 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"  This project will study four species of Rockcress plants (Brassicaceae family, Boechera genus). These plants are native to California. Two of these species live in deserts and two are found either on the coast or in the mountains. These plants differ in their ability to survive and grow when exposed to high temperatures. Plants cannot move away or avoid high temperature stress and therefore, the ability to survive high temperature stress is a very important trait for plants. While heat stress has been studied in some crop species very little is known of the differences in tolerance to stress among wild plant species. This project will address this important but yet under studied question. In order to obtain a full understanding of how Rockcress plants respond to high temperature stress studies will be conducted that will examine rates of photosynthesis, and overall plant growth. In addition, the gene expression patterns of both the heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive plants will be examined both before and after stress. By examining the patterns of gene expression among species that respond differently to stress the researchers will identify novel genes and proteins that provide tolerance to heat stress. In addition to deepening our understanding of how wild plants adapt to stress this research will also provide information that will assist in understanding how crop species may acquire tolerance to heat stress. During this project a wide range of students (both undergraduate and graduate) will be trained in modern scientific methods. Preference will be given to students that are the first in their families to attain a university degree and/or are members of groups that are under-represented in science. In addition, a post-doctoral fellow will be trained during this project and will be provided with mentoring to facilitate his or her independent research career.",
