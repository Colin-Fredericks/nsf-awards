 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, \"NUE: Introducing Nanotechnology into the Thermal and Fluids Curricula: A Multi-Department, Modular Laboratory\", at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) under the direction of Dr. Diana A. Borca-Tasciuc, has as its goal to expose undergraduate students to nanoscale science and technology aspects relevant to thermal and fluids engineering via a formal class environment using an experiential-learning approach.  Four experimental laboratory modules will be developed to be included in two existing courses within the Mechanical, Aerospace and Nuclear Engineering Department and the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department.  These modules will be focused on visual demonstrations and hands-on activities focused around the study of heat transfer, fluid flow, and capillary properties of nanofluids. By introducing the experimental study of nanofluids into the undergraduate curriculum both missions of promoting teaching and learning while advancing discovery and understanding are accomplished.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will affect approximately 250 undergraduate students annually, which represents 100% of the undergraduate student population in Chemical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.  Furthermore, since two of the proposed experiments employ direct visualization of the phenomena under study, they may also be used as a simple yet powerful demonstration of nanotechnology to a high school audience during \"Design you future day\" a workshop organized annually at RPI to encourage women to pursue engineering careers.",
