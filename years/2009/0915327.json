 "awd_abstract_narration": "Machine Translation (MT) into morphologically-rich languages poses unique\r\nchallenges that have so far not been adequately addressed in state-of-the-art\r\napproaches.  Even the best available MT systems into languages such as Arabic\r\nfrequently produce translations that are disfluent and lack proper grammatical\r\nstructure.  This project explores novel approaches that address these issues by\r\nthe development of a statistical MT framework that incorporates deeper levels\r\nof modeling of syntax and morphology.  While the methods explored are largely\r\nlanguage independent, the research is conducted and experimentally evaluated\r\nwithin the context of a large-scale English-to-Arabic MT system constructed\r\nusing vast corpora available from LDC.\r\n\r\nThe research in this project focuses on novel approaches for combining\r\nsyntactic and non-syntactic translation resources that are automatically\r\nacquired from vast amounts of parallel data and on exploring several\r\nalternative pathways for the integration of information provided by a\r\nhigh-accuracy morphological analysis and generation engine for Arabic into the\r\nMT framework. The project also explores methods for improving the syntax of MT\r\noutput in Arabic using syntactic transfer rules that model syntactic\r\ndivergences between English and Arabic. The goal is to develop an\r\nEnglish-to-Arabic MT system that produces significantly more fluent,\r\ngrammatical and accurate Arabic output than the current best systems, as\r\nmeasured by MT evaluation metrics (such as BLEU and METEOR), and as judged by\r\nhuman evaluators.\r\n\r\nThe availability of high-accuracy fully-automatic Machine Translation from\r\nEnglish into Arabic has high potential value to the Arabic-speaking population\r\nat large, by opening up access to all English content available over the web.\r\nSuch high-quality MT into Arabic may potentially also improve access to\r\nmarkets in the Arabic-speaking world for US and international companies.\r\n",
