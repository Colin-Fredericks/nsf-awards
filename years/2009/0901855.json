 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: the objective of this effort is to study and demonstrate adiabatic bandgap shift in type-II quantum wells, and use this process to cool a heat load to below 10 degrees Kelvin.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed research provides an excellent testbed to study many important adiabatic and diabatic quantum processes such as Quantum Refrigeration, Quantum Heat Pumps, and Quantum Amplifiers. It also helps advancing research in\r\nmany related devices, such as quantum sensors and computers. Using type-II quantum wells, this research advances the deep physics involved in Type-II heterojunctions, including their non-linear electrooptic effects, carrier lifetime, and built-in electric field.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Small, non-mechanical cryogenic coolers resulted from this program can revolutionize the way we live, since they lead to practical access to our most sensitive optical sensor (superconductor single photon detector), magnetic sensors (SQUID), the most accurate voltage standard (Josephson Junction) and time standards (Superconductor Oscillators) to name a few. Simulation tools that will be developed in this research effort will become publicly available and shared with the scientific community through World Wide Web. Also, some of the results of this research will be incorporated in a solid-state course and an advanced course on modulators. Undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented and minority groups will be encouraged to take part in this research through Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professorate program at Northwestern University. We will also collaborate with a major company to validate the results, solicit feedback, and produce a commercialization path.",
