Led by faculty in computer science, computer information systems, management information systems and mathematics, this project will create a cultural shift among faculty in multiple areas of study. Faculty from these varied departments are serving on the advisory committee for this planning project and have agreed to pilot threads that introduce computational thinking into their courses: physics, biology, education, graphic design, petroleum engineering and theater. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activities \r\nAt a small liberal arts institution, the dependence of each discipline on another is perhaps more pronounced than at larger institutions. Rather than creating discipline-specific computer curricula, professors in most other disciplines rely on the computer science department to offer courses that provide a strong base for computational learning. The expectation is that as students develop mastery within their disciplines, they will be able to integrate this knowledge with their computational skills, which will strengthen their ability to manage information, and enable them to transition to increasingly higher levels of discovery and comprehension. The intellectual merit of this CPATH project stems from its focus on revising basic computer courses to emphasize computational thinking, and integrating computational thinking as a method that informs learning across many disciplines. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the Proposed Activities \r\nThe broader impact of this CPATH planning project is evident in three elements: campus-wide involvement, community outreach, and piloting threads of computational thinking (CT) in non-computer courses. Faculty and staff from any discipline are invited to explore the concept of computational thinking by participating in workshops, attending presentations and/or serving on a CT project advisory committee. Through creative road shows and summer learning opportunities, middle and high school students are being introduced to CT. An introduction to CT is being added to in-service math teachers? workshops at the college. Faculty in at least two and perhaps as many as six other disciplines are piloting efforts to introduce CT within their courses.  The anticipated project outcomes include broadening fluency with computational thinking among faculty at Marietta College and among math teachers in the K-12 educational community; revision of two key computer courses to create a stronger alignment with computational thinking for first year computer students; and increasing excitement about and awareness of the myriad uses for computational thinking among K-12 youth. The project?s evaluation process will measure the effectiveness of the various elements of this project and inform the development of a full implementation proposal in the spring of 2011.\r\n",

What is the outcome or accomplishment? \n \nMarietta College explored effective means of introducing and/or revitalizing computational thinking across disciplines on its campus and among teachers and students in the surrounding K-12 educational community. Led by faculty in computer science, computer information systems, management information systems and mathematics, our project created a cultural shift among teachers and students in multiple areas of study. \n\n \n2.     What is the impact? \n\n\nPublic schools in our region have ceased teaching computer science concepts. Since students need to be inspired to become involved in computing at a young age, our work with Alice/Computational Thinking camps and work teaching Alice and Computational Thinking to 3rd-8th grade math teachers helped bring computing/problem-solving to their attention. In addition, faculty from biology, physics, education and communications have implemented computational thinking techniques in their classes.  Six Information Systems Colloquia promoting Computational Thinking were held during one year at Marietta College. These seminars were from a variety of problem domains: including, Geographic Information Systems, Biology, Artificial Intelligence and Financial Systems.\n \n \n3.     What explanation/background does the lay reader need to understand the significance of this outcome? \n \nNo special background is needed to understand the significance of this outcome. It is easy to see the excitement students have when exposed to Alice and Computational Thinking.  CPATH funding allowed our Alice/Computational Thinking camp and our work with Ohio 3rd-5th grade math teachers to become a reality. I remember working with one of our math teachers on base conversion. We went over the algorithmic process to convert from base 10 to base 2.  This teacher saw the benefit of learning about algorithms and showing students what happens behind the scenes when a calculator is not used.  Parents and students were excited about the Alice/Computational Thinking camp and the participation level was very high. We were also able to employ a local public education teacher and a future science teacher in our camp. In both cases the impact on these workers was positive and we believe will carry over into their future work with students. \n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Van Camp"
