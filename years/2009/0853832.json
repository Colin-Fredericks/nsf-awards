 "awd_abstract_narration": "0853832\r\nKumar\r\n\r\nAn infrared thermography system will be procured that features a (3 to 5 micron) infrared camera, a 50 mm lens, thermographic calibration from -10 C to 350 C, and a 4x microscope kit, capable of imaging 50 to 100 micron objects. The equipment includes simultaneous analog and digital video and synchronization capabilities, and a temperature sensitivity and spot size of 0.02 C and 10 microns, respectively. The system will be used to investigate transport phenomena in (a) fuel cells, (b) biofuel droplet evaporation, and (c) flow boiling. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The thermography system will be employed to spatially and temporally resolve temperature distributions within microchannels and minichannels, and on microdroplets. The equipment will be used in conjunction with existing velocity measurement instrumentation (micro PIV) and species measurement instrumentation (tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy and laser induced fluorescence). The resulting experimental data will serve to unravel the complicated physical mechanisms associated with these complex, two phase systems, and validate models that are being developed worldwide. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Courses, curriculum and workshops will be developed to educate students and professionals in the fields of IR thermography and laser diagnostics as applied to areas such as fuel cells, biofuels and cooling of electronic packages. Undergraduate students will be trained in the critical areas of experimental design and advanced measurement strategies, both in senior design projects and with research modules for an existing NSF REU program. New summer REU projects will incorporate the IR camera. Through the Honors Thesis program, undergraduate students will be exposed to laser diagnostics and IR thermography. These activities will pique interest in engineering among current and prospective students, including students from underrepresented groups.",
