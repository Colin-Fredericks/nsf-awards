 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scripps Institution of Oceanography proposes to support technical services on four research vessels, all operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  Ships to be supported include R/V Revelle, R/V Melville, R/V New Horizon and R/V Sproul.  As part of their basic operations they will provide one (Sproul, New Horizon) or two (Revelle, Melville) technicians on each seagoing research project to support basic services, including multibeam sonar operations, and they will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  They also propose to provide several elements of specialized support for investigators, with separate charges. Specialized support requested for 2009 includes 1) reference quality hydrographic support, 2) seismic reflection profiling and related mitigation of impacts on marine mammals, 3)  management of the service contract and maintenance for HiSeasNet (Internet connectivity at sea from research vessels) for UNOLS vessels using C-band or Ku-band service for 7x24 access to satellite-based ship-shore, and 4) support of CTD operations on USCG Healy.  The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.",

An extra level of data quality analysis is provided to the scientists under Specialized Support Activities.\n \n A brief description of the four research ships operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography follows. Research Vessel (R/V) Robert Gordon Sproul,built in 1981, is 125 feet in length and has a beam of 32 feet. The ship carries a crew of 5 and has berthing for a maximum of 12 scientists. It can operate for up to 14 days straight. R/V Sproul generally operates within a few hundred nautical miles of home port.

Figure X shows the track lines of the research cruises conducted on the four SIO ships in 2011. As stated above, the areas of operation for the ships are similar in the other two years of this grant (2009 and 2010).\n \n Besides funding for salary and travel expenses for technical staff to participate on research cruises, this grant funded the maintenance and repair of commonly used oceanographic instrumentation . This set of instruments collects data and samples that span the four general disciplines of oceanography: biological, chemical, geological and physical. The instruments are loaded on a ship at the request of the scientists sailing on a specific cruise. This may be moving with a fork lift from the staging area to the dock along side the ship in home port, to securely packaging and shipping half way around the world to load on one of the larger ships in a foreign port. As soon as the instrument is no longer needed on a particular ship then it is returned to the home port for check out, maintenance and preparation for its next use. Although use on SIO ships takes priority, the instruments are also available, on a not-to-interfere basis, for use on other US academic research vessels. \n\n Capable and reliable oceanographic technical support is vital to the health of the U.S. oceanographic research community.  The U.S. academic research fleet has played a critical role in the exploration of our planet,..."
