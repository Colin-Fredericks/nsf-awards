 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis award supports research and education in theoretical condensed matter physics in magneto-acoustic and quantum transport in helium three. The theoretical investigations describe and explain newly discovered and newly predicted quantum condensed phases of matter. The research responds to recent experimental results establishing the existence of new superfluid phases of 3He in confined geometries and the existence of new collective modes of superfluid 3He exhibiting unusual magneto-acoustic properties, including acoustic birefringence of transverse sound. Transverse magneto-optical phenomena have been recently observed in electronic superconductors. The theoretical efforts address predicting and characterizing the magneto-optical and magneto-acoustic properties of quantum condensed phases of 3He. Another vein of research develops theory to predict new phases of 3He with properties characteristic of both solid and superfluid states of matter, i.e. ''crystalline order in superfluid 3He''. In particular, the PI will carry out theoretical research based on transport theory for quantum fluids that will examine the physical properties and experimental signatures of this predicted phase of 3He. A third effort employs theoretical models and quantum statistical methods for analyzing the interplay between ordering associated with symmetry breaking phase transitions, and extrinsic disorder that is present in virtually all macroscopic forms of matter. These theoretical developments connect with the experimental systems of liquid 3He impregnated into low-density silica glass, also called aerogel. This system permits theory to compare to a controllable and tunable medium to study effects of quenched random disorder in strongly correlated Fermi liquids.\r\n\r\nThe research has a strong education component involving the training of graduate students and a continuation of the PI's long history of recruiting undergraduates in cutting edge research projects with publishable outcomes.  The research connects with substantial international collaborations in Germany and France focused on the research topic, thereby strengthening and enriching the US physical community.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis award supports research and education in theoretical studies of a unique fluid, helium three, which exhibits magnetic and flow properties governed by the laws of quantum physics. Just as common materials exhibit different phases such as the liquid, gas and solid phases, so do quantum fluids, but the laws of quantum physics allow a wealth of complexities not normally encountered in everyday materials. The theoretical investigations of this research describe and explain newly discovered and newly predicted quantum phases of the fluid. The research responds to recent experimental results establishing the existence of new quantum phases of helium three which occur if the fluid is confined in small  regions of space, such as cavities, droplets or films. In these confined geometries the existence of new physical behavior is exhibited as remarkable magnetic properties that appear when sound travels through the droplet or the film of liquid. Such behaviors reflect the quantum laws of nature operating in the liquid. These phenomena allow for a deeper understanding of similar phenomena in the technologically important superconductors, which can carry electricity with no energy loss. The theoretical efforts extend to other geometries that are important for investigating a wide range of quantum behavior, and in expanding basic scientific understanding beyond helium three to superconducting wires, and to practical quantum electronic and magnetic devices that will be part of the next revolution in ultra-miniaturization and quantum computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research has a strong education component involving the training of graduate students and a continuation of the PI's long history of recruiting undergraduates in cutting edge research projects with publishable outcomes.  The research connects with substantial international collaborations in Germany and France focused on the research topic, thereby strengthening and enriching the US physical community.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project covers theoretical research aimed at understanding and predicting the thermal, magnetic and transport properties of recently discovered condensed phases of the light isotope of Helium with atomic number 3, denoted 3He, particularly the role of disorder on the transport and thermodynamic properties of liquid 3He. This project involved the research of two PhD students, two undergraduate students, the PI and collaborators in the US, UK and Japan. In order to pursue their research students receive training in analytical and computational methods which can be used in a broad range of endeavors in science and engineering.\n\n3He is unique in nature in that the condensed phases do not solidify down to the absolute zero of temperature, and are the purest form of matter in nature. The discovery that Helium could be infused into a highly porous form of glass known as silica aerogel opened new opportunities for detailed studies of the role of disorder on otherwise highly ordered states of condensed matter. Silica aerogels are grown in the laboratory by a process of diffusion and bonding of SiO2 clusters. We model this process by the process by random walk of SiO2 clusters with rules for bonding of the clusters into macroscopic structures. These ``numerically grown\u00c6\u00c6 models (Fig. 1) provide detailed information on the spatial structure of aerogels.\n\nResult: Aerogels provide a realization of a random fractal in which the atoms are randomly distributed, but statistically correlated in their relative positions. The number of SiO2 clusters at radius r scales as Nc(r) = N0 rD , where D ? 1.7 is the fractal dimension. At large scales scaling fails. We find a hierarchy of length scales from the strand size, d ? 3 nm, to the aerogel correlation length, &xi;a ? 30 nm, and a longer mean free path (mfp) for ballistic transport, l ? 300 nm.\n\nResult: Transport of thermal energy by 3He is governed by a kinetic equation with (i) binary collisions of excitations and (ii) scattering of excitations by the aerogel. We obtained exact solutions for thermal transport by 3He for temperatures above the superfluid transition, Tc ?10-3 K, with the conductivity predicted to obey a scaling law, &kappa;(T)/&kappa;el(T) = F(T/T*): T* is a cross-over temperature determined by pressure and mfp (Fig. 2) [New Journal of Physics 12 (2010) 083056.]. For a random fractal the mfp does not fully account for energy transport within the aerogel. The probability distribution for ballistic free paths is non-Gaussian, described by a L&eacute;vy distribution with a finite probability for very long ballistic paths (bottom left Fig. 3). The Gaussian random walk that leads to thermal diffusion is replaced by a L&eacute;vy walk (bottom right Fig. 3) with intermittent, long ballistic flights, and super-diffusive transport. Our result suggests that liquid 3He infused into high porosity aerogel provides model system for investigating rare events described by L&eacute;vy statistics.\n\nResult: The discovery of superfluidity of 3He infused into aerogel opened a new window into the interplay of disorder and order in condensed matter systems. We calculated the free energy for the B-phase of 3He as a function of the dimensionless disorder parameter, &alpha; = l/ &xi;0 , where &xi;0  is the pressure dependent correlation length of pure 3He [J. Low Temp. Phys. (2011) 162: 233&ndash;242]. Results for the heat-capacity as a function of temperature and pressure (p) are compared in Fig. 4 with experimental data for 98% porous aerogel [H. Choi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 145301 (2004)]. The theory accounts for the jump at Tc and the temperature dependence down to &asymp; 0.5 Tc.  The analysis shows that disorder has a profound effect on the excitation spectrum - the B-phase, which has a fully gapped excitation spectrum in pure 3He, is gapless at all pressures with approximately half the density of states of normal 3He available for thermal excitation in the T ? 0 limit in Fig. 4: C/T ? 0.5 ..."
