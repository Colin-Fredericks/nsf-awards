 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses satellite observations to analyze the impact of changes in surface characteristics (e.g., land use, snow cover trends and urbanization) on surface temperature variations.   Typically global temperature is assessed with in situ 2-meter air temperature measurements from weather stations, which are usually located in populated regions where human activity causes disturbances such that the temperature record may not be representative of the global land surface.  The use of satellite observations can provide an independent global estimate of the surface temperature change over the last 25 years or so.  This project focuses on infrared-based skin temperature estimates from  polar-orbiting satellite instruments and includes cross-validation and calibration of the satellite retrieval estimates.  The PIs have done much work previously developing methods to translate skin temperature to near-surface air temperature and have applied this in a global mean sense.  This project extends the developed methodology to the scientific problem of trend detection and attribution on regional and smaller scales.  A key feature of this project is the effort to connect observed land use changes to observable temperature trends.  An examination of uncertainties is also part of the plan.  This activity will support a graduate student at Georgia Tech and employ an undergraduate at U. Maryland on an hourly basis to perform data processing.  There are strong implications for climate change assessment and attribution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGoal of the project: make encouraging process on understanding land surface-atmosphere interactions.\n\nThe most important new scientific findings are:\n\na) Urban canyon (e.g., tall buildings) induces urban cooling effect instead of urban heat island effect.  This is evident on DOE Oklahoma observations.  Nevertheless, land surface models currently lack capability to simulation this specific process.  New research reveals that this is mainly due to the size of urban region much less than the real world.  WRF urban canopy model uses 1992 USDA land cover data, while in 2010, urban area in Oklahoma is about 10 times larger than the size in 1992.  Consequently, surface albedo in model is less affected and UCI is not evident in WRF simulation.  This finding helps to improve WRF urban simulation.\n\nb) Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range (SNMR) generates up to 70% of usable fresh water in California.  With the winter and spring temperatures increased in the western North America during the twentieth century, the change of the availability of snowpack in the SNMR severely affects California Water resources management.  TRMM rainfall, MODIS snow cover, and ground snow observations are combined to understand the mechanisms responsible for snow cover variations during 2000-2012.  In particular, three mechanisms are identified: large-scale dynamics, land-atmosphere interactions, and local meteorological disturbance including urban heat island effect (UHI) induced disturbance.  Furthermore, simulating such mechanisms is essential for water management.  Nevertheless, both regional climate model (WRF) and global climate model (NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM), Community Land Model (CLM)), currently show severe deficiencies in simulating snowfall as well as snow cover SNMR.  Applying TRMM and GPM observations to improve snow modeling is an important task.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/12/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Menglin Jin"
