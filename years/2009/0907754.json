 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the travel of US participants in an international workshop on Advanced Smart Materials and Smart Structures Technology to be held in Boston.  The workshop will identify the high priority emerging research issues in the area of smart materials and smart structures technology for application to structural health monitoring.  It will also identify the collaborative research topics and mechanism that can be pursued by researchers to leverage the resources of different international research centers in the Asia-Pacific region. One of the workshop foci will be on utilization of emerging bio-inspired intelligent systems in sensing actuation, networking and decision making involved in structural health monitoring.  The program includes a strong participation by young researchers and graduate students.  The workshop will facilitate the exchange of ideas, research data, facilities, and resources with international researchers from the Asia-Pacific region to address the pressing research issues of common interest in structural health monitoring.\r\n",
