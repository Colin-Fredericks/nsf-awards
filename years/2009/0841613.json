 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nMimicry, the adaptive resemblance of one organism to another, is one of the most compelling examples of evolution by natural selection. Although most examples of mimicry concern defense strategies of animals, floral mimicry also occurs. Dracula orchids (about 150 species) appear to be a remarkable but poorly known example of mimicry in plants: their flowers look and smell like mushrooms. However, the key component of mimicry in Dracula orchids, that the similarity to mushrooms actually benefits the plants, has never been tested. This project is designed to understand the ecology and evolution of mushroom mimicry in Dracula orchids through pollination experiments, chemical analysis of orchid and mushroom fragrances, and testing for pollinator specificity using field experiments and genetic analysis in natural populations of the orchids in Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to mimicry theory in general and specifically its extension to non-animal systems. Furthermore, it will enhance the current, and sometimes contentious, discussions in pollination ecology about specific versus generalist pollinators and the ecological forces and genetic mechanisms responsible for their evolution. This project also has broad implications for the power of natural selection in shaping the biology of organisms at local scales and the evolutionary forces resulting from interactions among species that create and maintain biological diversity.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this project will include advanced training for students and a postdoctoral fellow, and international collaborations with Swiss scientists and two Ecuadorian women scientists. Responsible, sustainable ecotourism will be promoted by providing the kind of natural history story that draws inquisitive visitors and by working closely with Fundaci\u00f3n Los Cedros, a private organization that protects 17,000 acres of primary rainforest in a biodiversity hotspot. Beyond its intrinsic value to conservation, remarkable biological narratives about fascinating organisms inspire new scientists and improve public engagement in science.",
