 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on developing computer aided design (CAD) tools for the design of state-of-the-art Silicon Carbide (SiC) Power Double-Diffused Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transistor (DMOSFET) and Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) based electric power-conversion systems for hybrid and all-electric commercial and military vehicles.\r\n\r\nThese tools will aid device manufacturers and power conversion system designers, to develop high power, energy-efficient, and light-weight, power converters using SiC power devices. These devices are capable of working at extremely high temperatures and power levels that are beyond the theoretical limits of currently used Silicon power semiconductors. Use of this technical know-how and tool set for designing novel power conversion systems for automobiles will play a direct role in reducing green-house gases in the atmosphere. This project will assist the design of energy efficient, ultra-low emission, and environmentally friendly automobiles.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).",
