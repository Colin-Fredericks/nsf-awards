 "awd_abstract_narration": "The STEM Colorado Streamline to Mastery project is a professional development program supporting ten Master Teaching Fellows who hold masters degrees and seek additional content-specific educational experiences. Streamline to Mastery teachers receive salary supplements for five years while they continue to teach full time and participate in courses such as Teaching and Learning Physics, Teaching and Learning Biology,and Physics and Everyday Thinking at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Streamline to Mastery teachers also participate in (and form) a community of teachers, university STEM and education faculty, mentor teachers, and novice teachers. This community meets regularly to discuss content-specific instructional issues ranging from how to teach a specific topic in physics to using mathematics and science to empower underrepresented youth. Streamline to Mastery Teachers also participate regularly in the nationally recognized Science Discovery program, which is an informal science education program in Boulder that serves teachers and students in the greater Denver area. It is anticipated that by participating in the program, these teachers will develop expertise as teacher leaders and in teaching various subject-specific content areas.",
