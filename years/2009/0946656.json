 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principle Investigator and his colleagues propose to organize the international conference Computational and Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering (CMMSE 2010) on May 26--28, 2010 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin.  This is the tenth in a series of conferences, with previous meetings held in Chicago, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Kastoria, Greece; Alicante (twice), Gijon, Madrid, and Murcia, Spain; and Uppsala, Sweden.\r\nCMMSE 2010 is organized on the principle that excellent applied mathematics of the Keynote Plenary Speakers and a core of  10-20 Special Sessions attracts participants from a wide variety of related specialties to share their ideas and results for the latest advances of computational and applied mathematics.  Presentations center around the  themes of the special sessions, and there will be poster sessions, opportunities for emerging researchers and a session on future directions led by experts in the various fields of research. \r\nExtensive efforts will be extended to attract significant participation from graduate students and emerging researchers, especially women and minorities.  Graduate students and young researchers will have opportunities to present their work and learn about open problems, thus enhancing their careers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the various successful annual conferences there remains a niche for unifying, cross-cutting, interdisciplinary gatherings, where specialists can have exposure to diverse fields, a chance to meet new people in or near their individual areas of research, and participate in special sessions different from, but still close to, their own interests.  The CMMSE conference series fulfills that important role in the field of computational mathematics. Computational mathematics, numerical analysis, and mathematical modeling have come to be regarded as an incredibly valuable part of the scientific process, complementing in an essential way theory and experiment.  Computational simulation truly enhances the study of  complex systems of  science and engineering to enable\r\nbreakthroughs for modern technology.   In seeking better and better results from simulations, the computational mathematician or\r\nscientist needs not only  capacity to carry out simulations, but also innovative ideas and foundational analysis for algorithms. \r\nThis conference represents a rapidly growing multidisciplinary approach in scientific research with connections to business, economics, the sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer science through academia as well as industry.",
