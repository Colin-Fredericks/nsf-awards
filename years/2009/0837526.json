 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to use the Professional Development Experiences at the university setting to improve the participation of 2-year undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds in their pursuit of both undergraduate and graduate degrees in chemistry. Many community college students who transfer to four-year institutions are not adequately prepared to fully integrate into the learning environment and benefit from a first research experience. The program represents a partnership amongst Texas A&M University-Commerce and two community colleges, Collin College and Northeast Texas Community College, representing urban/suburban and rural areas, respectively. The partnership will promote comparable training of students in organic chemistry with respect to using instrument-based chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. Texas A&M University-Commerce students will be peer mentors to the community college students throughout the project, including the Professional Development Experiences and follow-up activities, both via email and on-site visits.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance knowledge and understanding by exposing undergraduate students to hands-on research experiences in organic chemistry. Community college students will master techniques of chromatography and spectroscopy. Using peer-mentoring strategies and professional scientist presentations, this project represents a potentially transformative model of innovative educational strategies. Additionally, it will not only encourage undergraduate and underrepresented students from community colleges to promote discovery and learning in organic chemistry, but it will also benefit society by serving as a model for similar community college and university partnerships.\r\n",
