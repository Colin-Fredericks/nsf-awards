 "awd_abstract_narration": "0855863\r\nTsapatsis\r\n\r\nThe practical exploitation of biomass as a carbon-neutral source of chemicals and fuels is limited by the development of process and reaction engineering technology suited for the chemical transformation of hydrophilic, oxygen-functionalized and thermally unstable biomass feedstock. This research seeks to simultaneously harness the shape selective catalytic properties of zeolitic materials and selective separations for implementation in catalytic membrane reactors that will enable low temperature catalytic and separation processes for conversion of sugar monomers, specifically for dehydration of fructose to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). It is predicated upon preliminary data that show HMF can be selectively separated from fructose using zeolite membranes and seeks to extend previous work from the PI on the synthesis of high-selectivity, high-permeability membranes for hydrocarbon separations to integrated reaction-separation systems and to polyfunctional biomass-derived feedstock.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit The project brings together the complementary and diverse experience of the Tsapatsis (zeolitic membranes), Bhan (zeolite catalysis) and Daoutidis (process design and control) research groups to develop new reaction-separation process technologies using biomass as feedstock. Specifically, the co-PIs plan to:\r\n(i) Determine the kinetics, mechanism and site requirements for the dehydration of fructose using steady state and chemical/isotopic transient experimental studies to provide a rigorous description of reaction rates for process design,\r\n(ii) Investigate the potential of zeolite-membranes to separate fructose-derived oxygenfunctionalized molecules and quantitatively assess the effect of adsorption and transport phenomena on the rate and selectivity of HMF production, and\r\n(iii) Design and optimize an integrated reaction-separation system based on (i) and (ii) and also, compare and contrast this methodology at a process engineering level with other reactionadsorption and reaction-extraction biphasic systems proposed in the literature.\r\n\r\nThe research encompasses the interaction of transport and adsorption phenomena with kinetics in reaction systems for the design of integrated low-temperature reaction-separation systems adapted for the specific molecular structure of biomass feedstock and extends chemical reaction engineering approaches to process intensification to include biomass processing.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact Transforming traditional chemical processing and production is one of the challenges the global society faces to ensure a sustainable future.  Combination of catalyst development, new materials for separations and energy efficient reaction-purification process integration has the potential to contribute to this transformation.  In this respect, the research will have broader methodological impact and may stimulate the development of solutions for other problems related to biorefinery processes.  The co-PIs will incorporate elements of this work as case studies in an advanced undergraduate/graduate course that focuses on reaction engineering and separations and in teaching-modules that will be made available on the internet. Undergraduate students will be encouraged to work on aspects of the project and emphasis will be given in recruiting efforts to assure continued diversity within the co-PIs research groups.",
