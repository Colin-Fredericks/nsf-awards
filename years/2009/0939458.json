This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with 1800 anticipated attendees. The meeting has been successfully run for over sixty years. The intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics. The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. Since the awards are meant to supplement participant travel funds, not to cover these entirely, the committee takes into account the travel budget entered on the application. Special effort is made to achieve diverse participation from underrepresented groups in engineering, including women and members of minority groups. The application and selection process is under the auspices of the DFD External Affairs Committee, Prof. Michael Plesniak, Chair (The George Washington University). Typical awards will be $500-$1000. NSF support will fund students from the U.S.",
