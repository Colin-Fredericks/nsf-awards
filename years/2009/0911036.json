 "awd_abstract_narration": "The commercial success of data mining, and the great research interest\r\nthat this area attracts, prove that there is a need for analyzing and\r\nunderstanding data that goes well beyond classical database queries.\r\nUsers are often particularly interested in understanding the causal\r\nrelationship between data items and the reasons for observations.\r\n\r\nCurrent database systems cannot explicitly model the causal structure\r\nwithin data (although it is often implicit in the data), and thus offer\r\nno specific support for causal queries. In the absence of information\r\nabout causal relationships, users have to rely on techniques for mining\r\nfor statistically significant patterns in data. Causal relationships\r\nare often simply concluded from statistical dependencies. This can lead\r\nto inaccurate conclusions; correlation does not necessarily imply\r\ncausation.\r\n\r\nThis project creates the foundations for a new breed of databases\r\ncalled causal databases. Causal databases can model causal information,\r\nand allow for queries regarding causality and explanations, which are\r\nbeyond the scope of current databases. They can also take advantage of\r\ncausal information that is implicit, but unexploited, in some current\r\ndatabases, such as those for large engineering projects. In the\r\nproject, new database models and query languages for representing and\r\ntransforming causal information are developed, with particular focus on\r\nlarge engineering databases and scientific databases. In addition,\r\nefficient and scalable techniques for processing causality and\r\ncomputing explanations in large causal databases are developed. This\r\ninvolves both work on integrating causality processing into traditional\r\ndatabase query processing architectures and the development of special\r\ndatastream techniques for scaling up to the most data-intensive\r\napplications.\r\n \r\nFurther information on the project can be found at the project web\r\npage:  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/databases/causality/\r\n",
