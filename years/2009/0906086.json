Teichmuller space and the mapping class group\r\nare objects for special attention, and tools developed for that\r\nsetting are often promising for wider study in metric geometry\r\nand geometric group theory.  The PI proposes to build on recent\r\nwork on flat metrics, their length spectra, and the associated\r\nboundary theory, as well as work on synthetic curvature\r\nconditions and their applications to random walks.  Specific\r\navenues of future investigation include asymptotics on the space\r\nof singular flat surfaces; filling inequalities and higher\r\ndivergence functions adapted from symmetric spaces to group\r\ntheory; and the use of intersection patterns of metric\r\nhalf-spaces to study the dynamics of isometries.\r\n\r\nWhile quite abstract, ideas in this work can also prove\r\nbeautifully applicable-- for instance, Thurston's theory of flows\r\non surfaces has direct and strong applications to the study of\r\nmixing in fluid dynamics.  More immediately, though, this\r\nresearch area addresses foundational questions toward\r\nunderstanding geometric structure of complicated spaces in the\r\nlarge, in the small, and changing over time.",
