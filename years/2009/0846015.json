 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER (DBI): Computational Methods for High-Throughput Sequencing and\r\nPopulation Genomics Analysis\r\n\r\nThis is a CAREER award to support the research of Dr. Yun Song in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, and Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Song is a second-year, tenure-track Assistant Professor. High-throughput sequencing technology has entered a new era and obtaining whole genome sequence information will soon become routine. In one important area of research, the whole-genome description of DNA sequence variation will help us understand the biological mechanisms through which genetic polymorphisms affect phenotypes. In order to understand these mechanisms, the PI is developing tools to improved all aspects of data acquisition, error rate reduction and reduction of the cost of high throughput sequencing by increasing the throughput per run. The PI has used the innovative approach of working closely with the Solexa/Illumina high-throughput sequencing data and the source code for this project. This kind of research is important for setting a high standard for the commercial sector to meet in the future. Further, this project is developing reliable computational methods to annotate genomic variation, including structural variation, and applying them in a large-scale Drosophila resequencing project. Finally, scalable informatics tools for population genomics analysis is being developed. This work is enabling accurate inference of selection and demography on the whole-genome scale in multiple populations and is being applied in a novel approach to the study of human migration patterns. \r\n\r\nAs a part of his CAREER plan, Dr. Song is integrating research by developing a new undergraduate course in computational biology for students in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Furthermore, he is developing effective, open source software packages for the larger community. Finally, the PI is developing bioinformatics modules for courses for students in a minority-serving charter school in the Oakland area. Adam Roberts, a graduate student from Dr. Song?s research group, is teaching at the charter school full time in order to integrate these modules into the curriculum before beginning his own graduate research.\r\n\r\n",

To address this challenge of assembling highly repetitive regions, we developed a new assembly algorithm based on a statistical framework.  Results on real and simulated data demonstrate that our approach can effectively resolve the complex repeat structures found in the telomeres of yeast genomes.  \n\n\nNew methods for analyzing ribosome profiling data: Recent advances in sequencing technology have fundamentally transformed genomics research and many questions in molecular biology can now be studied using sequencing.  An important example is ribosome profiling, which is a recently developed technique that combines a clever experimental protocol with high-throughput sequencing technology to provide detailed positional information of ribosomes on mRNA transcripts that are being translated.   We developed a new way to use ribosome profiling data to study and quantify the translational process for any given gene.  Our method is based on a mechanistic model of translation, and, for each gene, it allows one to estimate initiation and position-specific elongation rates, as well as the protein production rate, from ribosome profiling data.  This work should facilitate the study of translation regulation.   Applications of ribosome profiling have shown that ribosomes are not uniformly distributed along the mRNA transcript.  Understanding how transcript-specific distribution arises is important for unraveling the translation mechanism.  We found that the mRNA sequence context is highly predictive of the shape of ribosome profiles.  Our inference method has several applications, including inferring isoform-specific ribosome footprints, designing transcripts with fast translation speeds, and understanding how the inferred fast and slow codons relate to the distinct stages of translation.   \n\nScalable inference tools for population genomic analyses: A promising class of methods for large-scale population genomic inference employs the conditional sampling distribution (CSD), which approximates the probability of sampling an individual with a particular DNA sequence, given that a collection of sequences from the population has already been observed.
