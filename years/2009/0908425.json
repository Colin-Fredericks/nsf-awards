 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project supported by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering, Dr. James R. Mihelcic of Michigan Technological University will involve an international investigation led by the PI, to be held at a site in La Paz, Bolivia, Coroico, in partnership with Dr. Nathan Reents of ACDI/VOCA Bolivia, a non-profit organization, and Dr. Santiago Morales, of the Bolivian Technological University.  The research focuses on sustainable development engineering education.  This experience will allow students to engage sustainability and appropriate technology principles in a way that is useful and meaningful, and to collaborate with students and community members in a developing country, fostering values of global community service while forging collaborative relationships of the future.\r\n\r\nThis project directly benefits society through the project's focus on community needs.  The goal of the project is to foster the development of engineering students who value service to local and global communities while creating innovative and appropriate ideas, technologies and services for people in need of safe water, sanitation, air quality and affordable technology. \r\n",
