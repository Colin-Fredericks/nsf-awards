 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF ECCS-0925882\r\n\r\nA large number of modern physical and biological structures and devices require tools and techniques to see below surfaces, non-destructively and with nanoscale resolution. With respect to \"non-destructive\" real-space imaging, there is a clear void between the two ranges of length-scales offered by confocal / photon or acoustic/sonography techniques (micrometer scale) and SPM (nano- and sub-nanometer scale).  This is particularly true if features of interest are buried deeper into the material, beyond the interaction range of proximal probes.  The project concerns development of a Scanning Near field ultrasound holography (SNFUH) with integrated electronic feedback and actuation system for imaging buried nanostrucures and pattern recognition.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the project addresses many unmet needs for sub-surface imaging tool-set. The project research comprises an innovative combination of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) approach, scanning probe microscopy (SPM), acoustic holography integrated with all-electronic feedback approach; to enable massively parallel metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) embedded microcantilever platform for rapid turn-key imaging tool-set. By combining the nanometer-scale spatial resolution of conventional SPMs with the elastic imaging capabilities of acoustic or ultrasonic microscopes, the electronic detection SNFUH project is expected to fill the critical need in characterizing and investigating the static and dynamic mechanics of nanoscale systems. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impact of the project promises to open new vistas in non-destructive high resolution microscopy for imaging buried nanostructures, defects, delaminations and sub-surface pattern recognition in semiconducting materials and devices. The education plan focuses on (1) development of a teaching module in nanomechanics of soft and structures which includes hand-on-laboratory demo and classroom tutorials; (2) Undergraduate and RET (research experience for teachers) individual project modules correlated with research goals. The educational objectives will be achieved by (a) providing hand-on, team experience to promote active and collaborative learning; (b) exposing promising students at the undergraduate level to research opportunities in emerging field of nanomechanics, and (iii) to recruit and retain traditionally under-represented students though MIN (Minority Internships in Nanotechnology) programs which provide opportunities for undergraduates to participate in hands-on research in the area of nanotechnology.   Collectively, the project will attempt to address the unmet technology requirements for imaging buried defects/structures in nationally critical important fields of emerging nano-electronics and nano-bio-electronics. The project is also expected to positively impact educational and training needs; by providing diverse educational and societal outreach initiatives for American students; with a particular focus on underrepresented groups.",
