 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Learning: Integrating Design, Engineering and Robotics (SLIDER) project is a collaborative effort involving the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing (CEISMC), the Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning (CETL), the School of Psychology, the School of Biomedical Engineering, and the College of Computing at Georgia Tech; the State of Georgia Department of Education; and three Georgia school systems: one urban, one rural, and one suburban. The project is developing and implementing a rigorous eighth grade physical science program that utilizes engineering design, LEGO robotics and mechanics, and a problem-based learning approach to teach mechanics, waves, and energy. The project seeks answers to these research questions: Can research-based physical science instructional materials that use problem-based inquiry learning in the context of engineering design scenarios empower a broad range of middle school learners to learn physical science content and reasoning skills? Can these educational materials lead to increased engagement, motivation, aptitudes, creativity, and interest in STEM fields; if so, does this effect persist as students move into high school?  Do students engage with the materials differently depending upon their gender, race, socioeconomic status, prior academic achievement level, or location (urban, suburban, or rural)? \r\n\r\nIn the process of answering these primary questions, additional questions being addressed include: How should the learning be assessed in the classroom and how does this assessment impact student performance? What instructional materials and professional development are necessary to prepare teachers to deliver this type of instruction effectively in their classrooms? Three geographically disparate schools with strong school leadership and an existing track record of robotics use are participating in the project. In each school, two teachers utilize LEGO kits and storage units to fully support instruction in their physical science classes. The SLIDER instructional materials consist of contextualized, problem-based challenges that require students to design, program, investigate, reflect, and revise their products or solutions.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: SLIDER contributes to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of using engineering design and robotics in K-12 education. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: SLIDER impacts K-12 physical science education by providing a research-based and thoroughly tested set of instructional materials for use by teachers. These materials are designed to attract more students, particularly those previously underrepresented in STEM, into technical fields and careers. The project also impacts the educational research workforce by training graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in the theory and methods of educational research and evaluation.\r\n",

Eighth-grade students developed understanding of energy, motion, and forces as they engineered a solution to an authentic traffic accident problem by designing 1) traffic rules for a dangerous intersection, and 2) an automatic braking system for a robotic truck. &nbsp;The most important goal was that the curriculum promote student learning of physical science disciplinary concepts and science practices.

This current work shows that finding the time to develop sufficient functional knowledge with these manipulatives among both students and teachers to enable them to create truly novel designs is very difficult, particularly at our mid-to-low socioeconomic status (SES) schools. The materials management issues inherent in having thousands of LEGO pieces in crowded classrooms are also formidable.
