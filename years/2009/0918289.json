 "awd_abstract_narration": "In eukaryotes, DNA in the nucleus is packaged into nucleosomes.  Each nucleosome consists of a short segment of DNA wrapped twice around eight proteins that are called histones. Packaging of DNA with histones is dynamic and has a profound influence on gene activity.  Tight packaging prevents DNA from being accessible to the machinery that is needed to transcribe the information contained in DNA to a usable form.  In contrast, loosely packaged DNA is accessible. Loosening DNA packaging is accomplished by changes in the conformation of the histone proteins, although exactly what conformations promote loose packaging is not clear.  Using biochemical and X-ray crystallographic approaches, this project will explore the histone conformations that are associated with loose DNA packaging.  Understanding the dynamic nature of conformational changes in nucleosomal histones will provide important new insights into regulation of gene activity.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts.  A major emphasis of this project is to provide educational opportunities to students at several levels.  Eighth grade students participating in the SMART program (Students Modeling a Research Topic) will be given the opportunity to build three-dimensional plaster models of proteins, using information obtained from publicly available protein databases. The students will then work for a day in the lab getting hands-on experience with the protein they modeled and later share what they have learned with the public and at teacher's conferences by giving oral and  poster presentations. High school students and their science teachers will take part in summer research projects in the lab, aided by undergraduate student researchers. This intermixing of students with varying educational backgrounds is beneficial for all.",
