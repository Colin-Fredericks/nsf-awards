 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs will convene a workshop to bring together experts and stake-holders in\r\nsynthetic aperture radar and GNSS systems, the data processing and the products they\r\ngenerate. The workshop will examine the wide range of different approaches that have\r\nbeen developed to understand and mitigate the atmospheric ?noise? in SAR signals, and\r\nestablish the current best-practices in atmospheric imaging and mitigation techniques,\r\ngenerate priorities for further investigations, and recommendations for upcoming\r\nmissions for how best to maximize the utility of the data products they will produce.\r\nIonospheric and tropospheric imaging using SAR and GNSS and stochastic and\r\ndeterministic modeling have great potential for correcting media effects on space\r\ngeodetic systems, however, although many of these approaches have shown promise in\r\nparticular circumstances, effectiveness and general applicability are yet to be\r\ndemonstrated. Small amplitude, non-linear and non-periodic ground motion signals\r\nabound in geodesy from a wide range of sources, and InSAR holds great promise for\r\ngiving us new insights into these types of physical phenomena. For a wide spectrum of\r\nthe signals we might hope to explore, however, the delays induced in the SAR signals by\r\nthe ionosphere and the troposphere overprint and confuse the interpretation of\r\ninterferograms.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is multi-disciplinary bringing together atmospheric\r\nand solid earth researchers, operational centers and technologists to find ways to\r\nunderstand and mitigate the effects of the atmosphere on new satellite SAR systems.\r\nCoupled with the compelling hazards research applications of SAR and GPS, this\r\nworkshop provides an excellent venue to engage students. Two students and one career\r\nresearcher will be recruited from a pool of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s from UNAVCO and UCAR?s\r\nRESESS and SOARS summer internship program. These two programs have operated in\r\npartnership for many years providing research opportunities for students from\r\nunderrepresented groups. In addition, a workshop report of the results and outcomes of\r\nthe workshop and statement of recommendations for upcoming SAR missions will be\r\ngenerated after the meeting and disseminated via the UNAVCO website.",
