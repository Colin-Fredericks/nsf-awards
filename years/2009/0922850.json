The HRSEM instrument with ultrahigh-resolution and optimized analytical functionality will provide much-needed improvement to the research infrastructure at the USF. This proposal, in different ways, affects many on-going research activities and the proposed equipment will provide the opportunity to conduct high-quality research and will also allow the development and creative partnership with industry.  Numerous new scientific investigations will be enabled with the new equipment. The proposed research projects cover a broad area of research related to synthesis and characterization of high-performance materials for manufacturing applications and a HRSEM will provide an opportunity to conduct high-quality research to understand the microstructural properties of the materials. Establishment of a HRSEM capability to support these activities will leverage current and future funded programs. \r\nThis project is expected to have significant impact on research, education, research training, and infrastructure building at the USF. This research will train students in emerging cross-disciplinary areas. The results of the research will be widely disseminated through inclusion in courses and modules developed by PIs, demonstrations and outreach to community colleges. Apart from providing hands-on experience and the obvious preparation for graduate studies, the proposed research will provide a unique opportunity for the students to be involved in interdisciplinary research - a must for future success. Results of the project will be disseminated by paper presentation in regional and national conferences, and published in journal.",
