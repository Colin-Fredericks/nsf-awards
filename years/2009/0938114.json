These numbers continue to grow and\r\nthe need for tools to understand the behavior of the system\r\nsoftware becomes paramount: without these tools it is impossible\r\nto effectively tune that software, and high degrees of efficiency\r\nis unattainable by applications. This project addresses the\r\nchallenge of understanding the behavior of complex system\r\nsoftware on very large-scale compute platforms, like the current\r\npetascale computers. In particular, this project is developing\r\nsoftware infrastructure to provide end-to-end analysis and\r\nvisualization of I/O system software. Specifically, the\r\nobjectives are to develop, improve, and deploy (1) end-to-end,\r\nscalable tracing integrated into the I/O system (MPI-IO, I/O\r\nforwarding, and file system); (2) information visualization tools\r\nfor inspecting traces and extracting knowledge; (3) testing\r\ncomponents that drive this system to generate example patterns,\r\nincluding a component to generate anomalies; and (4) tutorials\r\nand tools for helping other system software developers\r\nincorporate this analysis and visualization system into their\r\nproduction software. The software and techniques developed in\r\nthis project will be directly applicable to and useful in other\r\nsystem software libraries which perform complex interactions on\r\nlarge systems.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL:\r\nhttp://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/NSF/Jupiter\r\n",
