As an agent for change, QEM continues to develop effective strategies for broadening STEM participation, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent minorities from receiving a high quality education. This project supports internship opportunities for students at the National Science Foundation as a mechanism to: increase students understanding of science policy; develop the potential of future leaders and proponents for STEM participation, including students from low-income communities; and promote the continuation of STEM interests and studies through the doctoral level. Complimentary to the internship experience at NSF, students are required to engage in a science-oriented community K-12 outreach activity during the following academic year at their respective institutions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
