 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Academy for Educational Development (AED) examines the short and long term employment outcomes of ATE 2006- 2008 program graduates from four states who earn either a certificate or associates degree in biomanufacturing/biotechnology or process technology.  The three major goals of the study are: (1) to utilize Unemployment Insurance (UI) wage records and supplemental data to demonstrate the employment outcomes of graduates of ATE programs in two STEM fields and assess the quality, productivity, and effectiveness of the programs; (2) to develop partnerships and design survey instruments to demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining quality follow-up data on ATE graduates, particularly UI wage records, in both a multi-state region and single-state setting; and (3) to provide ATE Centers and projects with information for replication to obtain quality follow-up data on graduates for data-driven decision making, planning, and program improvement purposes.  A Guide to Getting ATE Program Employment Results Through Workforce System Partnerships written as a result of this project encourgaes broad replication by providing a roadmap and model to influence and inform current and future advanced technology programs in design, evaluation strategies, and strategic partnerships.",
