 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Arizona for the summers of 2009-2011. The site is focused on exposing undergraduates from predominantly non-PhD granting institutions to collaborative research environments in order to initiate or develop aspirations to pursue scientific careers. The site is coordinated by program director Katrina Miranda and assisted by co-PI Dominic McGrath, both of the Chemistry Department. The chemical sciences thrive on the sharing of ideas among researchers from various disciplines and sub-disciplines. The collaborative environment is an exciting atmosphere that will instill in students the enjoyment of research and an enthusiasm for chemistry. The site will recruit primarily women and underrepresented minority physical science students from institutions that offer limited research opportunities. These students will benefit from the variety of research and research-related activities and will be encouraged to pursue careers in chemistry. The core of the program will be independent research with a faculty mentor supplemented by a series of workshops that will help prepare the REU students to perform research, to initiate thought and discussion about ethical issues in science and the research environment, and to consider career opportunities in chemistry. A poster symposium for the REU students as well as other on-campus summer research programs will be held at the conclusion of the program. After the program, the REU students will be encouraged to present their research at regional or national conferences.",
