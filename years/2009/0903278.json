 "awd_abstract_narration": "From June 15-27, 2009, a summer school will take place at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Canada.  It will be followed by a conference from June 28 to July 3.  Both the conference and the summer school will focus on the topics of geometric representation theory and extended affine Lie algebras.  The summer school will be aimed at graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty working in the field of Lie algebras and will consist of six one-week courses spread over two weeks.  The conference will bring together mathematicians working in the above-mentioned fields and will feature approximately 20 lectures by experts in these areas.\r\n\r\nThe summer school will provide an excellent opportunity for young mathematicians to gain access to the active and flourishing fields of geometric representation theory and extended affine Lie algebras.  While these topics are currently very popular among research mathematicians, they are not often taught in typical graduate courses.  It is expected that the majority of students attending the summer school will stay for the conference to follow.  The conference will expose students to current research related to the subjects of the courses they attended in the preceding two weeks.  It will also bring together researchers in these fields and provide a forum for them to discuss their work.  This grant supports participation of U.S. based mathematicians in both the summer school and conference.  The majority of the funds will be used to support women, minority, and young scientists (including graduate students).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
