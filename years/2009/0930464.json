 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2009 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Photosynthesis, will be held June 28-July 3 at Bryant University in Rhode Island and will bring together a broad spectrum of scientists, both junior and senior, from a wide range of disciplines, who will discuss (1) understanding the major natural way of solar energy capture and conversion into chemical energy, and (2) utilizing this knowledge to contribute to developing natural and bioinspired systems for improved solar energy utilization mechanisms in society. The focus on the development of sustainable global energy solutions will be promoted by having world leading international researchers in alternative energy speak at the meeting. These include Prof. Dr. Klaus Lips (Helmholz institute, Germany) who is a leading international researcher in thin film photovoltaic science and Professor Fraser Armstrong (Oxford University, UK) who heads a very large and influential laboratory focused on hydrogen production and bio-based fuel cell technology. The conference offers a unique opportunity to forge new international collaborations between experts in Nature's solar energy converter and experts in sustainable alternative energy technologies. The conference will also emphasize participation of junior investigators. In addition to a large number of poster presentations by students and postdocs, 6 of the 24 invited speakers qualify as junior investigators. The 2009 photosynthesis GRC will be an exciting and important event for scientists from many different backgrounds, and will offer a unique opportunity for synergy between researchers in two critical research areas that offer so much promise in our search for global energy solutions.",
