 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to fabricate self-healing microfibers and investigate the impact of their shape and size on their self-healing performance. These microfibers will be embedded into construction material (e.g., asphalt in the proposed project) to form a self-healing composite. When this composite develops a crack, the microfibers will be ruptured to release healing agents that can automatically restore the integrity and toughness of the composite. Novel microfluidic devices will be developed to form and solidify microfibers with healing agents encapsulated in them. The proposed self-healing microfibers are expected to outperform existing spherical microcapsules even when used in lower concentrations. The research project will provide a fabrication platform with unique controllability and flexibility. Therefore, it will enable the researchers to investigate how the shape and size of the microfibers affect their self-healing performance by employing the proposed micromechanical modeling and experimental techniques. As a result, a guideline will be provided for the design and implementation of future self-healing systems.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this project will contribute to the nation?s goal of employing more durable construction material so as to provide safer and more sustainable transportation infrastructure systems. The proposed research holds the promise to benefit engineering structures ranging from microelectronic devices to spacecraft, bridges, and other large infrastructures. It can potentially contribute to the commercialization and broad applications of self-healing materials by improving performance and reducing costs. Research results will be widely disseminated through publications to inspire further investigation and stimulate future interdisciplinary collaboration on self-healing materials. Education and outreach activities, such as undergraduate enterprise and summer youth programs, are also planned for a diverse group of students, including minority and female students. \r\n",
