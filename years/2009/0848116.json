 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eric Goergen is awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to develop an integrated program of research and education at Brown University. The goal of this project is focused on exploring the kinetic driving forces and mechanistic interactions fundamental to the development of reaction-induced strain localization in rocks. This project aims to investigate simultaneous reaction and deformation processes through a series of deformation experiments carried out on rocks of lherzolite bulk composition. These experiments are designed to explore strain localization through three approaches: 1) investigating the known positive correlation between reaction rate and strain rate; 2) characterizing the time dependent evolution of microstructures associated with reaction-induced strain localization through a series of experiments carried out to increasing amounts of finite strain; and 3) investigating the effect of bulk composition on the progress of reaction and localization by varying modal amounts of phases present in starting materials. Experiments will be analyzed by focusing on the microstructural evolution through chemical and crystallographic analysis to develop models of the kinetic and mechanic history within and between experiments. In addition, the choice of the lherzolite chemical system and pressure-temperatures for these experiments will also provide fundamental rheologic data on the upper mantle in the context of evolving bulk composition and phase assemblages.\r\n\r\nThis project also aims to incorporate a strong educational component through the integration of undergraduate research. Dr. Goergen has developed two independent projects that are appropriate for the undergraduate level and will also contribute strongly to the research objectives stated above.  These projects will both further the intellectual development of young geoscientists by laying a strong foundation in sound research as well as, further the professional development of Dr. Goergen by gaining necessary experience in the integration research and teaching through the advising of undergraduate theses.",
