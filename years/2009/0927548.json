 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MSP-Start Partnership project, \"Power of Physical Sciences\" (POPS), is partnering the State University of New York at Geneseo and teachers and administrators from five neighboring rural school districts in Livingston County to investigating ways to encourage middle and high school girls to study physics and geological science. \r\n\r\nThe POPS program is focusing on a hands-on, middle school enrichment curriculum that emphasizes the role that physics and geology play in solving societal problems, specifically in addressing future energy needs in an environmentally responsible way.  They are conducting a pilot study to collect preliminary data to help address the question of whether or not a rigorous and engaging enrichment curriculum that emphasizes the societal benefits of the physical sciences can encourage more girls to study physics and geology.  Furthermore, pre-service teachers at SUNY Geneseo are involved with this project.  They are working closely with experienced science education faculty to develop some of these learning activities as part of an undergraduate \"research\" experience.  \r\n\r\nAn independent evaluator is working with the POPS team to design and implement an evaluation plan to monitor the success of the program.  The results of this investigation are being used to develop an MSP Targeted Partnership proposal.",
