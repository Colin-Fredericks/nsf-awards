 "awd_abstract_narration": "An ad hoc committee of the National Academies will conduct a study to summarize current geoengineering knowledge about underground development in the urban environment; identify pressing research needed to take advantage of opportunities for enhancing urban sustainability through underground development; and develop an enhanced public and technical community understanding of the role of geoengineering in the sustainability of the urban built environment, specifically through the minimization of consumption of nonrenewable energy resources, construction materials, and negative impact on the natural, built, and social environments.  Issues to be addressed include geologic site characterization, construction and geotechnical monitoring techniques, energy requirements and benefits, and lifecycle costs and benefits of sustainable underground infrastructure development.  The study will recommend directions for a new geoengineering research track focused on earth systems engineering and management to ensure future human resources for sustainable underground development.  Advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new research center in this area will be analyzed, and other potential options for enhancing the human resource capacity for sustainable underground development -including the status quo- will be considered.  The policy, economic, and human behavioral drivers that promote or inhibit the development of the subsurface in a sustainable manner will also be considered from a social science point of view.",
