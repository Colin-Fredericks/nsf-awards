 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a working prototype of a federated and community-enabled approach to data sharing, discovery, and enhancement. It will be implemented based on several new and evolving open source technologies that allow discovery across multiple search protocols and conventions and continually inform users of relevant changes in data availability and data and service enhancements. This work will help lower barriers to data publishing, annotation, and enhancement while maintaining the authority and heritage information provided by formal archives. The cutting edge technologies to be prototyped by this program for the polar sciences - data and service casts, OpenSearch services, and Wave-enabled metadata - should work synergistically to provide an overall solution that is greater than the sum of its parts. Interactive (Wave) technologies that can significantly increase responsiveness to user queries and decrease the barriers to provider participation in data set accession and distribution will be employed. In terms of broader impacts, this prototype has the potential to be transformative and not just evolutionary, changing the mindset of the data provider, data center, and user. The aggregation server, data and service casting, along with wave technologies represent new trends in collaborative technologies enabling both users and distributors of information to more easily share their work with less concern over loss of control of their data. Through connections to the Polar Information Commons, this project has the potential to globally distribute the concepts demonstrated and to inform ICSU's development of a World Data System.",
