 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) II project proposes to develop innovative compositionally tuned nanomaterials based oxide phosphor bright UV light emitting devices that have tunable optical UV light emission. This innovation is based on optical processes emerged in nanomaterials by absorption and emission through band gap engineered meta-stable but high quantum efficiency nanocrystalline, highly directed wires and nanocrystalline epitaxial films. This effort will demonstrate the optimization of nanostructural optical materials with high UV light emission efficiencies and proto-type device integrated with UV lamps. \r\n\r\nIf successful the outcome of this effort will facilitate applications including invisible UV ink for security applications, medical devices, biological analysis tools, ultraviolet-based secure communications, space sensors, mineral identification, UV curing, UV fluorescent inspection, UV disinfection/sterilization of water, and UV measurement which have market potentials over $500M by 2010. The next generation of UV light sources will enhance UV applications by, 1) Providing additional energy savings, and thus a lower cost of ownership, 2) Enhancing optical spectroscopy, and 3) Enhancing national security applications. \r\n",
