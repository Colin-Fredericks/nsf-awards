VMI is important to certain research\r\nareas such as distributed computing, automated system management and\r\nconfiguration, and computer security.\r\nVirtualization technologies have created new momentumfor a number of research areas\r\nsuch as distributed computing, automated system management and configuration, and\r\ncomputer security. One basic yet powerful instrumentation function in\r\nvirtualization-based research is virtual machine introspection (VMI): observing a VM?s\r\nsemantic states and events from outside the VM. VMI is hard to implement, mainly\r\nbecause of the semantic gap between the external and internal observations of the VM.\r\nThus a generic VMI software instrument becomes highly desirable to virtualization\r\nresearchers.\r\nThis project develops and deploys OpenVMI, an open-source, software-based research\r\ninstrument for VMI at Purdue University and North Carolina State University. OpenVMI\r\ncan be thought of as a ?fluoroscopic? instrument for VMs. Through the OpenVMI API, a\r\nuser will be able to obtain the VM?s semantic states and events in both kernel and user\r\nspaces without modifying or instrumenting the VM.\r\nThree research areas are identified at the PIs? institutions that will benefit from the\r\ndevelopment and deployment of OpenVMI:\r\n-Management of hosted virtual environments: This research involves monitoring,\r\nprovisioning and regulating autonomous virtual environments running in a shared\r\ndistributed hosting infrastructure. Open- VMI will enable non-intrusive, semantic\r\nmonitoring of VMs, which will trigger VM management operations at runtime such as\r\nVM migration, resource adaptation and access control.\r\n-Monitoring, detection and investigation of user-level malware: This research is\r\nconcerned with OSlevel policies and mechanisms for malware detection and\r\ninvestigation. By using OpenVMI, these policies and mechanisms can be moved out of\r\nthe target VM, achieving stronger tamper-resistance without losing VM observability.\r\n-Monitoring of OS integrity: This research addresses the integrity of the guest OS\r\nagainst kernel-level attacks. It also involves detailed profiling of kernel-level attacks for\r\nfuture detection and recovery. OpenVMI will provide a unique vintage point to observe\r\nruntime state changes of kernel objects, which will help reveal details of an OS integrity\r\nviolation.\r\nSix research projects in the above areas are designated for OpenVMI deployment.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0855141 PI Name:Xu, Dongyan\r\nPrinted from eJacket: 07/25/09 Page 1 of 1",
