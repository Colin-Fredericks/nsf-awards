 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the study of local rings of equicharacteristic p, the tight closure\r\nhas proved very useful. This closure also extends nicely to local rings\r\nof equicharacteristic zero. Unfortunately this closure does not\r\nnaturally extend to mixed characteristic rings. This project is designed\r\nto fill this void. In earlier work, the principal investigator defined\r\nseveral variants of an extended plus closure. As the name suggests,\r\nthese closures, which coincide with tight closure in equicharacteristic\r\np, are based upon the plus closure of an ideal, the set of elements\r\nwhich are in the extension of the ideal in some integral extension of\r\nthe original ring. In the earlier work, a number of properties of these\r\nclosures were demonstrated. Most notably, the principal investigator has\r\ndemonstrated that the colon-capturing property implies that ideals in\r\nregular rings are closed and also that the colon-capturing property does\r\nin fact hold in dimension three. Hence the Direct Summand Conjecture is\r\na theorem in dimension three. A key objective of the current project is\r\nto extend these results to dimension four and above. A completely\r\nsuccessful program would establish that one of these extended plus\r\nclosures - or a close relative - satisfies all of the requirements\r\nsuggested by Huneke for a mixed characteristic analog of tight closure.\r\nIt would also determine whether or not three particular rings of\r\ninterest are Cohen-Macaulay. The most compelling of the three is the\r\nabsolute integral closure of a complete mixed characteristic local\r\ndomain of dimension three. For equicharacteristic complete local domains\r\nand all complete local domains of dimension not equal to three, the\r\nanswer is already known.\r\n\r\nOne of the most fundamental subjects in algebra is the understanding of\r\nthe concepts of ideals and modules in local rings. For those local\r\nrings which contain a field, the notion of tight closure has evolved as\r\na way to give a unified presentation - and a simplified one - for many\r\nof the known properties of these objects. As a natural byproduct, it has\r\nled to the discovery of new properties. Understanding of local rings\r\nwhich do not contain a field has always lagged behind. The principal\r\ninvestigator has proposed several closely related and promising\r\ncandidates to play the role of tight closure in the alternate setting.\r\nThese candidates have already led to one significant new result. In this\r\nproject, the investigator will continue his efforts to determine which\r\nis the best candidate and to what extent the new closures fill the void.",
