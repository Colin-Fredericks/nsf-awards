Since successful operation of any MCVD often rests upon efficient communication among the vehicles, the dynamic mission planning problem (including search and classify and mapping capabilities) is studied utilizing a fleet of heterogeneous AUVs and ASVs. This challenging problem, considering underwater acoustic communication, navigation, and sensing constraints, differs from those usually studied and reported in the underwater literature. The work is contrasted to unmanned aerial or ground vehicles in which communication and navigation capabilities are generally NOT considered significant bottlenecks. The project capitalizes on two previous NSF achievements:\r\n-\tAn underwater vehicle network simulatorsand\r\n-\tA location aware source routing (LASR) protocol developed for multiple communicating AUVs subject\r\n to realistic underwater communication constraints.\r\nNonlinear and stochastic variations with the environmental conditions and sensor characteristics are expected. Because a closed form solution for an optimal controller design is not anticipated, given that control performance tends to be cost-prohibitive, when completely via experimentation. Hence, given the wide range of mission and environmental scenarios and controller objectives, the problem will be studied combining modeling, simulation, and experimentation. Some of the simulated results will be validated by carrying out targeted at-sea field experiments using the instrumentation. Local cost definitions will be explored as a means to constrain individual vehicle?s maneuvering and cooperation. Attention is paid to maximizing the overall mission efficiency while minimizing the impact of uncertainty. Expectations include development of:\r\n-\tAn advanced event-base planning and control algorithms to improve robustness of communication and \r\nnavigation uncertainty, throughput, and bandwidth efficiency,\r\n-\tAn advanced multiple cooperating vehicle modeling software to support mission performance analysis, and \r\n-\tA science base for multiple AUVs and undersea acoustic networks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe research problems constitute ideal topics for theses and dissertations. This multidisciplinary field will be integrated into the existing course curriculum, providing valuable theoretical and simulation knowledge to the students, as well as hands-on experiences. Using underwater robotics as a primary domain application, the existing effort, sustaining the teachers and students with interest in math and science, will be continued giving special consideration to female and underrepresented groups. Workshops, competitions, and summer classes are also planned to expose students the logistics of marine vehicles. The understanding gain is likely to provide insights to the U.S. Navy for missions using a fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles to better search and classify in homeland security missions.",
