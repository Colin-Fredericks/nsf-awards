A microfluidic chip with featured microelectrodes will be designed and developed to carry out this study. The microchip will use dielectrophresis to capture cells onto the microelectrodes. The captured cells will subsequently be studied in a wide frequency range using electrical impedance spectroscopy, and their electrical properties will be analyzed using proper equivalent circuit models. This research will provide a direct (without biomarkers) approach to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. It has potential applications in early diagnosis of cancer and monitoring of cancer metastasis and the progress of cancer treatment. Education will include the incorporation of research into course development and the training of minority undergraduate students at NCCU in interdisciplinary research.",
