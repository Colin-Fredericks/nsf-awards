 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61). Despite its importance in the biological sciences, evolutionary theory is not widely understood or accepted in the general public, and there is tremendous variation in coverage of evolution and related topics in pre-college and college-level science education. Consequently, many undergraduate students enter and may leave introductory level biology with a poor knowledge foundation about evolution. In response to calls for more active, student-focused science education in general, and more effective teaching of evolution in particular, this project is developing a curriculum comprised of a series of active learning modules that can be used in an introductory-level biology course for majors and non-majors, one that is aimed at increasing student understanding and appreciation of evolution as a fundamental principle of modern biology. Because surveys also report a positive correlation between understanding of the principles of genetics and inheritance and the acceptance and understanding of evolutionary principles, the modules emphasize the link between phylogeny and genetic data. By emphasizing a phylogenetic perspective called tree thinking, the strength of genetic data that reveal the unbroken chain of inherited information among different lineages can be built upon to explain other evolutionary and biological phenomena. The modules include group problem sets, case studies, peer learning, and inquiry-based exercises that can be used in a lecture or laboratory setting. Because the modules depend upon awareness of and expertise with tree-thinking, active learning techniques and current educational technology, the project also includes an interactive pedagogy workshop for graduate students teaching in these courses. The pedagogy forum provides experience and exposure to current research in science education and is designed to complement the research skills the graduate students are developing. The modules are impacting over 375 undergraduate students at the University of Oklahoma each year; approximately 10 graduate students per year participate in the program and receive training in science pedagogy to foster development of this critical aspect of their professional development. The effect of the modules on student learning is being assessed through multiple-choice pre- and post-module assessments, concept maps, and open ended surveys. Results of the project are being shared with other units at the University of Oklahoma whose mission includes science education, presented at professional scientific conferences, and published in the science pedagogy literature.",
