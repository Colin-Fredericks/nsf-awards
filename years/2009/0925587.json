 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recoveryy and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to study chemically synthesized ZnO nanowires for potential application in high performance light emitting diode applications. The comprehensive research proposal combines expertise in material synthesis, advanced optical characterization of semiconductor materials, and device design and fabrication capabilities to develop fundamental understanding of the light emission mechanisms in ZnO nanostructures, which will be applied to the realization of light emitting diodes with high luminous efficacy and luminous flux.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal stems from its strong interdisciplinary nature. The research activities will encompass (1) a cost-effective chemical synthesis approach to ZnO nanostructures with great control on the doping properties, targeted towards the realization of single nanowire p-n junction devices, (2) a detailed study of the dynamics and light emitting characteristics of the carriers in these doped ZnO nanostructures using spectroscopic and time-resolved optical techniques, and (3) the application of the knowledge developed in the carrier dynamics and synthesis techniques to design and fabricate LED structures. A successful completion of this research program will develop substantial new knowledge in the light emission mechanisms in ZnO nanostructures, with transformative impact on display and solid-state lighting applications.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this program have technical and educational aspect. Thorough understanding of luminescent properties of nanostructured semiconductors like ZnO will open up new possibilities for photonic devices based on impurity-assisted carrier dynamics. Creation of undergraduate course module that combines the chemical synthesis and photonic device will be a unique attempt at Duke University.",
