 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nA neural progenitor cell encounters numerous cues during its development, but acquires a distinct fate from hundreds of possible fates. The PI is interested in understanding how neural progenitor cells choose the cues to respond to during their development. For example, his previous work demonstrated that a cell's decision to become brain or spinal cord was controlled by Caudal/Cdx genes.  This project examines the role the Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) signaling in regulating Caudal/Cdx activity during the cell?s decision. He will address this issue by altering Caudal/Cdx and FGF gene expression at different times and places during zebra fish development. He expects to uncover the conditions where FGF signaling promotes proliferation and differentiation of brain and spinal cord progenitor cells and where these processes are prevented from occurring. These studies should provide new insights into the mechanisms governing the ability of cells to respond to environmental factors during the development and adult life of an organism. In particular, this research should have broad intellectual implications in the fields of immunology, neurobiology, developmental and cancer biology. This research program is also designed to foster inquiry-based research and communication skills and advance knowledge among graduate and undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented minorities.",
