 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to enable operation of synthetic and\r\ncyborg insects in complicated environments, such as outdoors or in a\r\ncollapsed building.  As the mobile platforms and environment have\r\nsignificant uncertainty, learning and adaptation capabilities are\r\ncritical.  The approach consists of three main thrusts to enable the\r\ndesired learning and adaptation: (i) Development of algorithms to\r\nefficiently learn optimal control policies and dynamics models through\r\nsharing the learning and adaptation between various instantiations of\r\nplatforms and environments.  (ii) Creation of control learning\r\nalgorithms which can be run on low-cost, low-power mobile platforms.\r\n(iii) Development of algorithms for online improvement of policy\r\nperformance in a minimal number of real-world trials.\r\n \r\nThe proposed research will advance learning and adaptation\r\ncapabilities of practical cyberphysical systems.  The proposed\r\napproach will be generally applicable and lead to a new class of\r\nlearning and adapting systems that are able to leverage shared\r\nproperties between multiple tasks to significantly speed up\r\nlearning and adaptation.\r\n \r\nSuccess in this research project will bring society closer to solving\r\nthe grand challenge of teams of mobile, disposable, search and rescue\r\nrobots which can robustly locomote through uncertain and novel\r\nenvironments, finding survivors in disaster situations, while removing\r\nrisk from rescuers.  This project will provide interdisciplinary\r\ntraining through research and classwork for undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents in creating systems which intimately couple the cyber and\r\nphysical aspects in robotic and living mobile platforms.  Through the\r\nSUPERB summer program, under-represented students in engineering will\r\nexperience research in learning and robotics.\r\n",
