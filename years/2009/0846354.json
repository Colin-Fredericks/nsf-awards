 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award to the Borror Laboratory of Bioacoustics at The Ohio State University and the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH) will fund the conversion of animal sound recordings in the latter institution's collection to digital format.  These recordings are currently housed on analog magnetic tape, which has a finite lifespan, and degrades in quality with each use.  Conversion to digital format will ensure the preservation of this important collection, and make it much easier for FLMNH staff to serve clients in the future.  \r\n\r\nCollections of recorded animal sounds provide an important resource for scientists interested in the behavior and evolution of animals, for members of the public interested in natural history, and for various commercial enterprises.  The FLMNH collection of animal sounds is one of the three largest in North America, and is very strong in birds from the New World tropics, a center of avian biodiversity.  In digital format, users will be able to search the collection database and audition every recording in mp3 format.  The collection database will also be linked to ORNIS, an NSF-funded consortium of ornithological collections.  Finally, collections of bird sounds will be reissued in mp3 and CD format for use by birders and by biologists conducting population surveys.",

In many animals, insects, frogs and birds in particular, acoustic signals provide important cues to species status, and so recorded animal sounds can provide important taxonomic information. Many animals are also cryptic, and are most easily identified in the field during population censuses by their sounds.  With NSF funds we digitized the large collection of recorded sounds in the Florida Museum of Natural History Sound Archive (FLMNH) using the equipment and techniques developed in the Borror Laboratory of Bioacoustics at The Ohio State University (BLB).  The collection of recorded sounds in the FLMNH is one of the largest in the western hemisphere.  It is third largest in number of recordings and second largest in number of species and total duration of recordings.  Over 120 of the world\u00c6s 174 avian families are represented.  The collection is particularly strong in tropical birds of the Americas, with tinamous, trogons, woodpeckers, antbirds, flycatchers, wrens, wood warblers, and corvids being especially well represented.  Geographical strengths include North America, especially Florida, and the New World tropics, with smaller numbers of recordings from Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia.\n\n \n\nCollections of analog recordings, the FLMNH collection included, face a variety of threats.  Many of the recordings were on old, or unstable or non-archival tape stock used in the 1970\u00c6s and 1980\u00c6s, the years when the collection experienced great growth.  Saving these recordings before they became unusable was essential.
