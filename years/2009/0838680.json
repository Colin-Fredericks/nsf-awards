 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The UCLA Analysis Research and Training Groups (RTG) program consists of a variety of initiatives with the common aim of increasing the number of US citizens and permanent residents who study mathematics and then go on to careers in mathematics, including university teaching and research.  These initiatives include: recruitment and training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in the area of mathematical analysis, taken in its broadest meaning; better preparation of these students and postdocs for their future careers through a series of participating seminars, research workshops, and intensive summer school programs; increasing interest in mathematics among undergraduate students by creating new junior-senior level undergraduate seminar courses in analysis and involving undergraduate students in an annual Mathematics Summer Camp; and showcasing mathematics to school children and giving graduate and undergraduate students experience working with school children through the continued operation of the Los Angeles Math Circle.\r\n\r\nThe initiatives supported under the RTG grant will strengthen the department's research and training program in analysis as well as our training and outreach programs at all levels -- from middle school through postdoctoral scholars. The outcomes of these programs -- attracting, training, and supporting students to create a mathematically skilled workforce -- represent the national and state-wide effect of this grant.",
