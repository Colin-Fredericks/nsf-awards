The students will be active members of interdisciplinary groups and will interact with faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and industry.  Some of the students will also participate in an international research experience at the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), Mexico, which will build on an existing partnership with ISU, and provide students with valuable skills in a global environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the research experience, a variety of enrichment activities have been incorporated. These include: short courses, joint seminars/meetings, workshops, tours of research facilities, and field trips.  At the end of the program, the students will participate in a joint poster symposium together with students from other ISU undergraduate programs.  \r\n\r\nA talented and diverse group of students will be recruited, with special efforts made to attract women and minorities.  The experience some students will get working in a global environment will evolve from dependent to independent status and will enable them to walk away with life-long skills that will impact their contributions to science and engineering and to society.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n",
