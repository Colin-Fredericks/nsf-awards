In particular, nanoscale spectromicroscopy - the combination of micro- and nano-scale microscopy with powerful spectroscopy - is a lynchpin approach. We propose the acquisition of an atomic force microscope (AFM), near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) and confo-cal Raman microscope combined in a single, multifunctional system. The light source will be not only a standard laser but also a powerful turnkey tunable laser that enables a broad range of spec-troscopy and femtosecond measurements of dynamic nanoscale phenomena. It will function in seamless combination with the microscope for spectromicroscopy and also serves as a stand-alone source for complementary spectroscopy work to maximize its use and value. It will aid a broad range of research in nanoscale phenomena, materials, and devices involving 18 identified users. The crucial combination of microscopy and spectroscopy allows observed phenomena to be asso-ciated with specific nanoscale features and entities, such as connecting optical and structural prop-erties of semiconducting nanowires, studying optical phenomena in nanocircuits, probing the nanostructure of the cell wall, characterizing nanomechanical behavior, and studying polymer nanocomposites. It will be installed and managed in the Probe Innovation Facility of Penn?s Nano Bio Interface Center for widespread access. Vigorous associated outreach efforts include graduate and undergraduate curricular development, and substantial high school teacher and student en-gagement through established outreach programs which emphasize connecting with students from underrepresented groups and economically disadvantaged backgrounds in greater Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nLayman Summary:  Nanotechnology is the study and development of new materials and devices that possess exciting and unprecedented properties thanks to having their structures controlled at the scale of a few atoms and molecules. It is extremely difficult to ?see?, ?feel? and ?listen? to at-oms, molecules, and nano-scale structures, yet we must do this to understand how they behave and make useful applications from them. Recently, researchers have developed ways to do this at the nanoscale with new techniques for microscopy (taking highly magnified images of the size and shape of objects) and spectroscopy (measuring the energy absorbed and emitted by objects). This funding will be used to purchase an instrument that combines both microscopy and spectroscopy in a multi-tasking system that includes a powerful, versatile laser. The laser illuminates the nanoscale objects being studied with light, where the color of the light can be selected from a wide palette. Simultaneously, the microscopy is used to determine where light is being absorbed, re-emitted, or scattered by the nanoscale objects being studied. As well, we can measure the size and shape of the objects, sense how stiff and strong they are, measure how sticky and frictional they are, and meas-ure how well they conduct electricity and heat. By making all of these measurements at once, or at least one right after the other in the same instrument, we will be able to quickly learn how the nanoscale objects behave. Researchers will use this equipment to study nanoscale materials and structures for applications including communicating information in new ways using light, develop-ing new ways to understand the cell and to treat and diagnose diseases, and creating new materials for strong, durable, lightweight structures and powerful, efficient electronic circuits. The system will be installed in Penn?s Nano Bio Interface Center, a leading national research center, for very open access. We will also use this instrument in several courses at Penn, and will engage high school teachers through programs in greater Philadelphia that connect with students from eco-nomically disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented groups in science and engineering.",
