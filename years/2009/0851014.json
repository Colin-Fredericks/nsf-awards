 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses laboratory economics experiments to explore the relationship between one?s birth order and risk preferences as well as the relationship between risk preferences and risk-taking behavior outside of the laboratory. The research team will collect demographic information on family structure and participation in certain risky behaviors including heavy alcohol use, cigarette smoking, marijuana use, and unprotected sexual activity. The research will explore if risk preferences vary between respondents of different birth orders as well as the strength of the relationship between risk preferences measured in the laboratory and risk-taking behavior in a natural setting.\r\n\r\nThe results of these experiments have significant policy implications. Risky teenage behavior costs society billions of dollars every year in current and future medical costs, law enforcement costs, and lost productivity. Recognizing factors that may lead to substance use initiation and escalation during the teenage years or certain subpopulations that may be at greater risk for early initiation of risky behavior has important implications for the design of successful prevention and treatment programs. \r\n",
