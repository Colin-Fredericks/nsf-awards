The students are using modern mathematical notation instead of special, software-specific notation for their modeling tasks.  Using space exploration as a theme, this professionally-developed software is a powerful tool for exploring challenging and realistic problems.\r\n\r\nThe collaborative DIYModeling project team includes six universities which represent diversity in type of institution and in geographical location.  The PI-team is teaching and is field-testing the software and corresponding learning resources in mathematics, business, physics, and biology courses.  Furthermore, this project is building a large community of users to expand and enhance the component library.  Both formative and summative evaluations are included.  The software and  the lessons are being disseminated through workshops, presentations, and NSDL.",
