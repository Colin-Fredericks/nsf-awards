At UConn they will participate in a rich spectrum of activities that will provide them a broad view of research methods and hands-on education and research experience in ongoing programs in sustainable energies. The planned activities of the program are integrated into the following five categories: 1) research preparation, 2) research participation, 3) professional development, 4) bridging technology and K-12 curriculum, and 5) mentorship and outreach.  To attain sustainablility and institutionalization, the project team will develop a combination of activities: an innovative Master of Engineering Education degree program, collaboration with the State to develop engineering frameworks in K-12 curricula, and building community-based enabling partnerships.",
