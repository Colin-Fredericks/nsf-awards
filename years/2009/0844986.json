 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Mary Jane Shultz of Tufts University. Prof. Shultz and her students will develop and employ sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and microscopy to study the interactions between gas phase adsorbates and water and ice interfaces. SFG spectroscopy studies will be used to associate features in the largely unexplored hydrogen bonding region of the IR spectrum with specific binding of adsorbates to the ice surface. SFG microscopy studies will be used to differentiate reactions at defects such as grain boundaries from those on the ice crystal faces. The project is of great environmental importance since molecular level encounters between adsorbates and water or ice determine the fate of substances that are released to the atmosphere. These include, for rexample chloro-fluoro carbons that ultimately form a hole in the ozone layer and combustion generated oxides that acidify the environment. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to students in an area of great importance to society.  In addition, Prof. Shultz and her students will use advanced imaging and visualization techniques to educate K-12 students about environmental processes that involve water and ice surfaces.",
