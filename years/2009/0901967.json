 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Michael McElwain is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Princeton University. The PI will develop new ground-based observing techniques that improve the direct-detection sensitivity to extrasolar planets by a magnitude or more. These techniques will be assessed on-sky using the high contrast imaging system (HCIS) at the Subaru Telescope, and the results of this study will guide the observing program of the 120-night Subaru Strategic Exploration of Exoplanets and Disks (SEEDS) survey. Dr. McElwain will participate in the first-light science using Subaru's new high contrast instrumentation, and he will lead the \"Moving Group\" category of the SEEDS survey. In addition, through simulations and laboratory experiments, Dr. McElwain will design and characterize a focal plane wavefront sensing unit for the HCIS. \r\n\r\nDr. McElwain will also create a new course for the Princeton University Questioning Underlies Effective Science Teaching (QUEST) institute that targets the professional development of secondary school physical science teachers. The course will use inquiry-based learning techniques to bring current exoplanetary science research into the classroom. In addition, Dr. McElwain will post the entire QUEST institute material online in a user-friendly web interface. These public online materials and video demonstrations are expected to reach more than 2000 New Jersey students each year, and this resource will be available to anyone with the internet.",

This survey was awarded 120 nights over 5 years time to use the new high contrast imaging system to study exoplanets through direct detection, explore the evolution of protoplanetary and debris disks, and investigate the link between exoplanets and circumstellar disks.  This fellowship was used to devise and carry out a subset of the SEEDS survey focusing on nearby young stars that are part of known moving groups.  In total, 68 unique systems were observed and a Super-Jupiter exoplanet was discovered around Kappa Andromeda.  The moving group category was combined with other parts of the SEEDS survey and other high contrast imaging datasets to draw statistical constraints on the frequency of exoplanets around young stars.  We found that 1.0-3.1% of stars have substellar companions between 10-100 AU, which is consistent with an extension of the low mass end of the initial mass function rather than an extension of the exoplanet distribution detected with radial velocities.  In addition, this fellowship was used to create new high contrast imaging data reduction algorithms and to design a new integral field spectrograph (IFS) in order to characterize the atmospheres of directly detected exoplanets.   This IFS, called the Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS), is currently being built at Princeton University and is scheduled to achieve first light at the Subaru Telescope in the spring of 2016.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael W Mcelwain"
