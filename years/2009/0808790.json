 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a renewal proposal for the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC), led by the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT). The overall aim of the project is to build the capacity of the nation to produce more highly-qualified physics and physical science teachers, and thus address the critical shortage of qualified physics and physical science secondary teachers in the U.S.   The goals of the project are to: demonstrate and provide sustainable models for a) increasing the number of highly qualified high school physics teachers and b) improving the quality of K-8 physical science teacher education; advocate for improving teacher education within the physics community, and spread best practice ideas through a coalition of institutions committed to this work; and work directly with physics departments to engage them in educating teachers, targeting areas of critical need.   Project sites will adopt best practices in teacher education, including researched curricula and methods shown to increase student learning, and research-validated assessment tools to measure important aspects of teacher quality. The sites will collect and report data on teacher production, teacher quality and teacher retention, as well as implementation of program elements and innovations. Collaborative working relationships with prominent physics education researchers have been developed who will lead scholarly investigations to answer research questions in teacher education and advise the project on assessment activities. The project will use surveys as a formative evaluation of conferences, workshops, and other activities.   Teachers from PhysTEC institutions and from outside the project will benefit from mentoring and professional development provided by Teachers-In-Residence and local Teacher Advisory Groups.   With a combined membership of over 50,000 physics professionals, the APS and AAPT, through this project, will disseminate knowledge on teacher education to its members, and through conferences and workshops for PTEC Coalition institutions.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p class=\"Normal1\">The Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) project aims to improve and promote the education of future physics teachers. The U.S. has a severe shortage of qualified physics teachers, and fewer than half of all high school physics classrooms have a teacher with a degree in the discipline (see Figure 1). A strong preparation in high school physics is important for student success in many STEM majors in college. Specifically, PhysTEC project goals were to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transform physics departments to engage in preparing physics teachers;</li>\n<li>Demonstrate successful models for increasing the number of highly-qualified* teachers of physics prepared at colleges and universities; and</li>\n<li>Spread best-practice ideas throughout the physics teacher preparation community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Since 2001, PhysTEC supported 46 colleges and universities to establish model programs for preparing greater numbers of highly-qualified physics teachers (See Figure 2). PhysTEC sites have more than doubled the number of new, highly-qualified teachers they prepare annually (See Figure 3); if each of the 750 colleges and universities that grant a physics bachelor&rsquo;s degree did the same, the physics teacher shortage would be largely ameliorated. A study on the sustainability of PhysTEC Sites showed that nearly all the studied sites were successful in maintaining their programs after the award period ended (see Figure 4); increased production of new physics teachers was also maintained. Thus, the project is successful in building the national infrastructure necessary for a long-term solution to the physics teacher shortage. In addition, the project has worked with minority serving institutions to increase the diversity of the teacher workforce. About 12% of PhysTEC teachers are underrepresented minorities, compared with 5% of all physics teachers nationwide (see Figure 5).</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">PhysTEC also established a national coalition of more than 300 member institutions committed to the project mission, which includes over 40% of all colleges and universities that grant a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in physics (see Figure 2). There are members in all 50 states, DC and Puerto Rico, and their locations approximately reflect the U.S. population density. Coalition members collectively educate over half of the nation&rsquo;s highly-qualified physics teachers. Nearly all member institutions have sent one or more faculty members to PhysTEC conferences and workshops (see Figure 6), and about half submitted proposals to become a PhysTEC site. This shows the reach of the project and the growing commitment of the physics community to address the physics teacher shortage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">*Highly-qualified physics teachers are defined as those who have a physics degree and teacher certification.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/25/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Monica&nbsp;J&nbsp;Plisch</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0808790/0808790_10025472_1492631727994_FIGURE2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0808790/0808790_10025472_1492631727994_FIGURE2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Physics Teacher Education Coalition\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0808790/0808790_10025472_1492631727994_FIGURE2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Physics Teacher Education Coalition\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">FIG. 2.

  "por_txt_cntn": "The Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) project aims to improve and promote the education of future physics teachers. The U.S. has a severe shortage of qualified physics teachers, and fewer than half of all high school physics classrooms have a teacher with a degree in the discipline (see Figure 1). A strong preparation in high school physics is important for student success in many STEM majors in college. Specifically, PhysTEC project goals were to:\n\nTransform physics departments to engage in preparing physics teachers;\nDemonstrate successful models for increasing the number of highly-qualified* teachers of physics prepared at colleges and universities; and\nSpread best-practice ideas throughout the physics teacher preparation community.\n\nSince 2001, PhysTEC supported 46 colleges and universities to establish model programs for preparing greater numbers of highly-qualified physics teachers (See Figure 2). PhysTEC sites have more than doubled the number of new, highly-qualified teachers they prepare annually (See Figure 3); if each of the 750 colleges and universities that grant a physics bachelor?s degree did the same, the physics teacher shortage would be largely ameliorated. A study on the sustainability of PhysTEC Sites showed that nearly all the studied sites were successful in maintaining their programs after the award period ended (see Figure 4); increased production of new physics teachers was also maintained. Thus, the project is successful in building the national infrastructure necessary for a long-term solution to the physics teacher shortage. In addition, the project has worked with minority serving institutions to increase the diversity of the teacher workforce. About 12% of PhysTEC teachers are underrepresented minorities, compared with 5% of all physics teachers nationwide (see Figure 5).\nPhysTEC also established a national coalition of more than 300 member institutions committed to the project mission, which includes over 40% of all colleges and universities that grant a bachelor?s degree in physics (see Figure 2). There are members in all 50 states, DC and Puerto Rico, and their locations approximately reflect the U.S. population density. Coalition members collectively educate over half of the nation?s highly-qualified physics teachers. Nearly all member institutions have sent one or more faculty members to PhysTEC conferences and workshops (see Figure 6), and about half submitted proposals to become a PhysTEC site. This shows the reach of the project and the growing commitment of the physics community to address the physics teacher shortage. \n*Highly-qualified physics teachers are defined as those who have a physics degree and teacher certification.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Monica J Plisch"
