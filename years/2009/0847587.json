The physical\r\nmechanisms are described by discrete \"particle\" schemes for\r\natomic line defects.  However, mesoscopic and macroscopic\r\nconsequences are best understood via continuous models.  Linkages\r\nbetween models are sought by kinetic theory, partial differential\r\nequations, and stochastic analysis.  The education part includes\r\nthe training of a graduate student, development of innovative\r\ncourses in applied mathematics, activities for mathematics\r\nawareness and outreach, authorship of a book on integral\r\nequations, and organization of working group seminars. \r\n\r\n     The project addresses fundamental issues in nanotechnology\r\nand materials modeling.  The investigator uses tools of applied\r\nmathematics to study systematically how nano-structures decay on\r\nsurfaces of technologically important materials.  This work is\r\nmotivated by the pressing need to design increasingly smaller and\r\nfaster, yet more reliable, devices.  The proposed work advances\r\nthe ability to model and predict by theoretical methods the\r\nreliability of devices for the next generation of applications in\r\nmicroelectronics and information technology.  The project\r\nintegrates research and education: Interdisciplinary concepts of\r\napplied mathematics are shaped into instruction tools that reach\r\nout to students and science experts in diverse areas.  This Career\r\naward is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences\r\nand by the MPS Division of Materials Research. \r\n",
