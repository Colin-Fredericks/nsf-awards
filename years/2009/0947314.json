 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes is essential for developing a robust theory of community assembly. With the imminent construction of numerous temporary ponds in an experimental forest near Syracuse, NY, there is the unique opportunity to use these systems as models for testing several aspects of how ecological and evolutionary factors feedback as species colonize new habitats.  The project will manipulate independently both genetic and species diversity of invertebrates immediately after pond construction, and measure how initial establishment influences subsequent genetic diversity, species diversity, and the evolution of life history traits. Through a controlled, large-scale, field experiment, the project addresses three questions: (1) To what extent do species interactions versus dispersal limitation influence community assembly? (2) How does genetic diversity influence community assembly? (3) How does the assembling community influence important fitness traits?  The immediate results of this EAGER should provide insight into how ecological (e.g., species diversity and interactions) and evolutionary factors (e.g., genetic diversity and evolution of life history traits) interact when influencing the dynamics of this landscape of communities.  Taking advantage of this time-limited opportunity to control the pond communities from their construction will also lead to more interesting longer-term studies as the communities develop.\r\n\r\nThis project will result in the training of one post-doctoral fellow, one graduate student and several undergraduates (several of whom are women and/or members of ethnic groups that are underrepresented in science).  Public outreach will be accomplished by adding a module related to this award to an existing outreach website (www.life.uiuc.edu/caceres/teachers). C\u00e1ceres and Schulz will develop the lessons together, using state standards from both New York and Illinois. Project participants will be part of a multi-disciplinary research team evaluating the role of constructed temporary ponds in restoration efforts, especially in the conservation of endangered amphibians.",
