Laurencin \r\nInstitution: University of Virginia Main Campus \r\nProposal Number: 0736002  \r\n\r\nEFRI-CBE: Biological, Chemical, and Mechanical Surface Cues for Cell Migration, Proliferation, and Differentiation: An Integrated Approach to Regeneration of New Tissues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance the scientific understanding of the role of nanoscale cues on cell adhesion and differentiation. As illustrated in the testbeds, this new understanding of these cues can be applied towards the construction of three-dimensional polymer scaffolds for the repair of complex tissues such as ligament and nerve, tissues that require a greater degree of precision for adequate healing and regeneration. The motivation is to focus specifically on matrices for ligament and nerve repair stem from vital clinical need and in this way will be of significant impact on the NSF effort in Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation. Many individuals suffering from musculoskeletal connective tissue and nerve injury live painful disabled lives. The design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel synthetic constructs engineered to precise specifications through innovative methodologies represent the next generation of nanoscale tissue engineering. These emerging technologies are ideally-suited to the regeneration of those tissues that depend on their complex structure for complete functional restoration, and thus far have proven an insurmountable challenge to repair due to their inherent complexity.  Additional strength of this proposal comes from the previous accomplishments of its interdisciplinary team by integrating experts in polymer chemistry, materials science, computational modeling, and stem cell biology and utilizing each of these tools toward one unified objective.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will have a significant impact on the field of nanotechnology and tissue regeneration. Inherent in the mission of the assembled team will be to ensure that this impact is felt not only in the research community but also in teaching, training, and education. Of particular focus is the inclusion of underrepresented minorities in the scope of its impact. By encompassing scientific and educational goals one hopes to achieve this. The Principal Investigator's laboratory has trained over 80 minority students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels over the past several years, with attention to minority recruitment, training, and mentorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Additionally extensive work was completed developing methodology to create nanoscale fibers, referred to as nanofibers, in patterns similar to those seen in the microscopic structure of some human tissues like skin, nerve, ligament, and tendon.  While the diameter of the fibers is small, on the scale of 100th the thickness of a human hair, we developed a method in which they could be oriented in predictable patterns with considerable accuracy using controlled electric fields, a process called dielectrophoresis.  We oriented these fibers in parallel configurations to mimic tissues such as ligament and tendon as it was noted to be critical in guiding the direction in which fibroblasts and neuronal cells attached and migrated.  Indeed the more parallel the nanofibers the more predictable was the direction of migration of seeded fibroblasts.
