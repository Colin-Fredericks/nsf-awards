 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates the technical feasibility of a Fast-Response, High Sensitivity MEMS based NOx Emission Sensor for Diesel and Other Lean Burn Engines. The innovation combines the company?s SiC-based MEMS piezoelectric bimorph microresonator chemical detection technology with a NOx sensor materials technology patented by MIT, to develop a NOx sensor needed for emissions control and capable of operation in harsh engine emissions environments. This will be accomplished by 1) formulating NOx-sensitive material compositions optimized for sensitivity, reversibility and long term stability, 2) developing deposition processes for integrating the NOx sensitive materials onto its MEMS resonators, and 3) developing high temperature compatible electrodes and packaging compatible with hot engine emissions. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf successful the proposed NOx sensor will fill a strategic and unmet need allowing diesel engines to conform to new diesel engine emissions standards being implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), European Union and Japan. The proposed program will develop and demonstrate highly innovative, sensitive and stable MEMS-based resonator sensor suitable for detecting NOx and ultimately other pollutants in high temperature and chemically aggressive engine emissions environments, and will position US industry for a leadership role in engine emissions NOx control. In order to meet these standards, automobile and truck manufacturers have turned to two after-treatment technologies that reduce tailpipe NOx emission levels. Both after-treatment technologies require NOx sensors, to 1) control the after treatment trap-regenerate cycle, and 2) to monitor after-treatment system performance, confirming proper NOx restriction or triggering the ?check engine? indicator. The NOx sensor will allow clean, energy efficient diesel engines to continue to replace gasoline engines, thereby reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions without increasing NOx pollutants. Furthermore, as the NOx sensor and NOx remediation technologies are introduced into diesel automobiles, trucks, locomotives, diesel power generators etc., these systems will become cleaner providing significant value to society in the form of cleaner air, improved health and reduced medical costs.",
