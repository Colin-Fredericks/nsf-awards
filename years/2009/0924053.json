 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize technology for the inspection of cylinders with reflective surface finishes such as those found in the valve ports of valve bodies and pump covers of automatic transmissions. In order to achieve automated inspection stations with multiple probes in real time, on a production line, and in a factory environment many factors must be addressed such as: protecting the optical, electronic, mechanical and computing system of the probe from the factory environment, ensuring operability and maintainability of the probes on a high speed production line, and integration of the probe software into the computer system of a factory inspection station. Procedures to maximize useful information output must be developed that are easy for plant employees to use and understand. End user requirements for introducing new equipment into a production environment must be met including comparing the results of probe measurements with those of existing inspection techniques. The anticipated result will be a prototype valve port inspection system that can be used in a transmission manufacturing plant. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to inspect transmission valve ports for surface defects before the components containing them are assembled into valve bodies and pump covers. At the present time no automated inspection of this kind is being carried out. Valve bodies and pump covers are considered to contain defects only if they fail a leak test after they are assembled. This results in a range of variability in the quality of these components and in the performance and service life of the transmissions containing them. Reducing the variability and improving the quality of automatic transmissions could lead to more efficient vehicles with longer periods between transmission repairs and better fuel economy. It could also lead to a better scientific understanding of the effect of these defects on transmission performance and improvements in the manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n",

Part inspection is required to ensure that these conditions are met and defective parts are not allowed into the assembly stream. If defective parts are incorporated into an assembly, the performance of the subsystem will be affected. In a mass production situation many subsystems may have been assembled before a problem is discovered. The cost of correcting this problem is compounded if the subsystem is incorporated into a complete product. Even worse, if the finished product is shipped to a customer and malfunctions, it must be returned for warranty repair, increasing costs and affecting the reputation of the manufacturer. Conversely, an effective inspection system can keep the cost of manufacture  low and provide a competitive advantage to companies employing effective inspection procedures.\n\nAn example where total inspection of manufactured components is needed is the manufacture of valve bodies of automatic transmissions. Valve bodies contain cylindrical valve ports that regulate the flow of fluid and determine the gear in which the vehicle operates. If there are defects in these valve ports the valves can leak. This could affect the ability of the drive train to switch gears and the efficiency of operation of the vehicle.\n\nIntellectual merit\n\nTransmission valve bodies are one of the most complex components of an automobile. Each valve body contains multiple cylindrical valve ports. Typical valve ports are the order of 1 cm in diameter and eight or more cm in length. Each valve port can be intersected by multiple slots creating short cylindrical segments that can vary in diameter along the valve port. A cut away cross section of a valve port is shown in Figure 1.       \n\nUntil now the surface finish of transmission valve ports has been inspected primarily by human visual inspection. Manually operated borescopes have been used to assist this inspection process on a statistical basis, but an automated solution that could operate under factory conditions was needed.\n\nA conceptual drawing of the IOMS probe used to inspect these cylinders is shown in Figure 2. An optical element in the probe tip directs a laser beam perpendicular to the surface of the cylinder. A linear motion stage inserts the spinning probe into the cylinder to scan the surface. A cover shields the internal probe components from the factory environment.\n\nResults\n\nThe results of a typical scan are shown in Figure 3. The colors represent different detected light intensities. The red areas are highly reflective diamond turned cylindrical surfaces, the greenish blue areas are unmachined casting surfaces and blue areas are even lower intensity return signals. The large blue regions are holes in the casting material. The blue stripe inside the red area on the far left of the image is a step where the diameter of the cylinder changes. Green areas within the red stripes can be defects, such as pores or chips off the edges of the cylindrical segments.\n\nChatter is produce when a cutting tool vibrates as it machines a cylinder. Figure 4 shows a case of tool chatter that appears as a repetitive pattern of vertical lines in machined sections of the bore.\n\nTapped threads can also be inspected using our probe.
