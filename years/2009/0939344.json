The goal of the project is to expose undergraduate students to the design, manufacturing and characterization of nanostructured materials systems and device prototypes. An interdisciplinary nanotechnology course (Nanotechnology I) with a significant hands-on laboratory component will be developed as a preparatory course and will be offered as a junior-level technical elective open to all engineering majors.",
