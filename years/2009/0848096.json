 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Innovation Technology Transfer (STTR) project will demonstrate the utility of infrared planar array technology to study water pollutants such as industrial contaminants and biological impurities. It proposes to optimize the design and construction of a compact, high-sensitivity, double beam infrared instrument based on focal plane array detection, which meets or exceeds performance standards of commercially available Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) solutions and is able to operate in ambient environments to provide measurements of dilute concentrations of organic and biological contaminants.\r\n\r\nIf successful the outcome of this project will enable real time effluent detection from a manufacturing site such as that found at chemical companies who could realize tangible and intangible savings from being able to pro-actively identify and measure the presence of pollutants. A portable Planar Array Infrared (PA-IR) spectrograph could be used to measure contaminants in rivers, streams and ponds, thereby providing ?real time? feedback on changes in the environment. The World Laboratory Analytical Instrument Market is estimated to be $9.36B in 2008. IR spectroscopy is estimated to be $738MM. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA new instrument has been developed for rapidly obtaining mid-infrared (IR) spectra. Focal plane array (FPA) technology has made possible the development of a PA-IR or planar array IR spectrograph.  This spectrograph is capable of operating in the 1 to 12 micron (10,000 to 800 wavenumber) region at speeds that will allow spectra to be collected 100 to 1000 times per second.  The overall spectral coverage and the speed are ultimately dependent upon the type of detector (FPA) and the type of dispersive optical grating used in the system.   This technology enables the use of a true double beam sample chamber, allowing the simultaneous collection of sample data as well as background reference data.  With this technique, unwanted components present in the environment can be eliminated from the sample spectrum in real time.  \n\nThe key goal of this project was to develop an infrared spectrograph based on dispersive optics and the use of modern thermal imaging cameras that utilize 2 dimensional focal plane arrays. A secondary goal was to develop a double beam sample chamber which would eliminate the need to purge the spectrometer with nitrogen in order to eliminate water vapor, carbon dioxide and other ambient impurities.  Both goals were achieved.  The outcome is a unique instrument that for the first time makes possible the IR analysis of rapidly changing chemical events and dynamic chemical systems.\n\nThe performance of the instrument has been validated against the performance of an FT-IR spectrometer. Fourier Transform IR (FT-IR) is the technology widely used for mid IR spectral analysis.  A PA-IR instrument is considerably faster than FT-IR.  It also shows an improvement in signal-to-noise over the same measurement time.  Long term stability is also enhanced mainly by the ability to couple the PA-IR with the double beam sample chamber developed under this project.  The major trade-off for using a PA-IR is that the wavelength coverage is limited to about 1000 wavenumbers, whereas an FT-IR is capable of covering all or most of the mid-infrared region at one time.   The 1000 wavenumber band over which the PA-IR can be operated is variable based on the system configuration.  The results have been described in several oral presentations at national and international scientific conferences and exhibitions.\n\nThe development of the instrument and methodology for PA-IR spectral acquisition results from the collaboration of Dr. Bruce Chase from PAIR Technologies and Dr. John Rabolt of the Material Science Department at the University of Delaware.  This collaboration has led to this one-of-a-kind instrument that is well on its way to commercialization.  Government research labs and private industry have expressed a desire to acquire a PAIR system in the near future.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Frost"
