Students who participate in this REU program will perform frontier research at the interface of chemistry and biology.  Projects are available in areas of research including proteomics, protein-protein interactions, protein-macromolecule interactions, protein-small molecule interactions, protein structure-function relationships, enzymology, and small molecule synthesis.  Students will work either in the NARL or in labs at MSU, and joint group meetings and a mid-summer symposium will facilitate interactions between the two sites.  Native American students and students from Montana's Tribal Colleges are especially encouraged to apply, as are students from small colleges within the upper Northwest region of the country.  Additional information and electronic application materials are available at www.chemistry.montana.edu/reu/.",

Both groups participated each summer in a joint symposium at Flathead Lake Biological Station (Yellow Bay, MT). All of the students made short PowerPoint presentations (10 minutes plus time for questions) at this meeting.\n\nThe students and faculty of our REU program led three workshops at the MSU site for the twenty-five high school students who were on campus doing research through Montana\u00c6s Apprenticeship Program (MAP) each summer.  These students are from high schools on Montana\u00c6s seven Native American Indian Reservations and they spend six weeks at MSU working in the research labs.  In the mornings, the high school students have enrichment activities to boost their academic skills.  REU led three three-hour labs that were modified from our undergraduate chemistry/biochemistry curriculum. The REU students served as facilitators for all of the MAP labs.  This series of workshops has very successful, for the past nine summers.  Three of the students who participated in our REU program during previous summers participated in MAP prior to REU.\n\nAt the conclusion of the summer, each REU student submitted a written report on his/her research.  The faculty and graduate mentors worked closely with the participants to use the report as an opportunity to improve the writing skills of the undergraduates.   The REU students also created a poster for an afternoon poster symposium at MSU.  About seventy-five students who participated in summer research activities campus-wide presented their research findings, and approximately one hundred faculty members, graduate students, and administrators attended the poster symposium.\n\nTo assess the impact of the REU program on our students, each student participated in an individual exit interview.

At their exit interviews, students listed the following as important skills they gained from our program: plating fungus, prepping samples for ..."
