 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graphene, a single-atom-think layer of graphite, has exceptional electronic qualities, such as the ability to carry charge at great speed, that make this new nanomaterial attractive for the next generation of electronic devices. Synthesizing and characterizing such ultra-thin material however is especially challenging. Laser irradiation of a single-crystal of silicon carbide (SiC) is proposed as a graphene synthesis method. Laser light absorption causes the decomposition of the SiC and selective evaporation of silicon leaving a graphene layer on the surface. Using the x-ray beam at the Stanford Synchrotron source crystalline perfection and orientation of the laser-synthesized graphene layer will be investigated. Furthermore, bonding defects of the graphene layer will be investigated spectroscopically. Finally, one-step synthesis and patterning will be demonstrated by masking parts of the laser beam during irradiation.\r\n\r\nThe societal benefits of having a graphene synthesis method that can be scaled to large wafers, similarly to silicon, would be very significant. Indeed, making large areas of graphene suitable for the fabrication of devices is one of the main challenges to the development of this material. Furthermore, students working on the project would be trained in the Materials Science of a novel material that is likely to play a role in the next generation of advanced electronic devices. Outreach activities are also planned through the summer institute for middle-school teachers at the Stanford-based NSF center for probing the nanoscale and through the development of hands-on activities that can be exported into a classroom environment.\r\n",
