The planning, in preparation for a Noyce Teaching Fellowship project, involves the expansion and strengthening of existing relationships with school districts and partnering corporations and foundations.  The project is revising the current Masters of Arts in Education program at SPU to focus on the needs of STEM teachers, enhancing the Teacher Mentorship Program to support new STEM teachers and improve retention, conducting  a needs assessment and marketing research to determine school district needs and the needs of potential STEM career changers who are considering teaching, obtaining agreements from school districts regarding salary supplements for future Teaching Fellows, developing plans for increasing diversity, and identifying contributions from external partners.",
