 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nHigh-end routers and switches perform performance-critical lookups\r\ninto large data based on network packet content.  Current designs rely\r\non specialized hardware modules for high performance. While mostly\r\nsufficient, emerging new protocols create a problem; for these to be\r\ndeployed, expensive equipment upgrades are required. To support the rapid deployment of new data plane protocols, we need a flexible hardware/software framework.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing such a unified framework for future\r\nnetwork devices with four components: a) an abstract execution model\r\nto represent hardware, b) a toolchain to ease implementation, d)\r\nquantitative performance evaluation of protocols, and d) programmable\r\nhardware architectures specialized for the core operations in network\r\nprotocols. Leveraging trends in tiled architectures, the project is\r\ndeveloping a specialized tiled architecture that moves computation close\r\nto storage and thus provide efficient lookups. The project is also\r\ninvestigating how these design methodologies extend beyond protocol\r\nprocessing to payload inspection as required by intrusion prevention,\r\napplication identification and other functionality.\r\n\r\nDeploying and implementing new protocols is challenging. This project\r\nwill result in specification of flexible hardware for high-end\r\nrouters. This flexibility to support multiple protocols using a single\r\ntoolchain and architecture framework will reduce development costs of\r\nfuture high-end routers and speedup the deployment of new\r\nprotocols. Another outcome will be the open-source release to\r\nthe academic community of the toolchain for developing high-speed\r\nimplementation of protocols, reference implementations of various\r\nprotocols, standard data sets, and a NetFPGA implementation of the\r\nproposed hardware architecture.",
