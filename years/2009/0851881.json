 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at El Paso REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summer of 2009 through 2012. The Site will host eight students in a ten-week summer Research Experience for Undergraduates Program. The main goal of the program is to provide participating students with a nurturing and exciting environment in which to obtain the tools, information, and research experience that encourages the pursuit of graduate careers. Students are required to engage in a research project under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Students will be trained to address questions in various areas of basic biology utilizing molecular and cellular techniques. Students also attend two weekly meetings, a \"Career Development Workshop\" and \"Careers in Science Seminar Series\". The first workshop provides the students with the tools to enhance both their oral and written communication skills and the second seminar series introduces students to careers in science. Throughout the summer, several social activities are organized to help students get acquainted with each other, with the University, and with the surrounding area. At the conclusion of the program, the students present their research accomplishments in both written and oral reports. Although not strictly limited to the immediate geographical area, the program will focus its recruitment efforts on students who are from the southwest U.S.- Mexico border region. Students from underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged to apply. More information is available by visiting http://www.reu.utep.edu, or by contacting the Program Director, Dr. Garza, at kgarza@utep.edu.",

The goal of the program is to increase participation in the biological sciences by traditionally underrepresented groups, to promote careers in science, and to provide students with an opportunity to inspect a biology graduate program at a regional university. The program aims to achieve these goals by 1) guiding students through a real world research project, 2) teaching scientific methods through the use of modern techniques in biomedical research, 3) encouraging student enrollment in graduate school through a seminar series in which academic and non-academic careers in science are discussed, 4) instilling a sense of community through extensive student-faculty and student-student interaction promoted by weekly structured mentoring activities, and 5) improving student confidence and communication skills through oral and written presentations of their results in conjunction with Career Development Workshops. The program selects 8 to 10 undergraduate participants every summer, allows the students to choose a mentor from the list of participating scientists, and the students spend two months over the summer performing an independent research project under the guidance of their chosen mentor. The current funding award spanning 2009 through 2012 served a total of 35 undergraduate students, many of which did not have access to research opportunities at their home institutions. A total of 24 (69%) of the students went on to pursue additional research opportunities at the undergraduate level after completing our program suggesting that their interest in a research career was either stimulated and/or maintained through participation in our program. A total of 17 (49%) students have completed their Bachelors degree and 11 (65% of the graduates) of those that graduated are currently in a graduate program focusing on biomedical research. In addition, 30 (86%) of the students served this funding period were Ethnic Minorities. Thus, our program has contributed significantly to increasing the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in scientific research. These numbers provide strong evidence for the continued success of our REU Program in achieving the stated goals.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/17/2013<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marc&nbsp;B&nbsp;Cox</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
