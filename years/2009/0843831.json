Their research will demonstrate the power of NEOTOMA, a new community paleoecological database that reduces informatics costs and removes barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration by storing in a single database most of the major late-Neogene paleoecological databases. The proposed research will be the first-ever synoptic analyses of late-Quaternary community dynamics in North America that directly integrate fossil pollen, plant-macrofossil, and faunal records. The PIs propose improving the resolution of the NEOTOMA database by obtaining 100 new AMS radiocarbon dates for key vertebrate fossil localities, adding recent high-quality records to NEOTOMA, revising existing chronologies in NEOTOMA in light of this new data, and mapping all data for 15 time-windows covering the last 21,000 years. These time windows are more finely subdivided than the original FAUNMAP synthesis, and will permit study of species responses to the rapid climate changes of the last deglaciation. The PIs will test such hypotheses by comparing the distributions of the floral and faunal no-analog communities to each other and to the distributions of no-analog climates. They will create plant based and animal based biome maps to see whether such maps are complementary or in contradiction. The PIs will further conduct generalized dissimilarity modeling to reveal patterns of species turnover, along environmental gradients, in both space and time. \r\n \r\n",
