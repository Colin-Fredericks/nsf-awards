National Committee for Psychology\r\nProject Abstract\r\n\r\nThe U.S. National Committee for Psychology (USNC/IUPsyS) represents the U.S. psychological science community to the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS) on behalf of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The USNC/IUPsyS provides a valuable network through which the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the NAS enhance their capacity to contribute to global research in psychological science. It is also a vehicle through which the NAS reaches out to the U.S. scientific community through international union activities that are designed to further develop the fields of psychology both nationally and internationally, thus helping to create a diverse and globally-oriented U.S. scientific workforce.  \r\n\r\nU.S participation in IUPsyS fulfills a unique role in the national science infrastructure. The national committee:\r\n\r\n - provides a forum for dialogue between U.S. scientists and foreign colleagues; \r\n - develops programs for building human and research capacity in developing countries; \r\n - fosters research cooperation by sponsoring conferences and workshops on topics of interest and by initiating pilot/demonstration projects for bilateral or regional research collaborations; and\r\n - organizes travel grant programs for young scientists and scientists from underrepresented backgrounds to participate in international scientific congresses.\r\n - interacts with union officers to ensure strong governance and sound financial management; \r\n - identifies and supports the best candidates for election to union offices; \r\n\r\nOverall, this proposed program encourages cooperative research and education efforts across disciplinary and international boundaries, and positions the United States to benefit from global investment in science and technology.  The proposed activities of the USNC/IUPsyS are 1) a workshop and report addressing institutional impediments to cross-national psychological research, 2) a website with resources to foster international collaborations, and 3) two Advanced Research Training Seminars (ARTS) held in conjunction with the IUPsyS General Assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe national committee's impact is the result of the work of the members of the committee, who represent a variety of psychological science disciplines and have strong international interests. Several current and past members of the committee exercise leadership at the international union level.  The work of the committee -- whether as an organizer of scientific initiatives with impact in both domestic and international arenas or as a leader at the union level -- ultimately contributes to U.S. scientific diplomacy activities.",
