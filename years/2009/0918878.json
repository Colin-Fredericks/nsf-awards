 "awd_abstract_narration": "The key scientific significance of this work is the integration of microbial community and chemical interactions during the long-term degradation and stabilization of plant litter because there has not yet been a working synthesis of this knowledge expressed in a comprehensive quantitative framework.  Plant litter decomposition is the main control on soil fertility and carbon (C) sequestration. There is growing interest in understanding the conditions under which soils gain or lose C, in part, because soils contain more C than the atmosphere and could play either a moderating or exacerbating role in global warming. An integrated field, laboratory, and modeling study of the biochemical mechanisms driving interactions between soil C sequestration, plant litter chemistry, and microbial community composition and activity during decomposition is needed to define these relationships. Moorhead and Sinsabaugh (2006) developed a new model that incorporates microbial dynamics into the decomposition process, the Guild Decomposition Model (GDM), which has generated a series of specific hypotheses about the mechanisms controlling the interactions between plant litter chemistry, C stabilization and microbial community composition and activity during decomposition. The proposed research will evaluate these hypotheses experimentally by monitoring changes in plant litter chemistry and microbial community composition and function during decomposition, with and without added N to mimic N deposition. Stable C isotope (13C) labeling will further determine the community composition of active microorganisms capable of metabolizing specific chemical components of plant litter. This research will provide mechanistic insight into the impacts on plant litter decomposition and soil C sequestration from N deposition, elevated CO2, plant community composition shifts, and climate change. \r\n\r\nAn integrated education and outreach program will complement this research, assisted by the University of Toledo's Center for Creative Instruction (CCI). For this project, the CCI will develop an online interactive Model Of Leaf Decomposition (iMold) to provide educational outreach about decomposition for grades 5-12.  Visitors will be able to visualize the progress of the decomposition of litter as a whole, or different individual litter chemical constituents, along a time line to see how time, litter type, and environment relate to how quickly or slowly something decays. Teachers and students will be able to network between researchers and classrooms at other schools, enabling them to share data, ask questions, and collaborate on experiments. A communication center will be created so that the researchers and classrooms can share ideas and results, as well as ask questions in a blog-like environment.  Additionally, this project will provide training for several undergraduate and graduate students. University of Toledo and Kent State University serve significant populations of underrepresented groups in science, and  they will be recruited to this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overriding objective of this project was to investigate whether the types of species present in soil are important for making predictions about plant tissue decomposition rates, which will affect storage of carbon in soil.  Understanding soil carbon is key to accurate forecasts about how global carbon cycling will be affected by future perturbations such as land use change, shifting vegetation, or increasing temperatures.  Most computer models do not consider species composition of soil microorganisms or plants in predictions about soil carbon.  However, microorganisms carry out complex chemical reactions to break down dead plant tissue, which is then stored as soil organic matter or returned to the atmosphere as CO2.  Each species of microorganism is thought to be able to carry out a different combination of the chemical reactions important in this process, which could alter the rate of plant tissue decomposition, the amount of carbon eventually stored in soil, and the chemical and physical form of that stored carbon.  Likewise, plant species may also affect decomposition and soil carbon by producing root and leaf tissue with different chemical and physical characteristics.  We performed two experiments demonstrating the importance of species composition.  In the first experiment, we grew three different species of fungi on decomposing leaves so that these species would have a \"head start\" on other microorganisms.  The differences between these initial fungal colonists were shown to have a dramatic effect on subsequent decomposition rates in forests, demonstrating the importance of microorganism species early in the decomposition process.  In a second experiment, we sampled tree roots from a diverse natural forest and identified them through DNA analysis.  We found that root biomass increased for all species in response to soil fertility, but there was an additional increase in root biomass where roots of distantly related species mixed in the same soil patches.  Thus, species placed their roots in the same rich soil areas, but differences among the combinations of species present affected the amount of root tissue that could accumulate.  These differences in root accumulation affect the amount of plant biomass available for decomposition by microorganisms when the roots die.\n\n\nAlthough microorganism and plant species composition may be important in determining soil carbon dynamics, incorporating this information into computer models would benefit from simplification of the enormous species diversity present in natural communities.  In trees, we found that root traits evolve relatively slowly (in contrast to leaf traits).  Thus, root traits may be predictable from high-level taxonomic groups (e.g., angiosperm super order), which could be a convenient way to aggregate species.  In microorganisms, the species diversity is far greater and traits important in decomposition evolve more quickly.  One hypothesis is that microorganisms can be divided into \"functional guilds\" that have predominantly different traits corresponding with i.) microorganisms that are active early in decomposition and utilize simple plant compounds, ii.) microorganisms active in an intermediate stage of decomposition and utilize unprotected polysaccharides, and iii.) microorganisms active in late stages of decomposition that can break down polyphenolics.  We analyzed DNA of microorganisms in decomposing leaves over two years, and confirmed that species of microorganisms turn over as predicted by this \"functional guild\" hypothesis.  However, only minor differences in microorganism species were detected when comparing decomposing leaves from tree species with differing amounts of simple compounds, unprotected polysaccharides, and polyphenolics.  Thus, the functional guild hypothesis did not extend very well to comparison of leaf types.  This approach was also only partially applicable in experiments comparing land use types and longterm starvation of mic..."
