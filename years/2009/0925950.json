 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual merit: This project is aimed at experimental and theoretical investigations of linear and nonlinear optical phenomena in the presence of multiple scattering and photon localization in random media. The amplification of weak optical signals, such as linear and nonlinear Raman scattering, due to greatly elongated wave trajectories in strongly scattering optical samples will be explored. Disordered nanostructures in GaP and InP exhibiting controlled microscopic/ mesoscopic disorder and light scattering efficiency will be employed to study their linear and nonlinear optical response. The precise material and structural characteristics in these samples will be optimized to achieve the enhancement of Raman signal that is comparable to the state-of-the-art techniques and is enough to detect environmentally significant concentrations of hazardous chemicals in water solution. The ultimate design of Raman sensor developed in this proposal will be implemented as a prototype that will be tested at the sewage facilities for continuous monitoring of the water quality.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This research brings together collaborators from optical and material sciences to create a unique climate for the active student participation in research and science/engineering education and for the preparation of the future scientists, engineers and educators. Students from the largest and diverse urban centers in Texas and Wisconsin, including those of underrepresented groups, will be able to gain interdisciplinary experience and training in optics, materials, biological and chemical sciences. The significant improvement of chemical sensor architecture, aimed as a part of the proposed research, will have an immediate impact on society and economy through established partnerships with local industrial companies and communities.",
