 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to gain understanding of the basic science governing the behavior and tunability of Magneto-Active Polymers (MAPs).  These polymer based composites with a filler of magnetic particles have the ability to change their size, stiffness, water retention and other magneto-mechanical properties when exposed to a magnetic field.  The specific changes desired can be engineered into the microstructure of the materials by controlling the local elastic and magnetic ordering during the cure process as well as manipulating a variety of other synthesis conditions.  This is only possible with a thorough understanding of the behavior of MAPs and a predictive model of this behavior.  The specific aims of this project are: (1) the experimental characterization of MAP magneto-mechanical property dependencies, (2) micromechanics-based analytical models explaining the behavior of MAPs, (3) quantitative prediction of the performance of MAP-based devices, and (4) synthesizing protocols for MAPs with an engineered microstructure.  \r\n\r\nThe successful completion of this research will enable applications that will transform not only how MAPs are used but also the capability of technology in fields ranging from virtual and augmented reality to bio-medicine, noise and vibration control, and high resolution positioning.  The research will be incorporated into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum through example problems and used in a broader educational effort to understand the instructional pedagogy for teaching ill-structure problem solving.  Additionally, the personnel development of this project will involve training PhD and Masters level students as well as undergraduate researchers recruited through minority programs at Iowa State University.  These students will gain valuable technical abilities as well as mentoring, team work, and other non-technical skills.  The research will also be simplified into hands on activities for K-12 students and will be used in collaboration with a variety of existing programs.\r\n",
