Specific equipment that will be acquired  includes: 1) a Carbon/Sulfur analyzer (CS analyzer) for combustion of bulk samples for total S, total C, and total inorganic C (TIC) abundances of bulk samples; and 2) a gas chromatograph/combustion/pyrolysis (GC/C/P) inlet system for the separation of organic extracts from sediments and sequential combustion for C and H isotope compositions.  The equipment will support PI and colleague studies of biogeochemical processes and climate variability on the early Earth (Archean and Proterozoic eons) and allow expansion of this research through new analytical capability for characterization of compound specific stable isotopic ratios and the structure of organic molecular compounds preserved in ancient sedimentary rocks.  The expanded capabilities fo this laboratory will also support visiting scientists, graduate, undergraduate and high school student projects. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
