 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nObjective: Nanowires' unique geometry leads to a large surface area to volume ratio, which, along with the capability of rational control in doping and heterostructure formation, can be exploited in many devices and subsystem modules for various applications. In this program, we will build upon our experience on nanowire growth on semiconductors substrates to advance the study of nanowire based electro-optic and photonic devices such as nanowire optical modulator and nanowire photodiode for optical communications, and to develop fabrication processes that allow the massive integration of nanowire devices with Si devices. \r\n \t\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed research will advance the technologies that make functional nanowire devices and allow their integration with existing CMOS or Si Photonic circuits. Optical modulator and photodiode incorporating nanowires investigated and fabricated in this program will lead to very significant and important advances in optical communication systems as well as enabling high speed and energy efficient optical intrachip interconnects. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project will provide a better understanding of nanowire properties that are  essential for achieving performance uniformity and reproducibility in devices incorporating nanowires. From an educational perspective, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students in an inherently interdisciplinary field by incorporating aspects of materials science, nano- scale device and fabrication, into existing courses. The project will contribute to the educational infrastructure required to attract and train a broadly represented group of future engineers through undergraduate seminars and research participation, and through outreach to high school students.",
