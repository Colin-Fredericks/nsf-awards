The project is recruiting an additional 41 STEM teachers by awarding 20 scholarships to STEM majors in their junior and senior year preparing to become secondary math or science teachers and providing one-year stipends to 21 STEM graduates or professionals who are making a career change to become mathematics or science teachers. Recruitment efforts begin with summer internships for freshmen and sophomores who intern in summer school programs in supportive and structured academic settings in two local school districts (Meridian and Mt. Baker School Districts) assisting students needing science and mathematics remediation.  In addition to recruiting undergraduate STEM majors at WWU and local community colleges, the project is recruiting STEM professionals from area industries who are considering a career change.  The Noyce Scholars have access to the resources of the Science, Mathematics and Technology Education program at WWU and benefit from an infrastructure consisting of teacher-led  professional learning communities established  in 28 partner school districts under the North Cascades and Olympic Science Partnership, a Math and Science Partnership project.",
