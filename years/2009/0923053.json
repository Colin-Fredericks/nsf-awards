 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award will enable the University of Akron to acquire an AFM/Raman (atomic force microscopy/Raman spectroscopy) integrated system which is critically needed to support current research and education activities on campus.  The proposed interdisciplinary team shares a common vision for their research programs in the molecular interface of the bio/nano materials research.  The AFM/Raman integrated system will directly advance the ongoing research projects, including: 1) gecko-mimetic dry adhesives, 2) electrospinning-enabled heterogeneous structures, 3) high-speed biomimetic microfluidic biosensors, 4) multifunctional imaging probes, 5) bioimplants, tissue scaffolds and biosensors, and 6) high-performance electrodes for fuel cells.  Taking advantage of the unique capabilities of the instrument, the team seeks to uncover the fundamental principles of molecular interactions at the interfaces of the bio/nano materials, and enhance undergraduate and graduate education missions.    \r\n\r\nThe proposed activities cover a wide spectrum of programs in engineering, chemistry, biology and medicine.  The AFM/Raman integrated system will create hands-on research training and education opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students and high school students, and inspire them to pursue careers in science and technology.  The concept, theory, and results associated with this instrument will be used in strengthening existing and new undergraduate and graduate courses.  The AFM/Raman system can benefit industrial partners by sharing the usage of the workhorse instrument and will serve as a catalytic and synergetic platform for the collaboration between the university and industry.  Research and education efforts will also be disseminated via conference presentations to reach a broader audience.\r\n",
