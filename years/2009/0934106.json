 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is hosting a five-day Cognitive Diagnosis Models (CDM) working group in conjunction with the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Science Institute (SAMSI) Summer Program on Psychometrics. The CDM working group will bring together researchers from statistics, mathematical psychology, computer science, and educational psychology, who have worked on diagnostic and related models, to synthesize different models and approaches to diagnostic modeling and address major challenges in the field. Three methodological cornerstones will guide the workshop activities: (1) the design of diagnostic assessment; (2) the analysis of the resulting data; and (3) the reporting of the results. The workshop will emphasize issues related to the first and second methodological cornerstones. The presentations and discussions during the CDM working group will form the basis for a white paper outlining methodological challenges in CDM and will be submitted for publication in statistics and education journals.",
