 "awd_abstract_narration": "FUNDAMENTAL EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF FINITE STRAIN, HIGH-STRAIN RATE ELECTROMAGNETIC LOADING PROCESSES IN DUCTILE METALS\r\n\r\nInteraction between electromagnetic and mechanical fields in electrically conducting materials generates high forces and large temperatures, and enables important practical applications, such as the Electromagnetic Forming (EMF) method for shaping sheet metals at high-velocity. The complex nature of the coupled electromagnetic and thermo-mechanical phenomena that occur during these rapid processes, have not been the object of a systematic study from the mechanics standpoint. The goal of the proposed work is a systematic investigation of electromagnetic loading phenomena, which is expected to help: a) characterize, using fundamental experiments, the constitutive response of structural metals under EMF conditions and: b) establish the modeling capability required for such processes, and validate with experiments in which full field strain measurements will be performed in real time.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study will enable a useful new technology, since the EMF process has the advantage of being a rapid, low-waste and environmentally friendly process for manufacturing parts out of alloys that are difficult to shape through conventional means. Recent advances in electronics and energy storage technology make EMF technology ripe for mass production, and plans are well under way for the large scale manufacturing of fuel cell plates and tubular frames for the automotive industry. The fundamental understanding of this process will significantly push the use of EMF towards large-scale applications through links that have been established with interested industry to facilitate such transition. Furthermore, education and training of a diverse group of graduate students is an integral part of this proposal. \r\n",
