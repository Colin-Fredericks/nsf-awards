 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  This award will fund the acquisition of a new tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy isotope analyzer (TDLAS) and a tabletop induction furnace.  We intend to: 1) Calibration the system in a controlled glove box, followed by a continuation of atmospheric water vapor studies in New Mexico and at the Mauna Loa site; 2) undertake controlled laboratory studies of evaporation and condensation in order to better understand controls on the composition of atmospheric water vapor, particularly the deuterium-excess parameter; 3) Develop an extraction procedure for analysis of H and O isotopes from fluid inclusions; 4) Develop an extraction procedure for H isotope analysis for hydrous minerals, nominally anhydrous minerals and extraterrestrial materials; 5) Develop a step-heating extraction procedure for H and O isotopes from clay minerals; 6) Study H and O isotope ratios related to evapo-transpiration in the Rio Grande Valley ecosystem; and 7) Measure H and O isotope values of soil gas (soil water).  In the course of this work, we will provide an accurate calibration of the system at low atmospheric p(H2O), and develop analytical procedures that will benefit the overall geological community by providing novel 'front-end' applications to the TDLAS system.\r\n\r\nThe TDLAS will become an integral part of research and teaching at the University of New Mexico (UNM). UNM is one of only three Universities in the country that is designated as both a Hispanic-serving institution and a Carnegie Doctoral/Research Extensive University, and this laboratory routinely hires minority and/or women undergraduate students to work in the laboratory or as part of a undergraduate honors research project. The TDLAS will be an important part of our ongoing program to involve undergraduates in research because it is easy to use, and they can be active participants in the projects outlined in this proposal. The instrument will also be used for teaching in environmental studies and stable isotope courses, as it can be used with only minimal instruction.",
