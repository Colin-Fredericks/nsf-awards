 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Board on Science Education (BOSE) of the NRC is a standing committee of the National Academies.  This proposal requests core support for BOSE so that it can continue to provide national leadership in science education.  Specifically, BOSE (1) improves the knowledge base for science education; (2) identifies critical issues in science education policy and practice; (3) translates research and disseminates evidence-based information; and (4) builds an interdisciplinary community of scholars to bring knowledge to bear on important issues in science education.  \r\n\r\nTo carry out its mandate, BOSE conducts studies, sponsors workshop and works with government representatives to surface emerging policy issues.  The Board has identified the following priorities for the next few years:\r\n?\tIntersection on research on learning and science education\r\n?\tCyber-enabled learning and teaching\r\n?\tAnalysis of the Education System to enable implementation and scale-up\r\n?\tReaching diverse populations\r\n?\tIntersection of science and science education\r\n\r\nThe core support enables two two-day Board meetings each year, coordination with DBASSE  and other units of the Academy, and regular meetings between NSF and the Academies.\r\n",
