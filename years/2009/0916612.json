 "awd_abstract_narration": "This projects investigates the external and internal factors (e.g., demographic, personal, and psychological aspects) that impact senior citizens' online privacy behavior.  The multi-perspective approach to address this question consists of surveys (standardized), intensive in-person interviews, focus groups, key stroke logging and log analysis and scenario based questionnaires to understand online privacy behavior and attitude.  A computational framework for online privacy protection using Bayesian Networks will be developed that includes a privacy architecture incorporating security policies, enforceable measures and a set of recommendations for proper design of privacy-enhancing technologies. This research will also explore senior citizens' perceived value of their personal information and the impact of cyber security education on online privacy behavior.\r\n\r\nSince there is limited empirical data and research about senior citizens and online privacy, this project has the potential to significantly contribute to the design of more usable and unbiased online privacy protection technology for elderly users of the Internet. Ultimately, the wider societal importance of the proposed research is that a deeper understanding of the interaction between personal, social and institutional factors in determining senior citizens' experience with online privacy is needed to facilitate the continuing effort in enhancing online privacy assurance on the Internet.",
