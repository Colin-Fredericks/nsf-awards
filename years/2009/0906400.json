 "awd_abstract_narration": "DSC 2009, an international workshop on Directions in Statistical\r\nComputing, will be held July 13--14, 2009 at the University of\r\nCopenhagen, Denmark.  This is the sixth in a series of meetings;\r\nprevious meeting were held in Vienna, Austria (1999, 2001, and 2003),\r\nSeattle, WA (2005), and Auckland, New Zealand (2007). The workshop\r\nwill focus on, but is not limited to, open source statistical\r\ncomputing and aims to provide a platform for exchanging ideas about\r\ndevelopments in statistical computing.  UseR! 2009 will be held July\r\n8--10 in Rennes, France, and is the fifth in a series of conferences\r\nthe use and development statistical methods and software related to\r\nthe R system.  This proposal is for funding exclusively to provide\r\nsupport to assist with travel expenses for junior investigators from\r\nUS institutions to attend this meeting. Work of young researchers is\r\noften among the most novel, yet often these researchers lack the\r\ntravel funds necessary to attend such a conference because they have\r\nnot yet established themselves sufficiently to attract external travel\r\nand other funding for their work.\r\n\r\nStatistics is playing an increasingly important role in\r\ninterdisciplinary research, and statistical computing is essential as\r\nthe means for making new methodology available to researchers and\r\nallowing the best statistical practices to be applied effectively.\r\nScholarly conferences on statistical computing are an essential\r\nframework for the exchange of ideas and for encouraging the\r\nexploration of new directions in the design of statistical software.\r\nInternational conferences are particularly valuable as they allow the\r\nexchange of ideas among researchers from around the world who would\r\nnot ordinarily come into direct contact.  The benefit to young\r\nresearchers of a first exposure to the international research\r\ncommunity is particularly important.  International meetings also\r\nprovide an opportunity to meet with outstanding international graduate\r\nstudents and encourage them to consider opportunities for further\r\nstudy in the United States.\r\n",
