 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\" \r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to develop solid-state devices\r\nfor achieving controlled and efficient coupling between single photons and\r\nsingle electrons confined in microstructures.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe intellectual merit is the ability to efficiently transfer information\r\nbetween the quantum state of an electron spin and the polarization state\r\nof a photon. This allows for unprecedented studies of electron spin\r\ndynamics using quantum optical measurements. The research team has the\r\nrequired material-growth, device-fabrication, and quantum-optics skills\r\nand resources to perform this challenging project.  To complement the\r\nresearch, the team will collaborate with the Allosphere, which is a\r\nvirtual reality research center at UCSB, and with local high schools (with\r\na predominantly Hispanic student population) to provide high-school\r\nstudents with an unforgettable science experience.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe broader impacts of this effort are the direct relevance to the micro\r\noptoelectronics industry (the research is based on cutting-edge\r\ntechnologies and materials from that industry), the importance for\r\nfundamental studies in confined electron and hole properties in\r\nsemiconductor, and the outstanding training of PhD students in Engineering\r\nand Physics.  Furthermore the ability to establish a one-to-one relation\r\nbetween an electron, the ultimate representation of a locally stored bit\r\nof information, and a photon, the ultimate representation of a flying\r\nbit of information, would potentially have a tremendous impact on\r\nultra-low-energy consuming classical and quantum communication and\r\ncomputation systems. Finally, high-school students will be inspired to\r\nfollow a career in science.",
