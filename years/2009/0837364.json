 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a set of computer based learning modules for use in introductory circuits courses in electrical and computer engineering curricula.   Each module leads the student through four learning phases for a particular concept.   The first phase is a tutoring phase in which the student is given basic ideas and information.   The second phase is a quizzing phase in which the student is quizzed on the ideas and information presented in the first phase and given immediate feedback on their performance.   The third phase presents the student with a design problem in which they need to use the ideas and information provided.    The final phase provides the students with concrete practical examples of the use of the concept in real world applications.  The learning modules are being developed and deployed at a four-year institution and a community college.  The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator.  The projects results are being disseminated through conference and journal publications and through a training workshop.",
