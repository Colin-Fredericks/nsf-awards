 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to utilize the self-assembly and metal-binding properties of a biological nanostructure, the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), in the development of novel functional materials and fabrication processes for small-scale energy microsystems applications. The TMV is a high aspect ratio cylindrical plant virus that can be genetically engineered to include amino acids with enhanced metal-binding properties. These genetic modifications facilitate electroless plating of the molecules as well as self-assembly onto various substrates. Particular emphasis will be placed on integrating the TMV biofabrication into standard micromachining through the combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches such as DNA-directed patterning, molecular self-assembly, photolithography and thin-film deposition.  The developed processes will be readily incorporated in the fabrication of nanostructured small-scale energy storage devices. \r\n\r\nThe outcome of this proposal will result in the realization of novel strategies for nanomanufacturing that alleviate several limitations currently involved in the integration of nanostructures into microsystems fabrication. The envisioned results are not limited only in the field of energy, but can be used by researchers to develop other types of devices where nanomaterials can mark a significant improvement, such as sensors with high selectivity and sensitivity and miniaturized heat dissipation components that can be integrated with commercial electronic products. The wide range of scientific matters involved in this investigation provides an ideal interdisciplinary \"training matrix\" for students from diverse backgrounds interested in research and education careers by bringing together aspects of science and engineering previously distinct from one another.\r\n",
