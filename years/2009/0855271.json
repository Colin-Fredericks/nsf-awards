 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FrameNet project has been building a lexical database containing\r\nhighly detailed information about the syntax and semantics of the\r\ndifferent senses of English words, with applications such as question\r\nanswering and information extraction.  The database is based on\r\nCharles Fillmore's theory of Frame Semantics, relating word meanings\r\nto conceptualizations of situations and their participants, ranging\r\nfrom simple actions like Placing to complex events such as a Criminal\r\nprocess, with subevents like Arraignment and Trial. The\r\ngeneralizations are derived from annotated example sentences from\r\nlarge text corpora.\r\n\r\nIn this planning grant, input will be gathered from researchers in the\r\nNLP field regarding how the FrameNet data is currently being used, how\r\nit can be made more useful to a wider range of users, and how it can\r\nbe enhanced so as to enable new directions of research.  As part of\r\nthis, a series of conferences will be held, both face-to-face and by\r\nvideoconference, to plan future FrameNet development and cooperation\r\nand alignment of data with other lexical resources and annotation\r\nprojects, such as WordNet, PropBank, OntoNotes, etc., with the\r\nultimate goal of improving results in sense disambiguation, semantic\r\nrole recognition, and natural language understanding in general.\r\n",
