The primary research tasks of this project are (1) to investigate the mechanical properties of stand alone carbon nanotube macro-films; (2) to identify interfacial strength between carbon nanotube macro-films and substrates; and (3) to achieve deformability of carbon nanotube macro-films in integrated systems. A multiscale approach will be employed to capture the intrinsic multiscale nature of carbon nanotube macro-films, namely macroscopic features with nanoscale details, such as morphologies of inter-bundle junctions. A buckling method that involves buckled thin films on compliant substrates will be used to measure the interfacial strength, and to enable fully deformable carbon nanotube macro-films without sacrificing their electrical properties upon deformation. The deformable energy storage devices made from buckled carbon nanotube macro-films and solid electrolyte will be fabricated as a testing platform to examine the mechanical performance of the integrated system.\r\nThe combined experimental and theoretical studies will carry significant potential in the development of a design guideline for the assembly of macroscopic carbon nanotube networks with desired mechanics properties that can significantly impact nanoscience and nanoengineering fields. Integrated research and education will focus on increasing enrollment and retention of underrepresented students and engaging the public through unique outreach programs in partnership with the Arizona Science Center, and Phoenix Elementary School District. A new senior/graduate level course will be developed based on this research.\r\n\r\n",
