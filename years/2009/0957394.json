 "awd_abstract_narration": "IntelliDrive(SM) is a major U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT)\r\ninitiative of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), aimed at building a\r\nfully connected surface transportation environment via advanced communication\r\nand information technologies.  The grand vision is \"to provide transformational\r\nsafety, mobility, and environmental improvements in surface transportation\".\r\n\r\nThe IntelliDrive initiative envisions a networked environment among\r\nvehicles (V2V), between vehicles and infrastructure components (V2I) \r\nor among vehicles, infrastructure, and wireless hand-held Devices \r\n(e.g., cell phones and PDAs) (V2D) that enables numerous safety \r\nand mobility improvement applications.  For example,\r\nin a V2V environment, if the vehicle in front has a malfunctioning\r\nbrake light, the following drivers or travelers will be notified \r\nin real-time and take precautionary actions (e.g., slow down or \r\nchange lanes); or if roadside sensors detect a patch of ice on the road\r\nat milepost 305, drivers will be notified immediately through V2I or\r\nV2D about the situation in terms what, where, and the degree of \r\nseverity, etc.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to improving mobility,\r\nIntelliDrive provides real-time traveler information concerning\r\ntraffic conditions, accidents, transit vehicle on-time performance, \r\nparking availability, ride share opportunities, etc.\r\nThus travelers will be able to make informed decisions about their\r\ntravel so to improve the individual and consequently the overall \r\nsystem efficiency and mobility.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this proposal is to develop the framework of a\r\nDatabase Management System (DBMS) in support of IntelliDrive applications. \r\nThis means, among others, a set of services that will answer the questions:\r\nWhat data is relevant to answer the query? In what nodes does this \r\ndata reside? How to access the data on these nodes?\r\n\r\nFor further information please see the project web site:\r\nwww.cs.uic.edu/~wolfson/html/IntelliDrive\r\n\r\n",
