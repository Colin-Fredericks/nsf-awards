 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC) at the University of Pennsylvania, the Nano/Bio Interface Center (NBIC), designs and controls molecular functionality, quantifies behavior of individual molecules and interactions at organic/inorganic interfaces to establish the foundation for understanding the interface of physical and biological systems.  The NSEC unites investigators from five schools (the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Medicine, the School of Arts and Sciences, Wharton Business School, and the Graduate School of Education) to provide, not only new directions for the life sciences but also for engineering, in a two-way flow essential to fully realizing the benefits of the intersection of biology with nanotechnology.  A comprehensive program uses fundamental research enterprises as a platform for curriculum development, pre-college educational programs, out reach to the community, and commercialization.\r\n\r\nTwo multi disciplinary research teams are focused on: optoelectronic function in synthetic biomolecules and mechanical motion of molecules from physiological systems.  In each area physical interfaces probe, control, or influence the outcome.  A cross-cutting initiative brings together investigators who develop nanoscale measurement tools to produce the next wave of innovation in probes of molecular function and enables research in both teams. To enable these advances the NBIC has established the Nano/Bio Probe Facility.   The Nano/Bio Probe Innovation Facility assembles a comprehensive set of enabling research tools to support research interactions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to sustain. The Facility is unique to Penn, where the newest advances in probing single molecule and nanostructure behavior are made available to the research community.   The facility opened in 2005 and now has over 80 users.   \r\n\r\nThe NBIC established and leads a large portfolio of educational programs.   An undergraduate minor in Nanotechnology now serves 70 students from 3 schools and with representation from all engineering departments.  The graduate certificate in Nanotechnology has an enrolment of 20 students.  An annual summer high school academy offers a residential program on Nanotechnology that obtains enrollment of ~25 students/year.  A strong theme of NBIC outreach addresses professional development of pre-college teachers in the Philadelphia region.  A highlight is the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program that is a collaboration with Drexel University.  A partnership with Alabama State University has established programs to impact the pipeline of future scientists and engineers.  A variety of community outreach activities are highlighted at the annual NanoDay@Penn.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Nano/Bio Interface Center at the University of Pennsylvania designs and controls molecular interactions to yield new functionality, enabled by interfaces with inorganic materials.  This control yields new classes of hybrid structures for chemical sensing, optoelectronic devices and energy harvesting; and provides new windows into biological processes relevant to human physiology.  The single molecule approach results in new discoveries as well as new tools for probing nanoscale phenomena \n\nNBIC research activities are organized to maximize cross-fertilization and drive a coherent approach to the Center\u00c6s overall goals.  Two multidisciplinary research teams are focused on the fundamental scientific issues; a cross cutting initiative develops ideas integral to all projects.  The fundamental themes are: optoelectronic function in synthetic biomolecules and mechanical motion of molecules from physiological systems.  Physical interfaces are used to probe, control, or influence the outcome.  Each theme has a strong fundamental component and technological impact ranging from nanoelectronics to medical diagnostics.\n\nThe NBIC unites five schools (School of Engineering and Applied Science, School of Medicine, School of Arts and Sciences, Wharton, and the Graduate School of Education) to provide new directions for the life sciences and for engineering, in a two-way flow to fully realize the benefits of the intersection of biology with nanotechnology.

Nearly 60 of these appeared in high impact journals such as Science, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy, Nano Letters, etc.  These accomplishments include the following examples.\n\nA new family of optically active nanostructures was synthesized by design and control of peptide platforms.  Hybrid structures of functional organic molecules linked to inorganic nanoparticles revealed a new photoconduction mechanism: Plasmon induced molecular conduction.  Novel inorganic/organic constructs based on quantum dots, nanotubes and graphene demonstrated sensor function. \n\nBy combining microfluidic platforms, surface functionalization, and single molecule detection, the details of protein motion were determined, both for isolated molecules and in crowded environments more typical of cells.  The biomechanics of fibrils within cells was quantified.  Statistical mechanics models of biomolecular motion related experimental measurements to mechanism.\n\nResearchers at NBIC advanced the frontiers of single molecule probes.  3-D single molecule tracking with total internal reflectance was developed.  The spatially localized complex dielectric function of a single molecule layer was quantified with a new scanning probe technique.  A theory for sub wavelength optical tomography was developed.  The first simultaneous near field and force images of single biomolecules demonstrated on a ribosome. Microfabrication was exploited to design a variety of platforms for in situ electron microscopy, including a \u00e6nanoaquarium\u00c6 where assembly of nanoparticles was characterized and the \u00e6nanoprobe\u00c6, an electronic device used to elucidate the atomistic mechanism of electromigration.\n\nNBIC activities facilitate a multidisciplinary approach to education.
