 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this award is to measure and model the forces and nanoscale structure-function relationship of a recently discovered collagen gene within the ultra-colony forming marine cyanobacteria, Trichodesmium erythraeum. Over the course of this three-year project the investigators and their students will test the hypothesis that the expression of the collagen gene found in serves a unique mechanical role in maintaining colony integrity in this photosynthetic, nitrogen-fixing neurotoxin-producing organism. The hypothesis will be tested with static and dynamic cell culture, protein isolation and purification, a collagen gene knock-out model, atomic force microscopy imaging, and transmission electron microscopy of fibrillogenesis experiments. \r\n\r\nIf we are able to establish the hypothesized mechanical role that collagen serves in this organism, we will not only gain valuable insights into the nanoscale mechanics of cell colonies, but also into cyanobacteria ecology. The presence of this collagen within T erythraeum may represent an interdomain gene transfer event that occurred during the Devonian or Silurian period from a multicellular organism such as a vertebrate (Layton et al., 2008 J Molecular Evolution 66 539-554), into an ancestor of modern marine bacteria, endowing a prokaryote with the ability to gain access to additional food sources via neurotoxin concentration and gill-clogging mechanisms. The specific collagen gene found in this organism also has potential applications for the tissue engineering, such as an alternative to Matrigel, programmed collagen expression, or accelerated wound healing. Outreach to the local K12 community through a 2-week NSF-RET-style teachers program to be held during the summer quarter at Drexel University will give teachers from local high schools with the greatest need, enhanced access to the important recent scientific discoveries in cell and protein mechanics, evolution and nanotechnology.",
