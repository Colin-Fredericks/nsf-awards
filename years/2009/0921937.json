 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Judith M. S. Pine, of Western Washington University, will undertake research on the use and impact of internationally available media in minority languages to create a common identity for minority communities that reside in different nation states and practice different religions. The research will be conducted among people who call themselves Lahu, and who speak various dialects of this Tibeto-Burman language. Lahu speakers live in rural agricultural villages, small cities and metropolises throughout Southeast Asia and southwest China.  But Lahu people today also use a wide variety of shared media, including cassette tapes, CDs and VCDs, newsletters and books, radio programs and the Internet. \r\n\r\nThe researcher will investigate whether Lahu-language media create a common sense of Lahu-ness that cross-cuts their diverse, distinct relationships with particular nation-states and religions. The researcher and her field team will interview and record Lahu-speaking media producers and media consumers in both Thailand and China.  The primary methodology to be employed is a painstaking sociolinguistic technique called frame analysis, which will be used to analyze both the media and the researchers' field recordings of native speakers discussing Lahu language media.\r\n\r\nThis research will enhance social scientific understanding of how minority populations who live in different countries but speak a common language may transcend geographic, political, and ideological boundaries through the use of modern media. This knowledge will have practical application, especially for those who are designing public health or public education programs targeting stateless or indigenous populations.",

Lahu is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by an estimated 800,000 people.  The majority of Lahu speakers live in China, with significant populations in Thailand and Myanmar and smaller groups in Vietnam, Laos, Australia and the U.S.\n\n Impact.  \n\nAlthough formal channels for circulation of Lahu language media are limited, the project discovered that media in the form of music, music videos and feature films, was being produced and distributed throughout the region through an array of informal channels.  These media products are being distributed and consumed by Lahu speakers from diverse sub-groups.   The popularity of this media and its widespread and diverse distribution support the claim that this media is able to compete with the professionally produced and widely distributed media in dominant languages.  Exploration of this media has thus far also supported the hypothesis that this media gains its importance from something other than a shared political identity. \n\nInterview and participant observation data indicate that Lahu speakers from various political backgrounds share an enjoyment of Lahu language media.  Preliminary analysis of songs and videos on the topic of Lahu identity indicate that Lahu song writers and media producers operate with the understanding that Lahu identity and language is worthy of preservation, and that Lahu speakers should promote and support Lahu identity.  There is, however, no sense in these media that such an identity would require a shared political entity such as a Lahu state or nation. As a result of Lahu Media Project research, we are now aware of a widespread network of media circulation which crosses borders, linking individuals and communities who share linguistic and cultural identity.   The mechanisms through which Lahu language media is able to connect Lahu speakers, creating a shared cultural identity but not a shared political identity, may be a product of the nature of traditional Lahu political practice. \n\nOngoing analysis of the data collected through the project, as well as data collected in the future, will have two foci: semiotic analysis and the impact of growing access to digital media through the Internet, especially the capacity for individuals living in rural areas and in relative poverty  to consume, circulate and even produce media.

That article has been reviewed and revised and is pending final acceptance.  A paper exploring the use of YouTube as a platform for Lahu language media was presented at the International Conference for International Relations and Development (ICIRD) in Bangkok in August 2013.\n\nThis project has benefited education in the U.S. and abroad in a number of ways.  Material from the project has been integrated into class and other presentations made by the PI.   The grant included an Undergraduate Research Assistant position, and three undergraduate students held this position, receiving hands-on training in digital data management and analysis.
