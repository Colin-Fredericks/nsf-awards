The constructed WSN will consist of a long-lived, real-time reliable network with remote control capability. Based on engineer portable, low-energy sensor nodes that can provide sensed data, the resulting system (W-ULIMS) addresses fundamental constraints faced by WSNs deployed in outdoor harsh environments, including energy supply, limited memory, the need for unattended operation for a long period of time, and the lossy and transient behavior of WSN communication. The project presents the following activities:\r\n-\tRandomized scheduling with a connectivity guarantee,\r\n-\tExtremely low duty-cycle data forwarding, and\r\n-\tRemote control (using the idea of Trickle).\r\nThe randomized scheduling with connectivity guarantee and extremely low-duty cycle data forwarding protocols under study are expected to collect sensor data in an energy efficient manner. The testbed provides an infrastructure to study practical estimation, data collection and dissemination, and energy conservation faced by WSNs in harsh environments.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project applies new technologies to traditional agricultural environments and other applications while advancing the complex behaviors of WSNs. It should contribute to alleviate the significant water shortage problem facing many cities by providing cost-savings through efficient usage of agricultural labor and timely notification of situations requiring managerial decisions. Furthermore, it establishes an environment to broaden student?s knowledge and research experience.\r\n",
