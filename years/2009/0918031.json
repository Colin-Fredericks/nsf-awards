 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\r\n\r\n\tThe long-range objective of this project is to understand the external and intramuscular signals and signal-transduction networks that regulate protein degradation in muscle. This project focuses on understanding the basic architecture and behavior of a complex signaling network to provide a closer understanding of how complex networks of signals and signal-transduction pathways are coordinated to regulate protein stability in the target tissue. It will establish the identities of the components of the signal-transduction pathways and determine whether the amount and/or the activity of each component is regulated, in order to map the interplay among components. This project emphasizes the identification of feedback loops, which are crucial to network behavior. This information (which has not yet been worked out at this level of detail for muscle cells) is indispensable for computational modeling of network dynamics. Previous studies have made it clear that protein degradation in muscle responds to multiple signals and is mediated by multiple proteolytic mechanisms, and that the state of protein breakdown is determined by the balance among opposing signals rather than the intensity of a single signal. These convergent signals are apparently integrated by control of the phosphorylation state of the Raf kinase molecule. This protein can be phosphorylated at multiple specific site(s) and the output of Raf is thus determined combinatorially. An important consequence of this mechanism is that the phosphatases that act on specific sites on Raf may act as positive or negative regulators of the \"signal integrator\". This project aims to elucidate how Raf acts as a \"signal integrator\" in the specific context of striated muscle, particularly in terms of the functions of protein phosphatases and of calcium signaling.\r\n\t \r\nBroader impacts:. Undergraduate researchers will be an integral part of the project team. One graduate student will be trained on the project. The senior scientific personnel will make strong efforts to incorporate aspects of C. elegans biology and neuromuscular biology in general into undergraduate courses they teach (Honors courses in Genetics, Introductory Biology) and into other undergraduate courses (Developmental Biology, Cell Biology). Modules using C. elegans as a model for insulin signaling and lipid metabolism are incorporated into workshops for high-school teachers and a module using C. elegans for inquiry-based learning of basic genetics concepts will be delivered in K-12 school visits through an NIH-supported Science Education Partnership Award.",
