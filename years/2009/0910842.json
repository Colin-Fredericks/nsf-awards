 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nTechnology infrastructure in the healthcare realm requires secure and effective systems to meet two of its most significant challenges of the 21st century: improving the quality of care and controlling costs. Yet developing, deploying and using information technology that is both secure and genuinely effective in the complex clinical, organizational and economic environment of healthcare is a significant challenge. This project's multidisciplinary approach will develop and analyze information-sharing technology that ensures security and privacy while meeting the pragmatic needs of patients, clinical staff, and healthcare organizations to deliver efficient, high-quality care. \r\n\r\nDartmouth's Trustworthy Information Systems for Healthcare (TISH) Program addresses fundamental challenges in current and emerging areas of information security in healthcare:\tprotecting the security of clinical information, while ensuring that clinicians can access information they need, when and where they need it, and securing the collection of sensor data through personal sensor devices (including both physiological and activity data) to enable monitoring of patient outcomes while giving patients usable control over their privacy.\r\n\r\nTo be effective, such technologies must consider the economic, organizational and sociological dynamics that are critical to creating and implementing IT that is secure as well as usable and effective. Thus, the researchers will consider: usability, and its implications for secure information sharing throughout the organizational environment of medical care; privacy concerns, examining how key stakeholders (patients, clinicians, and other providers) understand and evaluate the trade-offs between information sharing, usability, security, and privacy: economic risks, identifying the economically motivated threats to security and privacy in healthcare information systems and the incentives for adopting security technology; and security challenges related to collection, processing, and medical use of data from sensors worn by outpatients\r\n\r\nThis research will result scientific advances in several fields. The team will develop new secure and efficient protocols that allow remote health monitoring through a mobile phone and wearable wireless medical sensors; design new machine-learning methods, especially active-learning and relational-learning techniques for analyzing and summarizing sensor data in a user-friendly manner; seek a deeper understanding of the economics of information security in healthcare; and explore how patients and clinicians trade off usability, security, and privacy.\r\n \r\nTISH, a collaborative project of the Institute for Security, Technology, and Society at Dartmouth College, involves a team from Computer Science, Sociology, the Dartmouth Medical School, and the Tuck School of Business. Its researchers include computer scientists with expertise in computer security and sensor networks, sociologists with expertise in healthcare organizations and health policy, a clinician with medical informatics expertise, and a business professor with expertise in the economics of information security.  The TISH team will work in collaboration with local hospitals and health systems in the Upper Valley region of Vermont and New Hampshire.",
