This project performs the tasks for the next GEM Communications Coordinator starting from 2009, following the guidelines described in the GEM bylaws. The tasks fall into the following four categories: (a) the electronic newsletter GEM Messenger, (b) the annual GEMstone reports (including special reports), (c) the GEM website GemWiki, and (d) the GEM Data Catalog. \r\n\r\nGEM workshops have been considered by many of their participants as the best environment for discussing magnetospheric research and exchanging ideas. This project ensures the efficient communications and comprehensive archiving that GEM needs to continue its vital role in the magnetospheric community.  The project provides the archives of GEM activities that are accessible by the scientists and students today and in the future. The project also builds a GEM Data Catalog for GEM students and the general public to know where to access and learn about space weather data products.",
