 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project is devoted to the study of relatively hyperbolic\r\ngroups and their applications in  low--dimensional\r\ntopology. It consists of three main parts. First part deals with\r\nsmall cancellation theory over relatively hyperbolic groups.\r\nNamely we intend to use methods elaborated by the PI to construct\r\nnew groups with 'exotic' properties that solve some long--standing\r\nproblems in the classical theory of groups. The second part is\r\nmotivated by the Virtual Haken Conjecture and is based on a\r\ngeneralization of Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theory in the\r\ncontext of relatively hyperbolic groups. The third part concerns\r\nnew results about group embeddings. The ultimate goal here is to\r\nobtain a relatively hyperbolic version of the Higman embedding\r\ntheorem. Our approach to these problems is based on a new methods\r\nrelated to asymptotic and combinatorial analysis of van Kampen\r\ndiagrams.\r\n\r\nThe notion of a relatively hyperbolic group was first proposed by\r\nGromov in 1987 to generalize many examples of algebraic and\r\ngeometric nature. Since then the theory has been elaborated from\r\ndifferent points of views and now it is one of the most prominent\r\nparts of the group theory. The class of relatively hyperbolic\r\ngroups encompasses many examples of interest such as fundamental\r\ngroups of finite volume hyperbolic manifolds, geometrically finite\r\nconvergence groups, mapping class groups, fully residually free\r\ngroups, etc. Rather than just generalizing the theory of\r\nhyperbolic groups to the relative case, this project is aimed at\r\nthe study of new and sometimes unexpected phenomena which are\r\ninvisible in the context of ordinary hyperbolicity. The close\r\ninteraction between the theory of relatively hyperbolic groups and\r\ngeometry, low-dimensional topology, the theory of dynamical\r\nsystems, provides a rich source of problems and motivations for\r\nour project.\r\n",
