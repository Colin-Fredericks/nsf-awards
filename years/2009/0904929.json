 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project focuses on the development of a fundamental understanding of strain reduction mechanisms in overgrown gallium nitride (GaN) layers on silicon. The central idea is to use ion implantation through an AlN buffer layer to create a highly defective layer in silicon substrate, in the vicinity of the interface between the AlN buffer and silicon substrate. Reduction in strain due to the formation of the defected layer is expected to greatly reduce GaN film fracturing as well as the formation of threading dislocation defects. Preliminary results suggest that a large reduction in strain in GaN is possible using this approach. However, the fundamental mechanism responsible for such improvements is not yet understood. In this project, various ex-situ and in-situ materials characterization techniques will be used for the formulation of an understanding of the relationship between ion implantation conditions and the morphology and thickness of the epitaxially grown AlN buffer layer as well as the type and density of dislocations and film fracturing observed in the overgrown GaN layer.\r\nNon-technical: This project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The success of the project would help to the development of high performance optoelectronic devices on large area dislocation reduced III-nitrides on Si(111) and Si(100) substrates. The project cultivate a sense of leadership in graduate students while offering undergraduate students an opportunity to learn scientific research and problem-solving skills via mentoring from graduate students and faculty in a collaborative environment. The project involves faculty and students at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering of the University at Albany - State University of New York and at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. In addition, a public outreach program, Science and Technology exhibit in the Mall, is expected to expose over 1000 families and their children to science and technology each year in a fun and informal environment.",
