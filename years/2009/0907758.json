 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Oey will investigate the population of massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by examining stars in the general field, rather than the more commonly studied star clusters.  She will use the multi-object spectrograph at the 6.5-meter Magellan telescopes to take spectra of the 400 or so known stars in the OB class, which contains the hottest and most massive stars.  The motion of the stars towards or away from the observer can be measured directly from the spectra; their temperature and mass can be estimated by comparison with models.  She will then estimate how many stars were formed at each mass (the field star initial mass function).  She will examine whether the high-mass stars now in the general field might have been born in star clusters, exploring the distribution of radial velocities to constrain the numbers of both runaway stars and binary stars, and estimating the time required for a star cluster to dissolve into the field.\r\n\r\nBoth undergraduate and graduate students will be trained through their involvement in the research.  Dr Oey will lead a number of outreach programs at the University of Michigan, including a Theme Semester for the International Year of Astronomy in 2009.  She will partner with the historic Detroit Observatory on campus, to update exhibits, provide scientific training for the docents, and collaborate with a science historian to document the Observatory's historic role.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLike beach pebbles, stars range in mass with low masses being far more common.  We therefore expect that when stars form, the rare, high-mass stars should always have many low-mass companions.  However, up to 25% of massive stars are apparently isolated \"field\" stars.  What is the nature of these high-mass field stars?  How many are \"runaway\" stars ejected from clusters, and do any of them form essentially in isolation?  If so, this is highly counterintuitive, and requires modification of star formation theories.\n\nWe carried out a complete, spectroscopic survey of all the field massive stars in our nearby companion galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).  We found a sharp drop in frequency for the highest-mass stars, implying that such stars are almost always found only in clusters.  We also find that around half of the targets do have tiny clusters of companion stars, implying that massive stars can indeed form as field stars, under far more isolated conditions than normally encountered.  Nor does this rule out the possibility that some can actually form in complete isolation.  Fourteen objects are especially interesting, and are centered within dense nebular gas, again strongly implying that they formed in place.  These are among the best candidates for isolated massive star formation.  Another critical test of star formation theories is the frequency of binary stars.  We monitored 8% of our sample and found that at least 60% are binaries.  This would be highly unusual for a sample of only runaways.  Thus, our evidence strongly suggests that most field massive stars form in place, and a minority are runaway stars.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that about 1/3 to 1/2 of the field stars are the \"tip of the iceberg\" on tiny clusters, about 1/3 are runaway stars, and 1/6 to 1/3 are stars that formed in extreme isolation.  We suggest that tiny star clusters are commonplace, but the largest stars cannot form in the tiniest clusters.  This realization led us to propose a new theory for understanding the mass distribution of high-mass stars that neatly explains this persistent relation.\n\nAbout half of the field stars turned out to be classical Oe/Be stars, which show evidence of circumstellar decretion disks.  These are produced by stars that are spinning near their break-up velocities.  A better understanding of these enigmatic objects will clarify their role in stellar evolution.  Our large sample of ~30 Oe stars greatly clarifies the properties of these objects.  We identify the earliest Oe stars known to date, clearly demonstrating that the most massive stars are fully capable of forming decretion disks.  Our much higher frequency of Oe stars in the SMC compared to the Milky Way confirms the role of low metallicity in enhancing fast rotation by suppressing angular momentum loss through stellar winds.  We also find that helium line emission is a normal feature in the hottest Oe stars.  One star is especially interesting, and provides observational confirmation of theories predicting that fast rotation produces hotter stars.\n\nAnother unusual and enigmatic spectral class are the B[e] supergiants.  Three of our field massive stars turn out to be members of this class, but they only show weak symptoms of this phenomenon.  These are normally stars with dusty disks, but our objects show no evidence of dust.  Their disks are more similar to those of classical Oe/Be stars, but with the signatures of denser, cooler gas characteristic of B[e] stars.  We therefore suggest that our objects may be a new subclass of transition objects with properties intermediate between ordinary stars and normal B[e] supergiants.\n\nThis project supported the Ph.D. thesis of a student who is now on the faculty at a community college, and another who is still working on his studies.  Several undergraduate students were also involved, providing the opportunity for four of them to co-author a refereed paper.  One was first author on a refereed paper correspondi..."
