 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU program in Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Arkansas seeks to motivate a diverse group of students to pursue careers in scientific research.  Within our 8-state region, undergraduate students will be selected from academic institutions with limited research opportunities.  A key facet of this development will be the opportunity given each participant to present their research at a meeting within the department, and to write up a summary of their work in a journal format that will be compiled for distribution to their home institution. The participants will visit local chemistry and nanotechnology start-up companies and a national laboratory (National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR).  The participants will be provided an experience which will not only enable them to obtain a realistic view of modern chemical research, but they will be exposed to an environment indicative of that to be expected in graduate school.  The broadest impact of this program will be the preparation of scientists for global competition in science and innovation.  The majority of the University of Arkansas REU participants over the years have continued their studies post baccalaureate in chemistry or biochemistry, and these individuals have now assumed positions of responsibility in the technical infrastructure of the chemical industry, as faculty at 4-year and Ph.D.-granting academic institutions, and as technical staff at a variety of Federal Laboratories and Agencies. \r\n\r\n",

The overall goal for the REU program was to encourage undergraduate students to choose careers in basic science, therefore providing a significant improvement in the available personnel for technological infrastructure in the United States.  This site, conducted under the auspices of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, has involved a total of 154 students over the 3 years, 24 of whom have been directly supported by the NSF-REU award.  The remaining 130 participants were supported by funds obtained from other funding agencies (e.g. NASA, NIH, HHMI), NSF supplements, and funds obtained from the University.\nMost participants did not have previous research experience prior to their participation in the program. Further, many participants came from groups traditionally underrepresented in science.  During this granting period significant improvements in minority recruiting strategies were made.  Minority participation grew each year of the program: 13% in 2009, 25% in 2010, and 63% in 2011.  The post-program survey, cumulative statistics for the past three years of the NSF REU support, showed that 10% intended to go to medical, dental, veterinary or pharmacy school; 71% intended to continue their chemical education in graduate school; 5% intend to become science teachers, and 12% were undecided.  The 71% of students intending to continue to graduate school clearly reflects a growth in numbers of students aspiring to graduate school over the previous three years (2005-2008) (56%).\nIn this program, capable students from smaller undergraduate institutions that have no opportunities for research were exposed to a research experience over a summer at the University of Arkansas.  The students were asked to spend 40 hours a week in the scientific laboratory developing their laboratory skills and learning about their research projects via reading the primary literature from major scientific journals.  The students were required to meet every Friday for one hour.  In the first half of a given meeting students were exposed to various aspects of modern chemical research.  This exposure occurred through brief lectures given by departmental faculty.  The second half of the meeting was logistical in nature and was used to evaluate the students\u00c6 progress through the program, as well as the effectiveness of the program.  One meeting was devoted to our graduate recruiter discussing application procedures, finding a research program based on the student\u00c6s passion for the science and not on stipend amount, and other aspects of graduate school.  In a second weekly meeting, all REUs on campus met together, approximately 80 students.  In these meetings a guest speaker spoke; topics including how to study for the GRE; how small businesses develop from academic research; scientific ethics; communication skills, and sources of funding for graduate school.  Students also visited the research laboratories of the National Center for Toxicological Research in Jefferson, AR.  Most of the students had never visited a national lab before.  These visits were exceptionally stimulating for the students; they had opportunities to see applications of the chemical principles they learned in class and to observe major directions of research supervised by scientists with advanced degrees.  With the help of their faculty mentors, students were asked to present their research findings orally, and produce a written report.  Six peer-reviewed-articles have been published with these student authors.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David W Paul"
