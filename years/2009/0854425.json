The activity profiles and product distributions for well-defined model catalysts will be correlated with sites of well-defined geometrical and electronic structure. Ultimately, knowledge of active site structures will facilitate the re-engineering of these catalysts by allowing the selection of combinations of sites to generate a desired product distribution, for example, polymer molecular weight and branch content. Furthermore, elucidation of catalyst activation mechanisms will indicate strategies to make the activation more efficient.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe goal of this project is to solve a longstanding and complex problem in a very successful class of industrial catalysts. Phillips catalysts for olefin polymerization (CrOx/SiO2) were discovered half a century ago, and their remarkable ability to self-activate in the presence of olefin has been the subject of much speculation ever since. Until the nature of the active sites is known, it is unlikely that we will be able to determine how they are formed or why this catalyst is so effective at reviving deactivated sites. Related catalysts containing supported group 6 metal oxides of Mo and W are also self-activating, but they promote olefin metathesis rather than polymerization. The proposed approach to determining how self-activation occurs combines synthesis of individual, well-defined active site candidates with analysis of the multiple active sites present on the heterogeneous catalysts. Experimental approaches will be integrated with computational modeling of reaction mechanisms to identify key transition states. The PIs propose to probe initiation mechanisms and match activity profiles and product distributions of the component active sites in the heterogeneous systems with those of structurally well-defined sites.\r\n\r\nThe synthetic approach to active site investigation is complementary to the combinatorial approach to catalyst discovery. Once interesting catalyst formulations are identified and optimized by screening (parallel or otherwise), further improvements depend on the ability to manipulate active site structure. Identifying the structural features that control reactivity by synthesizing model compounds has long been a successful strategy in homogeneous catalysis. The extension of this strategy in heterogeneous catalysis can be accomplished by combining expertise in organometallic synthesis, surface science, kinetics/mechanistic analysis of complex systems and catalyst modeling and evaluation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nHeterogeneous polyolefin catalysts are multifunctional materials with the ability to oligomerize, polymerize, copolymerize, terminate and reactivate, creating polymer resins with desirable combinations of physical properties. In parallel, recent advances in the synthesis of single-site catalysts have led to polymers with very low polydispersities, as well as elegant mechanistic studies of polymerization mechanisms. The complexity of the heterogeneous catalysts is enabling in both its flexibility and its diversity, and therefore deserving of the same systematic investigation in order to fully realize its benefits.\r\n\r\nExecution of this project requires strong skills in both chemical engineering and chemistry. Graduate students will develop a deep understanding of both fields as members of an interdisciplinary research team. They will learn to appreciate and implement the strengths of each discipline's approach to problem-solving. Students will also experience the close connection between computational and experimental modeling of active sites. Technical success in this work provides a powerful justification for interdisciplinary training of catalysis researchers.",

The long-term goal of our work is to develop design strategies for more robust and efficient catalysts by creating materials that are capable of switching themselves on and off on-demand. We also aim to control their properties so as to make new types of polymers with unique and tunable properties.\n\nIn this project, we investigated the properties of the so-called Phillips\u00c6 catalyst: chromium dispersed on silica. The catalyst must be heated in air at a high temperature (400 &ndash; 900 &deg;C) before it becomes active for ethylene polymerization. We discovered that this thermal treatment controls the strain in the ring structures that link the chromium to the silica, and that this strain is strongly correlated with polymerization activity. We constructed models involving different size rings and mapped their properties onto precisely prepared catalysts with different activities. We also investigated the reactions of these active sites with the first few molecules of ethylene (before polymerization is well-established) and discovered that ethyl radicals are formed by electron and proton transfer between ethylene and chromium. The net result is adjustment of the chromium electronic structure and formation of the first bond between chromium and carbon. Once these necessary conditions are established, ethylene uptake and polymer formation proceed very rapidly.\n\nIn a parallel approach, we synthesized well-defined active sites by grafting molecular chromium complexes onto silica in order to compare their structural characteristics and polymerization properties with the proposed active sites of the Phillips catalyst. One site in particular, an organochromium(III) site, behaves similarly. Its polymerization behavior is indistinguishable from that of the Phillips catalyst, lending confidence to our hypothesis about the nature of the Phillips active site. Our computational studies also support this hypothesis and further suggest that a slightly different, organochromium(II) site is  responsible for early chain termination. The resulting short ethylene chains (oligomers), when incorporated into the polyethylene structure, account for the observed chain branching.\n\nFinally, we have used this insight to develop a new family of chromium-based catalysts based on modifying the surface of silica with electron-deficient boranes. These modified silicas activate molecular chromium complexes for polymerization. Their high reactivity towards ethylene is attributed to their low electron density. The borane-promoted silicas are expected to be useful in creating catalysts for other types of reactions where electron deficiency at the metal center is the key to reactivity, for example, in H2 activation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susannah L Scott"
