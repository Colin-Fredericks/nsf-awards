 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe objective of the research will be to advance the science and technology of visible LEDs fabricated from columnar nanostructures that emit at visible wavelengths and with high efficiencies.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Program\r\nA program of research is proposed to explore nanostructure visible light emitting diodes (LEDs). The objective of the research will be to advance the science and technology of visible LEDs fabricated from columnar nanostructures that emit at visible wavelengths and with high efficiencies. Single and multiple wavelength emission nanowire LEDs in the InGaN materials system will be investigated for eventual fabrication on low cost substrates. Modeling of the physical structures involving new heterojunction designs enabled by the nanoscale columnar geometry will be undertaken. Reduced strain and use of non-polar and semi-polar facets in such structures will improve efficiency compared to planar designs. Understanding carrier transport and recombination in the nanowires and mitigation of processes that limit the efficiency of nanowires are the goals. Nanopatterning will be used to control the emission wavelength through control of physical dimensions and material compositions.\r\n  \r\nBroader Impact of the Program\r\nTo the extent possible, the program will be carried out by under-represented minorities. Graduate students and two undergraduate assistants from the USC Merit research program will learn the inherent interdisciplinary nature of device research. The Center for Energy Nanoscience and Technology for which the PI is Director will be exploited to induce interest in LEDs and in energy conservation among young students (K - 12) and teachers. The results will be included in two courses on photonics at USC.",
