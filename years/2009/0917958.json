The key habit of mind being developed is abstracting from calculation. Modules deal with the transition from arithmetic to algebra, rational numbers, expressions/equations/word problems, graphs and equations, geometry of algebra, and proportional reasoning.  The target population is students in urban high poverty schools with a significant ELL sector.\r\n\r\nThe proposers' hypothesis is that instructional materials focused on developing conceptual understanding and mathematical habits of mind can complement traditional skill-focused algebra instruction in ways that are engaging to students.  Furthermore, they argue that using materials with such meta-cognitive aims will actually strengthen the learning of core algebraic concepts and skills.\r\n \r\nThe supplementary algebra modules are being developed by a form of design research.  Concurrent with development and field test of the student and teacher materials, the investigators are addressing four research questions.  The first two questions are focused on the effects of the intervention in developing student habits of mind and in improving their competence and confidence in algebra.  The other two address the feasibility of implementing the new approach to double-period algebra in a variety of school settings.  A small-scale quasi-experimental field test is being used to give preliminary estimates of the effectiveness of the instructional materials and the implementation guidelines.  The core purpose of these research activities is to inform development and refinement of the student and teacher instructional materials.\r\n\r\nProducts of this development effort will be a valuable resource to schools as they devise strategies for helping all students master the essentials of elementary algebra.",

(EDC) builds on research that shows that students&rsquo; success in algebra is critical, because that success opens doors to more advanced mathematics; is a predictor of eventual graduation; acts as a gateway to a bachelor&rsquo;s degree; and is linked to job readiness and higher earning once the student enters the workforce. Our project developed and tested a full-year algebra support course, <em>Transition to Algebra</em>, that is designed to be used concurrently with Algebra 1 to assure success in algebra for at-risk students. This course can be taught alongside any Algebra 1 curriculum, providing ease for schools in implementation. It allows flexibility in scheduling and teacher assignment, as it does not need to be offered consecutively with Algebra 1 or taught by the same teacher.</p>\n<p>Rather than re-teaching or pre-teaching content covered in Algebra 1, <em>Transition to Algebra</em> focuses on a small number of essential algebraic habits of mind (i.e., puzzling and persevering, seeking and using structure, describing repeated reasoning, using tools strategically, communicating with precision) and the ability to use such reasoning to make sense of mathematical work. These algebraic habits of mind are consistent with and well-aligned with the Standards for Mathematical Practice identified by the <em>Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</em>. Conventional algebra topics are part of the curriculum, but instead of the topics being the focus of the lesson, they become contexts for developing these key mathematical ways of thinking. <em>Transition to Algebra</em> uses algebraic logic puzzles and explorations to help students shift their ways of thinking from the concrete procedures of arithmetic to the abstract reasoning that success with algebra requires.</p>\n<p><em>Transition to Algebra</em><em> </em>builds the logic of algebra first, so students expect algebra to make sense; offers a satisfying level of cognitive challenge and a lively pace; and allows flexibility in individualizing problems to accommodate a range of prerequisite knowledge. It makes accessible topics like systems of equations, rational expressions (algebraic and numeric), negative exponents, and factoring, while also strengthening understanding and skill with number.</p>\n<p><em>Transition to Algebra</em> has several distinctive features that connect arithmetic pattern to algebraic structure, build an image of mathematics as making sense, develop metacognitive skills, and increase student efficacy.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Mental Mathematics </em>is a daily series of brief, lively, highly focused exercises to develop a &ldquo;common-sense feel&rdquo; for algebraic properties of operations, capacity to juggle multiple pieces of information simultaneously, and mastery and confidence in mental computation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Puzzles</em><em> </em>build students&rsquo; logic and increase problem-solving stamina.<strong><em> </em></strong>Puzzles put the business of figuring out where to start&mdash;a critical element in problem solving&mdash;in the foreground. We have designed puzzles whose <em>content</em> as well as nature is mathematical, helping students develop logical thinking and other cognitive capacities critical for mathematics learning while also practicing topical skills. Seven distinct puzzle types focus on algebraic, logical, and arithmetic ideas.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Explorations<strong> </strong></em>provide a second focus on sustained reasoning, qualitatively different from puzzles and more akin to modeling. Explorations are multi-step; they require a period of experimenting to generate &ldquo;data,&rdquo; playing with the situation until a pattern can be found and articulated.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Student Dialogues<strong> </strong></em>are used regularly to model mathematical discussion and develop academic and mathematical language. Students might read them aloud or even act them out.</p>\n<p>The <em>Transition to Algebra</em> materials were developed through iterative cycles of development and revision. First, the units were developed through initial rapid prototyping; then, they were tested in classrooms over a school year to strengthen the usability of the materials for teachers and students; and finally, a quasi-experimental field test investigated the promise of TTA in a small scale study. Throughout this process, the involvement of teachers and administrators was essential, informing us about the needs of underprepared 9th graders, the usability of the materials for students and teachers, and the supports needed for successful implementation.</p>\n<p>In 2014, EDC partnered with Heinemann to publish <em>Transition to Algebra</em> and disseminate the materials widely. Heinemann is working with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to distribute the materials to schools and districts across the country. Materials include<em> Teaching Guides</em> and <em>Student Worktexts</em> for each of 12 units, with a total of 80 lessons and 20 algebraic explorations; materials are provided in print versions and as PDFs for classroom display. The materials are now in use in schools around the country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The authors of <em>Transition to Algebra</em> also developed <em>Making Sense of Algebra,</em> a professional book that describes instructional practices that help build student competence and confidence in algebra. The book has chapters on the nature of algebraic habits of mind, mental mathematics (more than mental arithmetic), puzzling through problems and the relationship between puzzles and mathematics, a role for investigation in mathematics learning, visual approaches to algebra, and conducting mathematically useful dialogue in classrooms.
