This research  addresses some problems that have long resisted explanation such as an explanation of the Hofmeister series and the mechanism by which urea acts as a denaturant. Topic (b) focuses on molecular mechanisms of protein folding and enzyme reactions under applied force as experimentally studied in force microscopy (AFM).  \r\n  \r\nThe research has broad applicability in many scientific areas including chemistry, biology, nanoscience and engineering",
