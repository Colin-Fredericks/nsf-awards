This conference has been held annually since 1978, twice in 1982, and is considered to be a major meeting of its type for the real analysis community. Support will be provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for some senior researchers. \r\n\r\nThe program will feature three invited speakers and a number of contributed talks. The principal objective of this meeting is to introduce young mathematicians to the field, as well as to provide a forum for presentation of the current state of the art of the theory. The organizers intend to actively involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and mathematicians from other under-represented groups, to which much of the funding will be directed. Graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.",
