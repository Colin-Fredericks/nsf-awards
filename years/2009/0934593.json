 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this planning grant, steps are being taken to develop the framework for the Pipeline for Excellent Rural Teachers (PERT) program that will train and support both Teaching Fellows and Master Teaching Fellows. It is anticipated that the partnership that emerges through this planning grant will include several tribal high schools and colleges in the region. Due to the large geographic area for the anticipated partnership, Fellows will be supported by an online mentoring program that will be based on previous successful models for mentoring in rural communities. The planning activities are beginning with a needs assessment survey to determine the level of interest in the region for the program and the expected outcomes. A partnership with the North Dakota Association of Tribal Colleges is also being fostered during the planning period. The educational curriculum for professional development of Master teachers is being designed, drawing on existing courses and structures where appropriate and a current master's degree program is being restructured to accommodate the needs of the Teaching Fellows. Other planning activities include identification of sources of university cost share, development and field-testing of an online mentoring system, and development of a recruitment plan for the Fellows.",
