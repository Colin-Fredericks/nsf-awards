 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) will hold its General Assembly and the XXXVI International Congress of Physiological Sciences in Kyoto, Japan, July 27-August 1, 2009. In order to encourage the participation of US scientists and students in the Congress, the American Physiological Society (APS) will administer a travel grant program offering a limited number of travel awards to qualified scientists interested in attending the comparative physiology program at the IUPS Congress. Special emphasis will be given to investigators within 15 years of receiving their doctoral degree and to women and under-represented minority scientists. The participation of US scientists in the XXXVI IUPS is critical to the advancement of science in the United States. Scientific discovery is international in nature and the scientific community learns from investigators worldwide. The IUPS Congress brings together scientists from around the world to share ideas, exchange information and develop collaborations. By offering a travel award program, the APS expects to promote the widespread participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and under-represented minorities, in the Congress. The APS also expects to interest new investigators and students in pursuing research using comparative approaches to understand physiological processes and traits. This internationally recognized interdisciplinary group of investigators will explore the rapid changes that comparative physiology has undergone as a result of the incorporation of a variety of new tools and technologies into the discipline. Participation in the Congress will also provide opportunities for the development of collaborative interactions with scientists from the United States and those working outside of the United States.\r\n\r\n",
