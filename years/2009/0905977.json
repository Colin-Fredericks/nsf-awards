These three\r\ndirections include: (1) A uniform approach to a number of higher\r\nrank superrigidity phenomena. This approach, based on the notion\r\nof a generalized Weyl groups, should cover many known results,\r\nincluding the original Margulis' superrigidity, and its cocycle\r\nversion due to Zimmer, results for abstract products, new results\r\nfor groups acting on exotic affine buildings.  (2)\r\nMeasure-theoretic notion of imbedding between countable groups.\r\nThe project is to study the resulting equivalence classes of\r\nMeasurably Bi-Imbeddable groups, and the order between these\r\nclasses. The techniques include cocycle superrigidity results\r\nobtained in part (1).  (3) \"Moduli space\" of invariant metrics on\r\na Gromov-hyperbolic group taken up to bounded distortion.  The\r\nguiding and motivating source for such metrics are metrics lifted\r\nfrom Riemannian metrics of negative curvature on a fixed closed\r\nmanifold.\r\n\r\nThe project belongs to an area of research where Algebra,\r\nGeometry and Dynamics interact.  The common theme of the project\r\nis the study of intrinsic symmetries of certain structures which\r\nappear in Dynamics, Algebra and Geometry, and the impact that\r\nsuch intrinsic symmetries have on the studied objects.  The\r\nproposed problems suggest new points of view and possible\r\ngeneralizations to some important recent results in these areas.\r\n",
