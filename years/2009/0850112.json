 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Paschal-Science, Technology, and Mathematics (P-STM) Scholarship program improves the recruitment and retention of talented female students in the STEM fields by providing scholarships to four cohorts of at least 8 women who demonstrate both academic talent and financial need.  The P-STM project is building upon both the current CSEMS Paschal scholarship program and the college's current STEM recruiting efforts, providing approximately 96 scholarships over four years for 32 students to pursue degrees in one of the STEM disciplines. The intellectual merit is in (a) establishing Just-In-Time Mentoring activities, (b) establishing Math and Science Cafes, and (c) enhancing student awareness of STEM career options. The broader impact of the program is that, as a women's college, Meredith is uniquely situated for recruiting women into STEM fields as it is located near the Research Triangle Park and it offers many STEM activities for middle and high school girls on campus. The college's strong commitment to professional development for K-12 teachers contributes to P-STM scholars becoming mathematics and science teachers in elementary and secondary schools.",
