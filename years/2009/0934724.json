In addition to their scholarships, Noyce Scholars are receiving funds to attend a regional professional meeting and, upon certification, an opportunity to apply for mini-grants to provide resources to upgrade STEM programs at their new schools.  The scholars are being mentored by exemplary teachers from partnering schools both during their preparatory year at the University and during their early years as a teacher. \r\n\r\n",
