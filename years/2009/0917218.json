 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer systems are commonly coupled with human operators who add\r\nhands, eyes, and judgment to the computer programming and its sensors\r\nand actuators.  The operators can be viewed as programming platforms\r\nin their own right, where manuals, training, and system feedback\r\nprovide the programming.  However, operators have unique platform\r\ncharacteristics compared to computers, including, in particular, the\r\nlikelihood of making numerous and diverse errors. Hence systems that\r\nrely on operators require a protection envelope representing an\r\nengineered collection of system behaviors that prevent important types\r\nof operator errors from leading to losses.  Having a well chosen\r\nprotection envelope is crucial to the robustness of a system that\r\nrelies on human operators. This project formalizes operator task\r\nanalysis based on models, languages, and techniques created for the\r\nformal analysis of concurrent processes and use this formalization to\r\nspecify and automatically prove properties of the protection envelopes\r\nof systems that rely on human operators for their safe and secure\r\nexecution in specified environments.  The project uses concurrent game\r\nstructures to provide a technical foundation for reasoning about\r\nprotection envelopes specified using alternating-time temporal logic.\r\nProgress is validated with case studies for airport screening and\r\nveterinary tagging protocols.  Interest in this type of contribution\r\nwill extend beyond specialized areas like jet pilots and nuclear plant\r\noperators to roles like: customers in ecommerce transactions or\r\nautomated retail checkouts, drivers in automobiles with new types of\r\ncomputer control, managers of smart warehouses, factory floors, and\r\noffice buildings, and first responders in emergencies.",
