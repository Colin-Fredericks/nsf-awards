 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent introduction of empirical biological and genetic methods into political science necessitates the need for training the larger political science community in these new methods. However, despite large scale data collection efforts, and the numerous publications in politics and genetics, very few political scientists have been exposed to the specific methodologies needed to review, evaluate, or take part in this new area of research. For established faculty members interested in this growing area of political behavior there are few avenues to pursue training. The central goal of this project therefore is to offer training to political scientists in applied statistical genetics to be used on political behavior analyses. Training political scientists in new methods and theories that are unavailable in their training programs will improve future scholarship and expand knowledge about the relationship between genetics and political behavior. \r\n\r\nEvery year the Behavior Genetics Association hosts a workshop at the University of Colorado Boulder, aimed at training junior and advanced faculty, across disciplines, in introductory behavior genetics. This project would send 20, mostly mid career associate professors or experienced assistant professors, to the 2010 International Workshop on Methodology of Twin and Family Studies. The project will cover travel, lodging, and tuition for attendees, and a portion of the expenses for one extra faculty member of the workshop (to accommodate the overload). The long term impact of sending faculty to the workshop is that it will undoubtedly spawn new interest in these areas, create a long term interest in sending future students to BGA workshops, and generate more human capital in the area of genetics and political behavior.",
