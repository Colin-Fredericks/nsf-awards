 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to study the mechanics of ultrasonic assisted microforming, focusing on micro-extrusions and microtube hydroforming. Microforming is one of the miniaturization technologies with great potential for high production rates. There is great potential for miniature parts that cannot be microformed due to part complexity, low material formability, inhomogenuity, severe tribological conditions and other size effects, to be successfully produced by ultrasonic assisted microforming. In this research, the influence of ultrasonic vibrations on material flow characteristics, material formability, and tribological conditions will be studied through analytical modeling, numerical, and experimentation. Analytical models for predicting temperature generation caused by ultrasonic vibrations, coupled with temperature induced due to plastic deformation will be established. Through experimentation, the transformation of material characteristics due to temperature rise caused by ultrasonic vibrations at different energy levels will be studied. The effect of ultrasonic energy on the reaction response of lubricant chemicals at the tool-workpiece interface will also be studied with an ultimate goal of identifying suitable and effective lubricant chemicals for this process.   \r\n\r\nIf successful, the fundamentals established from this study will be used to build a knowledge-base for developing cost-effective manufacturing method for 3D-miniature parts via ultrasonic assisted microforming. The knowledge gained from this research may lead to novel warm microforming process techniques, where billet heating is achieved through the heat energy induced from ultrasonic vibrations. This research will be of significant value to manufacturers of miniature parts and developers of microforming machine systems for mass production of hollow and solid micro parts. Biomedical, electronics, ordnance, and communication industries are expected to benefit from this technology due to high demand of miniature parts. Research findings will be incorporated into manufacturing courses and dissemination through seminars, conferences and journal articles. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research.   \r\n",
