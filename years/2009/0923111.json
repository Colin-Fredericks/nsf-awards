 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Applied Mathematics at the Illinois Institute of Technology\r\nwill purchase a high performance computer cluster of 128 processors with\r\nsupporting software, which will be dedicated to the support of ongoing research\r\nprojects and educational efforts in large-scale parallel computing.  The\r\nequipment will be used for seven research projects in applied mathematics,\r\nwhich require intensive computer simulations.  Mathematically, all projects are\r\nrelated to modeling, numerical analysis and simulation of deterministic and\r\nstochastic (partial) differential equations, covering a wide range of\r\napplications that include materials science, geoscience, finance, biology,\r\nenvironmental fluid mechanics, plasma physics and software engineering.\r\n\r\nThe proposed program will provide excellent training opportunities for graduate\r\nstudents in parallel computing and offer them easy access and hands-on\r\nexperience to a high performance computing cluster. Four courses in\r\ncomputational mathematics will be enhanced by incorporating parallel\r\ncomputation, which will benefit both graduate and undergraduate students from\r\ndifferent disciplines, including Applied Mathematics, Biomedical Engineering,\r\nMechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil\r\nEngineering and Computer Science.  The PIs in the proposal have outstanding\r\ntrack records of recruiting and scientifically nurturing women and\r\nunderrepresented minority students and the grant will enable them to train\r\nthese students in state-of-the-art scientific computing.  On the technological\r\nand social aspects, the proposed cluster will provide support for seven\r\nresearch projects that have applications to a broader set of related problems\r\nincluding global climate change, option pricing, membrane-based drug delivery,\r\nenvironmental research and monitoring, and large-scale computing software.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)",
