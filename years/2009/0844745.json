 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tA grant has been awarded to the Field Museum of Natural History under the direction of Dr. Mark Westneat to study the evolution the diverse community of coral reef fishes and their skeletal structure.  Coral reefs are centers of marine biodiversity where millions of species coexist. Reef fishes are a major component of the animal life in these habitats in terms of species number, economic resources, and the colorful, moving beauty of a living reef. The reef fish evolutionary tree, or phylogenetic history, depicting the diversification of these fish over time is largely unresolved. In addition, there is much that we have to learn about the way reef fishes feed, survive and coexist in the complex ecology of coral reefs. This project combines novel DNA information to examine the evolutionary tree of large groups of coral reef fishes with studies of how fish species feed to explore evolution in one of the most diverse species radiations on Earth.\r\nThe main objective of this grant is to understand the evolution of coral reef biodiversity, and to do that we need DNA data on hundreds of species. By using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, including genes that play a role in embryological development (for a total of 10 different genes), this project will analyze a total of 648 species of fishes to understand their phylogenetic history and use this family tree to explore evolutionary patterns in reef fishes. The second objective of the proposal is to combine phylogenetic research with engineering features of fish skulls to reveal patterns of evolutionary biomechanics. Engineering models of skull function link the variation in skull anatomy to feeding mechanics such as bite force, gape speed, and jaw protrusion, giving us a better understanding of how animals function in the reef habitat. \r\nFor a broader audience, this project contributes to museum collections, education, and exhibits. Students at the college, graduate, and postdoctoral levels are involved with all aspects of the proposed research, including sequencing, analysis, and presentation. International collaborations are underway with people from Austria, Australia, Chile, Kenya, Madagascar, New Zealand, The Philippines, and Thailand. A new museum exhibit at the Field Museum highlights the genetic research proposed here. This research will be incorporated into the new Encyclopedia of Life project through initiatives coordinated by the Biodiversity Synthesis Center at the Field Museum in Chicago.\r\n",
