 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: The objective of this proposal is to quantify the relative importance of surface area and quality factor on the sensitivity of detecting small molecules. While high quality (Q) factor resonant optical biosensors require fewer target molecules to be present for detection, without sufficient surface area the number of molecules captured by the sensor remains below the threshold for detection. In this work, we build on the rapid progress that has been made over the last decade in the fabrication of extremely high Q-factor photonic crystals and the PIs recent introduction of multi-hole defects (MHDs) that enable the surface area of photonic crystal biosensors to be varied while maintaining a high Q-factor. Silicon photonic crystal sensors with independently tunable surface area and quality factor will be theoretically and experimentally investigated to determine the most favorable sensor properties for the detection of variable-sized biomolecules.  Guidelines will be established to suggest when the introduction of increased surface area will benefit sensors for the detection of specific sized biomolecules. The development of a sensitive, reliable biosensor with the capability of monolithic integration with silicon electronic devices addresses a critical need for point-of-care diagnostics. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: There is strong demand in medical diagnostics, genomics, and homeland security for the development of reliable, sensitive, biosensor arrays capable of detecting multiple toxins, DNA fragments, and other small molecules. The proposed research establishes ground rules for the development of new biosensors and the modification of existing sensor designs, which will enable rapid, transformative progress in the sensitivity and throughput of small molecule detection.  A primary educational goal of this program is to expose students to state-of-the-art infrastructure at IBM and give them the opportunity to work in an industrial research setting through collaborative research.  The value of higher education in science and engineering for K-12 students will be promoted through hands-on outreach activities. An interactive nanoscience exhibit highlighting optical, materials, and biological phenomena will be created for use at outreach events\r\n",
