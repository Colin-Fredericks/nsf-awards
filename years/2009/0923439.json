 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\nAnalysis of stable isotopes has become an important tool in the study of a range of biological and chemical phenomena. This instrumentation will allow the use of stable isotopes to pursue research projects ranging from carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry, to food web dynamics, to paleoecological and forensic analyses. The presence of these instruments on campus will allow completion of these research projects without sending samples to outside laboratories and will enhance research and teaching activities in an almost unlimited range of science disciplines, from physical chemistry to molecular biology and ecology. All of the projects represent significant contributions to our understanding of environmental and chemical processes, and enhance interdisciplinary research at St. Olaf College. The instrumentation will also be used in classes as part of a growing tradition of research-based teaching at St. Olaf College. Several current courses will benefit directly, providing research opportunities for up to 40 students per year. In addition, this acquisition will lead to the development of a new course in stable isotope ecology taught by an early career scientist. Expected outcomes of this grant include data leading to presentations at scientific meetings and research publications in peer-reviewed journals, as well as the development of curricular materials that will be disseminated to other science educators through websites and other internet-based content.",
