This proposal is a follow-on to a previous successful IF equipment and technician support grant. The technician will be responsible for day-to-day operations, maintenance, logistics, training, scheduling, and supervising. Projects in paleoceanography, paleoecology, paleoclimate, nutrient cycling, forest and wetland biogeochemistry and hydrology, food web and trophic interactions, and methane biogeochemistry will benefit from this support. Previous technician support has been instrumental in getting the lab up and running. Currently, the administration has agreed to offer \u00bd of the technician?s salary. The PIs all have or have requested EAR funding. The management plan has the instrument housed in the stable isotope facility. After the two years of funding requested in this proposal, college and departmental funds plus recharge monies will be used to support the full-time technician.  The PI team is diverse and represents a breadth of disciplines. The partner is a historically black institution.  The technician will support both graduate and undergraduate research and education. Summer educational outreach will be performed through REU.\r\n\r\n***",
