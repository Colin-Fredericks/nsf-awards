 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support basic research with three-dimensions simulations including full-scale modeling of ongoing or planned experiments with  the primary tool being three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations.  The simulations provide a test bed for theoretical ideas and, once validated, a method to guide experiments.  High-fidelity full-scale modeling will provide a means to extrapolate parameters into regimes that will not be accessible to experiments for years to come. The research group will exploit an unmatched array of PIC codes and data analysis tools, a detailed understanding of the key PWFA experiments, and close connections to  experimental programs within the US and abroad. \r\nIn particular, the research will investigate the following  \r\n1. Explore the physics necessary to make a compact LWFA or PWFA stage.  \r\n2. Explore the physics necessary to make a linear collider based on wakefield stages a reality.  \r\n3. Carry out full-scale 3D PIC simulations of beam and laser-plasma experiments, e.g., at UCLA, SLAC, the L'OASIS lab at LBL, the Hercules laser at Michigan, the Texas Petatwatt laser, and RAL  (England).   \r\n4. Continue to develop the PIC infrastructure including reduced PIC algorithms.  \r\n5. Continue to develop predictive theory and scaling laws.   \r\n\r\nThe High Energy Density Science (HEDS) area of intense laser and beam-matter interactions has an impact on plasma-based acceleration and  radiation sources, and even on the fast ignitor fusion concept. Compact particle accelerators might eventually have an impact on particle physics, material science, structural biology, medicine, fusion research, and  transmutation of nuclear waste. The students and post-doctoral researchers trained under this grant will be part of the twenty-first century work force in computational science and engineering as well as experts in HEDS. UCLA codes and algorithms are being used by other groups throughout the world.  This grant supported a female graduate student. An effort is underway to share this group's parallel simulation codes with Florida A&M, a historically black university.",
