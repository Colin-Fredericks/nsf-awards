 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop the multiphenomena device physics of a patterned graphene to a point where new classes of devices can be conceived and simulated. The approach is solving quantum dynamic transport equations in the presence of electron-electron, electron-phonon, and electron-photon interactions, assisted by implementation of numerically efficient models and algorithms.  Intellectual merit: Physically meaningful and computationally efficient device simulation capabilities play a critical role in revealing device physics and exploring new device concepts. At nanometer and quantum transport scale, unexpected device phenomena and new device functionalities could arise from interaction of diverse physical processes. The proposed research advances our fundamental understanding on interactions between electrons, phonons, and photons in non-equilibrium quantum transport in nanoscale devices. The research will also contribute to building the predicative simulation power for new device phenomena in the emerging field of graphene electronics.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The research would enable engineering graphene for integration of communication, data storage, and imaging functionalities into existing integrated circuit technologies, and thus significantly extend the chip capacity through functional diversification. A web-based simulator will be developed and deployed to provide simulation support for the research and education worldwide on graphene electronics. Early exposure to electronics and optoelectronics will be provided through a set of video presentations on electronic and optoelectronic technologies in popular products through a University of Florida outreach program with an emphasis on minority student participation. An online nanotechnology course advising system will also be developed.",
