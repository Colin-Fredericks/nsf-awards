 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations have shown a relationship between increased summer ice velocity and increased meltwater production over several years on the western slope of the Greenland Ice Sheet.  This doctoral dissertation research project will map the spatial distribution of moulins (vertical conduits that transmit surface meltwater to the bed of the ice sheet) based on high-resolution satellite imagery within a 1,100 square-km area of the inland ice northeast of Jakobshavn/Ilulissat, West Greenland (at a latitude of roughly 70-degrees N).  The doctoral student will compare observed moulin locations to historical moulin locations as identified on a topographical map based on 1985 aerial photography in order to identify changes in moulin distribution over time.  A multivariate regression model will be derived to explain moulin density across the study area.  Subglacial water pressures, determined from moulin density, will be translated into basal sliding speed using sliding laws previously validated for alpine glaciers.  The seasonal melt-acceleration phenomenon then will be modeled using a coupled thermodynamic ice sheet model under both present day and future climatic conditions, with the latter including a simulated increase in surface meltwater production.  The primary goal of this project is to model the physical basis of the observed melt-induced acceleration of ice flow and predict how this mechanism will influence ice sheet dynamics in the future.  The secondary goal of the project is to identify changes in moulin distribution over time.  Moulin distribution will be determined via feature extraction from high resolution (with roughly one meter pixels) commercial satellite imagery.\r\n\r\nSea-level rise is a highly relevant societal concern.  The estimated sea-level rise contribution from glaciers and ice sheets currently is based primarily on surface mass balance and ignores the possible influence of changing ice velocity, with increased ice loss related to increased iceberg calving.  This project therefore will directly address the need to improve basic understanding of the potential sea-level rise contribution due to accelerated ice flow in the Greenland Ice Sheet.  The products of this project will be maps of moulin density and of the magnitude and spatial distribution of basal slide within the study area.  This project will provide new insights regarding the influence of meltwater on the ice dynamics of ice sheets by contributing novel models of surface hydrology (i.e moulin density) as well as basal slide (the relation between subglacial water pressure and ice velocity at the ice-bedrock interface).  The parameterizations and conceptual advances made in this project likely will be useful for the alpine glacier community as well.  This project will apply these theoretical advances to probe the physical basis of the observed correlation between ice surface velocity and duration of summer melt on the western flank of the Greenland Ice Sheet.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\n",
