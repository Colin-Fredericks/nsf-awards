 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Division of Chemistry supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte for the summers of 2009-2011.  The site director is Banita Brown who is assisted by Sherine Obare as co-PI.  Eight students will be recruited to conduct individual nanoscale science research projects or work as part of a research team centered on interdisciplinary nanoscale science research.  Targeted student participants will range from rising freshmen to rising juniors from the Greater Metropolitan Charlotte Area as well as from a broader region.  Nanoscale science research faculty from the Departments of Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Optical Science, or Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science will provide well defined projects related to the nanoscale science theme.  This project responds to the national need for developing a suitable nanoscale science workforce. In addition to the research activities, the REU students will participate in weekly workshops on various topics including research ethics for physical scientists and engineers, graduate school preparation, GRE test-taking strategies, and careers in nanoscale science, as well as attend and conduct mini-seminars related to recent developments in nanoscale science.  The summer will conclude with an Undergraduate Research Symposium event where the participants will deliver poster and oral presentations of their research results.",
