NC has been shown to be a promising approach to enhance networking performance.  However, many benefits of NC will not likely be realized fully when they are used naively with the existing wired and wireless infrastructures.  This research consists of two primary efforts, aimed to develop theories and methodologies for optimally incorporating NC to a large body of existing coding, signal processing, networking and communication techniques.  The first effort will investigate the NC-based techniques for efficient multimedia delivery from the Internet to receivers in a wireless access network such as Wi-Fi or WiMax. This effort will focus on the optimal integration of NC to the network stack, from media compression techniques at the application layer, to packet schedulers at the link layer, to channel coding and modulation methods at the physical layer, in order to improve quality of wireless multimedia networking applications.  The second effort will explore a scalable, NC-based, Peer-to-Peer architecture for multimedia storage and delivery.  The focus will be on developing network protocols and NC-based data replenishment techniques to support high quality video streaming.  \r\n\r\nThese two efforts will provide an in-depth understanding of when, where, and how to apply NC techniques for multimedia networking applications. The specific research goals are 1) to  understand and quantify the effects of the interactions among network layers and NC techniques,  2) to develop theories and methodologies for jointly optimizing NC techniques with the existing infrastructures, and 3) to develop software platforms for enhancing wireless multimedia networking applications, and for building robust, scalable, distributed multimedia storage and streaming systems. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. Integral to the research will be efforts to increase enrollment and retention of electrical engineering and computer science students through exciting projects and class materials, to promote inter-community collaborations among researchers in the fields of networking, signal processing, and coding theory through a series of workshops, and to create societal wealth through innovations via industrial collaborations and start-up ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
