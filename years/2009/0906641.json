 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is to study self-assembled drug nanocarriers, including liposomes, polymer micelles, and vesicles, exhibit poor in vivo stability, leading to poor targeting and reduced therapeutic effect. This award will help to develop multifunctional unimolecular micelles with excellent in vivo stability, passive and active tumor-targeting abilities, desirable particle size, high drug loading capacity, controlled drug release, and long circulation time, thereby greatly increasing the efficacy of targeted cancer therapy and minimizing undesirable side effects. These unique unimolecular micelles are based on novel biodegradable and/or biocompatible, multi-arm hyperbranched amphiphilic block copolymers with active tumor-targeting ligands. A hyperbranched polyester with 64 hydroxyl groups will be used as the initiator for the polymerization of the amphiphilic block copolymer arms. The relationship among the molecular structure, micelle property, and drug delivery behavior will be systematically investigated. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained with various cutting-edge techniques related to biomaterials research. The resultant knowledge will improve the design of next-generation drug nanocarriers for targeted cancer theranostics and be integrated into relevant courses established by the PIs\r\n\r\nDespite continuous and intensive efforts to discover highly effective cancer drugs, conventional chemotherapeutic agents still exhibit poor specificity in reaching tumor tissue and are often restricted by dose-limiting toxicity. Nanoparticulates are desirable anticancer drug carriers due to their passive and active tumor-targeting ability, thereby allowing anticancer drugs to be delivered specifically to the cancer cells and minimizing harmful toxicity to non-cancerous cells adjacent to the target tissue. However, one major limitation with self-assembled drug nanocarriers is in vivo instability, which leads to poor therapeutic effects. This award will help to develop a multifunctional unimolecular micelle drug delivery system with many desirable characteristics for targeted cancer therapy, thereby greatly improving the quality of cancer patient care. The resultant technology will be transferred to interested companies, further promoting economic growth in the U.S. Educational outreach activities will be conducted with Milwaukee-area middle/high school students through the various outreach programs at UW-Milwaukee.",
