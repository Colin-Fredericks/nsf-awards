This region, encompassing the corners of northwest California and southwest Oregon, is one of the richest botanical areas in western North America with >3,500 species, and yet remains poorly documented and explored.  This project will employ undergraduate students over a three year period to enter habitat and geographical data from the ~ 90,000 herbarium specimens into an on-line searchable database.  The specimen records will then be incorporated into larger databases maintained by the Consortium of California Herbaria and the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria, and made available to the public via their existing web portals.\r\n\r\nOn-line access to our specimen data will be invaluable to the state and federal biologists who monitor the many rare and endangered plants indigenous to the extensive public lands of the Klamath Bioregion.  Specimen data will also assist those engaged in tracking and curtailing the spread of potentially harmful exotic species.  Because most these specimens are not duplicated at larger herbaria, resource managers will now have access to critical information regarding the geographical distribution and habitat preferences of this region?s diverse flora.\r\n",
