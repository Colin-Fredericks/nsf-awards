 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research explores the interactions between plants and a specific type of soil fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi).  These fungi can dramatically improve plant nutrition, plant productivity, plant diversity, and ecosystem function, greatly contributing to crop production, the maintenance of diversity in native habitats, and soil health.  However, fungi can be detrimental to plants, especially in environments where soils are fertile (e.g., through fertilization) or light limited (e.g., under a dense layer of vegetation).  The research examines the specific conditions of resource availability (soil nutrients and light) under which fungi benefit plants, and asks whether some plants are better at controlling their interactions with fungi than others.  Understanding what controls the interactions between plants and mycorrhizal fungi is essential for predicting and manipulating the abundance of these fungi as well as their effects on plant growth.  The results of this research will inform advances in low-input agriculture, restoration and management of native ecosystems, and soil carbon storage.  The co-PI will also continue her work in Lawton Community Schools in Lawton, MI, helping K-12 students to conduct inquiry-based science activities to learn about ecology.  In collaboration with K-12 teachers in Lawton, she develops lessons about important topics such as carbon cycling, plant diversity, and how plants and soil organisms work together to provide important services for our environment.  The co-PI will also continue to present the results of her research at national meetings and in peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\n",
