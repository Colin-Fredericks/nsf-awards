Rio Piedras\r\n\t\t\r\nTitle:  \tMRI/Acq.: Acq.of  Equipment for the Establishment of a Reconfigurable Computing Center at UPR-RP \r\n\r\nThis project, acquiring a shared computational resource instrument with multiple high-end general purpose processors and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) co-processors that form flagship platforms for Reconfigurable Computing (RC), supports interdisciplinary collaboration with research groups in Finite Field Applications, Computational Discrete Mathematics, Electronics Design Automation, and Developmental Biology. Focusing on research tools for assisting automatic partitioning of applications to multicore architectures and configurable platforms, the project services eight application fields, including hardware/software (HW/SW) co-design tools, power optimization tools for embedded systems, Latin square orthogonality- and hypercube cut number-related problems, reconfigurable radar waveforms, and bioinformatics. The DMAGIC (DST Mapping using Algorithmic and Graph Interaction and Computation) methodology generates a high-level efficient partition for a given pair of problem descriptions in Discrete Signal Transform (DST) and architectural descriptions. Hence, algorithms will be designed mapping the different research areas into the platform. Education and research training are given a high priority.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The instrument expedites scientific results, impacts the education and training of all users, and contributes to workforce training. Collaborations open new opportunities for undergraduate research, contributing not only to retain students, but also to direct them to graduate studies. This university, residing in an EPSCoR jurisdiction, services a large number of underrepresented minority students.\r\n",
