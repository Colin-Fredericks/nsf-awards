Models of the articulators\r\n(such as the lips and tongue) can succinctly represent much of this variability. Most\r\nprevious work on articulatory models has focused on the relationship between acoustics\r\nand articulation, but more significant improvements require models of the hidden\r\narticulatory state structure. This work has both a technological goal of improving\r\nrecognition and a scientific goal of better understanding articulatory phenomena.\r\nThe project considers larger model classes than previously studied. In particular, the\r\nproject develops graphical models, including dynamic Bayesian networks and\r\nconditional random fields, designed to take advantage of articulatory knowledge. A new\r\nframework for hybrid directed and undirected graphical models is being developed, in\r\nrecognition of the benefits of both directed and undirected models, and of both\r\ngenerative and discriminative training. The project activities include major extension of\r\nearlier articulatory models with context modeling, asynchrony structures, and\r\nspecialized training; development of factored conditional random field models of\r\narticulatory variables; and discriminative training to alleviate word confusability.\r\nThe scientific goal addresses questions about the ways in which articulatory trajectories\r\nvary in different contexts. Existing databases are used, and initial work in manual\r\narticulatory annotation is being extended. In addition, the project uses articulatory\r\nmodels to perform forced transcription of larger data sets, providing an additional\r\nresource for the research community. Other broad impacts include new models and\r\ntechniques with applicability to other time-series modeling problems. Extending the\r\napplicability of speech recognition will help it fulfill its promise of enabling more efficient\r\nstorage of and access to spoken information, and equalizing the technological playing\r\nfield for those with hearing or motor disabilities.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0905633 PI Name:Livescu, Karen\r\nPrinted from eJacket: 06/10/09 Page 1 of 1",
