Both combustion and pyrolysis will be investigated.  The ultimate goal is to create an efficient and environmentally friendly thermal treatment process for PWB wastes to recycle the energy contained therein by extracting fuels, recovering precious metals, and avoiding pollution from the process.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research.  A homepage on \"Recycling of Electronic Wastes\" will be built, and a course on the recycling of materials will be taught every spring semester.",
