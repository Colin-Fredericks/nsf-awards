 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how the plant hormone gibberellin (GA) regulates seed germination, dormancy, and after-ripening. Besides being a major food source, seeds propagate, store, and disperse plants. Seeds are like lifeboats for embryonic plants. It is essential that seeds germinate only under conditions that will allow the seedlings to thrive and the species to survive. Thus seed germination is exquisitely regulated by the balance between two plant hormones, abscisic acid (ABA) and GA. During embryo maturation ABA triggers a condition called seed dormancy which prevents seed germination, even under favorable conditions. Dormancy is relieved by a period of dry storage or afterripening. This requirement for after-ripening assures seed dispersal over time as well as space. GA stimulates seed germination and has been implicated in after ripening. Plants such as Arabidopsis and tomato have an absolute requirement for GA synthesis to germinate. This project uses Arabidopsis to determine how the GA signal is perceived leading to germination. Germination is repressed by DELLA transcription factors. In Arabidopsis, GA stimulates germination by triggering destruction of the DELLA RGL2 protein. This destruction requires the GA receptor GID1 and the F-box protein SLY1. Interestingly, germination can occur in sly1 mutants that produce high levels of DELLA protein when seeds have been after-ripened a long time or when the GID1 receptor is over-produced. This suggests that a new mechanism controls seed germination and implicates the GA receptor. Three mechanisms will be tested: 1) DELLA-repression is bypassed by a parallel pathway; 2) DELLA is inactivated by interaction with the GID1 receptor; and 3) DELLA is inactivated by phosphorylation or ubiquitination. Elucidating these mechanisms will benefit society by providing molecular genetic methods to improve crop seedling establishment, yield, and resistance to preharvest sprouting in cereals like wheat. Knowledge about seed biology will be disseminated through annual presentations to Washington wheat growers and elementary schools. The project will promote education through training a postdoctoral fellow, an undergraduate and graduate student.",

Our hypothesis was that these mechanisms overlap with those occurring during dry after-ripening.  Based on transcriptome analysis, many more genes change expression due to after-ripening than due to GID1 overexpression (GID1-OE) (Nelson and Steber, in preparation).  This tells us that GA/GID1 is  only one of multiple mechanisms relieving seed dormancy during dry after-ripening.\n \n2) Does rescue of sly1 germination by after-ripening and GID1 overexpression result from a bypass of the requirement for DELLA destruction or DELLA inactivation?\nWhen changes in gene transcription were examined, all of the genes whose expression was altered by GID1-OE were also found to be GA and DELLA regulated genes by comparison to previous microarray studies (Nelson and Steber, in prep.).

Transcripts showing altered expression with sly1-2 rescue by GID1-OE were previously shown to be GA/DELLA regulated genes, and many after-ripening-regulated genes were also GA/DELLA regulated.  Thus, it appears that GID1 can down-regulate DELLA even though the sly1 mutation prevents DELLA destruction.  After-ripening of sly1-2 seeds relied, at least in part, on DELLA inactivation by formation of the GID1-DELLA protein complex.  Loss of function mutations in gid1a, gid1b, and gid1c prevented sly1-2 after-ripening.  Rescue of sly1-2 seed germination required both GA and the presence of the DELLA..."
