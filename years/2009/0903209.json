 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the regional center for next-generation manufacturing (RCNGM). The Colleges of Technology (COT) represents all 12 public Connecticut community colleges in partnership with six universities and 17 technical and comprehensive high schools. Included in this partnership are over 3000 manufacturing firms represented by the CT Business and Industry Association (CBIA). Over 250 community-college faculty, 75 faculty members of four-year institutions, along with 500 middle- and high-school teachers, have been engaged by the COT-RCNGM, directly impacting 59,000 students. \r\n\r\nSkilled manufacturing personnel are needed, particularly in New England, as documented in local, regional, and national manufacturing-workforce survey data. This problem is especially acute for industries using next generation manufacturing technologies such as laser manufacturing, fuel-cell technologies, 3D solid modeling and simulations, rapid prototyping, and 5- and 6-axis machining centers. The COT-RCNGM continues to address critical regional workforce needs and impact the 21st century manufacturing workforce. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nFor regional manufacturers to remain competitive, prudent but substantial investments must be made in the latest software, hardware, and equipment developments. Investment is needed in systems integration collectively known as Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). CIM is characterized by highly integrated computer systems that support all aspects of manufacturing across an entire organization and its supply chain. The COT-RCNGM is well positioned, with experienced staff, faculty and industry support, to pursue the evolution of CIM. \r\n\r\nCOT-RCNGM's proven model of mutually reinforcing goals begins with ongoing faculty development using industry externships to guide successful curriculum development. This is augmented by strong articulation agreements, culminating in highly effective recruitment and retention efforts targeting underrepresented populations. These efforts, driven by industry workforce needs, have had a marked impact on manufacturing program enrollments; for example, 57 new courses, nine credit certificates and 12 A.S. degree options in manufacturing and related technologies have already been developed and implemented. As manufacturing technologies continue to evolve, the COT-RCNGM is (1) providing professional development opportunities for faculty members that address 21st century workforce needs; (2) providing access to next generation curricula to include modeling, simulation, and CIM; (3) strengthening existing and creating new 2+2+2 articulation agreements; and (4) incorporating new models of student recruitment and retention that target women and minority populations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\nThe RCNGM has already developed a web presence that includes recruitment materials for students, parents, and educators. The center is sponsoring faculty members' papers, presentations and participation at regional and national conferences and workshops. The center is disseminating educators' career kits, pamphlets, brochures, and videos at seminars targeting students and their parents. The center is facilitating recruitment of underrepresented populations based on synergistic partnerships (e.g., the Girls Scouts and professional associations) to ensure sustainability. The broader impact is both regional and national since the center is working with nine other ATE centers and six ATE projects. The center responds to requests from around the country for recruitment materials to be adapted or used as a template to create local recruitment efforts. The center is broadening and strengthening its regional impact by disseminating proven practices throughout New England. Through collaborating with a network of community colleges, the center is assisting in the creation of the workforce essential for the United States to compete globally in the 21st century.",
