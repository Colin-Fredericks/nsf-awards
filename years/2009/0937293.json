 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER award is intended to test the hypothesis that waste materials containing significant amounts of alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides have sufficient carbonation potential to permanently store at least a part of the CO2 generated from industrial process.  Industrial alkaline waste materials, viz., cement kiln dust (CKD), high carbon fly ash from fluidized bed coal combustion, fine glass powder from highway glass bead manufacturing, and lime mud from paper manufacturing will be investigated. It is also proposed to investigate the beneficial utilization of the resulting carbonated end products in concrete applications. The specific research objectives for this EAGER study are:  (i) To quantify the efficiency of industrial alkaline waste materials in their as-procured condition for CO2 sequestration; and (ii) To evaluate the behavior of the carbonated end products in cement pastes so as to lay the foundation for their potential application in concretes.\r\n\r\nThe waste materials to be evaluated in this study are generated in industrial settings that emit significant quantities of CO2. If successful, this project will provide a pathway for the utilization of the CO2 emitted from a particular industrial process towards the beneficiation of the waste material from this process. Two, the beneficiated (carbonated) waste products will be evaluated in this study for their potential application as binding materials in concrete. If the carbonated products can be utilized in concrete applications, this will contribute towards making the concrete ?greener?.",
