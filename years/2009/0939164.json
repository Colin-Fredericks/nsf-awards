 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program aims to revitalize undergraduate computing education through the development of a computational science minor targeted to undergraduate majors in science and engineering.  These majors represent a broad community of learners for whom computation is an increasingly critical tool.  Modern scientific and engineering applications of significant complexity require high-performance computing solutions, and scientists and engineers require computational thinking competencies to achieve such solutions.\r\n\r\nThe project introduces concurrent, parallel, and distributed computing concepts, techniques, and patterns early in the curriculum.  The advent of multi-core processors at the commodity level, necessitated by the efforts to prolong Moore's law, have made understanding these topics a critical learning outcome.  The overall effect of this project will thus be to teach computational thinking competencies, modern software design methods, high-performance computing, and scientific computing to a broad community of learners sorely in need of them.  By renovating the curriculum with non-computer science majors in mind, computer science majors will also benefit significantly because concurrent, parallel, and distributed computational methods will be infused into the curriculum earlier than they are normally encountered. The computer science curriculum will also be revitalized by introducing real-world examples from science and engineering that have computational interest.\r\n\r\nThe demographics of science and engineering are different enough from traditional computer science that underrepresented groups in computing will receive significant exposure to core ideas of computational thinking and computing.  The diffusion of computational techniques throughout a variety of disciplines will also change the way computational thinking and computation are perceived and taught within the core computer science discipline. A rigorous evaluation plan throughout all phases of the project will measure quantitatively the changes in the preparation of undergraduates for scientific computing by the proposed computational sciences minor, leading to a greater likelihood of being adopted or adapted by other institutions. By improving the computational skills of scientists and engineers, at Vanderbilt and elsewhere, the project will achieve the broader impact of improving science education in the United States, making students far better prepared for the work force and advanced graduate training.\r\n",
