 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on an assessment of the potential for scientific collaboration between Indian and the US academic institutions in the fields of enterprise engineering, specifically Operations Research, Operations management and related manufacturing design research. The study will evaluate the potential of Indian institutions to produce effective faculty and graduate research talent for modeling and analysis of enterprise systems and effective collaboration mechanisms with US institutions in order to achieve that goal. It will also assess whether there is an impending shortage of talent at the graduate education and research levels in India and how these trends will affect US educational institutions and businesses. The study will focus on three areas: (a) Design Capability, models and associated services, collaborations and related research, (b) Supply Chain Management approaches in manufacturing companies and associated research and (c) Service networks and models used to understand risk in enterprise networks. These three areas of focus complement research agendas of the study team and taken together will provide a complete understanding of these aspects of enterprise systems. The grant will enable collection and analysis of data on output trends, in funded and unfunded research activity, collaborative activity, etc., from a representative set of top-class research-and-degree granting Indian institutions. A projection of problems and potential will be made based on direct onsite interviews by a research team. This will be followed by a brainstorming of specific possible collaboration initiatives between US and Indian universities.\r\n\r\nThis understanding will enable assessment of the potential for scientific collaboration between Indian and the US academic institutions in the fields of enterprise engineering, specifically Operations Research, Operations Management and related manufacturing design research.  As a broader outcome, the findings from this project will help in identifying possible mechanisms for enhancing collaborative opportunities between US and Indian university partners with a view to enhance overall research productivity.\r\n\r\n",
