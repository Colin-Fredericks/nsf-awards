 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\r\n(Public Law 111-5).\r\nThe chloridoid grasses are a large, economically and ecologically important group of\r\napproximately 1500 species in 150 genera that have been classified using the highly\r\nvariable features of the inflorescence (how flowers are arranged). Despite their\r\nimportance, relatively little is known about the relationships among the species or the\r\nregulation of inflorescence development, so these issues will be addressed through\r\nstudies of all genera and one-third of the species. DNA sequences will be used to\r\nreconstruct the evolutionary relationships and create a new classification, and\r\ninflorescences will be studied from early in development to maturity to characterize the\r\ndifferences in an evolutionary context. Genes involved in inflorescence development of\r\nother species will be examined for their role in chloridoids.\r\nChloridoid grasses are economically important because several species are grown as\r\nfood crops or turf grasses for humans, and many provide livestock forage.\r\nUnderstanding the evolution of the group and the regulation of inflorescence\r\ndevelopment can have important implications for crop or turf improvement as others\r\nseek sources of desirable traits or increased grain yields. In addition to the principal\r\ninvestigators, the project involves undergraduate students at a small college, as well as\r\ngraduate students and a postdoctoral scholar. The research findings will be broadly\r\ndisseminated through print and online outlets.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0920147 PI Name:Columbus, J.
