 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will fund the R&D needed for future lepton collider detector and in particular the International Large Detector (ILD) detector concept. The R&D projects will address critical issues related to the design of the ILD concept and associated beam instrumentation. The future lepton collider is expected to be a frontier scientific facility, exploring the interactions of electrons and positrons at energy scales of up to about 1 TeV. To fully exploit the physics opportunities of such an accelerator, it is essential to design a particle physics detector of unprecedented granularity, robustness and precision, and demonstrate that its feasibility. ILD is based around particle flow, a paradigm which aims for reconstruction of individual particles, using a highly robust tracking system centered on a time projection chamber supplemented with silicon tracking, and high granularity \"camera-like\" electro-magnetic and hadronic calorimetry suited to separation of individual energy deposits. Particle Flow calorimeters offer an exciting new approach to achieve significant better energy resolution needed by the new physics. If proven to work they could be useful for many future applications in High energy and Nuclear Physics experiments. This proposal will support the development and validation of Particle Flow Algorithms using test beam data. The detector projects address complementary aspects associated with advancing the design of the ILD detector with projects focused on tracking, calorimetry as well as beam instrumentation. This proposal will support the development of Low mass TPC endplates and luminosity monitoring system. \r\n\r\nThe proposal will have broader impact in that a number of the R&D projects utilize a significant numbers of undergraduate students who are highly integrated into the planned research. The university groups have a strong track record of encouraging the participation of under-represented groups in their research and this will continue to be emphasized. Many of the detector R&D projects have potential to lead to applications in areas such as medical imaging, and will lead to a cadre of scientists well trained in the art of experimentation and detector technologies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project has advanced our understanding of two key aspects of how experiments in high energy physics can be performed at future colliders. The work is especially relevant to facilities designed to collide high energy electrons and anti-electrons such as the International Linear Collider (ILC).\n\nThe first key aspect is the capability to measure the energies of collections of close-by particles, called jets, based on reconstructing individual particles and making use of correlations between particles. The project has demonstrated how more advanced methods for reconstructing the energies of jets can result in a more precise measurement of the masses of fundamental particles including the Higgs and the W. The work involved improving the jet energy measurement uncertainties using methods associated with the known masses of particles decaying to pairs of photons, and developing a better model of those uncertainties.

One big advantage of electron anti-electron collisions is that the initial conditions of the fundamental particles that initiate the collision can in principle be determined very precisely. The new strategy for measuring precisely the energy of the colliding beams leads to an improvement of about a factor of ten in the measurement uncertainty.
