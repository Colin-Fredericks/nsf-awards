 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with the Benjamin Banneker Association, Temple University, Arcadia University, and Georgia State University convene a series of two professional mini-conferences and one professional summit to address issues related to the mathematical education of African American students, Pre-K-16. Previous research (Kitchen, 2007; Stiff & Harvey, 1988) suggests that there is a negative relationship between African American students and mathematics. This relationship is exacerbated by the underrepresentation of African American students in advanced mathematics classes, even when they are the majority of school populations (Martin, 2007), and the overrepresentation of African American students in lower-track mathematics courses and special education (Blanchett, 2006). \r\n\r\nThe series of conferences addresses the following pressing questions: (1) In what ways do school structures and institutional policies impact African American students' success in school mathematics? (2) In what ways can technological tools and other forms of multimedia be used to motivate and encourage African American students to learn rigorous mathematics? (2) In what ways do highly qualified mathematics teachers understand issues of race and equity, and how might teacher education programs develop highly qualified mathematics teachers for urban schools? (3) What is the nexus of race and identity for African American students in the South and other spaces where African American students are the majority, and how does racial-identity and individual agency impact their mathematics attainment? (4) What are the best practices that facilitate learning and mathematical empowerment among African American students, and how might culturally relevant and critical pedagogy assist in developing academic success, cultural competence, and critical consciousness among African American students? \r\n\r\nNumerous stakeholders, including classroom teachers, school administrators, experts in STEM education research, and scholars in psychology come together to speak to the pressing issues facing the mathematical education of African American students. The conferences bridge research and practice and challenge policymakers and school system leaders to establish frameworks and infrastructures that encourage African American students to develop positive mathematics identities and high levels of mathematics attainment. Outcomes include articles in research and practitioner journals and professional development materials.",
