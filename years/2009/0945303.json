 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop potent and durable antimicrobial coatings that effectively neutralize both vegetative and spore forms of harmful bacteria and which are simple to manufacture. The effectiveness of a known biocidal chemical entity is enhanced through new discoveries on the impact of surface morphology and physical properties on biocidal activity. The coatings utilize inexpensive, readily available components and simple methods of application, and they will be targeted toward fighting hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections, in general, and Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD), in particular. The coatings will be tested for biocidal activity against C. difficile spores, as well as E. coli and S. aureus. Coating durability and effective lifetime will also be evaluated.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to significantly reduce costs to the healthcare system arising from nosocomial infections. While the first and best line of defense against nosocomial infections continues to be scrupulous hand washing and diligent cleaning of environmental surfaces, these antimicrobial coatings will help compensate for unavoidable inconsistencies in compliance with recommended protocols. The project may also lead to better understanding of the mechanisms through which one class of polymer materials posseses biocidal activity, particularly in the case of bacterial spores.",
