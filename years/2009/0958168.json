 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is supporting a workshop to discuss the role of centers for teaching and learning (CTLs) in enhancing undergraduate engineering education.  The two-day workshop will bring together the directors of CTLs, engineering faculty, and administrators of schools of engineering. The organizers are planning to (1) outline strategies for leveraging resources and expertise at existing CTLs to enhance undergraduate engineering education by identifying goals, expected outcomes, strategies, and activities for the CTL and school of engineering partnerships; (2) identify programs, support and resources from CTLs appropriate for engineering faculty to enhance lifelong development as educators; (3) identify ways of utilizing faculty insight into student learning issues and difficulties with content to inform the planning of professional development programs; and (4) prepare recommendations for how engineering administrators could support and recognize educational innovation and professional development through a partnership with CTLs.  The pre-workshop activities will include preparing a white paper on the state of the field that discusses current professional development practices for schools of engineering as conducted either by CTLs or centers for engineering education.  The organizers are planning a website to host the workshop materials and results and a session at the ASEE Annual Conference and at the AERA Professional and Organizational Development Network Conference.",
