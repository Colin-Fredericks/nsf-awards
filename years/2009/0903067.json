 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funding the development of a Biotechnology Advanced Certificate program at Harold Washington College (HWC) in Chicago. This certificate specifically targets students who already have either a 4-year or a 2-year degree in the appropriate science. A student interest survey, performed at the college, indicated that these students are interested in working in either the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry. The program is designed based on industry feedback obtained through a survey and meetings with industry.  Students in this program master biotechnology laboratory skills in the context of both increased academic knowledge, and what they need to know to work in the industry; for example the development and use of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs). The majority of students finish the program in 2 to 3 semesters, ending with a capstone research project. This project is done at HWC, or in a partnering University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) laboratory, or at a biotechnology company.  The possibility for broad impact on the traditionally underserved student population is huge, since HWC is the only affordable institution of higher learning in this area of Chicago.",
