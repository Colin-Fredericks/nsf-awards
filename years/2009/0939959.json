The design of the ATST and the proposed construction program result from the strongly community-based supported ATST design and development effort.\r\n\r\nThe effort will augment the project team with key staff to complete the design efforts and prepare for construction start, and support recommended risk reductions and vendor contracting preparation needed to move into construction.  The completion with industry of the site architectural and engineering (A&E) work and the foundation design is the highest priority item within this additional risk reduction and vendor contracting package.  The A&E work and foundation design drives the start of work on site and therefore drives the construction critical path. Other recommended work includes adaptive optics deformable mirror prototyping and wavefront sensor camera development and further instrument and software and controls development. These risk reduction efforts with industry flow directly from recommendations made by design and cost review committees.\r\n",
