 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI proposal is focused on developing an innovative bridge scour monitoring system in real time during the critical floods events. Bridge scour, which refers to the erosion of soil adjacent to bridge piers or abutments, is the number one cause of bridge failures. An automatic bridge scour sensor that is self-powered through integration of micropower impulse technology (MIR) and energy harvesting will be developed and fabricated.  The sensor performance will be validated on a prototype bridge structure in simulated laboratory experiments and on field testbed.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\n\r\nThis project will make unique contributions to support scientific study and practice design by providing innovative bridge scour sensoring for safety surveillance of bridges in flood conditions.  The monitoring data can also help calibrate and improve the existing scour prediction theory and risk estimation.  This will ensure the deployment of scour countermeasures that are safe and economic.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis research will built upon a strong partnership that allows for the academia and private industry to join force and address critical national needs. Additionally, the education plan will combine the research effort with aggressive outreach activities to involve students in K-12 schools in civil infrastructure research.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this research is to develop a real time bridge scour monitoring sensor system using guided electromagnetic wave (electrical TDR) principle and to understand the scour mechanism.  Research activities have focused on developing the technologies and use of advanced computational model for assessment of scour mechanism and countermeasures.  The research activities are organized along 1) sensing principles and system integration for bridge scour sensing;  2) Analyses of the feasibility of scour countermeasures and scour mechanisms; 3) innovative concepts for scour investigation.\nIn the sensor development aspects, a strip Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) scour sensor has been developed by integrating the strip sensor with a mounting element (U-channel).  The mounting element provides structural support for the sensing strip.  Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the sensing element in determining the scour depth.  Algorithm was developed for sensor signal analyses.  A preliminary remote monitoring system was integrated that is capable of automatically acquire TDR signal at preset time interval and send data via cellular phone data service.  The sensor power supply was by a solar panel.  The process of charging/discharging of the solar panel was monitored.   The field scour sensor was installed at a service bridge.  The results are encouraging.  A user friendly interface was developed for bridge scour sensor.  Discussions were initialized to assist a few states and industry to deploy scour monitoring system.\nThe scour countermeasure aspects, the study evaluated measures such as Streamline bridge piers to reduce scour effects and the feasibility of sacrificial pile to improve the scour protection. \nThe research also explore ways for energy supply for the monitoring system, including to harvest energy from water stream and from the embedded heat in  infrastructure.\nTraining opportunities are provided for a number of graduate and undergraduate students, which had profound impacts on their career paths.   The research activities are also actively disseminated via publishing, and conference presentations and demonstrations.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Xiong Yu"
