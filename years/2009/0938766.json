 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to develop materials preparation methods, including synthesis, purification and crystal growth, characterize the physical and chemical properties and use them to fabricate radiation detectors.  The detectors will be tested and integrated to realize practical detection devices for national security applications.  We will expand the overall knowledge in this area by: developing an improved crystal growth method for control of crystal quality and yield and the program will meld together theory, modeling and experiments, having both fundamental and applied research aspects.  The project will generate the knowledge needed to develop detectors that will have higher resolution, better directional sensitivity, and higher detection efficiency than current generation of devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will advance the science and technology of cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) gamma spectrometers and imaging systems for many national security applications involving radiological and nuclear threats.  Novel and optimal techniques for crystal growth, crystal characterization and detector fabrication will be developed.  This academic project bears the promise that it will produce publishable data allowing to establishing processing-properties-performance correlations and fabricate compact and low power, improved gamma spectrometers and imagers for the identification and location of nuclear isotopes.  This collaborative program will involve students, ranging from undergraduates through PhD graduate students and will produce more detector-trained scientists and engineers than any other US academic program.  Fisk students will transition smoothly to a major research university with PhD programs.  The project will attract and develop a high quality and diverse new generation of PhD scientists.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
