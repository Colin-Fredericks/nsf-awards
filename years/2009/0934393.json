The proposed site will closely collaborate with the industry to identify generally applicable approaches to IT management, based on scientific principles that guide the selection, modification and integration of these techniques into demonstratively efficient solutions.  The activities at MSU will target the optimization of individual or combined properties of autonomic computing-enabled applications and systems.   \r\n\r\nThe expected outcome of the research initiative of CAC at MSU is a set of technologies to convert a significant number of system management tasks into systematic and semi-automated processes, using rigorous mathematical models and proven optimization techniques.  The planned research has the potential to significantly improve the performance and effectiveness of autonomic-computing (AC)-oriented applications and AC-enabled systems, to reduce the operating cost of current and future large-scale distributed systems, as well as to improve the quality of service of the various services hosted on such systems.  For broadening participation, the PIs plan to investigate partnership opportunities with local and national outreach programs including the Increasing Minority Access to Graduate Education program, and the QUEST summer research program.",
