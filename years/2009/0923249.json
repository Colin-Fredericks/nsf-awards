 "awd_abstract_narration": "MITERAC shall expand the research endeavors of 18 researchers from 6 universities in Indiana and Michigan. This will be accomplished via the acquisition of the following new instruments with funding from the MRI Program, which will be combined with the existing high resolution Element 2 ICP-MS (with 213 nm laser ablation unit and liquid chromatographic system): multiple collector-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS), 193 nm laser ablation and microdrilling systems, and dedicated Hg analyzers. The MC-ICP-MS instrumentation shall provide researchers the capacity to obtain highly precise and accurate isotope data from various types of environmental and geological samples. The 193 nm laser system and microdrill shall be used to acquire high quality, isotope data at high spatial resolution; i.e. 10s to 100s of micron scale from geological and archaeological samples. The Hg analyzers shall be used to quantify mercury levels in environmental samples as part of on-going research investigations in pollution remediation.\r\n\r\nMITERAC shall be a facility specializing in isotope geochemistry and trace element research; one that is fully accessible to undergraduates and graduate students, and faculty. The establishment of MITERAC will provide both graduate and undergraduate students from 6 universities with experience in handling and interpretation of isotope data, and critical hands-on training and expertise at Notre Dame in latest ICP-MS technology and highly innovative instrumentation; training that is critical to their scientific development. The facility will address research covering a broad range of research disciplines, including petrology, planetary geology, anthropology, the environment, engineering (pollutant remediation), nuclear forensics, geomicrobiology, and hydrology; the latter research areas having a direct impact on societal issues. Our proposed facility shall attract scientists/engineers and accompanying students from around the world to conduct their highly innovative research, which ultimately enhances the educational experiences of all involved.\r\n",
