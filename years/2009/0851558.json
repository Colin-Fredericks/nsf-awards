 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an REU program at Texas Christian University (TCU), which would involve 6-7 undergraduate students in 10 weeks of workshops and research in Physics or Astrophysics. The main goal of the program is to provide a memorable and potentially career-defining experience for student participants A carefully mentored research program, thoughtfully-selected field trips, weekly discussions with other students and faculty, and workshops on ethics in science, effective presentation and planning for graduate school, culminating in a final oral research presentation, provide opportunities for students to consider a broad range of career possibilities in physics and engineering fields. The expectation is that participants will give post-summer presentations of research at a professional science conference. TCU has a reputation for providing a nurturing learning environment with a low student-to-faculty ratio. This award is supported by the Physics Division and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences.",
