 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the REU site at Kansas State University which will have research opportunities for undergraduates focusing on interactions of laser light with matter at atomic and nanoscales. The participants will engage in significant research projects and related experiences during the summer. At the core of the program are the research projects with mentors from the faculty.  Participants will do research on how atoms and molecules behave in intense and ultra-fast optical and xray pulses, how scattered laser light reveals the structure of nanoparticle crystallization and gel formation, and how light interacts non-linearly in optical fibers; they will develop computer codes for calculations of atomic interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates and codes for modeling nanoparticle self-assembly from lattices to gels.  This experience will be supplemented by a small series of lectures that provide the background these students need to carry out their projects. The participants will gain experience in explaining their research work to a variety of audiences and will also engage in reading on and discussion of ethical behavior in science. Social activities, both organized and spontaneous, will enrich this undergraduate research experience.   This award is supported by the Physics Division and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences.",
