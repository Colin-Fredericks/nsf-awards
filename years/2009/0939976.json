The summer school will be co-located with the annual Design Automation Conference (DAC) to be held in San Francisco in July 2009.  DAC is the main annual event and a major conference in the field that is to be expected to be attended by most active researchers in the field. \r\n\r\nThe workshop speakers will be mostly established and prominent researchers in the field of microelectronic design automation. The fact that the summer school is co-located will be an added advantage in that the most speakers at the workshop will not need to spend additional effort for their travel.\r\n\r\nIn the past similar groups have organized very similar events that have been very successful in bringing young generation of researchers up to speed with state of the art tools and techniques in modern electronic design automation.  \r\nThis workshop is expected to have a similar impact.\r\n",
