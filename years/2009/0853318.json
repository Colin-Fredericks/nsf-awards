The conference will be held in Charleston, SC on June 1-5, 2009.\r\n  \r\nIntellectual Merit: The IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation is the premier international annual conference devoted to theoretical and experimental advances in antennas and electromagnetic wave propagation.  The students will have opportunity to participate in a high quality, peer-reviewed forum.  Participation at the conference and in the student paper competition will help in developing the students' communication and presentation skills and foster interaction with experts in the field.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Student participation at the AP-S and in the student paper competition not only promotes education but also helps to attract new talent into the fields of antennas and electromagnetics.  Support for the student paper activity will help in attracting a wide range of interested applicants from U.S. universities.",
