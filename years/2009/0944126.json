 "awd_abstract_narration": "The second workshop on Resource Discovery (RED)  is co-located with\r\nthe 35th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB)\r\non August 28, 2009, in Lyon, France. This project provides travel fellowships \r\nto students enrolled in US universities in order to attend the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is concerned with the design and development of models and \r\nprototypes that support the representation of resources, the discovery of \r\nresources on the Web, the identification, localisation, and composition of \r\nresources. A resource corresponds to an information source such as a data \r\nrepository or database management system (e.g., a query form or a textual \r\nsearch engine), a link between resources (an index or hyperlink), or a service \r\nsuch as an application or tool. Resources are characterized by core information \r\nincluding a name, a description of its input and its output (parameters or format), \r\nits address, and various additional properties expressed as metadata. Resource \r\ndiscovery is the process of identifying and locating existing resources that have a \r\nparticular property. Machine-based resource discovery relies on crawling, clustering, \r\nand classifying resources discovered on the Web automatically. Resources are \r\norganized with respect to metadata that characterize their content (for data sources), \r\ntheir semantics (in terms of ontological classes and relationships), their characteristics \r\n(syntactical properties), their performance (with metrics and benchmarks), their quality \r\n(curation, reliability, trust), etc. Resource discovery systems allow the expression of \r\nqueries to identify and locate resources that implement specific tasks.
