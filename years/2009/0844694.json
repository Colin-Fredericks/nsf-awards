 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Franco Basile at the University of Wyoming is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division to study a challenging area of an important analytical detection method - mass spectrometry. Specifically, Professor Basile's research centers on the use of non-enzymatic processes (e.g., microwave digestion, pyrolysis, and electrochemistry) as alternatives to typical enzymatic digestion for pre-treatment of biological samples for mass spectrometric analysis. The research combines historical techniques with modern practices. Outcomes of Dr. Basile's work are likely to make a significant contribution to many areas of mass spectrometry. For example, field portable mass spectrometers would greatly benefit from shortened sample preparation protocols and the dramatically reduced need for reagents - focus areas for this research project.\r\n\r\nDr. Basile integrates aspects of this work with the Summer Research in Analytical Chemistry (SRAC) Program, which includes participation of high school students and their teachers from around the State of Wyoming. The program fosters independent research skills and excitement about science for students, and equips teachers with better understanding of some of the tools used in modern analytical chemistry techniques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResults obtained during the funding period of this NSF-CAREER award were geared towards the development of rapid and novel sample preparation techniques for the analysis of complex samples by Mass Spectrometry (MS).  Our initial goal focused on the analysis of proteins, with a specific aim at development rapid proteomic sample preparation procedures.  In this respect, we developed rapid digestion of proteins for subsequent bottom-up proteomics.  With the techniques developed we are now able to fragment (i.e., digest) proteins either in solution or in films at unique amino acids positions (i.e., site-specific digestion) and within 10 seconds to 5 min.  These results represent at least an order in magnitude decrease in the digestion time when compared to enzymatic digestion of proteins.  In addition, we developed other methods for the rapid analysis of complex samples by MS, and these include coal, metabolites in selenium-rich fungi, carbohydrates in rain forest plants, protein profiles from intact microorganisms and complex lipids and sterols in unique bacteria.\n\nIntellectual Merit of Research:  investigations undertaken under this NSF-CAREER award were aimed at using heat to induce rapid (seconds to minutes) chemical reactions that result in site-specific cleavages in biological samples, and take advantage of this chemistry as a rapid sample preparation step.  Our investigations have found that enzyme-like cleavages can be induced in proteins in seconds to minutes by heating them either to high temperatures (~200-250 oC, 10 s) or by microwave heating (120 oC, 5 min) under controlled pH conditions.  The intellectual merit of this research is based on our discovery of unique reactions induced in biological molecules by the judicious control of thermal energy coupled with the MS analysis of the non-volatile products. Because of the inherent technical simplicity associated with generating/applying heat to a sample, this approach now offers a simple and rapid, yet specific and controlled mode for sample preparation that is easy to interface with MS due to its reagent-free nature.\n\nBroader Impact of Research:  The investigations funded through this NSF-CAREER award have developed methods with decreased sample analysis time as well as provide efficient sample preparation for high-throughput analyses.  Moreover, our studies of high temperature treatment of biological molecules unraveled new chemistries that add to our knowledge in the fields of biological MS, forensics, and abiotic nonenzymatic reactions.  The undertaken research not only advanced discovery, but promoted learning and teaching in the chemical instrumentation and analytical sciences.  Undergraduate and graduate students exposed to these projects benefited from hands-on training that is necessary for successful careers in industry, government and academics.  Moreover, participation of high school students and their teachers in demonstrations in the funded laboratory broadened the impact of the proposed research to students from rural areas, Native Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, women, and first generation-college students in the state of Wyoming.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/02/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Franco Basile"
