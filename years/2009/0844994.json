 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to overcome the limited bandwidth density and energy scaling of electrical interconnects, which have caused a slow-down in performance scaling of advanced integrated systems like manycore processors. The approach is to create scalable and robust transceiver circuits with integrated monolithic silicon photonics to provide seamless optical on-chip and off-chip communication with extremely high energy-efficiency and bandwidth density.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:  This research transforms the traditional research and design approaches by developing novel communication and circuit techniques through tight interaction with photonic device properties. Proposed solutions include robust, highly-digital circuits and system techniques for energy efficient nonlinear equalization and modulation as well as high-sensitivity optical data and clock receivers, and circuits for temperature control, testing and characterization. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This research will enable continued performance scaling of data centers and internet routers, and bring significant benefits to the national economy by preserving the massive investments and introducing the photonic technology into advanced CMOS foundries. Through MIT programs like Interphase Pre-UROP, Women Technology Program, and K-12 Educational Outreach Summer Program the project will engage women and minority undergraduate and high-school students and teachers in multi-disciplinary aspects of experimental research and design in engineering. A newly developed graduate course in communication circuit and system design will be adapted for senior-level undergraduates and co-development of entry-level undergraduate class. These courses, design tools and projects will be available on the internet through MIT Open Course Ware initiative.",
