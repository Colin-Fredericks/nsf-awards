 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and meets the requirements established in Section 2 of the White House Memorandum entitled, Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, dated March 20, 2009. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs globally distributed research teams work more closely to solve complex problems utilizing high-performance cyberinfrastructure, from petascale computers to specialized instrumentation generating massive amounts of data, the need for high-resolution visualization is becoming more critical for analysis, and is propelling the worldwide adoption of \"OptIPortals\". An OptIPortal is an ultra-resolution visualization display instrument interconnected by optical networks that enables the creation of \"cyber-mashups,\" or juxtapositions, of data visualizations, enabling greater insight.  SAGE, the Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment, is cross-platform middleware that enables users worldwide to have a common operating environment, or framework, for accessing, streaming and juxtaposing high-resolution visualizations on one or more OptIPortals. This project will transition SAGE from a transformative research prototype to a hardened technology that provides production-quality, community-driven open services for visualization and collaboration utilizing shared national and international cyberinfrastructure, for the advancement of scientific research and education.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nCoping with complexity and scale in data is a problem that spans all of e-science. Using OptIPortals and SAGE, scientists can create visualization pipelines from multiple sources - whether supercomputers, data storage systems and/or instruments (such as high-definition cameras), as well as laptop screens and the Web - to access and share a variety of information, in a variety of resolutions and formats, and create giant Cyber-Mashups.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nOur Nation already invests in network-connected, middleware-enabled cyberinfrastructure to generate and disseminate petabytes (ultimately exabytes) of data among researchers worldwide. What is missing, however, is a globally integrated collaborative work environment to facilitate data analysis and high productivity. Funding to provide a production-quality SAGE will make cyberinfrastructure more accessible to broader communities of scientists and students, and help maintain US leadership in high-performance computing.",
