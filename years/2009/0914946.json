Vertical trust captures trust\r\nrelationships between individuals and institutions, while horizontal\r\ntrust represents the trust inferred from the observations and opinions\r\nof other peers. Although significant benefit could be realized by\r\ncombining horizontal and vertical trust mechanisms, they have evolved\r\nindependently in computing systems.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on developing a composable trust model capable of\r\ntightly coupling vertical and horizontal trust in a manner that is\r\nboth amenable to formal analysis and efficiently deployable. This\r\nresearch advances the state of the art in trust management through a\r\nseries of innovative results, including the design of a unified\r\nframework for specifying composite trust policies and the design and\r\nanalysis of efficient algorithms for policy evaluation. The composite\r\ntrust management approach championed by this project also enables\r\npolicy authors to move beyond simple proof of compliance to identify\r\nthe \"top-k\" preferred users satisfying security policies including\r\nsubjective assessments. The beneficiaries of this research range from\r\nadministrators of traditional computing systems who can better\r\nincorporate previous history into their decision-making processes, to\r\nusers in social networks who can more carefully manage the exposure of\r\ntheir personal data.",
