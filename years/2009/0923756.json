 "awd_abstract_narration": "When nitrogen is limited in soils most legume plants form nitrogen-fixing nodules on their roots in symbiosis with soil bacteria called rhizobia.  Nodulated legumes utilize bioavailable nitrogen produced within the nodule, reducing nitrogen fertilizer requirements, thereby lowering energy costs and environmental pollution associated with crop production.  Recently a gene called NIP was found to be essential for the development of symbiotic nodules in the model legume plant Medicago truncatula. This project seeks to determine the role of NIP in nodule formation and root differentiation.  Experiments will discern NIP's developmental and temporal patterns of gene expression in nodules and roots and test how NIP expression at artificially high levels affects nodulation.  Cellular approaches will determine where the NIP gene and encoded protein are expressed.  The biochemical function of the NIP protein, a predicted transporter, will be assessed in a foreign host as well as directly in wild-type plants and those with a genetic defect in the NIP gene.  Physiological experiments will discern whether the NIP transporter is acting as part of a sensor system. The results from these experiments will yield information on the biochemical function of the NIP protein and provide a context for understanding NIP function in nodulation and other plant development pathways.  The broader impacts of this project include adding to the knowledge base of nodule development, part of what makes legume plants valuable in agriculture as a source of high-protein, high-fiber food for humans and animals. Training opportunities for a post-doctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of molecular and cell biology, genetics and biochemistry will be provided by this project.",

Improvements in food crop production in the past have relied on nitrogen fertilizer from the chemical industry. Use of nitrogen fertilizer is a double-edged sword. While it has increased crop yield, chemically-produced nitrogen fertilizer consumes up to two percent of global energy production. Only about half the nitrogen fertilizer applied to agricultural lands is absorbed by crops and an appreciable amount runs off, damaging the environment. Nitrogen fertilizer can also be converted into greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Legume crop and forage plants like alfalfa, pea and soybean are different. When soil nitrogen is lacking but not when an abundant nitrogen source is present, legumes can form unique root nodule structures with soil bacteria called rhizobia. The nodules produce (&ldquo;fix&rdquo;) bioavailable nitrogen from the air, reducing nitrogen fertilizer requirements and thus lower energy costs and environmental pollution. This ability is not present in cereal crops like corn, rice and wheat. This has led to scientific interest in trying to transfer the ability to host nitrogen-fixing rhizobia in nodules to non-legumes like cereals and to increase the efficiency of nitrogen fixation in legumes as an alternative to increased fertilizer production. To do this, it is important to first understand the crucial mechanisms legumes use to establish nodules. This project focused on a specific piece of the puzzle, a protein originally called NIP or LATD and now named MtNPF1.7. It was first found in the model legume <em>Medicago truncatula</em>, a close relative of the forage legume alfalfa. MtNPF1.7 is essential for nitrogen-fixing nodule formation and is required for other aspects of normal root growth. Data obtained showed that the <em>MtNPF1.7</em> gene is active in parts of the root and nodule where cells divide and are growing in size. The project revealed that appropriate differentiation of nodule cells fails to occur in the absence of MtNPF1.7 function. Results established that MtNPF1.7 is able to transport nitrate, a form of chemical nitrogen fertilizer often used in agriculture. The project showed that MtNPF1.7 transports nitrate at concentrations below the level where nitrate inhibits nodule formation. This remains an enigma because legume plants are able to form nodules with rhizobia when nitrate is completely absent, yet MtNPF1.7 is required for nodule formation. The deduction from this enigma, supported by other data, is that MtNPF1.7 has another function, as yet incompletely deciphered. Intriguingly, results showed that when three different species of plants are modified so that MtNPF1.7 is made in every cell, they grow bigger. This latter finding was the subject of a US patent.
