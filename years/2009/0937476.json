 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips and systems, for technical exchange on current areas of architectural challenge. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded conference by obtaining travel support for students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in the ISCA conference in June, 2009 in Austin, TX. \r\n\r\nThe PIs propose to provide travel support in the approximate amount of $15,000 for around 40 U.S.-based student (at least $300 each).  The vast majority of the awards will be granted to Ph.D. students. Priority will be granted to students who have authored papers accepted for presentation at the conference or its joint workshops, in particular those students without existing travel support.",
