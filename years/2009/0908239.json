These topics touch upon a large variety of areas of\r\nfundamental and applied analysis, including frame theory,\r\npseudodifferential operator theory, Banach modules and\r\nrepresentations of locally compact Abelian groups, non-standard\r\nmultiresolution analysis, and signal processing.  The problems\r\nstudied in this project address interesting and important\r\nquestions regarding certain mathematical tools on which modern\r\nsignal processing is based.  The project is also expected to lead\r\nto new questions in more fundamental analysis, thus promoting\r\ncross-fertilization of the fields. \r\n\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues develop a mathematical\r\nframework aimed to address various problems posed by the deluge\r\nof data in the modern world.  Potential applications include\r\nimage processing, wireless communications, and others. \r\nParticular attention is given to an application for proton\r\ncomputed tomography.  Broader impact of the proposed activities\r\nincludes integration of research and education, dissemination of\r\nknowledge, and enhancement of interdisciplinary collaboration,\r\nboth domestic and international. \r\n",
