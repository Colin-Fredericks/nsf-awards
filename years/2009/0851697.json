 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\r\n\r\nThe Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University will host a summer REU program for 2009-20011. Each summer, six students will be selected nationwide for these programs, with recruitment efforts targeted at smaller colleges at universities and towards attracting underrepresented minorities (specifically Native Americans and Hispanics.) The Department has hosted REU students for the past 14 summers and its faculty have experience both in the selection of quality students and in the feasibility of 8-week student research projects. The intellectual merit of the program lies In the fact that it will allow its student participants to experience the research process by working on a problem that is both suitable and challenging, carrying out literature searches, giving an oral presentation of their work and writing up their results in a form suitable for publication. Publication in a refereed journal is considered a goal for students in the program.",
