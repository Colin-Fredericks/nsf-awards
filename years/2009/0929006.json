They will create three project products and will utilize the Internet, public television, and existing networks to share what works and what does not to increase the successful participation of people with disabilities in STEM.  All project products will be designed to be accessible to people with disabilities.  Products include:\r\n\r\nWebsite:  A password-protected collaborative 'wiki' that engages RDE-funded projects in developing products and dissemination plans, including those for sharing information about projects, outcomes, and materials on the Internet.\r\n\r\nVideo:  A video that shows how high school, college, and graduate students and employees with disabilities succeed in STEM and highlights the RDE-funded Alliances for Students with Disabilities in STEM as resources.\r\n\r\nBrochure: A concise brochure that includes information and results regarding all RDE-funded Alliances for Students with Disabilities in STEM and pointers to the project website for the project video and additional information and resources.\r\n\r\nAll project products will promote creative and potentially transformative concepts. The project evaluation will document (1) high quality, useful, and accessible resources; (2) effective distribution methods; and (3) increased engagement of RDE projects.\r\n\r\nThe external formative and summative evaluation for this project will be conducted by Dr. Gerald Gillmore.",
