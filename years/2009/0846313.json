 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to integrate nanophotonics with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to understand the regulation of gene expression under controlled perturbations. The approach is to develop luminous scanning probe-based platform for light transmission, concentration and live imaging at the tip. By adjusting the light intensity, one can directly perturb sub-cellular structures through nano-surgery or micro-ablation. Through the integrated near-field scanning optical microscopy, one can observe in real time the evolution of gene expression in live embryos during perturbation. The measurement data will set the foundation for an electronic library of gene expressions correlated to distinct perturbations. \r\n\r\nThis research will develop, for the first time, a versatile microsystem with tip-light manipulation,  enhancement, probe actuation and sensing, and near-field imaging functions. Perturbing the microenvironment is a complementary approach to modifying the genetic components of the developmental network. Using nanophotonic microsystems with unprecedented accuracy, this research can lead to significant advancement in the understanding of mechanisms crucial for robust development and engineering of substrates to guide organism development with controllable genetic characteristics. \r\n\r\nThis research can be of broader use on integrating heterogeneous nanosystems. It will also have a profound impact on biomedicine to enhance understanding of how environment-introduced ?errors? in gene action may lead to birth defects and cancer. The program has multiple integral educational initiatives, including the development of new teaching modules on nanophotonic Microsystems, cross-training of life science students at the frontiers of device engineering; and the establishment of ?Young Biomedical Engineers?(y-BME) program to recruit minority and female students. \r\n\r\n",
