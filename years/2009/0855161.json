 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nIn this project the PIs proposes to investigate the structure of the cerebral cortex with noninvasive diffusion-sensitive Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI). At macroscopic scale, the human cerebral cortex consists of an estimated 50 or so discrete areas of distinct structure identifiable only at the microscopic level but of immense importance as each corresponds to a specialized function. These fundamental divisions, however, are impossible to discern with contemporary MRI. Recently, one of the PIs made a dramatic progress in MRI of the fiber pathways of cerebral white matter using diffusion spectrum MRI or DSI to obtain a large-scale fiber connectivity of the human brain, or the connectome. The aim of this collaborative project is to extend DSI from white matter into the gray matter by developing and validating a diffusion MRI methodology to image the intrinsic structure and connectivity of discrete cortical gray matter areas. Undergraduate, doctoral and post-doctoral level students will receive interdisciplinary training in their interactions with the other two collaborative labs. In this way students will be trained in the cross-disciplinary methods of this project, obtaining hands on familiarity with the ideas and methods of modern neuroscience, neuroimaging, and concepts of condensed matter physics. Additionally, these studies will be of interest to the scientific media and public. These studies offer an opportunity to present neuroscience, its goals, methods, and uses, to a broad general audience, both nationally and internationally. The present proposal mixes diverse disciplines and so offers a fertile opportunity for student education. Under the auspices of the NSF Distinguished Teacher Scholar (DTS) Award, co-PI Stanley's research group will continue to work intensely with high school students and with college non-science majors through designing hands-on activities that encourage the student to ask questions and better understand the activities of a practicing scientist.",
