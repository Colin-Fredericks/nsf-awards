 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Brazil Workshop proposal will support U.S. graduate students in establishing and expanding research collaborations with Brazilian counterparts.  The U.S. researchers will work under the leadership of PI R.P.H. Chang of Northwestern University and the Brazilian team will work with Dr. Guillermo Solorzano from the Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio).  The proposed workshop, scheduled for September 2009, offers a unique model for preparing the next generation of US researchers to take part in global research initiatives.  The purpose of the workshop is to: (a) match U.S. students with Brazilian students that have complementary research interests and capabilities to plan potential collaborative research projects; (b) visit facilities at Brazilian universities, research institutes and industry labs; (c) attend a series of relevant lectures, industry exhibits and poster sessions; and (d) present their project plans for review by senior researchers and agency representatives.",
