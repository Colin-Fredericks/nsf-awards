 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nature provides many interesting examples of liquid interacting with nano-patterned surfaces to achieve a variety of functions such as repelling water and contaminants.  Nanotechnology, on the other hand, enables manufacturing of nanoscale surface structures that could significantly alter surface hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity. The objective of this SGER proposal is to explore nanomanufacturing methods to fabricate nanoscale surface structures with asymmetric features and characterize their effects on liquid-surface interactions. A two-step, novel lithography method will be developed in this study. Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) will be employed to produce high aspect ratio, asymmetric surface features in single crystalline silicon wafer. Different asymmetric patterns will be explored. Measurements will be carried out to characterize the hydrophobicity change of these surfaces as a function of asymmetric features. It is expected that such surface structures could be utilized to achieve functionalities that are not available in engineered materials and structures today.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the interactions between liquid droplets and patterned surfaces will help address important issues in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The manufacturing method developed in this project will pave the way to creating complex surface nanostructures. Understanding the mechanisms of liquid-solid surface interactions in the presence of asymmetric surface nanostructures will provide materials that could be self-cleaning, or surface structures that may be used to repel or collect liquid. Moreover, training of graduate students in the proposed exploratory research gives them the chances to experience the progressive stages of scientific research, which will benefit their career in the future.\r\n",
