 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to continue research in three inter-related areas. The first \r\nconcerns geometric approximation of Kaehler metrics by Bergman metrics. \r\nThe work of Tian, Yau and Zelditch shows that Kaehler metrics can be \r\nsmoothly approximated by Bergman metrics, and this ``quantization process\r\nhas found numerous striking applications to Kaehler geometry. The PI, in \r\njoint work with Phong, has shown that this approximation holds as well at \r\nthe geometric level: thus, geodesic segments and geodesic rays can be \r\ncanonically approximated by segments and rays in the space of Bergman \r\nmetrics. The first project is aimed at deepening our understanding of the \r\nstructure of the space of Kaehler metrics: The PI will investigate higher \r\ndimensional analogues of such Bergman approximations using methods of PDE \r\nand pluri-potential theory. The second project concerns K-stability and \r\nconstant scalar curvature metrics. Here the motivating question is a \r\nconjecture of Donaldson which asserts that the non-existence of a csc \r\nmetric should imply the existence of a geodesic ray along which the \r\nK-energy decreases. The PI will study this via the geodesic rays \r\nassociated to test configurations (constructed in joint work with Phong). \r\nThe next key step in this program is to prove C^{1,1} regularity of these \r\nrays using some of the recent advances in pluri-potential theory. The \r\nthird project concerns the Kaehler-Ricci flow. The goal is to relate the \r\nS-condition and the B-condition (introduced in joint work with Phong, and \r\nstudied as well in joint work with Song and Weinkove) to some of the more \r\nclassical notions of stability in algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main theme of this proposal concerns the Einstein equation, which \r\noriginally arose in the theory of general relativity. The great insight \r\nfrom physics is that many of the mysteries of the universe can be \r\nexplained if one accepts the notion that our universe is curved. This \r\nconceptual breakthrough may be compared to the discovery, dating back to \r\nthe early Greek philosophers, that the surface of the earth is curved. The \r\nEinstein equation gives a mathematical formulation of the curvature \r\nproperties of the universe which is precise enough to make accurate \r\npredictions for a vast range of large scale physical phenomena. It turns \r\nout, for reasons that remain quite obscure, that the same Einstein \r\nequations can also be used to resolve deep and longstanding problems in \r\ntopology and geometry. The partial differential equations that arise in \r\nthis approach are non-linear, and their study requires a broad range of \r\ntools from real and complex analysis, as well as algebraic and \r\ndifferential geometry. This project will investigate the interplay between \r\nthese various branches of mathematics, with the goal of furthering the \r\nunderstanding of fundamental geometric structures.\r\n\r\n",
