The award is made to Professor George Jiracek in the Department of Geological Sciences at San Diego State University.  The participating U.S. graduate and undergraduate students will collaborate with researchers at the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS) in Avalon, New Zealand, which is one of the world?s premier organizations committed to sustainable management of renewable geothermal energy.  Their foreign collaborators at the Institute are Dr. T. Grant Caldwell and Dr. Stephen Bannister.  The students will focus on enhanced exploration aimed at the development of geothermal energy for electricity generation, industrial processes, and buildings by assisting in field experiments, data reduction, and interpretation.  Specific research projects will include:  1) Geophysical monitoring of re-injection and production drilling; 2) Characterization of deep geothermal resources; 3) Characterization of Fracture Systems; and 4) MT (modeling techniques), Seismic, and Hydrothermal 3-D Modeling.  Results from any of these research projects will provide important findings for the world-wide geothermal community and provide excellent source material for papers at professional meetings and in scientific journals.  The students will also visit New Zealand?s Taupo Volcanic Zone for a geologic overview in one of the world?s most famous geothermal setting followed by a visit to an operating geothermal power plant where they will be taking hands-on geophysical measurements.\r\n\r\nA major emphasis of the project is to engage U.S. students in meaningful projects with international students and faculty.  Students will work closely with researchers with different scientific backgrounds and will learn field and laboratory techniques that will enhance their research skills.  Altogether, these experiences will increase the networking and international competitiveness of the student participants.  By intentionally creating opportunities for first-generation, minority, and female students, the research program will have broad impacts on geological education and research.",
