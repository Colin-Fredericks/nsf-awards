The project is addressing three key questions that have been suggested by prospects for fundamental technology-driven change in the character of STEM education:\r\n\r\nHow could STEM education look very different in the near and long-term future? \r\n \r\nWhat development and study of instructional materials, models, and technologies would be required to make those future visions possible? \r\n \r\nWhat design, development, and diffusion processes are most likely to produce new approaches to STEM education that are actually implemented in schools?\r\n\r\nThe goals of the working group activity are an innovation research and development agenda for STEM educators, activation of community interest in work on the tasks of that agenda, and guidance for funding agencies and professional organizations that provide support for the work.",
