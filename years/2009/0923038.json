 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe PIs are requesting funds to acquire a scanning mobility particle sizer, a Proton Transfer Time of Flight mass spectrometer (PRToFMS), and an isotope ratio mass spectrometer.  This suite of instrumentation will allow the PIs to examine biogeochemical properties and reaction mechanisms, and allow modeling of processes that govern the exchange of organic gaseous and condensed matter between the marine and atmospheric environments.  Research efforts enabled by the proposed instrumentation include investigations into:  the organic fraction of primary marine aerosols; marine biogenically driven volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions; compound-specific isotopic composition to differentiate between marine and terrestrial emissions; isotopic composition of carbon monoxide trapped in ice cores; chemical transformation of organic aerosol particles; effect of chemical aging on ice nucleation; polychlorinated biphenyl transformations on mineral surfaces; development of novel catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons; sedimentary diagenetic processes and seabed fluxes; and reconstructing food web structure in shallow enclosed bays.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed instrumentation will provide expanded analytical capability for the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, as well as across Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Additionally, the proposed instrumentation will be incorporated into the existing REU program at the institution, as well as into the Science and Technology Entry summer residential program, providing hands-on training opportunities for both undergraduates and secondary school students.\r\n",
