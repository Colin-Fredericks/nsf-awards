The request includes two items listed by priority:\r\n\t1) Replacement CTD Frame\r\n\t2) Network Upgrades\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. The addition of the water sampling equipment that was damaged as well as the upgrading of the computer systems will enhance the research effectiveness of the coastal vessel R/V Sharp.",
