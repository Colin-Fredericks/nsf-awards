 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe PI will investigate several aspects of polynomial mappings and\r\nrelated matters.  One topic involves orbits of complex polynomials.\r\nThe proposer will study when the cartesian product of finitely many such\r\norbits has infinitely many points in common with an algebraic subvariety of\r\naffine space.  This is a dynamical analogue of the Mordell--Lang conjecture\r\nabout intersections of subgroups and subvarieties of group varieties.\r\nAnother topic is to determine the polynomials over a field\r\nof positive characteristic inducing mappings with certain properties;\r\nthese properties can be recorded in the monodromy group of the polynomial,\r\nso the problem is to determine polynomials with prescribed monodromy group.\r\nVia a splitting field construction, polynomials with unusual monodromy groups\r\ngive rise to curves with large automorphism group.  Such polynomials could\r\nthus be classified if one could classify curves with large automorphism\r\ngroup over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, which\r\nis the next topic the PI will study.  A fourth topic is the\r\ntheoretical and algorithmic analysis of the problem of computing the intersection\r\nof two subfields of the field of rational functions, along with generalizations\r\nto mappings between curves.  A final topic addresses connections between\r\ndiscrete mathematics and algebraic geometry, for instance via connecting certain\r\ncombinatorial objects (Kloosterman sums) with parameter spaces (Shimura curves).\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on polynomials.\r\nThe classical topic of dynamical systems studies the orbit of\r\na number under a polynomial,\r\nwhich is the collection of numbers obtained by repeatedly applying\r\nthe polynomial to the number.  For instance, the orbit of the number 1\r\nunder the polynomial f(x)=3x+1  is 1, 4, 13, 40, and so on.\r\nOne question is when one such orbit can contain infinitely many numbers\r\nwhose square is in an orbit of another polynomial.  More generally, the\r\nPI will study when there is a polynomial relationship between infinitely\r\nmany points in one orbit and infinitely many in another.  The proposer\r\nintends to determine all examples of this phenomenon by proving new\r\nresults about certain types of identities of the form a(b(x))=c(d(x)),\r\nwhere a, b, c and d are rational functions (i.e., ratios of polynomials).\r\n",
