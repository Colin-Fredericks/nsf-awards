The first group of projects will have\r\napplications in Gromov-Witten theory and ``cohomological'' mirror\r\nsymmetry, that is, in the sense of Givental etc.  With F. Ziltener and\r\nhis former postdoctoral advisee E. Gonzalez he will investigate\r\nfunctoriality for Gromov-Witten invariants under the symplectic\r\nquotient construction.  Potential applications include invariance of\r\nGromov-Witten invariants under symplectic birational equivalence, to\r\ncohomological mirror symmetry for complete intersections of general\r\ntype.  With K. Wehrheim and his former student S. Mau the PI will\r\nstudy functoriality of Lagrangian correspondences in Floer-Fukaya\r\ntheory.  Applications include symplectic definitions of non-abelian\r\nFloer homology for tangles and arbitrary three-manifolds, possible\r\ngeneralizations of Khovanov homology and categorification of quantum\r\ngroups.  These projects will have applications in homological mirror\r\nsymmetry and low-dimensional topology.  Some of the projects have a\r\ngraduate education component, and the PI also proposes several\r\nundergraduate research projects.\r\n\r\nOverall the research carried out under this grant will advance the\r\nunderstanding of symplectic geometry, which is the mathematical\r\nlanguage for classical dynamical systems, and the relationship between\r\ngauge theory, representation theory, and quantum physics.  Gauge\r\ntheories arise naturally in a number of physical settings, such as\r\nelectromagnetism.  The first part of the project concerns certain\r\ngauge theories with an addition \"non-linear\" field taking values in a\r\nclassical phase space, which have been substantially studied in the\r\nphysics literature in the linear case under the name \"gauged sigma\r\nmodels\".  The second part of the project concerns the structural\r\nproperties of \"Floer-theoretical\" invariants which have been\r\nextensively studied in relation to dynamical systems in recent years.\r\n",
