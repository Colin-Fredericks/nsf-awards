 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nObjective: \r\nThis program will demonstrate semiconductor-based tuning mechanisms for active control of mid-infrared (mid-IR) plasmonic structures and the integration of these mechanisms with surface-plasmon based devices for sensing applications. This includes 1) development of semiconductor-based tuning mechanisms to control the spectral properties of plasmonic structures with optical resonances in the mid-infrared, 2) investigation of the enhanced mid-IR absorption of materials on planar plasmonic surfaces and finally 3) integration of tunable plasmonic materials into prototype mid-IR sensing systems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe field of plasmonics is of significant current interest for applications in display technology, sensing, and optical interconnects, to name only a few. The vast majority of the research in plasmonics has been in the visible/near-IR or terahertz wavelength ranges, and has focused on passive devices. The mid-infrared, however, is a technologically important wavelength range for sensing applications, and offers the possibility of integrating plasmonic devices with traditional semiconductor materials. The proposed research is transformative in nature as it will 1) advance the understanding of surface-plasmon enhanced absorption in the mid-IR, 2) lead to actively tunable plasmonic materials with broad tuning ranges, and 3) demonstrate novel compact systems for optical sensing applications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe development of active plasmonic devices will lead to new compact sensor systems, with environmental, medical, and industrial sensing applications. In addition, the proposed work contains a significant education and outreach component, which will lead to laboratory-based research opportunities for undergraduates at UMass Lowell and Connecticut College, as well as K-12 students in the Lowell public school system.",
