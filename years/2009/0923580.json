 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award funds the acquisition of a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) biomolecule purification system to support an interdisciplinary consortium of Seattle University faculty, their programs in undergraduate student-faculty research, interdepartmental collaboration, and scientific community outreach.  Faculty research enabled by the FPLC will be translated back into the classroom in support of Seattle University's educational mission. The instrument will provide research training to students on the industry-standard purification system and supply practical experience for undergraduates continuing on to graduate school or obtaining technical positions in the biotechnology industry.  \r\n\r\nFaculty members from the Biology, Chemistry, Nursing, and Mechanical Engineering departments will utilize the FPLC across a wide range of scientific research areas including pharmacology/toxicology, biological chemistry, microbiology, evolutionary biology, toxicology, and bioengineering; all of which focus on essential questions of biological significance while promoting the training of future scientists and professionals. Student-faculty research and the technological innovation of the FPLC will be directly incorporated into advanced courses, and all faculty research projects are substantially conducted by undergraduate researchers. Additionally, Service-learning partnerships with local middle school science classes will lead to increased interest and appreciation for the biological sciences, and continued scientific exploration for participating middle school students.  Project outcomes will be available through the Seattle University Interdisciplinary Life Sciences Research Lab website.",
