 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the investigators is to encourage talented undergraduate \r\nstudents to pursue graduate study and research careers in computer science.  The \r\nprogram directly impacts students by giving them first-hand experience with some \r\nof the most rewarding activities that characterize graduate study and research \r\ncareers: conducting research as a team, disseminating results, and participating \r\nin a community of scholars.  The research projects are drawn from a number of \r\nimportant fields of computer science.  The importance of teamwork and participating \r\nin a scholarly community is emphasized to the students.  It should be noted that all \r\nof the student participants in this program are enrolled at undergraduate-only \r\ninstitutions.  Thus, the program extends research experiences to students who are \r\nnot enrolled in large research institutions, and who thus might not have the \r\nopportunity to participate in research otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe particular projects vary with the specialties and interests of the faculty \r\nmembers participating in any given year.  Project areas include pen-based computing, \r\ncomputer-supported cooperative work, assistive technology (text navigation for the \r\nvisually impaired), natural language processing (text summarization), functional \r\nprogramming languages, wireless sensor networks, programming pedagogy, and virtual \r\nreality.  In addition to providing an orientation to their research projects, \r\nfaculty mentors sponsor orientation activities to help the students appreciate the \r\nnature of research and the value of working cooperatively.  Students are encouraged \r\nto collaborate formally and informally.  Students have several opportunities to \r\npresent their work to other REU participants as well as to external audiences.  \r\nFinally, students learn about the graduate school application process in part by \r\nvisiting a major research university.",
