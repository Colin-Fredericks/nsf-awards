 "awd_abstract_narration": "McLaughlin\r\nDMS-0852516\r\n\r\n     The investigator and her collagues organize a series of five\r\nworkshops in five different application areas of inverse\r\nproblems.  All of the represented fields are advancing rapidly\r\nand in all cases the mathematical advances, the engineering\r\nadvances and the new experiments enabled by new technology or\r\ninnovative ideas combine together to make a rich opportunity for\r\nnew research projects at the interface of disciplines.  It is\r\nexpected that research projects will be inspired, and in some\r\ncases be newly developed, as a result of the workshops.  The\r\npresentations include state of the art techniques in mathematical\r\nsciences and engineering; an important addition in some of the\r\nworkshops is the inclusion of experimentalists who describe their\r\nlatest advances, the data sets that are obtained from those\r\nexperiments, and their anticipated results from that data.  Early\r\ncareer participants, including a strong representation of\r\nparticipants from underrepresented groups, are targeted.  The\r\nInverse Problems Center, IPRPI, provides an ideal environment to\r\nhold these workshops. \r\n\r\n     The problem areas being targeted all impact quality of life\r\nand safety of individuals.  Two of the workshops specifically\r\ntarget medical imaging; one is in imaging of biomechanical tissue\r\nproperties, a new, very fast moving area with significant success\r\nanticipated, and another considers diffusion optical tomography,\r\nwhich also has a great deal of promise.  Successes in these two\r\nareas significantly impact human health.  Two other workshops\r\nemphazize identification in geosystems and waveform tomography. \r\nBoth target understanding the effects of earthquake dynamics, as\r\nwell as the identification of new energy sources.  As such, the\r\nsafety of individuals and quality of individual life is strongly\r\naffected.  Finally, the microlocal analysis workshop emphasizes a\r\nbroad set of application areas, including radar imaging, which is\r\nan important homeland security component.  Much of the grant\r\nsupports participants who are students, postdocs, junior faculty,\r\nwomen, and other under-represented groups. \r\n",
