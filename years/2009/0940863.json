 "awd_abstract_narration": "This purpose of this grant is to support an International Conference \r\non Advances in Scientific Computing at Brown University on December \r\n6-8, 2009, to honor the memory of Professor David Gottlieb and to \r\nreview recent advances and explore exciting new directions in \r\nscientific computing and related numerical solution of partial\r\ndifferential equations and mathematical modeling for time dependent \r\nproblems and their applications.  A notable feature of this \r\nconference will be the emphasis on the crucial role of significant \r\nmathematics in the design of advanced algorithms applicable to real \r\nworld problems.  The conference will include invited speakers \r\nranging from numerical analysts with a strong interest in \r\napplications, to applied and computational mathematicians to \r\nengineers, physicists and scientists in other fields.  The list of \r\ninvited speakers includes both very senior leaders in the field\r\nand relatively young scientists.  Represented in this list are both \r\nwomen and minority mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe proposed conference will be an effective venue for the exchange \r\nof ideas among a diversified list of invited speakers and \r\nparticipants.  It will provide valuable guidance to young \r\nparticipants to identify promising problems and application areas.  \r\nIt is expected that this conference will push forward the research \r\nin algorithm design and applications utilizing significant \r\nmathematics to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  These \r\nalgorithms have been and will continue to be widely used in \r\napplications which are of national interest, including homeland\r\nsecurity (image processing and pattern recognizing), environment,\r\naerospace engineering, communications, energy science, and climate\r\nmodeling.",
