 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER proposal funded by the Science, Technology and Society Program supports a workshop on science policy for younger scholars.  The workshop reflects an awareness that complex problems of science, technology, and society are conspicuously, perhaps uniquely, apparent in national politics today. Yet there is an absence of a community of science policy scholars who can span the terrains of intellectual inquiry and real-world practice to contribute to public deliberation and democratic decision making on these problems. A national competition is conducted to identify members of the next generation of leaders of science and technology policy.  Successful applicants are brought together for a workshop, hosted by Arizona State University?s Consortium for Science, Policy, and Outcomes, aimed at helping them advance their careers, promote their ideas, develop new ideas and collaborations, develop their capabilities as public intellectuals, and catalyze their participation in an emergent network of potential science and technology policy leaders.",
