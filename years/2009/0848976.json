 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cynthia K. Larive of the University of California, Riverside is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to work on the development of capillary isotachophoresis-nuclear magnetic resonance (cITP-NMR) methodology for the analysis and structure determination of oligosaccharides from important biopolymers like heparin and chondroitin sulfate. This work also aims to advance methods for the separation of these molecules by reverse-phase ion-pairing chromatography and includes magic angle spinning NMR experiments as an aid to understanding the nature of the intermolecular interactions among the analyte, the ion pairing reagent, and the chromatographic stationary phase.\r\n\r\nThis research offers potential applications in biochemistry and the pharmaceutical industry, which rely heavily on separation methods for compound purification and characterization.  In addition, the work offers students (including undergraduates and members of underrepresented groups) opportunities for experience with state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation and methodology.  Research advances will be incorporated in the classroom, bringing the excitement of research to students at an early stage of their education.  Educational aspects of this work will be disseminated through the Analytical Sciences Digital Library, http://www.asdlib.org, a free portal of peer-reviewed and annotated electronic resources for teachers, learners and practitioners of analytical science.",
