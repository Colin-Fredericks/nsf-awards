 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to combine a high-mobility semiconductor and a highly piezoelectric material to produce acoustic charge transfer (ACT) devices giving performance significantly improved over current devices. ACTs were developed from surface-acoustic wave filters to be capable of complex programmable filtering functions on high-speed analog signals. The approach is to exploit chip-to-chip bonding techniques to fabricate a novel structure consisting of a piezoelectric substrate supporting a quantum-well. \r\nThe intellectual merit of this research is to enable transformational improvement of ACT devices which currently need high power input to propel charges using a weakly piezoelectric semiconductor. Using a highly piezoelectric material, the power input requirement for moving charge through the quantum-well layer is substantially reduced. Initial estimates using available data show over one thousand times reduction in the input power required (e.g., from 0.35W to 300\u00ecW using typical device design parameters). This level of improvement is unprecedented and if successful would allow ACT devices to take their place as an important and competitive signal-processing device rather than as a power-hungry curiosity. \r\nBroader impacts include capitalizing on the PI?s frequent appearances as a scientific communicator in the broadcast media; transforming the electronic device landscape by allowing ACT usage in applications where power is at a premium; integrating research and educational goals by providing support to undergraduate Senior Design projects as well as training graduate students in techniques of both signal-processing and microfabrication, essential for future technology development; and promotion of diversity through close involvement in University minority programs.",
