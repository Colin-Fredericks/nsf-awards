 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This project is a collaboration between Drexel University and Merck Inc & Co and addresses the processing and optimization of multilayered tablets.  Multilayer tablets are becoming a key drug delivery method for coexisting medical conditions and multidrug therapies.  These tablets tend to split during production and storage.  A science-based optimization of their design and processing is needed to ensure quality by design. To this end, the goals of this project include: (a) experimental probing of the propensity of multilayer tablets to splitting (b) study of their nonlinear mechanical behavior, (c) continuum and mesoscale modeling of the stresses near the interface, (d) validation of model prediction, and (e) generation of processing maps that link process parameters and properties of multilayered tablets. \r\n\r\nThe combination of two medications in one tablet is a major step forward in the development of novel therapies of coexisting conditions or combination drug treatments.  The results of this work will promote industrial innovation and productivity with direct effects on consumers? health and potential cost benefits.  This project will provide a communication conduit between industry and academia.  Co-op opportunities for undergraduate and graduate internships will be set-up at Merck.  Further involvement of undergraduates in this project will be implemented through the NSF-REU Site DREAM at Drexel. Merck researchers will take industrial sabbaticals at Drexel University. Annual user group meetings will include scientists from pharmaceutical companies in the PA-NJ-DE area.\r\n",
