 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major aim of this research is to design, implement and apply a full-spectral interrogator for FBG sensors operating at high data acquisition rates and the associated signal processing algorithms required to interpret the acquired spectral data. The performance of the interrogator and sensor system will be evaluated for two applications: (1) the identification of sub-surface damage states in woven composite specimens subjected to multiple low-velocity impact events and (2) structural health monitoring of bonded composite joints. The FBG sensor grating structure (profile) will also be optimized for each of these two damage identification and structural health monitoring cases based on the ability of the inversion and signal processing algorithms to uniquely identify damage conditions. The research plan is a collaborative effort between researchers in the Mechanical and Aerospace Department at North Carolina State University and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University. The PIs will also work in collaboration with programs at the two universities to prepare diverse students for engineering and scientific undergraduate careers.",
