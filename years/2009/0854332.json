Practical and effective strategies to minimize biofilm occurrence and reduce public health risks, however, remain to be developed, due to the lack of adequate understanding of the microbial processes underlying biofilm occurrence, particularly in premise plumbing which represents over 85% of the total distribution system but has not received adequate research attention. The research objective of the proposed project is to identify the processes responsible for the survival and adaptation of biofilm microbial communities in premise plumbing.  The research will be conducted by using community-level characterization of biofilm functional processes. This research will use a community-level approach combining high-throughput DNA microarray-based functional analysis and 16S rRNA gene-based molecular microbial ecology tools for the characterization of biofilm microbial communities in premise plumbing systems of distinct characteristics. \r\n\r\nThis research will provide much needed insight into fundamental processes controlling biofilm persistence which would enable the development of effective strategies for the minimization of biofilms in premise plumbing by targeting key processes that facilitate biofilm occurrence. Results from this work will also enable improved risk assessment, design guidelines and regulations for premise plumbing by providing much needed data regarding the impact of plumbing material, water use pattern, environmental factors, and water quality characteristics on microbial contamination in premise plumbing. \r\n\r\nImproved understanding of the microbial processes controlling the development of biofilm in water distribution systems, particularly premise plumbing, will lead to more effective strategies to minimize microbial contamination of drinking water and enhanced safety of drinking water. This will lead further to minimized occurrence of waterborne diseases, increased use of public water supply, and reduced use of additional purification devices and bottled water. Our society will benefit through reduced heath care costs and more sustainable uses of energy and resources. In addition, the proposed research provides an excellent example of the application of genomics and microbiology in environmental engineering. Thus the infusion of research results from the proposed work into classroom teaching will better prepare students for learning and working in the increasingly interdisciplinary filed of environmental engineering. More importantly, the participation of minority students from a local urban high school in the proposed project will ensure that underrepresented students have the educational exposure crucial to their success in learning and working in the engineering profession.",
