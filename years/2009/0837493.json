 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rochester Institute of Technology proposes to increase the participation of students with visual impairments in computing by providing better preparation and support for them, as well as increased professional development opportunities for their teachers. There are four objectives: (1) increase the number of students with visually impairments who enter computing programs at the post-secondary level, (2) increase instructional opportunities for students are visually impaired in grades seven through twelve, (3) increase the preparation of computing teachers at the secondary level, and (4) provide ongoing support for computing educators and students while the students are in secondary school or making the transition to post-secondary education. Summer workshops and year-round follow-up activities will be developed to provide middle and high school-aged students with the opportunity to explore computing in a multi-modal, hands-on environment with their parents.  An annual workshop will be held to train special education and computing educators from secondary schools. The Project ACE website will be expanded to include a multimedia career zone to learn about being a student and practitioner pursuing computing.  In addition, a 2-day conference for industry, STEM professionals who are visually impaired, students and their families will be held in collaboration with the National Federation of the Blind to explore the issues, opportunities and successes regarding participation in computing by the visually impaired community.",

Due to the visual nature of many user interfaces, students with visual impairments need accomodating methods, support, and tools to support their exploration and participation in computing.  Project ACE (Accessible Computing Education) focused on addressing gaps in the preparation and encouragement that exists in computing participation by middle and high school students who are visually impaired.  Increasing such participation enables students to be prepared for post-secondary computing education and careers. Technical preperation in computer programming and hardware includded the use of robotics as the main platform to engage students.  The popularity of robotics in the pre-college classroom also served as a gateway to long-term engagement in computing after participation in the workshops. In order to address the preparation issue ACE has a student component and a teacher component. \n\n \n\nThe student componenet consisted of ImagineIT workshops and the CS (Computer Science) Academy.  The student workshops, called ImagineIT workshops, were held throughout the academic year and summer for middle and high school students who are visually impaired.  The students were mostly mainstreamed, though several were either home schooled or attended independent schools (schools for the blind).  Seventy-six students participated in the workshops, representing a nationally, ethically, and socioeconomically diverse group of students of both genders.  In addition to learning fundamental programming, hardware and robotics concepts, participants also learned about computing careers and what types of high school courses are needed in order to pursue a computing career.  A large set of modular tutorials and design challenges were developed for the workshops, where the complexity increased as student skill increased.  The modular nature of the materials allowed for flexibility during planning week-long summer workshops versus the weekend-long workshops during the school year.  Students worked in small teams, where each team had a mentor to guide them through activities.  The programming language was text-based in order for the screen readers, braille displays and other assistive technology to support student learning and information access.  The modular lessons are shared with the public, including educators who wish to use the lessons with sighted or visually impoared students.  The lessons are created to use with two differeent programming languages, thus widenting their use with different Lego Mindstorms NXT programming languages (NXC or RobotC).  As for student learning, a sample of 30 students were given a quiz of understanding of programming and robotics concepts before and after their workshops.  Before the workshop, less than twenty percent of students correctly conveyed understanding of any of the seven concepts.  After the workshop 2 concepts were correctly understood by over 80 % of students, with the other 5 concepts being understood by over nearly 100% of the students.  Among all participants, over 80% definitely or ilkely would continue to take computing courses if one is available.\n\n \n\nIn 2011 a special event, called CS Academy, was held in conjunction with the National Federation of the Blind.  CS Academy brought together families with visually impaired teens as well as role models from academia and industry.  During CS Academy, 18 students and their parents had different sessions at times and combined sessions at other times.  Parents learned about computing careers, transitioning in college, assistive technology, and accomodations in college.  Students learned about careers, studying computing in college, and programming concepts using web development and unplugged activity (requiring no computer).  Panelists and speakers from academia and industry, incuding current college st..."
