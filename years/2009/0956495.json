 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem is essentially a 2-part result, whose\r\nsecond facet establishes that all conventional axiom systems are unable to\r\nprove a theorem corroborating their own consistency.  This latter effect,\r\ncalled the Second Incompleteness Theorem, is quite counter-intuitive\r\nbecause human beings seem to implicitly believe that their cogitation\r\nprocesses are consistent (in order for them to gain the needed motivational\r\nenergy for cogitation).  Yet quite surprisingly, the Second Incompleteness\r\nTheorem has demonstrated that conventional logics cannot corroborate such a\r\nseemingly very natural consistency assumption.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of Willard's research project will be to explore to what\r\nextent a logic formalism can wiggle around the Second Incompleteness\r\nTheorem and formalize a type of at least partial instinctive faith in\r\nits own consistency.  Willard has already published several articles\r\nexploring boundary-case exceptions to the Second Incompleteness\r\nTheorem and generalizations of it, thus establishing the basic\r\nfoundational concepts for this quite unorthodox research approach\r\n\r\nWillard's planned investigation will have an inter-disciplinary\r\nemphasis, being germane to computer science, mathematics, the\r\ncognitive and information sciences, philosophy and linguistics.  It\r\nwill show that while self-justifying axiom systems have a very\r\nunconventional outer shell, they do retain an ability to simulate most\r\nof the practical computer-oriented knowledge of the data needed by any\r\narbitrary logically valid axiom system.  It will also show how\r\ncomputerized floating-point real number arithmetics behave very\r\ndifferently from integer arithmetics and how self-justifying\r\nformalisms retain an ability to expand their knowledge base by hopping\r\nand skipping form one formal self-justifying axiom system to another\r\n(via the use of Mind Change Theory and sundry trial-and-error\r\nexperimental methodologies).\r\n\r\nThe Second Incompleteness Theorem is sufficiently robust that its\r\nevasion is feasible only in a limited context, where the specified\r\nlogic possesses a component that is unconventional in a nontrivial\r\nway.  The reason that such unconventional logics are of interest is\r\nthat human beings evidently possess some type of innate instinctive\r\nunderstanding of their own self-consistencies (at least under some\r\nformal definitions of consistency).  It is therefore desirable to\r\nunderstand what type of algorithmic processes and foundational\r\nprecepts from symbolic logic can simulate a Thinking Being's\r\nconception of its own consistency (in either a full or partial sense).\r\nThe goal of this research project will be to investigate the nature of\r\nand the potential uses and implications of logics that possess some\r\ntype of well-defined partial knowledge of their own consistency.\r\n",

Goedel was called\n``one of the 20 greatest thinkers of the 20th century''  by the\nMarch 29,1999 issue of Time Magazine.\n\nGoedel's work on incompleteness was technically a 2-part\ndiscovery. His ``First'' Incompleteness Theorem specified that\nno logic or computer program can isolate all the true statements\nof arithmetic. The ``Second'' Incompleteness Theorem then showed\nthat conventional logics cannot prove a theorem confirming their\nown consistency.\n\nThis latter theorem  is counter-intuitive because human\nbeings implicitly presume that their cogitation process is \nuseful (and thus consistent).  However, the Second Incompleteness\nTheorem demonstrates that conventional logics cannot corroborate such\na consistency assumption. The purpose of Professor Willard's research\nunder grant CCR-0956495 was to help unravel this mystery.\n\nThis topic is especially mysterious because a self-referencing\nmethodology, discovered by Kleene, has established that essentially\nall conventional logics S can be expanded into a broader system,\nsay S+ , which differs from S by recognizing its own\nconsistency.  In particular for a fixed deduction method D, the system\nS+ will differ from S by including an additional axiom, called\nSelfRef(S,D), which is defined below.  It is a self-viewing axiomatic\nstatement that enables S+ to look at itself and immediately presume\nits own consistency:\n\n\n@     The axiom system S+ (which represents the union of the\n         axiom system S with THIS SENTENCE looking at itself)\n         has the property that there exists  no proof of   0=1 from S+\n         under  D's deduction method.\n\n\nKleene (1938) noted the statement  @  was well defined. The resulting\nsystem S+ is, however, usually inconsistent (essentially because it\ngets confused via its own giddy self-confidence).  These\nconsiderations led Kleene and most logicians to conclude that the\nstatement @  is typically useless.\n\nIn seven earlier papers published during 2001-2009 in the Journal of\nSymbolic Logic, Annals of Pure&amp;Applied Logic and\nInformation&amp;Computation, Willard meticulously examined this paradigm\nfor various different inputs of S and D (to determine which precise\ninputs (S,D) allow for an exception to the preceding paradigm). The\nbarriers imposed by Goedel's Second Incompleteness Theorem are clearly\nquite real and formidable. The reason this research is of interest is \nthat humans are presumably unable to develop the motivational energy \nfor cogitation without possessing some type of well-defined instinctive belief \nin their own consistency.\n\nThe main surprising aspect of Willard's most recent research concerned\n``Reflection Principles''.  It explored the well known fact that\nconventional axiom systems cannot prove the validity of the following\n``Reflection Principle'' for arbitrary sentences X:\n\n\n#       If an axiom system A proves the statement X as a ``theorem''\n         then X is true.\n\n\nThe intuitive reason axiom systems A are unable to prove # for\narbitrary sentences X is that X could be a ``Goedel Sentence'', which\nessentially states that ``There is no proof of me''.  It is well known\nthat if an axiom system A could prove the statement # for the case where X was such a Goedel Sentence then A would be inconsistent  (making it  entirely useless).\n\nThis paradigm has caused many logicians to suspect that it is\nimpossible to devise interesting versions of reflection that apply to\nGoedel sentences.  Willard found, however, a method for escaping\nfrom this dilemma.  It is to let X* denote a statement that has\nequivalent properties to X under logic's Standard Model and to change\nthe last four words of #'s reflection principle to read as:\n\n         ``then X* is true''\n\nIt turns out that Willard's self-justifying systems can prove the validity of\nthis ``translational modification'' of # for a broad class of logical sentences.\nincluding the formidab..."
