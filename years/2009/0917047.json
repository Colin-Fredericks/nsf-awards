In the past decade and a half, significant progress has been made in increasing the assurance and expressiveness offered by access-control systems, in large part through the use of formal logics.  When used to model a system, such logics can confirm that the system exhibits various desirable correctness properties, e.g., that its decision procedure will never erroneously permit an access if such an access is not consistent with access-control policy.  These guarantees can be even stronger when the gap between model and system is bridged by making the logical infrastructure part of the system, e.g., when reference monitors require proofs that access requests are consistent with policy.\n\n\nMuch of the work on logic-based access control has been in developing expressive and flexible access-control logics.

Because of this, and for administrative reasons, organizations with different needs will adopt different, possibly incompatible, access-control logics.  A particular challenge in building access-control systems is how to allow delegation between domains that use different authorization logics.\n\nInstead of trying to develop the authorization logic that all domains should use, this project focused on developing a framework for interfacing different, mutually incompatible authorization logics.
