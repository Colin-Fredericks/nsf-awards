Phone:  617-495-3789)\r\nCo-Chair:  Wing-Kam Liu (w-liu@northwestern.edu.  Phone:  847-491-7094)\r\n\r\nSonsors:  Academic Sinica, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, National Science Foundation\r\n\r\nA Workshop titled ?Meso-scale Mechanics of Complex Materials? is proposed, to be held in Vancouver, on 2 and 3 November 2009, jointly sponsored by Academia Sinica (Taiwan), Air Force Office of Scientific Research (USA), and National Science Foundation (USA).  Complex materials, such as metallic alloys, ceramics, polymers, and composites, exhibit highly nonlinear mechanical behavior.  Examples include fracture of metals under extreme conditions, coupled mass transport and deformation in lithium-ion batteries caused by insertion reactions, large deformation and swelling of polymers in response to diverse stimuli, and progressive damage of composites at sites of stress concentration.  Substantial progress has been made in understanding microscopic processes underlying such complex behavior, and in using these materials in engineering structures.  A gap, however, exists between mechanistic understandings of microscopic processes and rational design of engineering materials and structures.  Closing this gap will require fundamental advance in meso-scale mechanics. \r\n  \r\nThe Workshop will have a broad impact on knowledge dissemination of a field of research essential to modern technologies.  Effort will be made to invite participants among young, as well as female and minority, researchers.  Effort will also be made to invite participants both from the United States and Asia.  The Workshop will draw together researchers who share common interests in the deformation and fracture of complex materials, and in the fundamental roles of the meso-scale mechanics.\r\n  \r\n\r\n",
