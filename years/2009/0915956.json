 "awd_abstract_narration": "To take full advantage of the parallelism offered by a multicore\r\nmachine, one must write parallel code.  Writing parallel code is\r\ndifficult.  Even when one writes correct code, there are numerous\r\nperformance pitfalls.  For example, an unrecognized data hotspot could\r\nmean that all threads effectively serialize their access to the\r\nhotspot, and throughput is dramatically reduced.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide a generic framework for performing\r\ncertain kinds of concurrent operations in parallel.  Infrastructure is\r\nprovided to perform those operations in a scalable way over the\r\navailable threads in a multicore machine, automatically responding to\r\nhotspots and other performance hazards.  The goal is not to squeeze\r\nthe last drop of performance out of a particular platform.  Rather,\r\nwith the planned system a programmer can, without detailed knowledge\r\nof concurrent and parallel programming, develop code that efficiently\r\nutilizes a multicore machine.\r\n\r\nThe project involves the development of algorithms and data structures\r\ndesigned for the efficient parallel execution of generic code\r\nfragments.  The primary focus is on data intensive operations as would\r\ntypically be found in an in-memory database engine.  Critical research\r\nquestions include how to design generic multi-threaded operators that\r\ncan be applied to a range of computations, how to avoid cache\r\nthrashing, and how to implement the framework in a way that works on a\r\nvariety of hardware platforms.  Performance improvements in throughput\r\nof an order of magnitude are expected relative to naive solutions that\r\nsuffer from contention.  The project aims to achieve performance close\r\nto that of hand-tailored expert-written parallel code, with far less\r\ncoding effort.\r\n\r\nThis project has immediate applications in both commercial and\r\npublic-domain database systems where performance improvements would\r\nenhance the experience of database system users, and reduce hardware\r\nand energy requirements for a given level of performance.\r\n\r\nProgrammability improvements would allow programmers without expertise\r\nin parallel programming to effectively use multicore machines.  The\r\nproject also provides the focus for an advanced-level course on\r\ndatabase system implementation for multicore machines.  The software\r\ninfrastructure will be made available for research use by others.\r\n",
