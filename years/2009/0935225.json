Since virtual reality games and complex simulated environments are interesting to teens and young adults, and game players are motivated to spend time solving challenging complex problems in the games, it is logical to try to create similar environments for engineering education. Although students using games may be more engaged and may learn the material at a deeper level, the specific aspects of complex educational games that are important for improved learning outcomes are not known. The simpler \"minimal\" game will be developed as an instrument to systematically isolate specific aspects of the video game to determine how and why these aspects improve learning. This research addresses important questions about the effectiveness of games developed for educational use in engineering and will provide guidance for future development. It will contribute significantly to basic understanding of the effects and roles of educational video games which will improve learning and better prepare students for engineering jobs.\r\n",
