 "awd_abstract_narration": "The in-service Hakka rammed earth structures, i.e. Fujian Tulou of China, are historic and unique in design, construction and performance. The research effort will attempt to better understand their thermo-mechanical and aging responses under thermal, hurricane and earthquake loads. The scope of work will include to: 1) identify constituent materials in rammed earth and investigate durability of the constituents; 2) investigate structural integrity of Hakka buildings for structural efficiency under extreme loads, including modes of failure and verify any self-healing of cracks; 3) analyze heat transfer process through rammed earth wall for thermal comfort and energy-efficiency; 4) evaluate potential benefits of material and structural performance for implementation in modern constructions; and 5) identify other structural issues of scientific interest for further study and develop a follow-on proposal for international collaboration. The research approach to be used includes to: 1) review reports and articles on Hakka earth structures with reference to material selection and structural design; 2) visit Hakka earth structures and collect core extraction samples and field data nondestructively; 3) evaluate thermal, mechanical, chemical and morphological properties from wall samples through core extraction; and 4) analyze their response through finite element modeling.\r\n\r\nThe implications of findings of this research in terms of their application to modern structures are to: 1) identify durable rammed earth material systems; 2) advance rammed earth construction technique using reinforcing wall ribs; 3) build affordable housing and space-efficient office towers in urban areas; 4) develop disaster-resistant structural configurations; and 5) construct energy-efficient and green buildings. One graduate student will be trained to understand the Hakka rammed earth construction techniques. The research findings will be disseminated through journal publications, conference presentations, internet posting, out-reaching initiative and networking with professionals, who would be interested in Hakka building technology. This award is co-funded by OISE at NSF.",
