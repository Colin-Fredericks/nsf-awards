 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) proposes to fund student attendance at the 2009 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference that will be held April 1-4 in Portland, Oregon. The Tapia conference is unique in that it focuses on underrepresented minorities in Computer Science. Students will have access to the many researchers and technical presentations at the conference. In addition, they can present their own work in a poster session and at a PhD Consortium, giving them the opportunity to get feedback from discipline specialists. The Tapia Conference provides a supportive environment for students, allowing them to engage in intellectual discourse with a range of researchers and to meet peers from other institutions. The students will be able to build their personal networks and form professional relationships. This award will also fund travel support for some faculty at MSIs, giving them the opportunity to accompany their student mentees and make important technical contacts for themselves.\r\n\r\n",
