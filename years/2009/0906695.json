 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe fundamental objective of this research is to gain a detailed understanding of patterned conjugated materials in terms of their synthesis and characterization and application to advanced organic electronic devices.  There can be no question that organic electronic materials themselves are of great interest with whole industries being created around such materials: technical applications in mind include, but are not limited to, OLED/PLED displays, organic transistors, low-cost devices, and organic materials for energy conversion. The studies outlined in this proposal will answer questions about new patterned conjugated semiconductor polymer layers.  This project entails the detailed study of the chemical attachment of semiconducting layers to various substrates and their use to make operating devices. The long-term impact of the proposed research should be new insight into a new class of materials and the potential of easily fabricated devices with resolution unmatched by any currently known methods. The project research goals and outcomes: are; (1) the synthesis and characterization of patterned grafted brush layers of semiconducting polymers.; (2) an understanding of the morphology of grafted semiconducting brush layers as a function of molecular structure and molecular weight; (3) the development of a toolbox for the fabrication of active device structures on a variety of substrates; and (4) development of new device test structures that will allow the probing of electrical and optical properties of patterned semiconducting polymer layers. Our goals will be accomplished by the execution of three coupled subprojects: (1) we will exploit our skills in monomer and polymer synthesis to create and study new semiconducting polymers and generate surfaces modified by grafted semiconducting polymer layers or brushes.; (2) advanced patterning techniques will be developed allowing the unprecedented precise placement of these semiconducting layers for optimization of performance; and (3) we will combine our expertise in synthesis and processing to fabricate and test organic electronic devices. \r\n \r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nOrganic electronic materials themselves are of great interest with whole industries being created around such materials: technical applications in mind include, but are not limited to, advanced display devices, lost cost/ low power computing, and new materials for solar energy generation.  The fundamental objective of this research is to gain a detailed understanding of a new class of polymeric organic electronic materials ? specifically how they are made and how can they be used to make better and less expensive devices potentially impacting industry, the economy, and our energy infrastructure.  If successful, a new generation of materials and devices will be enabled and new opportunities for US companies and scientist to exploit these new technologies will be created.  Our materials design and synthesis will add to the portfolio of exciting polymer research at the University of Massachusetts, and help facilitate research interactions between the University of Massachusetts and the microelectronics industry (equipment suppliers, materials suppliers, and end-users of nanolithography).  Education of students and training them to help maintain US competitiveness in new areas of nanotechnology is another major impact of the study.  These students will be trained in new techniques and learn not only traditional chemical synthesis and advanced characterization techniques, but also how these materials are integrated into actual industrial process development. The PI will generate new curricula and modify existing courses with information generated by this project.  Funding will allow the PI to explore educational opportunities for local underrepresented minority children (Springfield, MA area) and part of the research developed in this proposal will be used to engage the minds and imaginations of young (8-14) children through weekend workshops. Finally, a network of New England Underrepresented Polymer/Material Scientists and Engineers will be formed.  It is the intention that the network will be used by the PI and others to bring together students and professionals to find common goals in education and development.",
