 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to fabricate zinc nitride, zinc oxy-nitride and their hetero-structures while enhancing the fundamentals understanding of  their the structure, interface, and surface properties. The zinc nitride and oxy-nitride system is an environmentally benign and potentially low-cost semiconductor material which shows much promise. This proposal brings together several key aspects of good materials manufacturing and surface engineering: (i) The reactive sputtering-deposition and nitridation of zinc films, which enables control of composition, as well as synthesis of multilayer structures for the study of interfaces between zinc nitride, zinc oxy-nitrides, and zinc oxide. (ii) The determination of the properties of the thin films so grown by a variety of experimental techniques, leading to a cross-correlation between the growth parameters, the resulting film structure and its physical properties. (iii) A synergistic experimental and theoretical investigation of structural, energetic, electronic, and optical properties of the grown films. (iv) Technological approaches and procedure to fabricate device-relevant structures are expected be outcomes of this work. \r\n\r\n\tIf successful, the results of this research will create an opportunity to develop new class of thin film photovoltaic devices based on zinc nitride and zinc oxy-nitride material system. Pertinent technological impact comes from the significantly wide applicability of this material system for renewable solar energy and cost saving opto-electronic devices. The project will also have a significant outreach component to high school students in the Midwest region through physics and engineering workshops at The University of Toledo. It is expected that 70-80 students will attend the events in the spring and fall semesters each year. The proposed outreach program will create more learning opportunities for underrepresented communities  and female students. Such activities will increase their interesting and motivation for careers in science and engineering. \r\n\r\n",
