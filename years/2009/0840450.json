 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), the Chemistry Department at Jackson State University (JSU) will acquire a multi-user GC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.  The spectrometer will enable/enhance research activities such as: (1) stereochemistry of biosynthesis and metabolism of tetrahydroisoquinoline-derived neurotoxins; (2) photochemical reaction mechanism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; (3) atmospheric chemistry of alkoxy radicals; (4) synthesis of 11-deoxyfistularin-3 and synthetic analogues; (5) light-induced nucleic acid base excitation, oxidation and release from nucleotides; and (6) supramolecular complexes of anions. \r\n\r\nMass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. This research is also expected to have a positive effect on the environment.  MS is one of the fastest growing and most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques.  Because of this, it is important for graduate and undergraduate students at this HBCU, one of three with a PhD program, to be exposed to the technique.  This instrument will support many researchers and students at JSU and others in the metro Jackson MS area.  It will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
