 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is developing learning materials for laboratory experiences in an undergraduate astronomy course, which utilize advances both in technologies available and in our understanding of the social nature of learning. These learning materials serve as proof of concept units demonstrating the power of combining 3D virtual learning environments (VLEs) with social interaction to augment science learning so that it is more engaging, active, visual and effective. \r\n\r\nVLEs are interactive computer systems that mediate the students experience with the subject matter and the instructor and fellow students. The proof of concept units include the use of 3D virtual reality to help students interact with scientific constructs, the use of collaborative learning tools to motivate student activity, deepen understanding and support knowledge building, and the use of process support mechanisms to enable realistic implementation of the instruction and guide students to effective and efficient work plans. The demonstration units and VLE target developing a basic understanding of science, i.e. what it is and how it works, through learning the meaning of Kepler's law and the nature of lunar motions and eclipses in an interactive environment. \r\n\r\nThe key steps of this project are: 1. Develop two proof of concept learning units to demonstrate the potential of implementing an integrated VLE comprising a 3D virtual science exploration, a collaborative system for social networking and class management, and a notification system for facilitating work process and social learning. 2. Implement the proof of concept units in open source environments (Croquet, Sakai, CANS) so as to leverage existing technology, support needed customization and maximize potential for dissemination, extension and broad impact. 3. Field test units and VLE for improving the design and implementation and to draw implications for dissemination, extension and broad impact.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The key outcomes are new, innovative learning materials that exemplify an integration of 3D exploration, social learning, and laboratory teaching. The project contributes to the intellectual basis for developing learning materials and VLE by furthering our understanding of design for virtual and social aspects of learning systems and by testing how well this work supports learning outcomes. \r\n\r\nBroad Impact: Given the need for improving and extending laboratory teaching for the sciences and the need for helping non-science majors to think scientifically, the proposed project is developing learning materials that can directly serve courses in Astronomy and serve as illustrations of how 3D and social environments can be used for other math and science learning in post-secondary and secondary education. The use of 3 open source systems makes the project materials and impact available for use and extension across the science education and learning technology communities",
