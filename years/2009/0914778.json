 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to address various search problems in group theory. \r\nDecision problems  in group theory have been studied for over 100 years now, since Dehn put forward, \r\nin the beginning of the 20th century, the three famous decision problems now often referred to as \r\nDehn's problems: the word problem, the conjugacy problem, and the isomorphism problem. In general, \r\ndecision problems are problems of the following nature: given a property P and an input O, find out \r\nwhether or not the input O has the property P. On the other hand, search problems are of the following \r\nnature: given a property P and an input O with the property P, find a proof (sometimes called a \"witness\") \r\nof the fact that O  has the property P. This is a substantial shift of paradigm, and in fact, studying \r\nsearch problems often gives rise to new research avenues in mathematics or computer science, very different \r\nfrom those prompted by addressing the corresponding decision problems.\r\n\r\nThe potential broader impacts of the proposed research are extensive; the impact on the general area \r\nof information security can be singled out. The difficulty of several well-studied problems, e.g. \r\ninteger factorization and the discrete logarithm problem underlie most current public-key cryptographic \r\nprotocols used in real-life applications.  Developing public-key protocols based upon other search problems, \r\ne.g. the conjugacy search problem whose difficulty has been well studied by group theorists, is prudent from \r\nthe standpoint of robustness, particularly if factorization or related developments threaten the security of \r\ncurrent protocols. The complexity of non-abelian infinite groups is a promising fertile ground for new \r\nprotocols and there is a great deal of preliminary work required such as that proposed here.\r\n",
