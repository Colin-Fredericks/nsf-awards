 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes is essential for developing a robust theory of community assembly. With the imminent construction of numerous temporary ponds in an experimental forest near Syracuse, NY, there is the unique opportunity to use these systems as models for testing several aspects of how ecological and evolutionary factors feedback as species colonize new habitats.  The project will manipulate independently both genetic and species diversity of invertebrates immediately after pond construction, and measure how initial establishment influences subsequent genetic diversity, species diversity, and the evolution of life history traits. Through a controlled, large-scale, field experiment, the project addresses three questions: (1) To what extent do species interactions versus dispersal limitation influence community assembly? (2) How does genetic diversity influence community assembly? (3) How does the assembling community influence important fitness traits?  The immediate results of this EAGER should provide insight into how ecological (e.g., species diversity and interactions) and evolutionary factors (e.g., genetic diversity and evolution of life history traits) interact when influencing the dynamics of this landscape of communities.  Taking advantage of this time-limited opportunity to control the pond communities from their construction will also lead to more interesting longer-term studies as the communities develop.\r\n\r\nThis project will result in the training of one post-doctoral fellow, one graduate student and several undergraduates (several of whom are women and/or members of ethnic groups that are underrepresented in science).  Public outreach will be accomplished by adding a module related to this award to an existing outreach website (www.life.uiuc.edu/caceres/teachers). C\u00e1ceres and Schulz will develop the lessons together, using state standards from both New York and Illinois. Project participants will be part of a multi-disciplinary research team evaluating the role of constructed temporary ponds in restoration efforts, especially in the conservation of endangered amphibians.",

Results indicate that the distribution of diversity is determined by processes operating at multiple hierarchal levels.  Abiotic filters (physical and chemical characteristics of pools), plankton dispersal abilities, local adaptation of residents and immigrants, interspecific interactions (e.g., predation and competition) and resource availability and how these factors are distributed in space all contribute to species persistence both locally and regionally.  Several of these processes are mediated by the traits of organisms.  In turn, these traits are shaped by natural selection, driven in part by these same ecological processes.  Though integrating spatially explicit interactions between priority effects, dispersal, and local adaptation to abiotic and biotic factors is a challenging task, existing metacommunity theory provides a promising conceptual framework.  To date, however, experimental tests of predictions from metacommunity theory have lagged behind its theoretical development.  A major contributor to this lag is the fact that we often have to infer the history of a particular location or region; we do not know how dispersal of either genotypes or species has influenced community assembly.  Once complete, our work will provide much needed empirical data that tests these theoretical predictions of the eco-evolutionary feedbacks that occur in metacommunities. \n\nThese awards supported 20 undergraduate students, four graduate students and two postdocs.
