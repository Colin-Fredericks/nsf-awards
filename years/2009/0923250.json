 "awd_abstract_narration": "0923250\r\nDeOtte\r\n\r\nWest Texas A&M University (WTAMU) is a regional university emerging as a research institution and seeks to strengthen the agricultural air quality program through acquisition of an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS), global sizing velocimeter (GSV), vibrating orifice aerosol generator (VOAG), and tethersonde equipped to measure parameters of the boundary layer in the vicinity of agricultural operations. The goal of acquiring the requested instrumentation is to apply advanced engineering  techniques and principles to the solution of environmental problems associated with production agriculture. Objectives include understanding atmospheric boundary layers to allow better dispersion modeling, accurate measurement of the efficacy of dust suppression, and integration of modern engineering instrumentation into high school and undergraduate classrooms, labs, and research experiences in conjunction with ongoing NSF STEP and S-STEM programs.\r\n\r\nInvestigators aligned with two agencies, one academic and one research oriented, and representing several disciplines including mechanical engineering, agricultural and biological engineering, and environmental science, will use the requested equipment to provide data for the solution of problems associated with several aspects of agriculture and environmental quality. The GSV and tethersonde will all be applied to provide the insight into boundary layer development around concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) necessary for realistic dispersion modeling of pollutants including aromatic compounds and PM, both of which are increasingly being scrutinized by the USEPA. The GSV and APS can gather data necessary to critically evaluate dust suppression at CAFOs so sound engineering principles may be applied to this important problem.",
