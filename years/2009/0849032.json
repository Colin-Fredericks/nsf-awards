 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nBeneteau\r\n\r\nThe proposal is for partial funding of the 25th Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM). The meeting will be held March 20-22, 2009 at the University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.  The purpose of SEAM is to disseminate and exchange the latest ideas and developments in classical analysis, complex and harmonic analysis, and operator theory. Emphasis is placed on involving junior faculty and graduate students in the meeting. The host school will provide facilities and cover local organizing expenses. NSF funding will be used to pay for the expenses of the main speakers and for participant support. Priority will be given to graduate students, post-docs, younger faculty, and members of underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nHistorically, the topics of the main lectures have reflected the major current developments in analysis. For example, at the 24th SEAM, C. Fefferman discussed his solution of the Whitney extension problem. The intimate format of the meeting fosters collaborations between younger and more senior mathematicians, and this exchange of ideas has often in the past and is likely to lead in the future to significant scientific advances. \r\n\r\nIn its quarter of a century history, SEAM has proven to serve as the first significant research experience for many beginning researchers and advanced graduate students. On many occasions, new PhDs have an opportunity to present their work and make important contacts with researchers from other universities, thus launching their careers. In addition, SEAM has always been very successful in promoting participation from underrepresented groups, women, and minorities. Because the conference is so well-known and well-advertised, we have confidence that this trend will continue for the 25th SEAM.",
