It is their duty to schedule the daily activities in this section, execute maintenance and calibration schedules for the various pieces of equipment in the pool of shared use equipment, and perform repairs and upgrades to the pool equipment. They are also responsible for recommending improvements to the marine technical capabilities of the ship. The Marine Technicians rotate on and off the ship and contend with the shore base duties as necessary. At sea, the Marine Tech is responsible for typical tech duties including maintenance and operation of scientific sampling gear, and providing aid and assistance to the science users of the vessel.\n\n The R/V Pelican was designed and outfitted to conduct a variety of oceanographic research missions. The reliability, utility and seaworthiness of this vessel have been well demonstrated. The R/V Pelican successfully conducts scientific trawling, large box core sampling, thirty-foot piston cores, shallow seismic surveys, current meter array and benthic boundary array deployment and recovery. The R/V Pelican has also successfully conducted plankton sampling, hydrographic casts with CTD-rosette system and underway sampling with towed water sampling systems.\n\n The R/V Pelican is operated as an Oceanographic Research Vessel as designated by the United States Coast Guard and is maintained as an American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Load Line vessel. The Consortium is a member UNOLS and the R/V Pelican is a designated UNOLS vessel. The vessel is available for legitimate research and education programs of Consortium members, state and federal agencies, other nonprofit groups, and oceanographic industries.\n\n NSF cruise summaries are as follows:\n\n 2009\n\nCollaborative Research: Tracer Distributions, Chemical Fluxes, and Distributary Comparisons in the Mixing Zone of the Mississippi River, Alan Shiller (University of Southern Mississippi), James Krest (University of South Florida), and Kyeong Park (Dauphin Island Sea Lab).\n\n \"Benthic Dinoflagellate Migration (BenDiM): Occurrence and Processes\"\n\nDaniel Kamykowski (NCSU), Carrie Thomas (NCSU), Gerald Janowitz (NCSU), and John Morrison (UNCW).\n\n2010\n\n\"Rapid: Impacts of the Deepwater Horizon crude oil spill on the diversity of macroalgae and macrocrustaceans inhabiting deepwater hard banks in the N, W, NE, and SE Gulf of Mexico, Darryl L.
