Mallouk of Pennsylvania State University are supported by the NSF Divisions of Chemistry (CHE), Materials Research (DMR), and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) and the National Institutes of Health to organize a workshop on \"Excellence Empowered by a Diverse Academic Workforce: Chemists, Chemical Engineers and Materials Scientists with Disabilities.\"  The workshop will consider: (1) the legal obligations of academic institutions under the Americans with Disabilities Act and other federal regulations, (2) characteristics of people with disabilities that add value to science and engineering departments, (3) the importance of mentorship for students and faculty with disabilities, (4) recent advances in research on disabilities education and assistive technologies, and (5) funding opportunities on broadening participation from underrepresented groups in science, including those with disabilities.  \r\n\r\nDisabilities can be apparent (e.g., mobility, visual and often, hearing impairments) or unapparent and undisclosed (e.g., learning/cognitive and mental health disorders).  Academic departments continue to have low numbers of faculty with disabilities making the underutilization of the available talent pool of critical interest to the chemical, materials science and engineering disciplines.  The aim of this workshop is to assist Departmental Chairs and policymakers in developing perspectives that recognize and are sensitive to people with disabilities.",
