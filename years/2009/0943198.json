This project examines the importance of intermediate physical organizations in the transformation of loose networks of researchers into sustainable cyber-based virtual organizations in emerging fields of interdisciplinary science and engineering work.  Unlike much previous research, this project specifically investigates the emergence of virtual organizations that did not emanate from major existing physical organizations.  Critical case studies of networks and organizations within Engineering Education Research will be studied from a symbolic interactionist perspective to understand precursors, pivotal moments, and the growth and strengthening of relationships amongst their members.  Social/organizational network analysis and oral histories will be used to develop an understanding of the evolution and success of loose networks and virtual organizations.\r\n\r\nInvestigating the emergence of new virtual organizations is a crucial step in learning how to identify, catalyze and provide the cyberinfrastructure required to support the nascent teams that will be central to future advances in science and engineering.  This will be helpful to funding agencies, and other public and private research institutions.  Research in the evolution and emergence of new interdisciplinary communities and virtual organization focused on discovery and learning can help eliminate potential barriers to access and enable increased participation by underrepresented groups.",
