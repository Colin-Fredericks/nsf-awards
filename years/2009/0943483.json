R/V Walton Smith is operated by the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) and R/V Seward Johnson by Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI).  Both are operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  The request for the sub-bottom transducers will be funded along with other units to supply the fleet. The award will include funds for 5 seperate systems, one each for:\r\n\r\nOregon State\r\nScripps\r\nWoods Hole\r\nMiami\r\nSpare system for fleet.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. In particular, the use of group purchases as is reflected in this award, are cost saving measures that benefit the entire fleet.",
