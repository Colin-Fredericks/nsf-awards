(1) Is every hyperbolic group residually\r\nfinite? If so, then in fact word-hyperbolic groups satisfy much\r\nstronger separability properties. The PI intends to investigate\r\nthese separability properties for known examples of\r\nword-hyperbolic groups and related groups, including 3-manifold\r\ngroups and relatively hyperbolic groups. (2) Is the elementary\r\ntheory of a torsion-free hyperbolic group decidable? Together\r\nwith Daniel Groves, the PI intends to give an affirmative answer\r\nby proving algorithmic versions of the results of Sela.  (3) Does\r\nevery word-hyperbolic group contain a surface subgroup? Little is\r\nknown about this famous question of Gromov, even for some very\r\nbasic examples of word-hyperbolic groups. The PI proposes to use\r\nvarious new techniques to find surface subgroups in examples of\r\nword-hyperbolic groups, including doubles of free groups along\r\nmaximal cyclic subgroups.\r\n\r\nA group is a collection of symmetries, for example the collection\r\nof all translations of the Euclidean plane that preserve the\r\ninteger lattice.  This group is generated by the translations of\r\none unit of length in the north, south, east, or west directions,\r\nin the sense that any element of the group can be obtained by\r\ncomposing copies of those four basic translations.  Every\r\nfinitely generated group carries a notion of distance between\r\npairs of its elements, defined by counting the number of\r\ngenerators that must be applied to carry one element of the group\r\nto another.  These projects concentrate on word-hyperbolic\r\ngroups, which have many of the properties of the hyperbolic plane\r\nfrom non-Euclidean geometry and are known to be so common that a\r\nrandomly selected finitely generated group is almost surely\r\nword-hyperbolic.  This award is jointly funded by the programs in\r\nTopology and Foundations.\r\n",
