Jane\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis study plans to investigate energetic costs in the steady free flight of Drosophila, and how the mechanical stability of 3D flapping flight affects maneuvering. The PIs will further investigate the trade-off between energetic demands and maneuverability during insect free flight. A major experimental advance planned is the application of state of the art data collection and imaging techniques to track untethered insect flight in 3D and obtain the wing and body kinematics necessary for aerodynamic analysis. Analysis of many acquired data sets will allow determination of statistical averages and deviations in wing stroke parameters corresponding to a given maneuver, vital for prediction comparisons. Determining the stability criteria for 3D free flight involves algorithm development and optimization with dynamic models of 3D flapping flight. The PIs will analyze correlations between optimal solutions across different species of Drosophilacharacterized by different wing and body morphologies. Understanding the solutions and maneuvering tricks used by insects will offer new insights into mechanical designs for flapping flight. This novel combination of experimental and theoretical techniques will carry out three focus studies: 1) a comparative study of hovering flight energetics in 12 species of Drosophila, 2) comparative study between wild-type and mutant insects, and 3) comparative study of control strategies in steady and maneuvering flight. The PIs plan to make the tracking algorithms and make them available online through their groups web sites. The PIs will provide a tutorial to guide the user through the kinematic data extraction process. Wang will continue to organize mini-symposia on fluid dynamics of locomotion, deliver public lectures on insect flight, and develop university courses for teaching mathematical modeling and biofluid dynamics. Cohen will continue to organize the semiannual New York Complex Matter Workshops and lead a collaboration between Cornell and the Harlem Children's Zone with the aim of improving science education at K-12 schools that cater to minority and economically disadvantaged communities in New York city. The PIs have also been asked to conduct a public outreach presentation through the Ithaca Light in Winter festival with the aim of educating the public about the results associated with this work.",
