 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is building a scalable mobile computing emulation infrastructure named ScalableSQ. With the popularity of mobile computing, there is an increasing need to allow mobile users to access data and process queries ubiquitously through their mobile devices. In the past decade, research efforts have been investigateing spatial query processing and pervasive data airing in mobile computing environments. However, the research issues on scalable data dissemination and efficient spatial query processing for supporting large-scale mobile computing systems have not been well explored. The main objective of this project is to design and develop a scalable data dissemination and query evaluation infrastructure for querying, indexing, and routing datasets to support novel mobile applications. Specific research challenges being addressed include design of highly scalable spatial query evaluation mechanisms, broadcast channel access bounds to speed on-air data accesses, effective memory management strategies to reduce access latency and tuning time, and novel request routing techniques to facilitate data sharing based query processing. \r\n\r\nIn addition to research, this project also benefits education by providing hands-on experience in mobile computing through the ScalableSQ infrastructure to both undergraduate and graduate students. Furthermore, the PIs will organize workshops at Tuskegee University (an HBCU) and collaborate with industrial partners to disseminate new discoveries from this project as the outreach component. The results of this project will be disseminated as research papers and as freely available tools in the project website at http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~weishinn/ScalableSQ.html.\r\n",
