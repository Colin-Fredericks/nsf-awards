 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop innovative fast-neutron detection systems that will provide revolutionary increase in the sensitivity of detection and characterization of special nuclear material (SNM). Current detection systems use helium-3 (He-3) detectors because they are very sensitive to thermal neutrons. Due to the neutron moderation in these systems, however, the initial neutron energy information is lost, which limits the capability of accurate characterization of SNM. Moreover, He-3 is a rare gas with unpredictable availability, threatening the fieldability of such systems. Novel neutron detection systems will be designed under this award, based on recently-developed organic scintillation detectors using aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (containing hydrogen and carbon) and custom electronics and real-time analysis algorithms. These new detection systems will preserve the incoming neutron energy information while maintaining high detection efficiency and allowing accurate neutron/gamma-ray discrimination. Several detection systems will be fully developed and tested, complete with detectors, electronics, data analysis algorithms, and neutron spectrum unfolding algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe new detection systems developed under this award are expected to have immediate applicability to homeland security mission areas for detection and characterization of shielded SNM. The new detection systems, based on unique detector designs, innovative electronics, and new analysis algorithms, will revolutionize the way in which information from the detectors is extracted, processed, and analyzed. This approach will significantly increase the sensitivity of detection and characterization of shielded SNM and provide a flexible and scalable platform for both portable (handheld) and large-scale (multi-detector) detection systems. The project will also help develop and train the next generation of nuclear scientists by engaging them in cutting-edge research activities such as real-time data analysis algorithm development, detailed characterization of new detection systems, evaluation of neutron shields for dosimetry and reactor physics applications, and passive and active interrogation of nuclear material.\r\n",
