 "awd_abstract_narration": "One aspect of Friedlander's proposed research is to advance the understanding of how finite groups and their generalizations act on vector spaces.  The elementary example of Z/p x Z/p is one of the first examples encountered by beginning students of abstract algebra, yet its representation theory is ``wild\" so that no listing of all finite dimensional representations is possible.  Friedlander has introduced constructive techniques which apply to this and other specific examples yet extend to very general situations.  Friedlander proposes to continue his study of representations of arbitrary finite group schemes using insights and techniques from algebraic geometry as well as more traditional techniques of algebra.  One goal is to contribute to the understanding of specific examples; a second goal is to sketch a general theory which incorporates these examples; and a third goal is to utilize certain special actions to study the algebraic K-theory of certain singular projective varieties associated to finite group schemes.  A second aspect of Friedlander's proposed research is the investigtion of algebraic cycles on algebraic varieties.  This is one of the most fundamental and challenging topics of algebraic geometry, much studied in the past hundred years.  Friedlander's focus will be on algebraic equivalence classes of cycles, influenced by insights from the better understood analogue in algebraic topology. Applications are envisioned to algebraic K-theory as well as algebraic \r\ngeometry.   \r\n\r\nHow can finite groups of symmetries act on vector spaces over finite fields or over even more general fields?  How does the consideration of more general algebraic objects (finite group schemes) reflect on the original problem, especially in basic, familiar examples?  How does the geometry, at first unrecognized, constrain the possibilities and lead to concrete examples?  Can the explicit nature of these examples give structures in abstract contexts? These are some of the questions Friedlander proposes to investigate with several collaborators.  In addition, he proposes to study solution sets of polynomial equations (algebraic geometry) using techniques developed in algebraic topology \r\n(theory of shapes).   Friedlander plans to encourage younger \r\nmathematicians (including his past, present, and future students) in his quest.  He also plans to continue his active roles in publishing mathematics, organizing mathematical events, and serving the national mathematical community.\r\n",

His activities have been undertaken as the Noyes Professor \nof Mathematics at Northwestern University (NU), the Dean's Professor \nMathematics at the University of Southern California (USC), and the \nPresident of the American Mathematical Society.\n\nDuring the period of this grant, Friedlander with coauthors has published\n12 research articles.  These articles introduce surprising connections \nbetween algebra and geometry, and develop techniques for further progress.  \nHighlights of this research include the identification of a special type \nof action (``modules of constant Jordan type\") and new numerical invariants \n(``maximal Jordan type\") which further the study of the very classical \nsubject of finite groups and their representations.  These articles also\nintroduce for the first time certain important geometric structures \n(algebraic vector bundles) into the study of group representations.  A\nlong-term goal is to not only use these vector bundles to study the actions\nwhich led to their formulation but to also to provide a method to produce\nnew vector bundles, one of the central problems in algebraic geometry.\n\nFriedlander's Ph.D students, current and former, have played an important \nrole in the activities of this grant.  Two of Friedlander's former Ph.D \nstudents (Christian Haesemeyer at UCLA and Julia Pevtsova at the University \nof Washington) were coauthors on some of the newly published papers.  Two \nof Friedlander's students (Chenghao Chu at NU) and Paul Sobaje (at USC) \ncompleted their Ph.D dissertations during the period of this grant, and 3 \nother students (Tylan Bilal, Joseph Timmer, and H.

Two other former Ph.D. \nstudents (Jeremiah Heller and Mircea Voineagu) are pursuing a research project with Friedlander which relates to the goals of this grant.\n\nFriedlander regularly advises young mathematicians both informally and\nformerly.  Currently, Friedlander is actively mentoring as well as \ncollaborating with USC postdoctoral fellow Joseph Ross, and is the \"official\nmentor\" of his younger colleague Aravind Asok.  Friedlander has served\non panels at Northwestern, USC, and the national AMS meeting advising \nearly career mathematicians about job prospects.  He helped to establish\nthe AMS-Simons grants for mathematicians recently completing their Ph.D's\nand was the primary instigator of the new AMS program of student chapters.\n\nDuring the period of this grant, Friedlander has co-edited 4 volumes of \nmathematical proceedings as part of his general service to the mathematical \ncommunity.  Additional service includes editorships on various journals as \nwell as referee work for other journals.\n\nAs President of the AMS, Friedlander has promoted the centrality of \nmathematics in science research and education.  He has been alert to the \nchanging climate of science publishing, especially developments concerning\nopen access.  He continues to participate in efforts to insure the long-term \nleadership of the American mathematics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/18/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric M Friedlander"
