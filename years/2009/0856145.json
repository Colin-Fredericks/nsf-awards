  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>NCAR pursues excellence and leads the nation in providing community-facing Earth system science-oriented computing facilities and data services, as well as conducting complementary activities in computational and data science. The disciplinary breadth of NCAR supports the extension of its science into adjacent disciplines critical for understanding and predicting mutual interactions between the Earth system and society. NCAR's unique range of partnerships across public, private, and academic spheres further support our core science program, the development of actionable science, and the deployment of these findings to the benefit of global society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NCAR's founding mission remains vital and relevant today: \"To understand the behavior of the atmosphere and related Earth and geospace systems; to support, enhance, and extend the capabilities of the university community and the broader scientific community, nationally and internationally; and to foster the transfer of knowledge and technology for the betterment of life on Earth.\"</p>\n<p>In 2020, NCAR adopted a new strategic plan that guides its activities through 2024, drawing on input from NSF and the broader scientific community. The three central science goals of the plan are:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enhancing and building on core      strengths, which includes long-term, team-oriented science and technology;      state-of-the-art instrumentation; flexible and capable community models;      robust high-performance computational resources and expertise; and the      adoption of co-development and systems engineering approaches.</li>\n<li>Promoting community Earth      system science, including an evolution toward understanding interactions      from global to local scales, improvement and integration of observing and      modeling capabilities, and the adoption of advanced data science and      computational capabilities.</li>\n<li>Advancing actionable science      that expands the disciplinary range of Earth system research and      partnerships, collectively helping to address societal challenges that      include air quality management; water, energy, and food availability;      protection of lives, property, and critical infrastructure from weather,      water, and space weather risks; and scientifically sound responses to      climate change.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Positioning NCAR for scientific excellence requires close attention to people, values, external engagement, and organizational character. To that end, we've adopted core principles that include scientific integrity and ethical conduct, support of community goals, connectivity to societal benefits, a balance of organizational agility and continuity, and a particular priority: ensuring diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), as set forth in the UCAR DEI Strategic Plan, throughout NCAR's research, workforce and community activities, including advisory panels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Underlying all of the activities of NCAR is its unique position as a national center devoted to atmospheric and Earth system science. When NCAR was founded, atmospheric research was scattered and uncoordinated, with little of the fundamental science needed to stimulate progress in weather forecasting. Visionaries in the university community and at NSF proposed a paradigm shift-a national center that would provide leadership in fundamental science as well as major field campaigns, large-scale computing services, and other activities beyond the reach of any one university. NCAR's subsequent research, and its work in serving and convening an ever-growing community of researchers, has played a leading role in the development of U.S. atmospheric and related sciences.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNCAR pursues excellence and leads the nation in providing community-facing Earth system science-oriented computing facilities and data services, as well as conducting complementary activities in computational and data science. The disciplinary breadth of NCAR supports the extension of its science into adjacent disciplines critical for understanding and predicting mutual interactions between the Earth system and society. NCAR's unique range of partnerships across public, private, and academic spheres further support our core science program, the development of actionable science, and the deployment of these findings to the benefit of global society. \n\nNCAR's founding mission remains vital and relevant today: \"To understand the behavior of the atmosphere and related Earth and geospace systems; to support, enhance, and extend the capabilities of the university community and the broader scientific community, nationally and internationally; and to foster the transfer of knowledge and technology for the betterment of life on Earth.\"\n\nIn 2020, NCAR adopted a new strategic plan that guides its activities through 2024, drawing on input from NSF and the broader scientific community. The three central science goals of the plan are: \n\nEnhancing and building on core      strengths, which includes long-term, team-oriented science and technology;      state-of-the-art instrumentation; flexible and capable community models;      robust high-performance computational resources and expertise; and the      adoption of co-development and systems engineering approaches.\nPromoting community Earth      system science, including an evolution toward understanding interactions      from global to local scales, improvement and integration of observing and      modeling capabilities, and the adoption of advanced data science and      computational capabilities.\nAdvancing actionable science      that expands the disciplinary range of Earth system research and      partnerships, collectively helping to address societal challenges that      include air quality management; water, energy, and food availability;      protection of lives, property, and critical infrastructure from weather,      water, and space weather risks; and scientifically sound responses to      climate change. \n\n\nPositioning NCAR for scientific excellence requires close attention to people, values, external engagement, and organizational character. To that end, we've adopted core principles that include scientific integrity and ethical conduct, support of community goals, connectivity to societal benefits, a balance of organizational agility and continuity, and a particular priority: ensuring diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), as set forth in the UCAR DEI Strategic Plan, throughout NCAR's research, workforce and community activities, including advisory panels. \n\nUnderlying all of the activities of NCAR is its unique position as a national center devoted to atmospheric and Earth system science. When NCAR was founded, atmospheric research was scattered and uncoordinated, with little of the fundamental science needed to stimulate progress in weather forecasting. Visionaries in the university community and at NSF proposed a paradigm shift-a national center that would provide leadership in fundamental science as well as major field campaigns, large-scale computing services, and other activities beyond the reach of any one university. NCAR's subsequent research, and its work in serving and convening an ever-growing community of researchers, has played a leading role in the development of U.S. atmospheric and related sciences. During these years, the impacts of weather and air quality on society, and research into those impacts, have grown vastly more complex, and understanding human-produced climate change has become a national and global imperative, recognizing that the atmosphere is one part of an interwoven Earth system. Fundamental research at NCAR has led to advances in weather prediction, improvements in climate projections, and better understanding of human impacts on atmospheric composition, all of which are critical to supporting decisions today and formulating policies for addressing the future. \n\nA sample of the significant metrics reached across the many facets of the National Center between 2016 and 2020:\n\nThe NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing      Center has served more than 3,000 distinct users from more than 500      institutions, supporting more than 1,600 projects using 3.7 billion core      hours of computation.\n228 Principal Investigators,      324 graduate students and 149 undergraduate students participated in 25      scientific field-campaigns across the globe that were facilitated by      NCAR.  \nNCAR has hosted more than 7,700      participants per year in the workshops, tutorials and colloquia that it      has facilitated.\nThere have been 38,763 orders      of data from NCAR's observational data repositories, serving 73.2 terabytes      to 7,015 users.\nOn average there are more than      800 annual scientific and/or technical visits to NCAR (78% of more than 7      days) from 357 institutions in 45 states and 40 countries.\n92% of NCAR's 3,261      peer-reviewed publications have had community co-authorship.\nOn average NCAR's publications      received 18.3 citations per paper, compared to the 9.5 citations per paper      average for atmospheric science.\nOn average, 219 students per      year begin or continue their research with an NCAR advisor and/or      committee member on their thesis or dissertation.\nA 35% improvement in NCAR's      wind energy generation forecast accuracy has resulted in $10m/year      reduction in fuel costs for a major US utility.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Everette D Joseph"
