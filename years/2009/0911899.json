 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most recent report that surveyed issues facing the mathematical sciences was NSF's Report of the Senior Assessment Panel for the International Assessment of the U.S. Mathematical Sciences (Odom Report) a decade ago. Since the issuance of that report, much has changed at NSF including a doubling of the Division of Mathematical Sciences' budget, significant diversification of the DMS portfolio of research and training awards, and increased connectivity of its funded projects with the larger science and engineering enterprise.  At the same time, the landscape of the mathematical sciences has changed significantly: demand for the use of mathematics and statistics in science, technology, and the economy has heightened, intellectual opportunities in the mathematical sciences have greatly expanded and the discipline has become ever more highly internationalized\r\n\r\nThe proposed study will produce a forward-looking assessment of the current state of the mathematical sciences and of emerging trends that will affect the discipline and its stakeholders as they look ahead to the quarter century mark.  Specifically, the study will assess (a) the vitality of research in the mathematical sciences, looking at such aspects as the unity and coherence of research, significance of recent developments, rate of progress at the frontiers, and emerging trends; and (b) the impact of research and training in the mathematical sciences on science and engineering; on industry and technology; on innovation and economic competitiveness; on national security; and other areas of national interest.",
