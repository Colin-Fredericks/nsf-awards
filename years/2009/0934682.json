 "awd_abstract_narration": "ACT! is an alternative teacher licensure program for secondary science and math (grades 6-12) providing highly qualified STEM individuals with the pedagogical skills necessary to teach secondary students and provide leadership in science and math education in their future school districts. ACT! specifically recruits post-baccalaureate mid-career STEM professionals. The delivery and content of the program are grounded in principles of adult learning.  The program is designed to recognize the unique backgrounds, learning and experiences that individuals with real life experience in science or math can bring to secondary teaching, the very real need to maintain some level of income while in a teacher preparation program, and time and geographic limitations related to maintaining family and work obligations. This project is providing critical financial support for 75 students (over five years) who are obligated to teach in high need schools. The ability to provide financial support is enhancing the project's mission to support mid-career professionals as they transition to careers as professional educators. The project places teachers in urban and rural districts throughout Wisconsin and is establishing new partnerships with three University of Wisconsin institutions serving the greater Milwaukee area, the University of Wisconsin Waukeesha, and two institutions serving rural communities - the University of Wisconsin Baraboo Sauk County and University of Wisconsin Richland.  This project is making the program accessible to STEM professionals in two thirds of the state geographically and serves the majority of the population in Wisconsin.",
