 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microorganisms are undisputed champions of biological diversity. They are both numerous and biochemically diverse, and they play significant roles in nearly all biologically relevant element cycles. But this diversity has made some fundamental questions difficult to solve: How do co-existing microbes partition ecological functions, and what are the evolutionary mechanisms of ecological diversification?  This project addresses these questions using coastal ocean bacteria of the Vibrionaceae as a model. New statistical tools will be developed to identify ecologically distinct populations among co-existing microbes, and ~70 complete genome sequences will be analyzed to identify the genes responsible for differences among populations. The role of gene exchange within and between bacterial populations will be quantified and used to critically test existing theories of bacterial population genetics.  \r\n\r\nPopulations are the fundamental ecological and evolutionary units of function in changing environments, and this project advances understanding of bacterial populations. The results will contribute to prediction of how microbial communities (including pathogens, as well as microbes involved in element cycles) will act and react in changing environments. A postdoctoral researcher and graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research. The project will create significant genetic and analytical resources and will develop visual tools to better inform the public about microbes and their important roles in vital ecosystem functions.\r\n\r\n",
