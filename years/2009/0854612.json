 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop fundamental dynamic models of web behavior for composite webs that are manufactured and processed in roll-to-roll (RTR) manufacturing systems. Composite webs are formed from dissimilar individual flexible material layers or through application of a thick gel material onto a base layer. In addition to developing models, a related core objective is to design the configuration (selection of location of driven rollers, web guides, and sensing systems) of the RTR systems and associated coordinated control strategies for RTR machine elements that would enable manufacture of quality composite webs with fewer defects. The research approach is to develop realistic models of web dynamics using first principles that can predict observed behavior during the formation of the composite web and its subsequent transport through processing machinery. The models will be analyzed to develop methods to efficiently configure primitive elements of RTR systems. The project will also develop new model-based control strategies for primitive elements to control key process variables such as web tension, transport velocity and lateral position. Deliverables include composite web models, modeling and analysis tools for RTR systems, demonstration and validation via software and hardware, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and training of practicing engineers in modern methods and technologies. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide methods to manufacture composite webs with improved product quality, less wastage, and reduced cost. The focus will be on composite flooring and ceiling products but the methods and tools developed will be general enough for use in manufacture of a wide variety of other existing consumer web products such as paper tissues, plastic film, hygiene products, etc. The potential for application of the research to development of new consumer products such as flexible electronics using RTR manufacturing is also substantial. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through interactions with practicing engineers and involvement in applied research activities at the industrial site. International collaboration will enhance research progress and will provide a mechanism for engineering students to interact with foreign counterparts. \r\n",
