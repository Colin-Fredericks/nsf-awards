 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering ? Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a computer based Guided On-Demand Adaptive Learning (GOAL) system that provides adaptive tutoring to students with asynchronous content delivery.   The GOAL system is automated and available to students through any internet connection at any time of day.   Students proceed through their chosen material at their own pace and have the freedom to choose specific subtopics and also to pursue specific topics with different degrees of depth.   The GOAL system presents in each topic in multiple modalities so that students can choose a presentation that matches their preferred learning style.   The system also includes a variety of tools that enable students to assess their mastery of a given topic with real-time feedback.   Over time, the system learns the individual student's preferences and presents material accordingly.  The assessment tools also enable the system to accumulate data over time that can be used to measure the effectiveness of specific learning materials.  The initial implementation of the GOAL system is in a digital logic design course.   Digital logic design is a course common to most undergraduate electrical engineering curricula.   The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator.",
