 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues support for the maintenance and expansion of the Integrated Primate Biomaterials and Information Resource (IPBIR).  IPBIR was initially established in order to assemble, characterize and distribute high-quality DNA samples of known provenance from as many different primate taxa as possible.  In addition the IPBIR attempts to collect and make available demographic, geographic, behavioral and other phenotypic data associated with the submitted biomaterials in order to facilitate research in inter and intraspecific genetic variability, biogeographic patterns of variation and genotype / phenotype associations.  \r\n\r\nIPBIR presently has DNA and cell lines available for 52 primate species, representing nine of the fifteen families within the order.  IPBIR has provided samples at scaled costs to academic, non-profit, government and industrial users for research including evolutionary studies, cross-species comparisons of genetic elements and single nucleotide polymorphism detection.  This award will ensure the continued availability of the facility  to the scientific community and will allow IPBIR to expand the number of samples available by increasing the number of species offered and increasing the number of individuals available from particularly interesting species.\r\n",
