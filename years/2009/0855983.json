The proposed Center will advance the materials science of wood and wood-based composites, by improving the understanding of how wood interacts with adhesives, sealants, and composite manufacturing variables.  The Center will promote research in building systems, mechanical and adhesive fastening between wood and non-wood materials, as well as novel material testing and modeling.  VT and OSU plan to use the NSF planning grant fund to hold a meeting with prospective industrial partners, and to develop an initial research agenda of sufficient commercial interest that attendees will be willing to invest in and sustain the Center. \r\n\r\nThe development of more advanced wood-based composites to be used in applications that currently depend primarily on steel, aluminum or concrete would have a positive impact on the environment and help combat climate change. The proposed Center plans to attract graduate and undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines, and to provide them with an opportunity to interact with industry leaders, thus giving them an understanding of how to apply and transfer fundamental research and impact the industry and the economy.  \r\n\r\n",
