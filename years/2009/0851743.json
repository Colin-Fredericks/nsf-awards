 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simulations of galactic events such as black hole and galaxy mergers \r\nallow scientists to understand the fundamental nature of the universe.  \r\nThese simulations create terabytes of data, which are extremely difficult \r\nand time consuming to analyze using traditional mathematical tools and \r\ntechniques. To address these challenges, scientists often use data \r\nvisualization, which provides a powerful and effective approach to \r\nunderstand interactions and behavior of simulations such as visualizing \r\nthe radiation of gravity waves during a supermassive black hole merger. \r\nVisualization systems require high performance file-systems for efficient \r\ndata management.  Over the last three years, a collaborative effort \r\nbetween the Computer Science Department and the Center for Computational \r\nRelativity and Gravitation at Rochester Institute of Technology resulted \r\nin a visualization framework called Spiegel that has been used successfully \r\nto analyze and visualize the simulation of a variety of galactic events.\r\n\r\nThis REU site provides students with the opportunity, environment and support \r\nto conduct research in data visualization and high-performance file systems \r\nusing Spiegel as the starting point. Working in a collaborative and \r\ninterdisciplinary environment, students develop solutions to a broad set \r\nof research problems in performing computation on massive amounts of \r\nmulti-dimensional data. Consequently, students gain knowledge in understanding, \r\ncritiquing, and presenting research literature. This project offers students \r\nopportunities to work on state-of-the-art computing techniques that are \r\nincreasingly vital for solving research problems in modern scientific \r\ndisciplines. Undergraduate students are encouraged to pursue interdisciplinary \r\ngraduate studies in STEM disciplines. With specific recruiting efforts that \r\ntarget underrepresented groups such as women, minorities, and persons with \r\ndisabilities, especially deaf and hard-of-hearing students, this REU program \r\nalso aims to increase the size and diversity of the scientific workforce.\r\n",
