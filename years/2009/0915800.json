 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\r\n(Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nRecently, the new field of compressive sensing has emerged with the  \r\npromise to revolutionize digital processing broadly. The key idea is  \r\nthe use of nonadaptive linear projections to acquire an efficient,  \r\ndimensionally reduced representation of a signal or image directly  \r\nusing just a few measurements. Surprisingly, Nyquist-rate sampling,  \r\nwhich has dominated how signals are acquired and processed in science  \r\nand technology since the origin of digital processing, can be leaped  \r\nover through compressive sensing theory. Such results may have a  \r\nprofound impact broadly, including applications in spectroscopy,  \r\nimaging, communications, as well as consumer electronics.\r\n\r\nIn this research, the compressive sensing framework is ``extended\" to  \r\nmake it an integral part of a discrete-time all-analog-processing  \r\ncommunications system that completely skips the digital domain and  \r\nshows an excellent robustness against noise. The key idea is the use  \r\nof non-linear mappings that act as analog channel encoders, processing  \r\nthe samples or compressive sensing measurements proceeding from an  \r\nanalog source and producing continuous amplitude samples that are  \r\ntransmitted directly through the noisy channel. Thus, all the  \r\nprocessing in the communications system is made in the analog domain.  \r\nIn addition to its theoretical interest, the potential of this  \r\napproach in practical systems is substantial. For instance, the  \r\nproposed framework is readily applicable in practical systems such as  \r\nimaging, where it presents a performance that is very close to the  \r\ntheoretical limits and clearly outperforms systems based on standard  \r\ncompressive sensing. Furthermore, the idea of completely avoiding the  \r\ndigital domain can be applied not just in point-to-point  \r\ncommunications systems, but also in more complex communications  \r\nproblems such as distributed coding in sensor networks.",
