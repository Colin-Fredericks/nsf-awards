ISSGC offers a comprehensive training program in distributed computing consisting of two weeks of lectures and hands-on exercises. An international team of instructors exposes the students to a broad range of concepts and technologies. Students from a wide spectrum of disciplines explore the different aspects of Grid computing through team projects and panel discussions. The students will be encouraged to continue their engagement with follow up mentoring by members of the Summer School in the US and others for Open Science Grid (OSG). In past years, the careful selection process and contact with the local supervisors and mentors of the students has yielded several who have continued on with using distributed computing for their work and research. Many students continue their research and learning beyond the conference, including participation in on-line learning opportunities provided by OSG.",
