 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops an educational pathway for students in Agriculture Education that articulates between local high schools, Modesto Junior College (MJC), and five California State Universities. The curriculum is designed and implemented in consultation with the Agriculture Education Steering Committee, comprised of MJC faculty, 13 area high schools, and representatives from the 5 partnering California State University Agriculture Programs. An Associate of Science degree is to be submitted to the State in Agricultural Science. Additionally, specific strategies are researched and implemented for recruiting, retaining and supporting future Agriculture Education students. These methods include program presentations, print and digital media, on-going communication with high school teachers and counselors, and a state-wide database. Special attention is given to approaches for students, including minorities, who have not typically pursued Agriculture as a career. Toward this end, an Agriculture Education Pathway Scholarship program is established, and a cohort approach to coursework is implemented, including an advising and mentoring component, cohort leadership training, and a Summer Institute for student success.",
