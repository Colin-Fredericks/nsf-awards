 "awd_abstract_narration": "Midwestern State University is awarded a grant for strategic planning to develop the Dalquest Research Station for the study of biological and geological past, patterns, processes, and phenomena of the northern Chihuahuan Desert. The project will conduct two workshops: one on-site and one on-campus in Wichita Falls. The Panel will include experts from a broad array of disciplines and specialties. They will be asked to provide guidance and written recommendations to MSU for (1) a mission statement and (2) long-term goals and landmarks for gauging success in (a) basic research and research-training needs; (b) data management systems and interconnectivity; (c) specimen documentation; (d) required laboratory-space and equipment; (e) necessary support facilities; (f) communication and energy systems; (g) funding opportunities; and other issues that emerge.\r\n\r\nDalquest Research Station (DRS) is a 1200 ha, pristine, Chihuahuan Desert canyon land in the Big Bend region of West Texas. The site is remote and ungrazed for the last 50 years by domestic ungulates. It lies close to and between two historic trails?the Comanche War Trail and the Chihuahua Trail. In 1996, the original site was donated to Midwestern State University (MSU) as a research facility. MSU purchased adjacent land to form DRS. MSU faculty and their colleagues/ students began preliminary biodiversity surveys of modern and fossil taxa in 1999, and the first geological/anthropological camp was held at DRS in 2005. Several new species of spiders and fossils and one new family of spiders have been reported.\r\n",
