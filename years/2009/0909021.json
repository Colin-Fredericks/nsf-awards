Sabloff, Lisa Traynor\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe principal investigators propose to investigate flexibility\r\nand rigidity questions that are central to the character of\r\nsymplectic and contact topology by exploring knotting phenomena\r\nof Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds.  Approaching\r\nsymplectic and contact geometry through a topological lens has\r\ngiven rise to a young and thriving discipline with interesting\r\nquestions that explore the boundary between flexibility (when the\r\nsymplectic world behaves topologically) and rigidity (when the\r\nsymplectic world behaves geometrically).  In particular, the PIs\r\nplan to study the Arnold Conjecture for Legendrian submanifolds,\r\nsqueezing phenomena for Lagrangian disks, and the cobordism\r\ntheory of Lagrangian submanifolds.  Special attention will be\r\npaid to Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds and Lagrangian\r\nsurfaces in symplectic 4-manifolds. The methods used in\r\naddressing the aforementioned problems are of interest in their\r\nown right.  On one hand, the PIs plan to develop and use\r\npseudo-holomorphic techniques initiated by Gromov and Floer, and\r\nexpanded to the Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) framework by\r\nEliashberg, Givental, and Hofer. On the other, the PIs plan to\r\ndevelop and use generating family techniques.  Investigations\r\ninto the structure of the holomorphic and the generating family\r\nbased invariants will yield insight into geometric flexibility\r\nand rigidity; making connections between these different types of\r\ninvariants will increase understanding of each.\r\n\r\nSymplectic and contact topology have their roots in physics as\r\nthe language of classical mechanics and geometric optics.  While\r\nremaining in touch with those roots, symplectic and contact\r\ntopology have blossomed into a central mathematical field that\r\ncombines features of geometry (the science of measurement) and\r\ntopology (the study of the shape of space).  This field has a\r\nvariety of applications including fluid mechanics, differential\r\nequations, and the study of the possible shape of the\r\n3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time in which we\r\nlive. The goal of the PIs' project is to achieve a better\r\nunderstanding of how symplectic and contact topology sit between\r\ngeometry and topology, and thereby strengthening the foundation\r\nfor the aforementioned applications.  The PIs'research activities\r\nwill bring a diverse set of students at both the undergraduate\r\nand graduate levels into the process of discovering new\r\nmathematics, with the PIs' research with undergraduates serving\r\nas a pedagogical laboratory for integrating mathematical research\r\ninto the PIs' curricula.",
