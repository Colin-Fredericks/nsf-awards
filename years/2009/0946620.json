Over 1000 participants are expected to attend, and up to 46 students, who are co-authors of conference papers, will be supported. The financial support will be used to establish a reduced student registration fee at the conference, relative to the regular registration fee.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The International Heat Transfer Conference includes a broad range of topics, from biological heat transfer to turbulence. Emerging areas such as novel energy conversion devices, environmental heat transfer, and nanomaterials will also be included. The co-sponsors of the conference include the American Nuclear Society, the American Institute of Chemical Engineering, the Canadian Society of Mechanical Engineering, and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\r\nBroader Impacts: Active participation of a diverse cadre of students from a variety of backgrounds will be enabled.  Students eligible for the reduced registration fee will primarily be co-authors of papers or posters presented at the conference. Students from underrepresented groups will be actively recruited to attend the conference. The venue will provide a unique opportunity for students to interact with researchers from the global heat transfer community.",
