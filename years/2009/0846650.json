 "awd_abstract_narration": "0846650 (Chandran)\r\n\r\nThis project will characterize gaseous nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from wastewater treatment plants, at the molecular mechanism and metabolic modeling levels.  Such emissions are deleterious to air quality.  For example, the greenhouse effect impact of N2O is about three hundred times that of an equal amount of carbon dioxide.  NO can directly deplete atmospheric ozone and is rapidly converted to NO2, which is a precursor to smog.  The key question to be addressed is: What are the underlying molecular mechanisms that render one set of biological nitrogen removal operating conditions more environmentally sustainable than others, in terms of limiting N2O and NO emissions?  The research will be integrated into high school education in minority oriented schools in Harlem, NY, and the PI will also mentor students from science high-schools in New York City.  Additionally, high-school science teachers will be hosted in the PI's laboratory during the summer with follow-up guest lectures by the PI and visits from high school students during the school year.",
