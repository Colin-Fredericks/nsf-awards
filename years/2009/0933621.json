 "awd_abstract_narration": "0933621\r\nSomasundaran\r\n\r\nThis project is for the acquisition of an analytical grade confocal Raman microscope for the UFL/CU I/UCRC NSF Center for Particulate and Surfactant Systems (CPSS) at Columbia University, for a shared use with other departments. The instrument is essential in advancing current and planned research at CPSS in such areas as 1) health and environmental safety and chemical reactivity of nanoparticles (NPs); 2) greener chemicals for industries; 3) new silicone surfactants and polymers with enhanced performance. Among current projects in the Department of Earth and Environment Engineering and other departments which would also definitely benefit from the use of Raman are: 1) carbon dioxide sequestration, alternative energy, gas separation membranes; 2) biocolloid engineering for medical applications in molecular imaging and targeted therapy; 3) determination of geological processes through identification of dissolved volatiles in high silica magmas, identification of mineral phases in multi-micron sized inclusions within host crystals; 4) new nanoelectronical systems; unique electronic, rotational, vibrational and spin interactions between an incarcerated guest molecules with the inner concave walls of a C60 host.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: 1) Unique, fast, accurate, and non-intrusive techniques of Raman spectroscopy will be developed for in situ locating of NPs and characterizing of their electronic, surface, and lattice properties, wettability, agglomeration, and deposition as well as reactivity (adsorption, acid-base, redox properties, and the capacity of NPs to generate or scavenge reactive oxygen species, interaction with cell membranes) at natural and engineered interfaces as well as in cells, bacteria, emulsions, and suspensions. 2) Based on the scientific data obtained through Raman and other complementary spectroscopic and microscopic methods, a new paradigm of nanotoxicity of NPs will be developed. 3) In combination with other experimental methods and theoretical modeling, Raman microscopy will be used to understand the synergistic effects of green surfactants with conventional surfactants, polymers and their hybrids at molecular and upramolecular levels. Fundamental mechanisms and predictive models for the aggregation behavior and structure-performance relationship will be proposed and tested. 4) For the first time, a systematic fundamental vibrational spectroscopic study will be performed on the surface and interfacial activity of silicone surfactants/polymers on cotton fabric, as a function of silicone molecular architecture. The information generated will be used to expand the existing knowledge base to develop new hybrid silicone structures and to identify other materials with unique interfacial properties.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The use of Raman microscopy in our research efforts will allow 1) the generation of critical knowledge required to address challenges in the emerging fields of green technologies, nanotechnology and nanoscience, colloid science, geoscience, medicine, and materials research; 2) the development of new technological solutions based on a better understanding of novel and complex materials and their interactions with biosystems at the molecular level, in particular, fostering innovation in a broad range of industries that employ surfactants, polymers, and nanoparticles; 3) the enhancement of interdisciplinary and inter departmental collaboration; 4) the training of undergraduate and graduate students on an instrument with utility across a wide range of disciplines, promoting their education and their team interaction; 5) the expansion of the scope of the spectrochemistry community into the emerging areas of applied sciences and engineering, which will certainly boost new high quality interdisciplinary research. The research will help to increase the number of minority students in various laboratories, as we are aiming to train more minority students through the Engineering school's special Undergraduate Research Involvement program. Minority students will benefit through first hand experience in methods of scientific research, working with advanced analytical techniques, and learning about their applications in industrially relevant areas. The PI will integrate a part of the employed experimental studies to develop a laboratory module for use in his courses Introduction to Surface and Colloid Chemistry and Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry.",
