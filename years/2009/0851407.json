 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators will conduct two research cruises to measure carbon dioxide, dimethyl sulfide, and acetone using the eddy covariance technique over a broad range of oceanographic conditions.  \r\n\r\nA tropical cruise in the equatorial Pacific upwelling region will capture the moderate to low wind speed conditions characteristic of most of the world's oceans.  A main goal of the Pacific cruise will be to study the increase of the gas exchange coefficient with wind speed.  A high latitude North Atlantic Ocean cruise will focus on areas of high biological productivity and higher wind speeds.  On the high latitude cruise the impact of phytoplankton blooms on gas exchange and the role of bubbles as a factor in gas exchange rates will be studied.  These cruises will add to the current database of direct flux studies in the oceans, which is extremely small, and insufficient to rigorously characterize the variability in gas transfer coefficients as a function of wind speed, sea state, biological productivity or seasonality in the major ocean basins.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research include the participation of students from various levels of education from high school interns to undergraduate and graduate students.  Underrepresented students will be included through an external program.  There will also be an effort made to include an undergraduate student and a high school teacher from a minority school district on a research cruise.",

Developing predictive models for future climate change requires both knowledge of current ocean-atmosphere fluxes and an understanding of the processes forcing gas exchange, and how they relate to the physical and biological state of the oceans.  This project followed our previous study of air-sea CO2 and DMS fluxes that showed no appreciable difference in CO2 and DMS gas transfer efficiency during low-moderate winds.  We went into this grant to focus on high winds where theories predict that CO2 and DMS transfer will diverge, with CO2 transfer becoming more efficient relative to DMS due to the enhancement of gas transfer by whitecaps and wave breaking.\n\nThis was a sea-going project with a substantial field component.  We directly measured air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide and DMS on 3 research cruises totaling 76 days at sea: April 2010 in the eastern Pacific (Punta Arenas, Chile to Seattle, 28 days, Fig 1), Jun-Jul 2011 in the N. Atlantic (25 days, Fig. 2), and Feb-Mar 2012 in the Southern Ocean (23 days aboard a New Zealand research vessel).  For each cruise we deployed 3 main measurement systems: air-water turbulent fluxes, water and air CO2 concentrations, and sea surface (whitecap) imaging cameras.  By simultaneously measuring the air-sea gas flux and the air-sea concentration gradient of these gases, an estimate of the gas transfer coefficient, or piston velocity, was obtained.  Since CO2 and DMS differ in their solubilities, a comparison of their gas transfer coefficients under various conditions provides insight into the mechanism of air-sea exchange.\n\nOverall, our systems worked well and we collected several large data sets.  The main scientific outcomes of this project include 2 published journal articles and numerous national and international presentations at invited seminars and conferences.
