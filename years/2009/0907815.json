 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sediments of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands constitute a valuable archive of Holocene climate change and variability. These peatlands are broadly distributed at mid to high latitudes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and at high elevations at lower latitudes, including tropical mountains. Their sediments contain a variety of microfossil, macrofossil, geochemical, and stable-isotope proxies of temperature and hydrology, and records are demonstrably sensitive to subcentennial to subdecadal climate variation.\r\n\r\nThis grant supports an international workshop to take place in May 2009, assembling 36 leading researchers to identify critical research needs and priorities, develop a comprehensive science agenda to advance peatland paleoclimatology, and initiate planning for a global network of Holocene peatland records. Participants will include scientists with expertise in peatland paleoclimatology, hydrology, and biogeochemistry, as well as paleoclimatologists with expertise in modeling, and statistical analysis, and other late Holocene archives (e.g., tree rings, speleothems, lake sediments).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe workshop will advance the science of Holocene paleoclimatology by fostering paleoclimate studies using peatland archives and integrating them with other high-resolution archives. Workshop products will include summary articles, research collaborations, and spinoff proposals to scientific agencies in North America (including NSF), Europe, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe workshop will foster international scientific cooperation and collaboration in paleoclimatology. At least 25% of the participants will be from outside North America and western Europe (Asia, South America, former Soviet Bloc), and at least 15% of the participants will be early-career scientists, primarily graduate students and post-docs.",
