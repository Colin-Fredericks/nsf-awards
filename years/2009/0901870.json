 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nCoherent nonlinear laser microscopy (CNLM) such as third harmonic (THG) and second harmonic (SHG) generation microscopes are widely used imaging tools. However, their application to date has eluded systems requiring rapid image acquisition. We propose to develop a method for rapidly acquiring three-dimensional (3D) images formed by nonlinear microscopy by means of digital holography coupled with rapid spatio-temporal scanning of the driving ultrafast laser pulses. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: \r\nThe proposed research will develop these capabilities which can be used to study fast dynamics of many processes. Making use of recent advances in spatio-temporal focusing, it will be possible to develop new forms of very high speed 3D imaging with coherent nonlinear contrast mechanisms. We will build an understanding of the capabilities of 3D nonlinear imaging and will better understand how to optimize both transverse and longitudinal (axial) resolution, while obtaining 3D information about an object.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis research will primarily focus on THG microscopy; but the technique is applicable to other coherent nonlinear microscopes, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS). Increased acquisition rates made possible with holographic microscopy will permit the study of micro- to millisecond-timescale dynamics.\r\n\tUndergraduate researchers will be involved in all aspects of this project focusing on research areas of ultrafast and nonlinear optics, and microscopy. Research findings will be incorporated into courses taught by the PI, particularly Ultrafast Optics and Nonlinear Optics. In addition, the PI will continue revising and delivering his \"optics show\" for K-2nd graders.",
