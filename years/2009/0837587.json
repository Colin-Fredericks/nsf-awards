 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe goal of this project is to modernize and improve the chemistry/biochemistry curriculum by developing and introducing new, innovative NMR spectroscopy experiments into laboratory courses. Wilkes University in conjunction with Luzerne County Community College (LCCC) is revising ten undergraduate laboratory courses and enhancing undergraduate research. The centerpiece of the recently overhauled chemistry/biochemistry curriculum at Wilkes University is the three semester Integrated Laboratory sequence. NMR spectroscopy experiments are being incorporated into all chemistry courses with a laboratory component, including organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, and biochemistry courses, and the use of NMR is being extended to include freshmen as well as 13C NMR in the sophomore organic laboratory. In undergraduate research projects students now have ready access to an instrument that can produce data of publishable quality. Remote access capability allows enhancement of the lecture courses as well as the laboratory, thus allowing experiments to be run during class and projected in real time. This technology is greatly enhancing the learning during the lecture portion of several courses (including organic and instrumental analysis) and is having a strong impact on the lecture portion of the organic chemistry courses at LCCC. LCCC also utilizes the instrument, hands on, for its laboratory courses.  The intellectual merit of improving the chemistry/biochemistry curriculum by the acquisition of a new high-field NMR spectrometer lies in the ability to add more complex, innovative experiments to the curriculum. This change is impacting not only chemistry and biochemistry students but those in almost all of the sciences at Wilkes University. Addition of a high-field instrument is strengthening the research capabilities of the faculty and students, particularly in the areas of biochemistry and physical chemistry.  The broader impact of improving the chemistry/biochemistry curriculum is apparent in several areas. Students in ten chemistry courses are benefitting from using the high field NMR spectrometer and one new course is being added to the curriculum. Students are able to use expertise gained in these courses for their senior capstone research projects. Typically, one-third of Wilkes University student body consists of first generation college students, and this year 70% of chemistry graduates are women. These underserved students are benefitting from access to this advanced technology. Community college students use this instrument for their organic chemistry laboratories, and high school teachers and students are being trained on the instrument during two already-established outreach programs offered in the summer.",
