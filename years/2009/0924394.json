Software developed from this program will result in development of process control sensors capable of rapidly measuring the elemental composition of a material solely from the material's analytical laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) spectrum. Analyses without calibration curves or standard reference materials (SRM's) would be revolutionary because conditions change and material compositions vary outside their expected range in industrial plants, rendering calibration curves inaccurate. Analytical LIBS could not be developed in the past because of these large uncertainties. This project will verify the algorithms developed are effective when applied to actual industrial materials: coal, aluminum, and glass. Coupling Analytical LIBS with a LIBS sensor for coal and patented LIBS probe for molten metals and glass will result in real time monitoring and control, a new and potentially paradigm shifting capability for these industries.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to the coal-fired power plants and manufacturing plants that produce glass, metal alloys, and other products by allowing the plant personnel to monitor the composition of their material continuously, which is currently impossible. Alloying and other mixing operations will be monitored in real time, eliminating errors in these operations. Increased plant output, reduced waste, and reduced energy expenditures per pound of product will result from problems in the production process being caught much more quickly. New manufacturing paradigms, such as continuous alloying of aluminum, are also made possible by development of this technology. Developing Analytical LIBS for the measurement of coal properties at electric utility power plants will increase their efficiency and optimize boiler performance. There will also be benefits in other fields such as atomic emission spectroscopy, plasma physics, and astronomy. Analytical LIBS can also be extended for accurate LIBS analyses of the environment (e.g. minerals, oceans, atmospheric aerosols), planetary science (e.g. Mars, moon, and comets), agriculture, and security (e.g. WMD detection). The development of Analytical LIBS for these fields is crucial because no standard reference materials (SRM's) exist for many of these materials, and hence accurate calibration curves are difficult to construct and will have limited utility.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merits of the Project\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project involves development of a laser-based chemical analysis method with unique advantages for improving the efficiency of coal-fired power plants and metal and glass production plants.  Software developed from this program will result in development of sensors capable of rapidly and accurately measuring the composition of a material (for example, coal) without the need to calibrate the sensor or the need to take samples to a laboratory for analysis.   This is a very valuable capability because conditions change unpredictably in industrial plants.  With the heretofore unavailable speed and accuracy made possible by this project, these changes can be managed effectively, increasing plant efficiency and reducing energy usage and waste.\n\nBroader Impacts of the Project\n\nThis project will impact coal-fired power plants and manufacturing plants that produce glass, metal alloys, and other products by allowing the plant personnel to monitor the composition of their material continuously, which is currently impossible. Alloying and other mixing operations will be monitored in real time, eliminating errors in these operations. Increased plant output, reduced waste, and reduced energy expenditures per pound of product will result from problems in the production process being caught much more quickly.  For electric utility power plants, the measurement of coal properties will increase their efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.

The technology can also be extended for accurate analyses of the environment ( minerals, oceans, atmospheric aerosols), planetary science (Mars, moon, comets), agriculture, and security (detection of weapons of mass destruction).\n\nResults of the Project to Date\n\nThe software package developed during the project has been transformed so that it operates automatically and takes advantage of the capabilities of modern computer processors to operate at high speed.  Both of these abilities are important for adoption of the technology in industrial settings.  The experimental setup has also been streamlined to increase the rate at which data can be collected to verify that the software is accurate and reliable.\n\nWe have also identified the first two industrial sites for demonstrating the technology.  The first is a coal-fired power plant in Pennsylvania, where a demonstration of the sensor hardware has already taken place.  The second location is a high value metal alloy manufacturer, also in Pennsylvania.  A demonstration there is forthcoming in the near future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Arel Weisberg"
