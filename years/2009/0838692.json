 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is an instance of SAGE Days (number 11 to be precise), a\r\nperiodic gathering where developers of the software package SAGE, a\r\nfree and open software that supports research and teaching in algebra,\r\ngeometry, number theory, cryptography, and related areas, address\r\ncurrent issues of the software, program for very long hours, either\r\nimproving existing code or adding new code, and plan the next steps to\r\nbe taken. For example, this workshop includes working on adding to\r\nSAGE the capability to work with modular forms over function\r\nfields. In addition to the above standard features of such a meeting,\r\nthis particular workshop includes a strong emphasis in the interaction\r\nbetwen algebra and number theory (the area of the bulk of the SAGE\r\ndevelopers and researchers in attendance) and computer science,\r\nsupercomputing (from TACC, the Texas supercomputing center) and\r\napplied Mathematics (from ICES, the Institute for Computational\r\nEngineering and Sciences) at the University of Texas at Austin, as\r\nwell as researchers working outside academia (from Entought, an Austin\r\nbased company).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main goals of this workshop are: (i) to support the development of\r\nthe free and open source software SAGE by gathering some of its\r\ndevelopers as well as researchers that use it in their own research;\r\n(ii) to bring together the SAGE commnunity and various research\r\ngroups at the host location, the University of Texas at Austin, that\r\nwhile might have very different research focus share many common\r\ncomputational problems and needs. To give just one example, being\r\nable to solve large linear algebra problems accurately and fast is a\r\nfundamental problem that underlies essentially any type of scientific\r\ncomputation imaginable. The availability of high level software is\r\nnowadays of crucial and increasing importance for research in\r\nMathematics, both in applied and pure Mathematics. SAGE is an example\r\nof a be very powerful computer package that is at the cutting edge\r\n(in terms of the sophistication of its capabilities as well as its\r\nspeed) of existing tools for research in Mathematics and its\r\napplications; particularly, in those areas related to algebra, number\r\ntheory, geometry and cryptography. The workshop is planned with the\r\nSAGE development model in mind, distinguished by an emphasis on\r\nopenness, community, cooperation, and collaboration.",
