 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genus Swartzia (in the legume, or bean, family) includes approximately 200 species that together form a diverse and characteristic element of Central and South American rainforests. Many species of Swartzia are abundant and play important ecological roles. Despite its importance, and despite the ongoing destruction of tropical rainforests, Swartzia has been under-studied relative to other plant groups. The taxonomy of the genus is badly outdated, most aspects of its biology are unknown, and many species in remote regions have yet to be described. Funding will be used to carry out extensive museum-, field-, and laboratory-based studies of Swartzia. This research will synthesize current information and will generate new data on species distributions, ecology, variation, biology, uses, and conservation status, particularly from previously under-sampled geographic regions. These data will be used to clarify the taxonomy of Swartzia and will be published in an encyclopedic taxonomic monograph and website. \r\n\r\nThe research will greatly advance a long-term objective to develop a model system in tropical trees for studying the origins and maintenance of species diversity in rainforests. Through the project website, all data will be made available to the scientific community and public. These data will help in species identification, biodiversity research, conservation, and management. The research team includes personnel in five countries and is a model of international collaboration. The project presents substantial educational opportunities for students and volunteers in the United States and South America.",
