 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the web continues to play an increasing role in information\r\nexchange, so too is it becoming the prevailing platform for infecting\r\nvulnerable hosts. One commonly deployed strategy for delivering\r\nweb-malware involves the underhanded tactic of targeting browser\r\nvulnerabilities to automatically download and run malicious software\r\nupon visiting a website. When popular websites are exploited, the\r\nvictim base from these so-called drive-by downloads can be far greater\r\nthan other forms of exploitation because traditional defenses (e.g.,\r\nfirewalls) pose no barrier to infection. Unfortunately, with the\r\nplethora of (insecure) web applications being deployed today, it is\r\nlikely that web servers will continue to be popular targets for\r\nexploitation for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nOne of our primary goals is to take an in-depth look at the malware\r\nserving network on the Web by building a scalable malware execution\r\nand analysis infrastructure. Specifically, we plan to build a\r\nresource-efficient host architecture that permits lightweight process\r\nmonitoring via tracking of interactions with the OS. An important\r\nfacet of our research direction is to explore a transactional\r\nframework that unifies virtualization and logging to allow efficient\r\nanalysis. In this framework, the granularity of recorded transactions\r\nis dynamically adjusted based on execution contexts, aggregating\r\nmultiple transactions to a single, summarized, transaction whenever\r\npossible. Broader impats of this project will result from the\r\ncomprehensive analysis of the different aspects of the problem posed\r\nby web-based malware, and the tools, methods, and analytical\r\ntechniques that will ultimately allow for large-scale malware analysis\r\nby the security community at large.",
