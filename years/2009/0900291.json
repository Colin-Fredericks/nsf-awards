 "awd_abstract_narration": "The p Laplacian  for most values of p is a nonlinear  divergence form degenerate elliptic PDE.  Solutions to this   PDE   (called p  harmonic functions) are  relatively nice in that they are invariant under rotations,  translations,  dilations, and also remain  solutions under multiplication by constants.  Still the nonlinearity  of  this  PDE makes even basic  questions difficult to answer. Recently the  principal investigator and coauthor Nystrom  have  proved a  boundary  Harnack  inequality (including  Holder continuity)  for  the ratio of two positive p harmonic functions vanishing on a portion of  a  Lipschitz domain.  This  project  proposal  is concerned with applications of this   boundary Harnack inequality  to problems  concerning the p Martin boundary,  the dimension of p harmonic measure, and to certain two phase free boundary problems.   \r\n              \r\nMost physical models involve  linear PDE  (in their principal part).  Laplace`s equation is one of the best known linear PDE and is often  used in  mathematical models,  as  well as to describe physical  phenomena. This  proposal is concerned with extending  some  classical results for Laplace's equation to its cousin  the nonlinear p Laplace equation. Recent  technology developed by the proposer and coauthors make this extension now possible.   It is hoped that  our work will eventually lead to greater use of the  p Laplace equation in  mathematical modeling  and in general in the sciences.",
