From the start the focus was to provide a place where collective learning would lead to individual scholarly advance and thereby, field advance. The strategies might be summarized as sanctuary, interdisciplinary research, and fostering innovation. Sanctuary refers to providing a place for reflection and writing, a place that offers respite from the demands of university life. Interdisciplinarity has only increased in importance over the half century since the Center was established. With increasing field specialization, most academics are deeply embedded in narrow fields.  Research on scientific advances has demonstrated that the majority of discoveries emerge from the boundaries between fields or interdisciplinary efforts. Finding new interconnections is one of the ways that scientific frontiers advance. Fostering innovation takes place within special projects organized in advance or other arrangements such as the groups that Fellows create once they get to know each other. Special projects provide the opportunity for scholars to work together on some problem of scientific or social importance. This project continues an AGEP (Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate)-CASBS partnership.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) has a\r\nlong and distinguished history of recruiting outstanding Fellows. Working collaboratively with AGEP the Center is preparing underrepresented minorities in the fields of social, behavioral, and economic sciences for faculty leadership in academia.",
