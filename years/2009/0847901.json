 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Mary K. Carroll (Chemistry) and Ann M. Anderson (Mechanical Engineering) of Union College are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to prepare and characterize aerogels - porous nanostructured materials that are approximately 90-99% air by volume.  An interdisciplinary team of faculty and undergraduate students is working to (1) develop a fundamental understanding of how changes in the novel rapid supercritical extraction (RSCE) method used to prepare aerogels affects the resulting properties, and (2) demonstrate the utility of tailored RSCE aerogel materials for specific applications including optical chemical sensing, chemical spill clean-up, and the development of low drag hydrophobic surfaces and thermal insulating materials.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to potential contributions to society from development of novel materials , the work achieves broader impact by supporting opportunities for undergraduate students in exciting cross-disciplinary research.  The team is part of the Converging Technologies (CT) initiative at Union College, which brings together students and faculty from engineering and the liberal arts to examine problems that occur at the intersections of traditional disciplines. Undergraduate students in chemistry, biochemistry and mechanical engineering as well as high-school students are engaged in aerogel research at Union, working alongside faculty mentors, using state-of-the-art instrumentation, presenting and, in some cases, publishing their results.",
