 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAGER: Characterization and Modeling of Nanoscaled Semiconductor Devices\r\nMarvin H. White\r\nLehigh University\r\nAbstract\r\nWe propose a EAGER program to apply a new approach to study low-field carrier mobility\r\nin high-K, nanoscaled, semiconductor MOSFET devices ? devices with Coulomb\r\nscattering centers in the high-K dielectrics. This concept will permit the evaluation of lowfield\r\ncarrier transport in nanoscaled devices with a two-terminal structure rather than the\r\nfabrication of a three-terminal device structure. We will use two hetero-insulator device\r\nstructures: (1) a nonvolatile, ?charge-trap?, nanoscaled MANOS semiconductor memory\r\ndevice with programmable charge storage and (2) a metal gate, high-K, nanoscaled\r\nMOS transistor with fixed charge in the high-K dielectric.\r\nThe intellectual merit involves the integration of research and education to explore lowfield,\r\ncarrier transport in high-K nanoscaled devices with a simple two-terminal\r\nconductance and capacitance measurement, thereby, alleviating the need to fabricate\r\nthree-terminal devices complete with ohmic contacts. We will characterize the influence\r\nof Coulomb charge in experimental high high-K devices on carrier transport by varying\r\nthe sign, magnitude and position of the charge. Two terminal measurements will be\r\ncompared with three-terminal measurements on completed device structures. The\r\nexperimental and theoretical studies involve device physics, chemistry, materials\r\nscience and modeling at the nanoscale.\r\nThe broader aspects in our program will advance diversity in the nanoelectronics\r\nworkforce and provide intellectual technology transfer, integration of research and\r\neducation, and promotion of partnerships with the industrial sector of the economy. We\r\nhave developed excellent educational and outreach programs to increase diversity with\r\nopportunities in nanoelectronics, especially semiconductor devices ? an important area\r\nto maintain US leadership in a global economy. Our research provides an excellent\r\nvehicle for minority student outreach and partnerships with industry.\r\nThe transformative nature of our research lies in a new approach to model low field\r\ntransport with simple two-terminal structures, which can be easily fabricated in the\r\nlaboratory without extensive photolithographic equipment. The concept is applicable to\r\nthe study of carrier transport in a broad range of emerging nanoscaled devices and will\r\naid rapid and innovative advances in the technology",
