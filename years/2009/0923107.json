This proposal involves the acquisition, installation and implementation of a state-of-the-art, high-resolution, 3-pinhole collimated, simultaneous SAXS/WAXD instrument with an added capability of grazing incidence for the structural analysis of ordered surfaces. The proposed instrument is necessary to fill a critical void in our nanostructure characterization capabilities at Virginia Tech in support of our polymer-related activities associated with the Macromolecules and Interfaces Institute (MII), a variety of NSF sponsored programs in active nanostructures, DOD and DOE-sponsored programs, and activities stemming from our newly established ICTAS Nanoscale Characterization and Fabrication Laboratory.  Given the broad versatility of morphological experiments available with this rare instrument, our multidisciplinary research efforts will involve structural analysis of nanostructured systems ranging from aqueous, colloidal suspensions of biopolymer complexes to solid-state membranes for energy applications and water purification, structurally-controlled semi-crystalline polymers and blends, tailored nanocomposite materials, and self-assembled surface structures. The proposed SAXS/WAXD instrument will be a cornerstone system in our multi-user Nanoscale Characterization and Fabrication Laboratory, and will stimulate institutional and national/international collaborations (among academia and industry) as a center for morphological analysis of nanostructured materials. Along with associated theoretical and practical training, this new capability will be open to enhance the science and engineering efforts of a diverse population of students and researchers. \r\nLayman Summary:  Small-angle x-ray scattering is a method used to measure the internal structure and form (in the dimension of nanometers) of solid materials and complex solutions by irradiating a complex sample with a fine beam of x-rays and capturing a projection of the scattered x-rays with a sensitive detector placed at a significant distance from the sample.  Federally-funded and industrially-sponsored research projects associated with this proposed instrument will involve structural characterization of a wide variety of new materials that will impact activities ranging from the development of efficient, energy conversion devices to bio-functional materials needed to address critical health issues in our modern society.  Each of these novel research activities requires the structural information obtainable with state-of-the-art SAXS/WAXD methods in order to gain fundamental insight into morphology-property relationships that will drive the development of the next generation of nanostructured materials for a variety of technological applications.  The proposed SAXS/WAXD instrument will be a cornerstone system in our multi-user Nanoscale Characterization and Fabrication Laboratory, and will stimulate collaborations (among academia and industry) as a center for morphological analysis of nanostructured materials. Along with associated theoretical and practical training, this new capability will be open to enhance the science and engineering efforts of a diverse population of students and researchers.",
