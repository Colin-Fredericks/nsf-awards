 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of\r\n2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\n\r\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a flexible computational technique that\r\nhas proven very useful to many scientific disciplines and is the backbone\r\nof current implementations of Bayesian inference. Recent research\r\ndevelopments suggest that the use of adaptive methods can make Monte Carlo\r\nalgorithms considerably more effective. This research proposal has two\r\nmajor components. The first part will contribute to the development of a\r\nlimit theory for adaptive MCMC algorithms.  More Specifically, the PI will\r\ndevelop a resolvent-based martingale approximation technique to investigate\r\nthe central limit theorem and the asymptotic variance estimation for\r\nvarious adaptive MCMC algorithms. The second part of this research activity\r\nwill develop a new MCMC algorithm for the Bayesian analysis of statistical\r\nmodels with intractable normalizing constants, a topic that currently poses\r\nmajor computational challenges. This part of the research is driven by the\r\nprotein design problem in computational biology but the same problem also\r\nfrequently occurs in many other statistical models including Markov random\r\nfields, Markov point processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo is a well-established Monte Carlo technique for\r\nsampling probability distributions. The method is used widely to solve\r\nsubstantive problems in many areas of applications. It is especially useful\r\nin situations with high-dimensional data, which is increasingly common in\r\nscience and engineering research as well as applications. Thus, the\r\nresearch developments from this project can have a significant impact on\r\nmethods for doing statistical inference in these areas. Through its\r\ntheoretical component, this research project will advance the general\r\nunderstanding and strengthen the use of adaptive Monte Carlo methods in\r\npractice. In the course of developing the asymptotic theory, the PI will\r\ndevelop original extensions to some well-established probabilistic tools.\r\nThe research is also proposing a new algorithm to tackle one of the most\r\nchallenging current problem in Monte Carlo simulation; sampling from the\r\nposterior distribution of statistical models with intractable normalizing\r\nconstants.",
