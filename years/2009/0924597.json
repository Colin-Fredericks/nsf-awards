 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael R. Hoffmann of California Institute of Technology is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct research in an international collaboration with Professor John T. Irvine of St. Andrews University and Professor Peter K.J. Robertson of the Robert Gordon University of Aberdeen.  The aim of the project is to investigate the photoelectrochemical catalysis of multicomponent systems comprising CO2, as an electron acceptor, and organic electron donors.  Initial studies will be performed utilizing both narrow and wide band gap metal sulfides as semiconductor photoelectrochemical catalysts and organic amines as electron donors.  Alternate oxide semiconductor catalysts and simulated waste streams will also be explored in parallel.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop efficient catalytic transformations that are potentially useful for conversion of CO2 to useful alternative fuel and chemical feedstock, and for the remediation of petroleum and bio wastes.  This project will expose students to an international research experience and will provide them with opportunities to network with researchers in the United Kingdom.\r\n  The project is supported jointly by the NSF and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom (EPSRC).",
