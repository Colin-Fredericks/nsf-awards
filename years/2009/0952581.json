 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to investigate a new class of mm-wave phase-locked loops (PLLs) for ultra-wide bandwidth applications. Current mm-wave PLLs are based on injection-locked frequency dividers, which have many locking limitations that affect their operating range. These limitations translate to limited data rate communications, and low resolution in imaging and spectroscopy applications. This work proposes a fundamental change in the design of mm-wave phase locked loops, combining the functions of the oscillator and injection-locked frequency divider through the use of N-push operation. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is manifested in its goal of developing new circuit techniques for mm-wave applications that efficiently utilize the wide bandwidth available and lends itself to operation at even higher frequency at the mm-wave/THz boundary. The proposed approach is expected to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in the phased-locked-loop operation range and simplify the design of the fundamental oscillator and the selection process of the frequency divider.\r\n\r\nA successful effort will provide the scientific community with design and optimization techniques for novel PLL topologies with superior performance compared to traditional architectures. The proposed approach can be employed for stable, wideband electronic-based THz sources having numerous applications including radio astronomy, atmospheric sensing, biological research, wireless communications, radar, and chemical and explosives detection. Undergraduate students will be involved in the experimental work. Planned outreach activities include developing hands-on activities for \"Design your Future Day,\" an annual workshop organized for female high school students.",
