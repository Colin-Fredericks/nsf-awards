 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract below:\r\n\r\nGraphs and networks are a natural representation across a wide range\r\nof disciplines and domains. Statistical tools have recently been\r\nbrought to bear on the analysis of graphs, yielding rich dividends in\r\nvarious application areas. The aim of this project is to use tools\r\nfrom statistics and graph theory to develop algorithms that generate\r\nsimilar graphs efficiently. Since graph data is often expensive to\r\ncollect, it is desirable to synthetically generate graphs. To be\r\nwidely applicable however, the generated graphs need to both preserve\r\nthe semantics of the original data (i.e., be drawn from the same\r\ndistribution) and be efficient to compute.\r\n\r\nTwo key questions form the core emphasis of the current project.\r\nFirst, how does one measure similarity between two graphs? Second, how\r\ncan this notion of similarity be used to generate new graphs? On the\r\ntopic of similarity, the project will investigate representations to\r\npreserve global properties, propose new, efficient, representations\r\nfor signatures, and explore sampling techniques and their convergence\r\nbehavior. On the topic of generation of new graphs, the project will\r\ndevelop an exponential random graph model using signatures,\r\ninvestigate feature selection via regularization, propose novel\r\nmethods to sample from the exponential random graph model and novel\r\ntechniques to produce proposal graphs, and provide rigorous empirical\r\nvalidation across a range of application areas.\r\n\r\nThe project will facilitate the study of large complex structures of\r\nthe kind frequently encountered in domains like theoretical ecology,\r\nsocial networks, and chemo-informatics, allowing researchers in these\r\ndomains to leverage statistical network analysis tools to identify\r\nsignificant patterns and understand algorithm performance.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page:\r\nURL: http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~vishy/graphs.html\r\n",
