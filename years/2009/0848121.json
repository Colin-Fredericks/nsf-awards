 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This project will focus on the development of new methods for the synthesis of organic peroxides.  The peroxide moiety, characterized by the presence of an oxygen-oxygen bond, is found in many biologically active natural products.  Preliminary data suggests that the core structures of several families of natural products can be constructed by new chemical reactions.  These processes will be developed, and their application to more complicated structures will be pursued.  Mechanistic studies will be conducted to provide insight into how these transformations proceed.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Keith A. Woerpel of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine.  Professor Woerpel's research focuses on the development of new chemical reactions for the synthesis of complex organic molecules.  Peroxides show considerable promise as drug candidates, but they are difficult to synthesize because of their inherent instability.  Successful development of methods for the synthesis of peroxides would lead to the development of new drugs for the treatment of malaria and cancer.",
