The lead of the proposed Center is UMBC with site locations at Georgia Tech (GT) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center plans to develop, test, and optimize prototypes of computationally intensive applications. A key contribution of the Center will be the implementation of prototype applications on new architectures and comparative performance analysis. This Center is needed to advance knowledge both in high-performance computing as well as computer architecture communities. The PIs are well qualified and the access to resources is excellent. The combined computing facilities at UMBC and GT, respectively, are the largest most advanced Cell Broadband Engine based multicore university systems available today. \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center will address the future needs of the computer industry as this new hybrid multicore processor technology evolves. The proposed Center will provide faculty and students the unique opportunity to gain hands-on expertise to address a wide variety of practical, hybrid multicore applications in areas of climate prediction, defense, biomedical informatics, 3-D graphic environments, finance and social computing. The Center has described efforts to increase participation of underrepresented groups, and there are plans to publish the results of research and education projects within an online Hybrid Multicore Knowledge Repository.",
