 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine design principles and technology advancements to enable the deployment and evaluation of new interface paradigms for managing continuities between hyperlinked 3D virtual workspaces and for managing user orientation with respect to 2D and 3D information resources within virtual workspaces. \r\n\r\nHaving built the open source 3D collaboration system (Open Cobalt) as a means of enabling the deployment of hyperlinked virtual workspaces, the research group will leverage the modularity and flexibility of Open Cobalt's graphical user interface (GUI) framework to explore optimal user interface approaches for: (1) defining optimal affordances for virtual workspace authors and end-users to manage the configuration and functionality of 3D portals (links) within hypermedia-enabled virtual workspaces, and (2) managing the perceptual relationships among 2D and 3D components displayed within virtual workspaces, which include multiple interacting avatars and aggregated 2D and 3D content. The research will assess the effectiveness of multiple GUI approaches in each of these areas in the context of two exemplar implementations involving scientific collaboration and education. \r\n\r\nThis work will provide key insights into optimal GUI approaches for managing content and connectivity within virtual workspaces. It will also: (1) further advance usability within a software infrastructure designed to support the cost-effective, large-scale deployment of interconnected and deeply capable virtual workspaces, (2) advance a common and extensible software framework supporting synchronized communication and collaboration among large numbers of people across distributed and hyperlinked virtual workspace contexts, and (3) provide open source software products that can serve as the basis for future research experimentation. \r\n\r\nThis project has great potential in advancing an effective 3D GUI for managing virtual place and space so that people are better able to manage access to social and informational resources within hyperlinked virtual workspaces. This will have direct impact on the efficacy of using virtual workspaces in support of education, research, business, social interaction, and entertainment. The resulting functionality of Open Cobalt will; (1) provide a highly capable open source platform in support of further research on virtual worlds; (2) further advance a powerful medium for enabling scientific outreach and education; and (3) serve as a powerful 'force multiplier' that by supporting an interlinked network of multi-user virtual world spaces, can leverage individual and recombined intellectual communities across the nation and beyond.\r\n",
