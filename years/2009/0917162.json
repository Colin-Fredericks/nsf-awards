 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtualization is rapidly becoming a key technology for computing\r\nsystems, promising significant benefits in security, efficiency, and\r\ndependability.  Fully realizing these benefits depends upon the\r\nreliability of virtual machine monitors (hypervisors). This research\r\naims toward developing a very high assurance, commercial quality\r\nhypervisor by:\r\n\r\n(1) designing practical tools and techniques to make reasoning about\r\n  hypervisors feasible;\r\n(2) honing them through the formal verification of an existing simple\r\n  research hypervisor; and  (3) applying them to develop and prove a graduated series of more and\r\n  more realistic hypervisor models, aiming toward a fully\r\n  functional, formally verified hypervisor.\r\n\r\nThe project proceeds along two tracks.  In the first, an existing\r\nresearch hypervisor is modeled and verified using the ACL2 formal\r\nanalysis tools.  In the second track, tools and methodologies are\r\ndeveloped applicable to a wide variety of hypervisor implementations.\r\nThis work aims to advance the formal analysis of an important class of\r\nsoftware applications and to advance the state of the art in formal methods,\r\nparticularly management of large and complex formal proofs.  This\r\nresearch is a collaboration between the formal methods and systems\r\nresearch groups at the University of Texas at Austin.\r\n",
