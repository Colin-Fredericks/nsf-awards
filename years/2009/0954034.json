 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\r\n\r\nThis engineering education research CAREER award to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will advance fundamental knowledge of how professional engineering practices have changed due to globalization and how this has impacted engineers in the field. The research is very innovative because it will contribute to theoretical development in the area of global engineering education and provide an intellectual foundation to develop pedagogical resources to prepare globally competent engineers. The results will impact engineering education widely through a guide on working on global teams which will be produced and disseminated to students, faculty, and study abroad offices.  Also the online repository of case studies and supporting curriculum will be published in academic journals and through online platforms such as NSDL.org and GlobalHUB.org. The project includes a strong evaluation and the commitment to share best practices with other engineering schools. It will enhance the number of students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs or start new high tech businesses.",
