 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research award is to investigate \"vascular wall engineering\" (VWE) using a highly synergistic combination of electrospinning, ultrafast femtosecond laser machining and biological integration. These unique, multi-scalar grafts meet the structural and biological requirements normally supplied by human vascular tissues. By studying the fundamental phenomena inherent to each distinct, contributing process, the resulting grafts will be tailorable and can modulate cell adhesion and, ultimately, the clotting response that normally prevents long-term function of synthetic vascular grafts.\r\n\r\nVWE that integrates synthetic materials with living cells within biomechanically capable, 3D-structured vascular grafts is desperately needed.  The inherent compositional, manufacturing and multiscalar flexibility of this process ultimately allows widespread, rapid reproduction of natural structures. Successful VWE will provide broad treatments for patients having a variety of serious clinical disorders. By studying and integrating two distinct forms of material processing with biomedical engineering, the opportunity exists to create a highly capable platform technology for future manufacturing. This research will support two PhD-level graduate students whose training is essential to the future competitiveness of the US in the domain of biomedical innovation. It also provides a research context continuing the involvement of under-represented minorities at both the high school and undergraduate levels. A presentation entitled ?Tissue Engineering the Human Body? will be developed for use in the Center of Science and Industry?s COSI Academy, a program for aspiring 14 to 18 year-old scientists and engineers.",
