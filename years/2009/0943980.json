 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I Center will address the foremost challenges in the field of C?H functionalization: the regioselective and stereoselective modification of unsaturated carbon centers. The goal is to make available a suite of chemical transformations for C-C, C-N, C-O, and C-X bond formation that are predictable, general, and utilitarian. The realization of this objective will provide novel technologies that change traditional paradigms for the logic of chemical synthesis.\r\n \r\nThe Center for Stereoselective C-H Functionalization will broadly share their research results to maximize the impact of this award. The Center will also fund collaborative training opportunities between Center investigators and also with industrial partners for graduate students and postdocs. The Center will partner with regional Minority Serving Institutions (HBCUs or HSIs) to provide symposia and research opportunities to students from under-represented groups. Center investigators will also engage high school teachers and students in the Center projects.\r\n \r\nThe Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers that can address major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges that have a high probability of both producing transformative research and leading to innovation. These Centers will attract broad scientific and public interest by sharing the results of their innovative approach to this challenging question.",
