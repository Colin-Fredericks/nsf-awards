 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe project develops cryptographic protocol reasoning techniques\r\nthat take into account algebraic properties of cryptosystems.\r\nTraditionally, formal methods for cryptographic protocol\r\nverification view cryptographic operations as a black box,\r\nignoring the properties of cryptographic algorithms that can be\r\nexploited to design attacks. The proposed research uses a novel\r\napproach based on equational unification to build new more\r\nexpressive and efficient search algorithms for algebraic theories\r\nrelevant to cryptographic protocols. Equational unification gives\r\na compact representation of all circumstances under which two\r\ndifferent terms correspond to the same behavior.  The algorithms\r\nare implemented and integrated into Maude-NPA, a system that has\r\nbeen successful in symbolic protocol analysis. It is demonstrated\r\nthat Maude-NPA when enriched with such powerful unification\r\nalgorithms can analyze protocols and ensure their reliability,\r\nwhich could not be done otherwise.\r\n\r\nImproved techniques for analyzing security are helpful both in\r\nassuring that systems are free of bugs, and in speeding up the\r\nacceptance of new systems based on the confidence gained by a\r\nformal analysis. This research will lead to the design and\r\nimplementation of next generation tools for protocol analysis.\r\nAlgorithms developed will be made available to researchers as a\r\nlibrary suitable for use with protocol analysis tools. Tools from\r\nthe project will help students understand concepts relevant to\r\nprotocol design and get hands-on experience. Equational\r\nunification for algebraic theories is not only useful for\r\nprotocol analysis, but also for program analysis in general, thus\r\nmaking the results of this project to be widely relevant.",
