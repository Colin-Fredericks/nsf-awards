 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nA significant majority of current Internet traffic is due to distributing content, yet the Internet was designed to be largely agnostic to characteristics of the content flowing over it. This research investigates the design and operation of a content-aware Internet ecosystem, which thrives on the interaction between users (seeking seek fast and correct downloads), content providers (seeking to minimize network congestion and transit traffic), and network providers (who generate content, and seek the cost- and resource-efficient dissemination). \r\n\r\nThis research takes a two-pronged approach. On one hand, it explores novel analysis of fundamental performance limits for a content-aware Internet ecosystem that rigorously characterizes the benefits of an intelligently designed cross-layer architecture. On the other hand, it includes developing mechanisms and practical implementation of a content distribution system, by which involved parties can interact constructively to achieve these gains yet respect each others' interests. This approach combines a range of techniques, including modeling and theoretical analysis, measurement and data analysis, system design, simulation, and system implementation. Affordable and ready access to digital content helps inform, educate, and entertain society as a whole. Additionally, by developing cost- and resource-effective delivery techniques, the friction continuing to build between involved parties can be reduced and the technical side of the network neutrality debate can be better informed. To enhance this impact, the project includes an educational component involving local universities from under-represented groups, curriculum development and interactions with industry.",
