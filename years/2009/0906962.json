Specific\r\nobjectives include the analysis of higher dimensional filling\r\ninvariants of groups, higher filling invariants at infinity\r\n(higher divergence), and investigating the structure of\r\nasymptotic cones of finitely presented groups. Other specific\r\nobjectives include the use of combinatorial Morse theory in\r\nunderstanding virtual fibering in certain classes of groups, and\r\nin developing an approach to the relator gap problem. The\r\nprincipal investigator also intends to compare non-positive\r\ncurvature methods and topological methods (using stable\r\ncommutator length) for proving the existence of surface subgroups\r\nin various classes of hyperbolic groups.\r\n\r\nGroups are used by mathematicians to study symmetry. A group is\r\njust a collection of symmetries of an object. Examples include\r\nthe geometric symmetries of a wallpaper pattern, or of a crystal\r\nstructure, or of an Escher painting, or the algebraic symmetries\r\nassociated to roots of polynomials. Mathematicians have studied\r\ngroups intensively as abstract algebraic objects since the 19th\r\ncentury. In the 1980's M. Gromov proposed that we consider groups\r\nas geometric objects, and began to derive deep connections\r\nbetween the geometric and the algebraic properties of groups. One\r\ntheme which emerged from Gromov's work is that the geometric\r\nproperties which have deep algebraic consequences are not local\r\nproperties, but rather coarse or \"large scale\".  For example, and\r\ninfinite ladder and an infinite straight line are not locally\r\nalike, but are large scale alike, and their symmetry groups will\r\nhave many algebraic similarities. The PI investigates large scale\r\nversions of isoperimetric problems (area versus perimeter length\r\nproblems) in groups, and also the geometry of coarsely negatively\r\ncurved groups. These investigations help deepen our understanding\r\nof the nature of symmetry.\r\n",
