 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaboration between SDSM&T and the Oglala Lakota College (OLC) campuses seeks to establish new opportunities for Native American students in South Dakota to become involved with geoscience education through participation in the High Plains Regional Science and Engineering Fair, which is affiliated with the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) and held at SDSM&T.  This planning grant project is working to achieve these objectives: 1) expose Native American students and members of their extended families to geosciences through preparation of science fair projects; 2) initiate mentoring experience for the Native American students on the SDSM&T and OLC campuses in the preparation of the science fair projects; 3) create a model for collaboration between Area School Districts and higher education for South Dakota through the OLC/ SDSM&T partnership that can be replicated throughout the Dakotas; 4) team faculty members and researchers at SDSM&T with science faculty members and liaisons from OLC to offer cross-institutional mentoring and guidance for middle/high school students; 5) encourage faculty members and researchers to take Lakota culture and language classes at the Rapid City Native culture classes to enhance their understanding of cultural differences; and 6) raise awareness and improve access for Native Americans to geoscience education. The planning grant proposal is focused on establishing the collaborations between SDSM&T, OLC, and the Area School Districts of Rapid City, Black Hills and Pine Ridge Reservation and addressing the very small participation of Native American students in this region in science fair opportunities.",
