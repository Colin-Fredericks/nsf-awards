St. Philip's College will recruit, retain, graduate and transfer students to four-year institutions where they will complete undergraduate degrees in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nProject GeNex aims to improve STEM education at SPC and increase the number of STEM professionals in the nation's workforce. To achieve this goal, three objectives will be targeted: \r\n1) To increase the number of students who enroll as STEM majors; \r\n2) To increase rate of course completion of STEM majors; and \r\n3) To increase the retention rate of STEM majors. \r\n\r\nThis project is innovative in that it will provide additional opportunities to increase the recruitment, retention, graduation and transfer to universities of minority students in the STEM disciplines.
