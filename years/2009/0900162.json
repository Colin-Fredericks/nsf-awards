 "awd_abstract_narration": "Top-down and bottom-up are two nanomanufacturing approaches which allow one to achieve nanometer scale structures. Top-down method is approaching its theoretic limits on the feature size that it can offer. In contrast, starting from tailored molecules, bottom-up method such as self assembly can easily reach nanometer feature sizes. One drawback of self assembly, however, is the difficulty to achieve large scale, defect-free structures. Combining the top-down and bottom-up methods in one system can lead to novel hierarchical nanostructures with small feature size and less defects. The PI aims to fabricate hierarchically ordered nanostructures (from a few nanometers to micron scale) by combining holographic lithography (top-down technique) and block copolymer self assembly (bottom-up method). The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) Fabricating hierarchical nanostructures by combining holography lithography and block copolymer self-assembly, and (2) Using both homopolymer and block copolymers as the vehicle to introduce a variety of functional groups into the hierarchical nanostructure and fabricating multifunctional nanostructures for thermal sensitive optical switches, high density data storage, and porous membrane applications.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project, if successful, could lead to a new method to achieve hierarchical nanostructures for a variety of technological applications. The educational component of the proposal includes: (1) Developing a ?Polymeric Materials Enabled Nanomanufacturing? module that will be used in the ?Nanostructured Polymeric Materials? course. (2) Involving high school students and teachers, particularly under-represented populations, in the proposed research activities. \r\n",
