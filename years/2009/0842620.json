 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social power is a fundamental element of human society.  Having power over others (or, lacking power) profoundly affects people's experiences of emotion, their social relationships, and the kinds of decisions they make.  Several recent scientific studies suggest that being in a position of power makes people especially decisive and action-oriented. This can help powerful leaders take appropriate action when necessary, but it can also result in overly quick and risky types of decision-making. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Michael Kaschak and Dr. Jon Maner will help uncover the basic psychological processes underlying these consequences of power. Their studies explore the hypothesis that the experience of power has a fundamental effect on people's motor systems (the bodily systems responsible for physical movement), essentially gearing up the neural systems responsible for planning and executing physical actions.  The investigators will examine this idea by conducting laboratory experiments that place people into positions of power and then measuring both their ability to perform basic motor responses (such as moving their arm to press a button, or moving a computer mouse to select a response on the computer screen), and their propensity to make risky decisions.  The investigators will examine the extent to which power promotes forms of risky decision-making via power's effects on the motor system. \r\n\r\nFrom the choices of corporate CEOs to the actions of major world leaders, the decisions of those with power dramatically shape the world in which we live. Indeed, some form of power or hierarchy exists within virtually every type of social context, from informal interactions between friends, to professional relationships within an academic or business environment, to decisions made at the highest levels of government. The research being conducted by Drs. Kaschak and Maner will help identify the basic psychological mechanisms underlying choice and action and so has implications for understanding and informing the decisions and actions of leaders across a wide range of social and professional domains.",
