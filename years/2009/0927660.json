 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proejct is to develop a predictive model for predicting rheological behavior of cement-based materials. Using a coupled immersed boundary method (IBM) - discrete element method (DEM), the model will link individual particle behavior to the bulk rheological behavior of cement-based materials at multiple scales. The major research activities will include (1) utilizing atomic force microcopy (AFM) experiments to calibrate/validate a coupled IBM-DEM model and to capture the interparticle interactions in a cement system (nanoscale); (2) establishing a refined coupled IBM-DEM model to predict bulk rheological behavior of a cement paste in simple shear flow (mesoscale); and (3) assessing the predictive capability of the model via rheological experiments of various cement pastes (meso and macro scales). This research approach/methodology will eventually lead to better macroscale models of concrete in future. \r\n\r\nThrough experiments, theory and modeling, the project will provide a better understanding of the rheological behavior of cement-based materials. The developed model will permit more economical designs by optimizing mix proportions for specified rheological requirements in concrete practice. The information on the particle interaction can be adapted by the cement industry for modifying cement chemistry and physical properties during the cement manufacturing process. The proposed work requires interdisciplinary knowledge in concrete materials, multiphase flow modeling, and nanoscale surface engineering and mechanics, and therefore, students will be trained in a variety of complementary research techniques during this project. \r\n",
