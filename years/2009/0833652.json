 "awd_abstract_narration": "A six-week-long research workshop on Intelligent Information Systems (IIS) is being held at Johns Hopkins University on Machine Learning for Language Engineering.  It strives for cross-fertilization with other areas of machine intelligence.  The workshop has diverse teams of professionals and students engaged in an intensive effort to advance the state of science.\r\nLanguage Engineering encompasses speech recognition, machine translation, information retrieval and extraction, etc., and shares fundamental Machine Learning techniques with other fields within IIS, most notably computer vision, medical- and bio-informatics and social network analysis.\r\nThe goal of the workshop is to advance machine learning for IIS and to attract students to the field and initiate them in research by working alongside senior scientists.\r\nFor projects to address relevant problems, an open call for proposals was issued to the IIS community. The (35) received proposals were evaluated at a planning meeting (attended by project proponents, government representatives, and experts from related fields) which chose the specific projects, their research leaders and many senior participants. The graduate students were selected according to their known performance, the undergraduates through a national search.\r\nThe workshop will disseminate its results and help incorporate them into research at geographically diverse institutions. The five past workshops resulted in 80 publications in premier journals and conferences. Some of the work was initiated in the workshops and completed after their conclusion.  \r\nIndividuals from several institutions are conducting collaborative research in this workshop, discovering new techniques, creating and disseminating valuable tools and establishing long-lasting collaborations. Graduate as well as undergraduate students are being initiated into the IIS field.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHuman Language Technology (HLT) encompasses capabilities such as speech recognition by computers, understanding of natural language text (as opposed to computer code), automatic translation of text from one language to another, information retrieval, extraction and summarization from large text databases, computers answering users\u00c6 questions, etc.  Computer Vision (CV), similarly, is concerned with making computers understand and interpret images and video, instead of speech and text.  If a computer were capable of performing these tasks, we would consider it intelligent.  In this broader sense, the goal of this NSF project was to train the next generation of scientists and engineers, and to make research breakthroughs, in pursuit of intelligent machines.\n\nModern HLT and CV technology performs nowhere near human abilities.  Even the apparent success of products such as Apple\u00c6s Siri app on the iPhone, Google\u00c6s prowess in web search and translation, or IBM\u00c6s Jeopardy! victory is, arguably, limited to \"friendly\" operating conditions: machine-directed speech, cooperative users and limited domains.  Spontaneous or accented speech is still very difficult for computers to transcribe, complex sentences are still interpreted wrongly, translations are at best marginal between all but a few language pairs, and computer vision systems fail to recognize partially occluded objects or images with less than ideal lighting conditions.\n\nTo make advances in these technologies often requires a diversity of expertise from fields like linguistics, neuroscience, computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics and statistics.  A meta-problem, therefore is to bring together a top-notch interdisciplinary team to work together closely on the problem, to make deep and genuine collaboration happen.\n\nThis NSF project tried to tackle these difficult HLT and CV problems in a novel way: bringing together researchers from geographically diverse institutions from across the globe in one central place, providing them a state-of-the-art laboratory and working environment, injecting an equal number of up-and-coming PhD students into the group, infusing some young blood in the room by adding the best undergraduate students from across the country, and letting them work together day and night for almost two months: a summer (boot) camp for researchers young and old.\n\nThree different \"teams\" were formed each winter (January-March of 2009, 2010 and 2011), each with roughly 4-5 senior researchers, 3-4 graduate students and 2-3 undergraduates.  Each team had a well-defined research objective, which was agreed upon ahead of time following a vigorous scientific debate among experts.

The workshops have seeded close collaborations across institutions and disciplines that continue to this day.  The workshops continue to be endorsed by the HLT and CV research communities as a valuable avenue for addressing new challenges and examining complex problems.\n\nOver three summers (2009-2011), mor..."
