 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Scott A. Snyder of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will develop new approaches for the asymmetric halogenation of alkenes by exploring novel classes of electrophilic halogen reagents and surrogates. The success of these efforts will provide the first way to achieve asymmetric halogenation of unactivated olefins as well as direct and indirect halonium-induced cation-pi cyclizations. The addition of these reactions to the synthetic chemistry toolbox would finally make possible the synthesis of dozens of unsolved natural product architectures that possess halogen atoms in combination with unique, and largely unexplored, chemical biology profiles. It should also elucidate principles in reagent design and synthetic strategy that may help to solve other significant challenges.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program will enable Professor Snyder to utilize the power of natural products synthesis and reaction design to expand the number and diversity of students pursuing STEM-based careers. These efforts will be focused on both the high school and undergraduate levels. First, Professor Snyder will offer students and teachers from local high schools in the New York City area, particularly public schools with high socioeconomic diversity, an opportunity to participate in a specially tailored experiential visit day at Columbia University, followed by a chance to work in Professor Snyder's laboratory for eight weeks. In the laboratory, they will work on a challenging chemical research problem and develop an experiment that can be utilized in the school's laboratory program for years to come. Second, Professor Snyder will create an inquiry-based laboratory program for Columbia's introductory undergraduate organic chemistry program based on a natural product total synthesis. This concept is meant to modernize the teaching curriculum, better marry its objectives across lecture and laboratory settings, and best illustrate to undergraduates the real nature and excitement of synthetic organic chemistry.",
