There are many exciting developments in our understanding of photosynthetic energy conversion that have happened since the last Photosynthesis GRC on biophysical aspects, held in 2006. Large scale computational studies, done in conjunction with novel imaging approaches have modeled the assembly of large photosynthetic complexes and opened the door to the atomic level functioning of these molecular energy converting machines. Much progress has also been made in our understanding of the efficiency and regulation of light harvesting by photosynthetic antenna systems in a number of different photosynthetic systems. There has been an intense focus on the operation of the water splitting reaction and detailed function of the oxygen evolving complex. This most critical reaction is responsible for the oxygen we breathe and understanding its function may be the key to efficient hydrogen production in the future. All of this work has implications in the race for sustainable energy sources. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include advancement of understanding and dissemination of cutting-edge research results. The focus on the development of sustainable global energy solutions has been especially promoted by having world leading international researchers in alternative energy speak at our meeting. These include Prof. Dr. Klaus Lips (Helmholz Institute, Germany) who is a top international researcher in thin film photovoltaic science and Professor Fraser Armstrong (Oxford University, UK) who heads a very large and influential laboratory focused on hydrogen production and bio-based fuel cell technology. These researchers would not normally attend a conference focused on photosynthesis, but are excited to be interacting with our photosynthesis community to work together towards sustainable energy solutions. The conference thus offers a unique opportunity to forge new international collaborations between experts in Nature's solar energy converter and experts in sustainable alternative energy technologies. The conference will also emphasize participation of junior investigators. In addition to a large number of poster presentations by students and postdocs, 6 of the 24 invited speakers qualify as junior investigators.",
