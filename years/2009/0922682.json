 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to acquire a state-of-the-art nanoscale imprint lithography system to provide critical fabrication capabilities for continued research progress in large area, high-throughput, high resolution nanoscale device applications. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The acquisition of this nanoimprint system will advance nanoscale science and technology on numerous research projects at the University of Cincinnati and other Southwestern Ohio Universities.  These projects include photonic device fabrication and integration, photonic optoelectronic structures, silicon and nanotube-array biosensor fabrication, bioNEMS and labs-on-a-chip, semiconductor nanowire plasmonic biosensors, quantum well infrared photodetectors for long wave infrared applications, and basic single semiconductor nanowire investigations.  Each of these projects will benefit from, and in some cases will be made possible by, the acquisition of the nanoimprinter tool. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. This nanoimprint system will expand the research capabilities for a wide range of faculty and literally scores of graduate students in their thesis and dissertation research, and will expose undergraduates and summer program students to state-of-the-art fabrication techniques.  This acquisition will have a direct and strong impact on the development and training of  future U.S. scientists and engineers in nanoscale science and engineering, a critical segment of the nation's workforce. Undergraduate students will be exposed to nanoscale science through a series of structured laboratory experiments integrated with an existing NSF Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education program. Significant collaborative efforts also currently exist between the University of Cincinnati, Xavier University (an undergraduate institution), Miami University, and the University of Dayton.",
