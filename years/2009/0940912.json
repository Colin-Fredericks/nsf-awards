 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comprehensive understanding of how organisms genetically respond to changing ecological and environmental conditions is one of the most challenging questions currently facing modern biological research and is the focus of the field of Ecological Genomics. This project aims to advance the field of ecological genomics through support of the seventh annual Ecological Genomics Symposium to be hosted by the Kansas State University from the 13th to the 15th of November 2009, in Kansas City, Missouri. This symposium provides the only annual forum for the dissemination of the rapidly advancing and diverse research in ecological genomics in the world. Therefore, this symposium provides an essential venue for exchanging scientific information from diverse disciplines and fostering novel research directions that can lead to important discoveries. The project will specifically support travel and lodging costs for nine speakers and seven student fellowships. The scientists that will speak at the symposium include established and emerging leaders of the field that represent both scientific and cultural diversity. The student fellowships will support young scientists working in ecological genomics. These fellowships will be targeted to support individuals from historically underrepresented groups in science. The meeting is designed around a single set of non-overlapping invited talks over a two-day period so there is ample opportunity to cultivate interactions among the participants.",
