Prof. Tokmakoff also maintains a Web site(http://www.mit.edu/~tokmakof/TDQMS/) through which his most recent quantum mechanics course materials are made available. Additional lecture and laboratory course materials are distributed on the MIT OpenCourseWare Web site(http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm/).",
