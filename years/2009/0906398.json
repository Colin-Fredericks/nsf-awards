Pilot implementations are incorporated in open source\r\nstatistical software systems.\r\n\r\nEffective statistical methodology made available through statistical\r\nsoftware is critical to the ability of researchers to make maximal use\r\nof experimental and observational data, and for the ability of\r\ninstructors to teach good research practices.  The design principles\r\ndeveloped by this research lead to software that improves the ability\r\nof researchers, instructors, and other users of statistical\r\nmethodology to apply this methodology more effectively in scientific\r\nresearch and teaching and to take full advantage of modern\r\nhigh-performance computational resources.  These principles also lead\r\nto software frameworks that can be used to more rapidly deliver new\r\nstatistical methodology to end users.  Applications in a range of\r\nareas serve as testbeds for methods and principles developed in this\r\nresearch.\r\n",
