 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project proposes to develop a smart wheelchair system that will integrate onboard LIDAR for position estimation and obstacle detection with an adaptive motor controller framework. The resulting smart-chair will be capable of autonomous navigation outdoors, and under real-world environmental conditions. This technology will be integrated into the Automated Transport and Retrieval System (ATRS). ATRS represents a new paradigm in personal auto-mobility for wheelchair users. It affords complete mobility independence while providing a safer and more economical transportation alternative to van conversions. The proposed smart-chair will be the heart of ATRS. It will navigate autonomously between the driver's seat position and a lift platform at the rear of the vehicle where the chair will be automatically secured and stowed for transport. This eliminates the need of an attendant for stowing and retrieving the wheelchair for the driver.\r\n\r\nAccess to transportation is critical for Americans with disabilities and the elderly to participate fully in basic activities such as employment, education, worship, job training, commerce, recreation, and other activities of community life that most people take for granted. By facilitating personal transportation, the proposed smart-chair system will improve personal independence and the quality of life for the physically challenged across the country. It will also help remove one of the greatest hurdles preventing wheelchair users from finding employment. With the number of people 65 and over in the U.S. expected to double from 35 million people in 2002 to 70 million by 2030, a sizable market is expected. The benefits of the technology-based smart-chair/ATRS paradigm over van conversions include lower cost, improved safety and greater vehicle choice.\r\n",
