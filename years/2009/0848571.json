Professor Makarov and his research group are developing computational tools and applying them to characterize the relationship between the structure of proteins and their resistance to co-translational unfolding. These computational studies complement  recent single-molecule protein translocation experiments. An interdisciplinary workshop on single molecule dynamics that brings together theorists and experimentalists from a variety of disciplines is being planned.\r\n\r\nAdvances in molecular level understanding of the mechanisms of protein translocation may have a broad impact in terms of understanding the diseases that are related to defects in translocation machinery.",
