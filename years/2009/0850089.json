 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers at the University of Washington will purchase a new Thermo MAT 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer to replace a 25 year old model.  This instrument replacement is needed because the existing instrument is experiencing an increase in failure frequency and associated down-time.  This increase in failure is causing substantial delays (months) in sample analysis, and the existing software is not compatible with unattended analyses, making analyses more labor-intensive.  In addition, the laboratory is a heavily used teaching facility that relies on rapid sample analysis for student research projects, which is jeopardized by the existing instrumentation.  The new instrument will be able to measure the isotopic composition of noble gases (Ar, Kr, Xe and Ne), which currently cannot be measured by any mass spectrometers in the laboratory, and will be needed for future research projects. Currently there are 14 projects within the College of Ocean and Fishery Sciences (COFS) that rely on isotope ratio measurements in the laboratory.  These projects involve seven faculty and nine graduate students within Chemical Oceanography.  Last year, twelve (out of 80) undergraduate Oceanography majors worked in the laboratory either for pay, individual research projects, or for class-related research.  The laboratory plays a central role in the research and teaching programs within the COFS.  Realizing that the successful operation of the laboratory is currently at risk, and the importance of rectifying this situation, the COFS will provide $100K in matching funds for a new mass spectrometer.  In terms of broader impacts, this equipment will substantially improve the infrastructure for research and teaching at the University of Washington.  The breadth of research and teaching activities within COFS that are impacted by isotope or gas ratio analyses is demonstrated by the significant number of faculty and students that rely on the laboratory.  Because of the large number of graduate and undergraduate students that routinely work in the laboratory, the new instrument will be a key teaching instrument within the COFS.",
