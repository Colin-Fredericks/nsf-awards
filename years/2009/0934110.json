The purpose of the meeting is to stimulate interest and enhance understanding of the technical and applied aspects of computer algebra.  The conference provides a forum for those interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to participate, interact, and meet with others in an inexpensive and easily accessible way.  ECCAD is a one-day meeting that is more informal than other technical conferences in the field, with ample time for unstructured interaction.  Participation by graduate students and junior faculty is particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster session and software demonstrations, and through travel support.\r\nThe meeting will include presentations by four invited speakers who have made outstanding contributions in the field of computer algebra.  These speakers will anchor the meeting and help attract participants.  There will also be a special panel on Future Directions in Computer Algebra, along with the poster and demonstration session.  The invited talks, panel, and poster session are expected to cover the entire range of computer algebra: algorithms, systems, and applications.  The contributed posters and software demonstrations will enable researchers, especially junior faculty and graduate students, to publicize their recent findings and to make new contacts.\r\nThis year's ECCAD is only the second to be held in New England.  With many colleges and universities in the area, it is hoped that the meeting will be able to draw a large number of attendees and to generate new interest in computer algebra.\r\n\r\n",
