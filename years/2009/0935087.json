 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project supports graduate student participation in the 26th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2009). Specifically, the project supports travel to the conference for those who might not otherwise be able to attend for financial reasons and organizes a student poster-presentation program that will facilitate one-on-one discussions and other mentoring with the world's leading researchers in machine learning. Students will be exposed to state-of-the-art work by other researchers and will have the opportunity to attend tutorials on material that is not taught at their home institutions. Participating students will receive feedback from senior researchers beyond their institutional and national boundaries. Furthermore, participation in the poster session and conference will help integrate these students into the research community and represents a natural integration of research and education.",
