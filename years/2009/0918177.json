 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects perceive the world through chemical signals, like pheromones, that communicate the presence of friends and foes, advertize the readiness to mate, and indicate the availability of food. They evolved an olfactory system so acute that they can find \"a needle in a haystack\" by smelling relevant information broadcasted in the midst of complex chemical mixtures in the environment. In addition, they \"separate the darnel from the wheat\" with a remarkable selectivity that allows them to detect a chemical signal while being completely insensitive to another molecule almost identical (from an anthropomorphic perspective). By using biochemical, biophysical, molecular biology, and electrophysiological approaches, the project will dissect molecular interactions of moth sex pheromone with an odorant receptor and other olfactory proteins. The goal is to unveil how these olfactory proteins contribute to the extraordinary sense of smell of the insect. Understanding the molecular basis of the inordinate sensitivity and selectivity of the insect olfactory system will open the door for the development of not only strategies for insect pest control, but also biomimetic devices for industrial and homeland security applications.  In addition, these research activities will be a platform for training graduate students as well as for professional development of postdoctoral scholars for academic and/or scientific careers. This project in synergy with other academic activities will provide opportunities for training underrepresented minorities.",
