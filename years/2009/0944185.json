Participants intend to:  1) formulate key research priorities and questions; 2) identify key sources of institutional and scientific knowledge, data, and institutional support; 3) begin to build a common knowledge base that will be made available to policymakers, scholars, and students via the Internet; and 4) develop long-term educational and collaborative opportunities for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas and the host institution, Universidad de Zulia.  By including students from minority groups from the University of Texas, women and indigenous people, and outstanding international scholars from the U.S. and Venezuela, the proposed planning visit will foster a more creative engagement with the social and political-economic causes of the water crisis in the Lake Maracaibo Basin that will allow participants to envision innovative research approaches to this important research area. \r\n",
