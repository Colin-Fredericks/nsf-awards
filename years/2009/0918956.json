The project is transforming the statics learning experience so that it is student-centered, by drawing together the potential of computer technology and an interactive classroom in a synergistic way. The web-based materials are being used in a wide variety of learning environments to test their effectiveness within a broad spectrum of faculty and students. The materials are being developed to provide students with instantaneous feedback on their learning and to provide faculty with comprehensive feedback on their students' progress. The tools being developed will allow faculty to create an interactive classroom where routine instruction takes place outside the classroom followed by stimulating, targeted activities inside the classroom. The project is being rigorously assessed to determine its impact on student learning and motivation through formative and summative means. The results from the project are being broadly disseminated through multiple venues, include online resources.",
