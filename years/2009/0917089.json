 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThis project designs, analyzes, and implements a k-Cover-Sense-Inform (k-CSI) framework for heterogeneous and mission-oriented mobile wireless sensor networks, where connected k-coverage, scheduling, and data forwarding are jointly considered. It (a) builds a theoretical foundation to achieve connected k-coverage of a given a region of interest while minimizing the total number of heterogeneous sensors, (b) designs secure data routing and dissemination protocols on top of secure scheduling protocols for connected k-coverage while minimizing the energy consumption due to sensor mobility and their collaboration, and (c) develops a prototype for k-CSI and assesses its performance through simulations using network simulator TOSSIM, and implementation using mobility-enabled MICAz motes based test-beds while considering various mobility models and a variety of network configuration and missions.\r\nThese research efforts are integrated with development of courses on mission-oriented mobile wireless sensor networks. The project helps recruit graduate and undergraduate students, especially economically disadvantaged students, including minorities, and expand the perspectives of K-12 teachers and high-school students by illustrating aspects of scholarship and methodology through High School University Seminar Series offered to local school districts in Long-Island, New York. Results are disseminated through publications in conferences and journals.\r\n",
