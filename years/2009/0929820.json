 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Senior Alliance was assembled for its potential to impact a minority majority population in southeast Texas. The alliance is comprehensive, including the country?s largest school district, two community college systems, a comprehensive HBCU and HSI, and the second most ethnically diverse research university in the country. For this proposal, the alliance has unanimously selected the University of Houston to apply for the Bridge to Doctorate Cohort-1. The University of Houston is the US?s second most ethnically diverse research university, and the 23rd largest in the United States. The University of Houston currently offers over 108 baccalaureate, 131 master, and 53 doctoral programs.\r\nThough a combination of a strong leadership team, outstanding faculty and staff, a proven track-record for success in diversity, using its leverage in the community, and national standing, the University of Houston plans to use Cohort-1 of the BD grant to:\r\nGoal 1 Increase the minority representation in graduate STEM programs at the University of Houston by 25%.\r\nGoal 2 Increase the number of Underrepresented Minority PhD degrees granted from the University of Houston by 200-300% (from 2-3 to 6-9) per year at the end of five years\r\nGoal 3 Promote and motivate more minority students from the UH-LSAMP program to pursue graduate education\r\nGoal 4 Create a university-wide enrichment program for graduate education that focuses on the retention of a diversified graduate student body though the integration of the Next Step workshop, a Deans? Lecture Series on diversity, and the collaborative learning community model to serve as an underlying program of support\r\nIntellectual Merit: The H-LSAMP-BD program uses a proven collaborative learning community model, based on over ten years of experience in implementing such a comprehensive model. This program also uses data drive methods to promote faculty enhancement. Numerous faculty who will serve as mentors to students in this program who will also have active collaborations with several national research centers.\r\nBroader Impacts: The program will support students in two colleges, across the departments of Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Earth and Atmospheric Science, Electrical Engineering, Petroleum Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil Engineering. Furthermore, the university is realigning all research into interdisciplinary research clusters, such as space systems and energy. This program will impact not only a diverse student population, helping to create well-trained minority researchers for academic and industrial jobs, but it will have substantial long-term impact on the US economy. This will happen by providing well-trained minority mentors to future STEM majors, and providing a well trained workforce to help create a new and emerging economy.\r\nPROJECT IMPACT This program?s impact is expected to be substantial, both in terms of short and long term goals. It seeks to establish a Collaborative Learning Community for graduate education, a structured mentoring program for undergraduate and graduate students, enhance faculty understanding of diversity issues, and most importantly lay the foundation for long-term change within the University.\r\n",
