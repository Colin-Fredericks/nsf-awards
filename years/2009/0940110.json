 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers requests travel support for participants in the Broader Engagement (BE) Program at the Supercomputing (SC) 2009 Conference. That program aims to increase opportunities for U.S. undergraduate, graduate, faculty, industry professionals, and researchers to learn about high performance computing (HPC). It emphasizes the participation of members of the groups that are underrepresented within the HPC community: African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, persons with disabilities, and women. Participants will have the opportunity attend specialized, targeted sessions, a student job fair, and to connect with mentors. This award will make it possible for additional participants to attend. New this year are (1) a pilot program combining the Broader Engagement Program, Education Program, Student Volunteers and Ambassadors Program into SC Communities to better leverage available opportunities for conference participants and (2) hosting travel to engage BPC Alliance members with the SC Community in order to build lasting relationships.",
