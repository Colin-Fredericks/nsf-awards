 "awd_abstract_narration": "0842295\r\nWiens\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This proposal seeks funding of ~$75K to purchase group computing resources for geophysical research. Requested are two Dell workgroup servers, three modern workstations, two fourteen Tb fast RAID disk arrays, and associated accessories. These instruments will be part of a departmental effort to standardize hardware and software on a common distributed system. Washington University will provide a 100% cost match in the form of IT technician support. The system will be put to use in studying the interior structure and dynamics of terrestrial planets using modeling and seismological approaches. The PIs will apply numerical modeling approaches to data collected from broadband seismometers to elucidate the structure of island arcs and backarc spreading centers. In so doing they intend to elucidate temperature anomalies, melt, water, and mantle flow in subduction systems. Broadband seismic data will also be processed to understand Antarctic mantle structure constraining post-glacial rebound and ice mass loss estimates. \"Hot lines\" in the mantle will be assessed by analyzing and relating seismic data to hotspots and small-scale convection patterns. EarthScope USArray data will be used to better understand seismic attenuation structure in the mantle. Additionally, deep earthquake mechanistics will be investigated using precise relative location methods and other source parameters. Different models for North American tectonic history will be interrogated computationally. Core-diffracted waves will be analyzed to understand the core-mantle boundary - thus elucidating the vertical structure of the lowermost mantle and heat flux. The new computational resources will also allow for refined numerical planetary resurfacing and geodynamical models. The computer system(s) will support numerous researchers - the PIs, 4 research scientists, and 8 graduate students. The system(s) will also support undergraduate senior theses. The large storage space will be used to organize IRIS/PASSCAL datasets for delivery to the DMC - thus providing open access to data for the community.\r\n\r\n***",
