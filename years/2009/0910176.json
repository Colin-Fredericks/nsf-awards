 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the Self-Explanation study is to investigate whether prompting students to explain problem-solving steps made by themselves would facilitate tutor learning. In the proposed learning environment, 8th grade students will be prompted to explain the reasoning behind their tutoring activities when teaching SimStudent. The proposed learning-by-teaching environment is designed for Algebra students to learn two major types of knowledge, namely: procedural skills to manipulate algebraic expressions and solve equations; and conceptual knowledge to justify skill applications when solving problems. The research question is: Does asking students to provide explanations for their reasoning behind the tutoring activities facilitate tutor learning? The hypothesis to be tested is: If students provide explanations on their reasoning behind the tutoring, then the effect of tutor learning will be facilitated. Students will be randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions: the treatment condition where the students will be prompted to provide explanations on their tutoring activities; and the control condition where the students will use the base-line Learning-by-Teaching environment. Pre- and post-tests will be used to measure students' learning achievement in conceptual and procedural knowledge. Student comparisons using the learning gain as the dependent variable will be the focus of analysis.\r\n\r\nThe study focuses on Algebra I linear equation solving, which is a critical area in the middle school algebra curriculum as indicated in both the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM) publication of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and the more recently released document Curriculum Focal Points for Prekindergarten through Grade 8 Mathematics. It is well known that prompting students to self-explain facilitates learning both when they are asked to explain correct worked-out examples and when they are asked to explain errors made by others. The study tests the hypothesis that self-explanation is also effective in tutor learning. Students will be asked to explain: correct steps when they demonstrate steps to their SimStudent; incorrect steps when they catch SimStudent making an error and want to indicate why the step is wrong; and 3) their choice of problems to teach to SimStudent, for instance, based on the observation on what mistakes SimStudent make when given a quiz.",
