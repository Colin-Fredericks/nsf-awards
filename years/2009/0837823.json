 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology (73)\r\nEven when departments have implemented student-faculty research collaborations as standard practice, undergraduate psychology majors completing a statistics-research methodology sequence often exhibit weak scientific skills in the laboratory. One cause of this weakness may be overemphasis of lecture-laboratory formats. This project is seeking to improve students' scientific skills by applying innovative problem-based learning (PBL) techniques within an undergraduate training laboratory. Transforming undergraduate psychology curricula and education experiences through novel, inquiry-based instruction and training in scientific instrumentation is the long-range goal of this project. To achieve this goal, traditional teaching techniques are being combined with four PBL projects that were developed by faculty members with expertise in each of four research domains. Student groups guided by faculty and graduate student tutors are working through complex problems in experimental psychology in these four domains. Students' prior knowledge is insufficient to understand these problems in depth. Therefore student groups must use resources within and outside of the laboratory to understand each problem and to develop valid solutions. PBL projects encourage students to integrate the principal statistical and methodological components of psychological research in a hands-on environment. A series of written tests are being used to examine student performance in research tasks requiring semantic and procedural knowledge. In addition, several established PBL evaluation techniques are being used to assess the changing learning experiences for students and tutors. Of particular interest is whether PBL works effectively for both traditional and returning students. The expected outcome of this project is a series of lesson plans, complete with interactive tutorials for each piece of scientific equipment, which will be used to disseminate PBL to other campuses. Preliminary findings from the proposed PBL implementation will be used to encourage the continuing evolution of PBL as a flexible, multidisciplinary learning approach in other social science disciplines.",
