 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nAccurate choice of cell fate is crucial for the proper development of multicellular organisms. The overall objective of this project is to study how cell fates are specified in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.  An understanding of how cells choose their fates in this simple model system may provide insight into the developmental processes of more complex organisms, including humans. \r\n\t\tLIN-31, a winged-helix transcription factor, is required for proper vulval development in the soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans.  This protein is believed to play two roles during specification of vulval cell fates: (1) to promote non-vulval cell fates (when bound to another transcription factor, LIN-1), and (2) to promote vulval cell fates (when not bound to LIN-1). \r\n\t\tThis project will use genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches to study LIN-31's role in vulval cell fate specification.  One set of experiments will focus on obtaining a better functional understanding of different regions in the LIN-31 protein. Other experiments will focus on protein interactions, first by continuing an analysis of the known LIN-31/LIN-1 interaction, followed by a powerful, high-throughput genetic screen in yeast in order to identify other proteins that may interact with LIN-31.\r\nThis project will allow a better understanding of the pathways by which cell specification occurs.  It has the potential to shed light on how cells interact to create a complex phenotype.  In addition, this project will simultaneously make significant contributions to teaching, training and learning.  Undergraduate students will be an integral part of the project and will improve their critical thinking, analytical, and problem-solving skills.  In addition, exposure to an authentic research experience will encourage students' interest in science and give them the skills and motivation to pursue a science career. Finally, many of these undergraduate students will be women and/or underrepresented minorities.",
