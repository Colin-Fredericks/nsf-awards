 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the durability and hermeticity of multilayer organic/inorganic permeation barriers in flexible electronics under large mechanical deformation and environmental moisture attack.  Flexible electronics is being developed for an exciting array of applications, such as paper-like displays and organic light emitting diodes. The functional organic materials used in flexible devices are extremely vulnerable to moisture, thus result in a sharply limited device lifetime to a grand challenge to the future success of flexible electronics technology. Multilayer organic/inorganic permeation barriers are emerging as a promising solution to the stringent barrier requirement of flexible electronics. The mechanical failure of the multilayer permeation barriers, however, could be fatal to the barrier performance. To date, the mechanical durability of multilayer permeation barriers is largely unexplored. In this project, a collaborative research framework (from modeling and experiments to design) will be built to explore the yet-unexplored mechanisms that govern the mechanical durability and barrier performance of multilayer permeation barriers. \r\nBy advancing the understanding of permeation barrier technology, this project will pave the way for the development of viable flexible electronics, whose widespread use addresses a wide range of societal needs. The proposed program also includes integrated outreach and education efforts. The summer internship at the industry partner provides the students a unique opportunity to interact with multidisciplinary industrial experts on a cutting-edge research topic.  Furthermore, by disseminating research findings via iMechanica.org and macroelectronics.org, the project will also increase public awareness about flexible electronics technology.",
