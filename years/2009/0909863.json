 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-year project tackles the important problem of the difficulty of conducting hands-on activities for 8th and 9th grade Earth Science classrooms.  The PIs take the approach of using tabletop models as analogs for the phenomena the curriculum is trying to elucidate. The project investigates how students apply insights gained from working with dynamic tabletop modules to understanding and reasoning about processes of the full scale Earth system.\r\n\r\nWorking with 300 students and four teachers in New York City schools, the researchers test three instructional strategies in terms of the usefulness and pitfalls of each.  The PIs develop written assessments using evidence-centered design principles that examine students' understanding of model attributes, model/Earth attribute correspondences, model relationships, model/Earth relationship correspondences, and geoscience data/evidence.  \r\n\r\nThe PIs collect student demographic data using t-tests and multiple regression analysis.  They also collect student demographic data and qualitative measures to describe how the instructional strategies were enacted across classrooms and to understnd the ways in which teachers should be supported to utilize these strategies effectively.",

In the Earth Sciences, many of the phenomena under study are too big or slow to fit into a classroom setting, such as global circulation or plate tectonics.  In \"Bridging the Gap Between Tabletop Models and the Earth System\" we examine how students reason about the relationships between common physical dynamic models used in Earth Science classrooms and full-scale Earth System processes.  The goals of this project are to better understand how physical models are used in science classrooms to assist with instruction more generally, and the role they play in helping students learn important science concepts.

We found evidence that students do indeed reason across all three levels of sophistication around the relationships between the model and the Earth System, and that generally the levels do seem to progress in difficulty (i.e., it is generally easier to reason at a Level 1 than a Level 2, and Level 3 is the most difficult), although the data is not as clean-cut as the hypothesis suggests.  We also found that students have much more difficult..."
