The prediction of material and device properties of other semiconductors using first principles numerical simulations will also be significantly improved. \r\n\r\nBroader impact &#8722; The broader impacts of this program could include transforming the design and fabrication of ZnO based UV emitters, making them very efficient and low cost. The efficiency of white light emitters for solid state lighting would also significantly increase. The nanostructures unique to this material system could make it possible to design light emitters and sensors where mechanical, optical and electrical functions are integrated in the same device. These new applications could have a significant impact on energy management, bioengineering and environmental monitoring with important societal benefits.\r\n",
