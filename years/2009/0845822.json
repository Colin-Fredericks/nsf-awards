 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to explore novel reconfigurable aperture antennas and arrays, which can provide compact multifunctional antenna solutions. The approach is to examine (i) reconfigurable radiation pattern aperture antennas with multiple phase centers by controlling the modal amplitudes and phases in multimode radiating elements, (ii) frequency reconfiguration of microstrip antennas by implementing radio frequency (RF) Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) switches and MEMS variable capacitors, and (iii) ground plane reconfiguration of microstrip antennas to reconfigure the impedance and radiation pattern properties. \r\n\r\nThe research will lead to novel, compact and reconfigurable aperture antennas for wireless communications and radar systems providing multifunctionality. The proposed innovative approaches have the potential to allow hardware minimizations, simplify complex antenna implementations, and provide enhanced performance antenna solutions. The theory and analysis tools developed will help in conceptualizing future antennas and enhancing the quality of antenna and microwave education. \r\n\r\nThe research outcomes are expected to lead to high performance and cost-effective transformative antenna solutions for wireless communications and radar applications, meeting societal needs in many ways. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research work learning valuable research skills and hands-on-experience in antenna design. The research work is expected to generate industry-sponsored projects. The participation of middle and high school students is highly encouraged. Further, this research will help in creating interest, recruiting, and retaining engineering students including minorities and women in the San Diego area. \r\n",
