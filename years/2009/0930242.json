 "awd_abstract_narration": "The City Tech I3 Incubator: Interdisciplinary Partnerships for Laboratory Integration addresses\r\nthree NSF I3 goals: broadening participation, integrating research and education, and developing a\r\nglobal workforce. The incubator will broaden participation by enabling our students, the majority\r\nof whom are underrepresented in STEM programs of study and professions, to learn science,\r\nmathematics, and engineering technology applications in laboratories that have been transformed\r\nto reflect the collaborative interdisciplinary approaches of advanced science and industry labs\r\ntoday. The incubator will provide new opportunities to fuse STEM education and STEM research\r\nby creating an institution-wide focus on inquiry based research as a means of learning and doing\r\nscience in labs, in faculty-led research projects outside the classroom, and in industry settings in\r\nthe New York metropolitan area, where our students will seek their futures. Finally, the incubator\r\nwill contribute to the development of a global workforce by enhancing and expanding the role of\r\nindustry representatives in communicating their needs and practices to the college and\r\nreciprocally using the college to meet their own technological workforce needs.\r\nThe City Tech I3 Incubator will weave together dimensions of four current NSF-funded projects:\r\nMetropolitan Mentors Network: Growing an Urban Talent Pool in New York City (STEP),\r\nResearch Experiences for Undergraduates in Ground-Based and Satellite Remote Sensing at\r\nNOAA-CREST (REU), S-STEM Scholarships for Students, and Research, Reflect, Plan:\r\nADVANCE IT-START at New York City College of Technology (ADVANCE). Mechanisms of\r\nintegration are 1) creation of a multi-dimensional model of lab practice across all STEM\r\ndepartments as a tool for benchmarking lab transformation; 2) creation of a cross-project matrix\r\nfor grant funded projects that charts diversity goals, outreach to high schools, research\r\nengagement of students, involvement of industry, and significant learning outcomes; 3) a\r\nmanagement structure led by the provost, two academic deans, and a biologist on the faculty that\r\nwill be continuously advised by a City Tech I3Incubator Advisory Board comprising members of\r\ndepartmental advisory boards and the PIs of current grant-funded STEM initiatives; 4) location of\r\nprofessional development activities for the wider STEM faculty in the Faculty Commons, a\r\ncollege-wide center for teaching and learning; and 5) enhancing communications by using the\r\ncross-project matrix as a communication tool and establishing a strong web presence for all I3\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nThe City Tech I-Cubed Incubator:  Interdisciplinary Partnerships for Laboratory Integration brings together NSF/EHR awards from the ADVANCE, NSF-STEP and S-STEM programs, as well as other work, around the I3 integrative themes for broadening participation, developing a globally engaged workforce, and the integration of research and education.",
