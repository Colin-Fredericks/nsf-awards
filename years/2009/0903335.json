 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award addresses two world-class experiments in areas identified as high priority questions in fundamental physics, one in search of neutrinoless double beta decay and one in search of dark matter. Firstly, this award provides support for the group's involvement in the SNO+ Collaboration. SNO+ is the conversion of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory detector, a heavy water Cherenkov detector located 6800 feet underground in a working nickel mine near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, into a new experiment by replacing the heavy water in the acrylic vessel with linear alkylbenzene, a liquid scintillator. This will yield enhanced sensitivity at lower energies enabling the SNO+ experiment to address several interesting scientific questions. By adding the double beta decay emitter 150-Nd to the liquid scintillator, SNO+ has the potential to lead the field of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. Secondly, this award provides funds for the group to build a trace gas analyzer based on cavity ring-down spectroscopy technology.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the program includes providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from Idaho and South Dakota, including under-represented Native American students, to participate in world-class international experiments in the exciting setting of underground particle physics. Working with BHSU's Center for the Advancement of Math and Science Education and the Education and Outreach arm of the Sanford Lab, education and outreach activities are planned which will involve undergraduate students as well as area high school students and their teachers.",
