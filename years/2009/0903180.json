 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Center of Excellence for Aerospace Technical Education (SpaceTEC), a consortium of 11 partner community colleges and universities, has developed and disseminated educational materials, established and improved associate degree programs, and implemented an industry-endorsed, nationally-recognized certification for aerospace technicians.  As a national resource center, SpaceTEC supports the nation's civil aerospace initiatives, Department of Defense personnel and the fledgling commercial space industry by developing a better educated technical workforce that can address the significant changes in aerospace systems for research, defense and commercial purposes.  A comprehensive and accessible repository of aerospace-related technical education materials and successful practices is established and maintained.  Increased opportunities are created for students and incumbent workers to seek and complete an aerospace technical degree.  Through industry and government support the partnership is expanded to ensure that the aerospace technology curriculum is current and relevant to industry and technological practices.  Professional development workshops are provided to enhance and upgrade the skills and knowledge of educators and technicians.  The Certified Aerospace Technician is established as a national standard for the industry and expects to certify 600 technicians nationally.  Evaluation is done by local advisory committees, a National Aerospace Technology Advisory Committee, the National Visiting Committee and an external evaluator.",

The overall goal of this program is to prepare and credential technicians for \"hands-on\" aerospace and related careers.\n\nSpaceTEC&reg; provides the nation's only internationally accredited, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) -recognized performance-based aerospace technician certifications that qualify for up to 76 hours of college credit through the American Council on Education\u00c6s (ACE) CREDIT Program.\n\n \nOUTCOMES FOR THIS GRANT INCLUDE:\n\nProvided aerospace courses to more than 75,000 students at 14 colleges nationwide.\nGraduated more than 52,000 aerospace students in ten states, many serving in the military.\nOffered workshops/clinics/webinars/meetings to more than 300 primary and secondary education institutions and more than 200,000 of their students nationwide.\nPromoted the aerospace technician curriculum as a national standard accepted by all major partners.\nAchieved ACE recommendations for up to 76 college credit hours for SpaceTEC&reg; certifications.\nArticulated college credit through Embry Riddle Aeronautical University for all partner colleges.\nAchieved accreditation under International Standards Organization's ISO 17024 - General Requirements For Bodies Operating Certifications Of Persons.\nEarned FAA Safety Approval for credentialing aerospace maintenance technicians. \nObtained more than 70,000 NASA documents for courses, practicums, lessons learned, and best practices from human spaceflight tailored for aerospace technician training and credentialing.\nIssued more than 440 certifications for SpaceTEC&reg; Certified Aerospace Technician&reg; to date.\nIssued more than 200 certifications for CertTEC&reg; non-aerospace STEM technicians to date.\nEvaluated the competencies of returning veterans, assisting and/or credentialing them for civilian jobs. \n\n\n \nRESULTS THAT DEMONSTRATE INTELLECTUAL MERIT ARE: \n\nThe SpaceTEC&reg; curriculum is used nationwide by all the SpaceTEC Consortium partner colleges and taught in their AAS and AS degree programs. It has become the standard by which aerospace technician education is judged.\n\nSpaceTEC&reg; partner colleges offer work-relevant programs and articulate them through the American Council on Education CREDIT Program and via a formal SpaceTEC articulation agreement with Embry Riddle Aeronautical University on behalf of all aerospace students. More than 1000 college credit hours have been earned through SpaceTEC&reg; certifications.\n\nNASA training and certification materials have been integrated into the NRC repository. This material comprises competencies and best practices that can be used in a wide variety of technical education and workplace venues, including aviation manufacturing and assembly.\n\nComputer-based assessments called Knowledge and Skill Inventories are available to determine each candidate\u00c6s strengths and weaknesses. The results are used to provide individual programs of study for success in the workplace.\n\nAll SpaceTEC&reg; certifications require:  (1) a proctored computer-based written exam, (2) an oral exam, and (3) a hands-on practical exam to demonstrate required skills.  The oral and practical exams are conducted by SpaceTEC&reg;-certified examiners. More than 44,000 individual competencies have been certified in the Core and its 3 Concentrations.\n\nThe more than 52,000 graduates from this program provide the emerging commercial aerospace industry with a workforce uniquely qualified to accomplish the tasks of aerospace technicians.\n\n \nRESULTS THAT DEMONSTRATE BROADER IMPACTS ARE: \n\nSpaceTEC&reg; is professionalizing the aerospace technician career field by providing \"stackable\" credentials that begin with the Core and progress to one or more of its Concentrations. This opens career pathways that include entry-level to journeyman technician, lead technician, systems e..."
