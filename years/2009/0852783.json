 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to help enable students and researchers whose careers have only recently begun to attend the 7th Gordon Research Conference on RNA Editing, which is being held Sunday, January 11, through Friday, January 16, 2009, at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas. This biannual conference is the only regularly scheduled meeting devoted exclusively to RNA and DNA editing and modification. Scientists investigating these diverse processes face similar theoretical and technical challenges, and thus need to interact at a single meeting to discuss their recent findings in the context of the central questions in the field. The conference brings together scientists at all professional levels, ranging from students to established leaders, for five days in a casual setting that fosters an informal and relaxed exchange of ideas among participants. To promote cross-fertilization between the editing and modification communities, the conference program is organized in thematic sessions focused on questions of common interest. A number of important and exciting breakthroughs are expected to be presented at the 2009 meeting.\r\n\r\nA major goal of the conference is to advance discovery and promote learning. The conference is the only scheduled meeting that provides a current overview of this rapidly growing field. It also provides a unique opportunity to discuss new hypotheses and models, exchange information about new experimental strategies, generate ideas for future projects, and initiate collaborations. To stimulate new ideas and strategies, several prominent scientists from outside the field will be invited to present their recent groundbreakings studies on similar questions in related systems. Of the 47 confirmed speakers, 10 speakers are new to the conference. As is the tradition of this conference, the organizers strive for gender balance and an ethnically and geographically diverse group of speakers. The Co-Chair and Co-Vice Chair, along with 6 out of 10 discussion leaders at the 2009 meeting are women. A major goal of the conference is to foster education by encouraging the participation of junior scientists. All attendees are invited to present a poster. To promote junior scientists, the organizers choose several graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from the submitted poster abstracts to give oral presentations. In addition, junior faculty (assistant professors or equivalent) are included among the invited speakers. Junior scientists represent approximately 22% of the presenters.",
