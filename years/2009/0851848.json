 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software safety is critical to many projects conducted\r\nby both private industry and the government. After the\r\nChallenger accident, NASA adopted a safety policy based\r\non a National Research Council report that requires every\r\nproject to take an organized and systematic approach to\r\nidentify safety hazards or unsafe situations and practices,\r\nand to follow appropriate steps to assure adequate safety.\r\nAt the REU site to be established undergraduates participate\r\nin research on verification and validation for software\r\nsafety: from, initially, a series of training seminars on\r\nthe necessary background knowledge, to becoming involved\r\nin one of several specially designed research topics\r\naccording to their interests. Topics include safety analysis,\r\nmodel construction and simulation, validation test generation\r\nand execution, etc. Interaction between the students and\r\nfaculty mentors is emphasized. Follow-ups are also conducted\r\nwith the students after the summer program to prepare their\r\nresults for presentation at conferences and publication in\r\njournals.\r\n\r\nThe research subject is software safety with a focus on the\r\nanalysis and integration of failure conditions with functional\r\nspecifications, the use of assertions in formal specifications,\r\nand validation not only for testing software under normal\r\nconditions but also for showing that unsafe states cannot be\r\ngenerated by the software as the result of single or multiple\r\nerroneous inputs. This project allows students from\r\nunderrepresented groups or universities with limited research\r\nopportunities to experience cutting-edge research in software\r\nengineering and to gain proficiency in a broadly applicable\r\nskill set, including critical thinking, research methods,\r\nproblem solving, and oral and written communication -- all of\r\nwhich are very important for success in graduate programs and\r\ncareers in science and technology research.\r\n\r\n",
