 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award supports an experimental research program to produce polar molecular gases with the goal of investigating quantum matter with strong and long-range interactions, and of performing sensitive tests of fundamental theories of physics. Lithium (one-electron atom, Li) and ytterbium (two-electron atom, Yb) are cooled and confined in a common atom trap and subsequently linked using optical field induced scattering resonances to form diatomic LiYb molecules. These strongly-interacting molecules are placed in periodic optical lattice potentials for studying extensions to the fundamental Hubbard model of condensed matter physics, incorporating inter-particle long-range interactions. The trapped paramagnetic molecules are also to be used as a very sensitive probe for the electron electric dipole moment (EDM), the value of which crucially impacts models of fundamental particle physics. These experiments will contribute to the development of trapped polar molecules for quantum computation.\r\n\r\nConcurrent with the research component, related education and outreach is being performed. Graduate and undergraduate students gain valuable research experience, preparing them to join the work force in academics and industry as the next generation of scientists and engineers. Undergraduate lecture and laboratory courses are being enhanced through an increased computational component and incorporation of context-rich problems based on modern cutting-edge research in atomic and optical physics. The research program is leveraged to encompass educational and outreach programs through the University of Washington's partnership with the Seattle MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) program. This involves periodic lectures, lab tours, and summer internships, for underrepresented and disadvantaged high-school students from the Seattle area, in an effort to attract them to scientific college programs and careers.",
