A plant's sessile lifestyle requires that it respond quickly to its environment. A cell wall is one of the most conserved evolutionary features of the plant cell and its dynamic structure regulates the passage of biomolecules, creates physical strength and acts as the first line of defense against biotic and abiotic stress. The project uses a chemical ligand that blocks cell wall sensing by targeting an integral protein kinase.  The investigators will use chemical genetics, fluorescence biomarkers and molecular biochemistry to identify other genes in the signaling pathway, identify the substrate for the kinase and observe the system in real time. Ultimately, the project aims to discover the dynamics of cell wall signal transduction and transform our view of how plants perceive their environment and initiate downstream response. Synthesis of the project will provide training to a Ph.D student, several undergraduates and foster an educational outreach program with the science museum for children in Lexington Kentucky in order to engage the community with the exciting world of plant and agricultural sciences.",
