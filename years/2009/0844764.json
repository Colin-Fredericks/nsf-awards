Prof. Shumaker-Parry and her students will develop and study unique plasmonic architectures with optical properties that may be tailored through organized assembly and controlled fabrication methods. Fundamental studies of the correlation of optical properties with structure shape and assembly will form a basis for tailoring and optimizing these plasmonic systems as enhanced platforms for sensing and spectroscopy applications. The research will provide multidisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students. Prof. Shumaker-Parry also will integrate research in nanomaterials and spectroscopy with educational activities focused on development of a week-long module for a summer scholars program for in-coming freshman women interested in math and science careers and a mentoring program for local middle school Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) clubs to encourage minority and female students to continue on a STEM-based track into high school and in their careers.",
