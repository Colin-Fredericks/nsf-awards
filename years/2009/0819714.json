 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will attempt to answer three key questions regarding the apparent mobility of uranium and thorium isotopes that severely compromises the accuracy of uranium-thorium dating performed on fossil corals:\r\n1) To what extent are the isotopes produced by uranium decay mobilized by the energy of alpha decay?\r\n2) Are excess uranium decay products, which are frequently observed in fossil corals, adsorbed onto the crystal surfaces?\r\n3) Can exchange of uranium between corals and water alter the isotopic composition of the coral with no change to the coral?s uranium concentration?\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: In light of current concerns over the impacts of rising sea levels on human welfare, understanding potential magnitudes and rates of future sea level change is crucial. A well-dated and detailed history of past sea level change would provide important information in this regard. One of the premier methods for reconstructing the history of sea level is the dating of fossil corals that once grew near the sea surface. The advantages of this approach include the wide spread distribution of fossil corals, improvements in mass spectrometry allowing precise dating as far back as 600,000 years, and detailed stratigraphic correlations that can be used to determine abrupt, sub-meter scale sea-level changes. Unfortunately, these potential advantages are largely unrealized due to the widely recognized but poorly understood mobility of the uranium and thorium isotopes used for dating. Observations of systematic alteration trends in fossil corals and the idea that these trends might be explained by the systematic addition of recoil-mobilized uranium decay products have reinvigorated interest in coral diagenesis. Several models have been proposed to correct U-Th coral ages for such daughter addition, and have been shown to improve the age agreement of corals from the same fossil reef. However, the accuracy of such corrected ages remains controversial, in part because the physical mechanisms assumed by the models have not been tested directly. There is an urgent need to better understand these mechanisms, so that we might improve our understanding of past and future sea level change. This grant will undertake a series of experiments designed to test these critical assumptions.\r\nBroader Impact: The data that collected will provide fundamental information for scientists studying a broad variety of fields: carbonate chemistry, mineral-fluid interactions, paleoceanography, geochronology, and paleoclimate. Results and methods will be made available to the scientific community through publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international conferences. Results and implications will be communicated to the public through interviews and talks. The team will use small-scale projects related to this research to introduce undergraduate students to laboratory techniques and the theory and practice of U-Th dating. Internships will take place through the WHOI Summer Student Fellowship Program. In addition, this proposal will support the careers of two junior scientists engaging in collaboration as a way of amplifying the impact of their combined scientific insights.",
