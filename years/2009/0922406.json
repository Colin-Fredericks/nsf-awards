 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWhen a worker changes occupations (e.g., sales representative, mechanic, taxi driver) she usually changes the kind of work she performs, with potentially non-trivial loss of specific skills accumulated in the previous occupation. Nevertheless, the fraction of workers changing occupations is remarkably large - close to 20% of workers in the U.S. switch occupations in a given year. Moreover, the size of worker flows vastly exceeds the amount of reallocation needed to accomodate changes in occupational employment shares.  Why do workers switch occupations so much? What are the consequences for the aggregate economy? Might there be a role for government intervention? The objective of the proposed research is to provide answers to these questions.\r\nThe PI uses administrative panel data on 100% of the Danish population to document a new set of facts characterizing the patterns of occupational mobility. He finds that a worker's probability of switching occupation is U-shaped in her position in the wage distribution in her occupation. It is the workers with the highest or lowest wages in their occupations who have the highest probability of leaving the occupation. Workers with higher (lower) relative wage within their occupation tend to switch to occupations with higher (lower) average wages. Higher (lower) paid workers within their occupation tend to leave it when relative productivity of that occupation declines (rises).\r\nThese previously unknown facts are not implied by existing theories of occupational mobility that mostly treat occupations as horizontally differentiated sets of tasks. The PI suggests that it might be productive to think of occupations as also forming vertical hierarchies. Workers who are unsure of their abilities learn about them by observing their output realizations. Employment opportunities in each occupation are scarce inducing competition among workers for them. Complementarities in the production function between worker's ability and productivity of an occupation induce sorting of workers into occupations according to their expected ability. The PI develops an equilibrium model of occupational choice with these features and show analytically that it is consistent with patterns of mobility described above. The PI plans to embed the features of this new theory into a dynamic general equilibrium model of occupational choice that the PI developed in his earlier work to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of different economic forces - such as learning, fluctuations in occupational productivities or demands, and search frictions in locating jobs in various occupations - to the amount of occupational mobility observed in the data.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in (1) discovery of a new set of facts that characterize patterns of occupational mobility, (2) an innovative research strategy of studying occupational mobility as a function of a worker's relative performance in her current occupation, (3) a development of a new theory of occupational mobility that is very tractable, yet consistent with all the features of the data it is designed to account for, (4) a development and estimation of a quantitative model of occupational mobility that would allow better quantitative evaluation of the forces driving occupational mobility.\r\nThe project will have a broad impact on the economics profession because it will \r\n(1) provide a new empirical evidence important for distinguishing between various theories of occupational mobility,\r\n(2) provide a new theoretical model of occupational mobility qualitatively consistent with the motivating evidence \r\n(3) develop and calibrate a new quantitative model of worker mobility. It will also likely guide our understanding of the reasons why wages grow with occupational experience. \r\nMuch of the existing literature attributes a sizable amount of this growth to selection: workers with bad occupational matches leave their occupations for better opportunities elsewhere which induces a correlation between occupational match quality and occupational tenure in a cross-section of workers. Given that the PI's findings challenge the importance of selection for wage growth because both bad and good workers leave occupations, human capital is the obvious remainder that can account for the positive relation between wages and occupational tenure. The results of this research will be presented at national and international conferences, and are likely to become a standard entry on the reading lists in advanced courses.",

Review of Economic Studies, Conditionally Accepted\n\n Using administrative panel data on entire Danish population we document a new set of facts characterizing occupational mobility. For most occupations, mobility is U-shaped and directional: both low and high wage earners within an occupation have a particularly large probability of leaving this occupation, and the low (high) earners tend to switch to new occupations with lower (higher) average wages. Exceptions are occupations with steeply rising (declining) productivity, where mainly the lower (higher) paid workers within this occupation tend to leave.

American Economic Review, 103(2) April 2013, pp. 771-803.\n\n We consider a model with on-the-job search where current wages depend only on current aggregate labor market conditions and idiosyncratic match-specific productivities. We show theoretically that the model replicates findings typically interpreted as evidence that wages are history dependent and inconsistent with a model where wages depend on current conditions only. We develop a method to measure match qualities in the data and show empirically that various variables summarizing past aggregate labor market conditions have explanatory power for current wages only because they are correlated with match qualities. They lose any predictive power once match qualities are accounted for\n\n \n\n3. \"The Price of Experience,\" with Hyeok Jeong and Yong Kim.\n\n American Economic Review, R&amp;R.\n\nWe identify a key role of factor supply, driven by demographic changes, in shaping several empirical regularities that are a focus of active research in macro and labor economics. In particular, the large movements of the return to experience over the last four decades are almost perfectly explained by demographic changes alone, with no role attributable to demand shifts. Moreover, these demographic changes account for the differential dynamics of the age premium across education groups emphasized by Katz and Murphy (1992), and the differential dynamics of the college premium across age groups emphasized by Card and Lemieux (2001).\n\n \n\n4. \"Identifying Equilibrium Models of Labor Market Sorting,\" with Marcus Hagedorn and Tzuo Hann Law. National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 18661. Econometrica, R&amp;R.\n\nDoes the market allocate the right workers to the right jobs? Since observable (to economists) variables account for only a small fraction of the wage variance in the data, to answer this question it is essential to study assortative matching between employers and employees based on their unobserved characteristics. This paper enables this line of research. We show theoretically that all parameters of the classic model of sorting based on absolute advantage in Becker (1973) with search frictions can be identified using only matched employer-employee data on wages and labor market transitions. In particular, these data are sufficient to assess whether matching between workers and firms is assortative, whether sorting is positive or negative, and to measure the potential effect on output from moving any given worker to any given employer in the economy. We provide computational algorithms that implement our identification strategy given the limitations of the available data sets. Finally, we extend our identification and implementation strategies to the commonly used class of models of sorting based on comparative advant..."
