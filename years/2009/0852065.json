This project will motivate and prepare the participants for graduate studies in mathematics by providing them opportunities to collaborate and engage in research with eminent research scientists. It will also enhance the undergraduate mathematical climate at participants' home institutions as they share their enthusiasm for research with their peers. This will  make visible that mathematics is more than the textbook problems that define most students' experiences. The eventual publication of students' research is an important educational opportunity and also serves to remind the mathematical community of the viability of such programs. A further goal of the program is to encourage the study of mathematics among women and minorities underrepresented in graduate mathematics. UCSB is among the most diverse campuses in the University of California, providing a broad pool of applicants and an attractive summer option.\r\n\r\nThis new REU Site will disseminate current problems and techniques of modern mathematics to a diverse group of undergraduate students. It is well known that the earlier the exposure of a student to the main structures of mathematics, the deeper is their understanding, and this will then increase their motivation and success in studying advanced mathematics. The students participating in this REU will collaborate with and learn from several active and very successful researchers  in the Mathematics Department at UCSB. Engagement in inquiry and research is the most powerful pedagogical tool for preparing future mathematicians. As a whole the project will benefit our society by awakening in undergraduate students the curiosity and interest in the scientific enterprise as a way to improve the world.",
