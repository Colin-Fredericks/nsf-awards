 "awd_abstract_narration": "With co-funding from the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Polar Programs, the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports Prof. Ido Braslavsky of Ohio University to study interactions between specialized antifreeze proteins (AFPs) and ice using fluorescence microscopy techniques combined with a unique ice growth/flow microfluidic cell.  With collaborators at Queens University (Canada), Yale University, and the University of California - San Diego, Dr. Braslavsky's group seeks to directly visualize AFPs on ice surfaces, and thus determine their location and concentrations under well defined conditions of growth, temperature, and solute flow.  The overall aim is improved understanding of the mechanisms of AFPs, and more broadly of biomolecule influence on crystal growth. \r\n\r\nGraduate and undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary Braslavsky group will participate in the research and will attend a Workshop on Ice Binding Proteins held in Canada, thus experiencing first-hand international scientific collaborations. The knowledge gained from the research will be incorporated into a new graduate Biophysics lab course being developed by the PI. Outreach activities to local schools through indoor and outdoor demonstrations at the Athens Public Library examine many aspects of ice growth in the natural environment. Results will also be incorporated into an exhibit \"Ice as a Mineral\" at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History (organized by collaborator John Wettlaufer).  Broad societal impacts that may result include more reliable food supplies through prevention of frost damage, enhancement of food preservation technology, and better organ, tissue and blood preservation.",

They do this using proteins that can bind to tiny crystals of ice and prevent them from getting bigger. These antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are found in fish, insects, fungi, bacteria, and plants.
