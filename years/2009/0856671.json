 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to investigate the use of a  novel inexpensive printing approach for patterning wafer-level, parallel assemblies of nanoscale electronic materials for biological and chemical sensing from DNA templates. To address features smaller than 20 nm yet still maintain low manufacturing costs, the proposed research will combine a novel soft lithography stamping technique with patterned silicon surfaces to build ordered, spatially defined arrays of DNA and peptide-DNA based scaffolds on flat polydimethylsiloxane.  These patterns can then be easily transferred to any receiving flat substrate, such as thermal oxide, metals, or polymers. Limiting the number of nanostructured oxide or silicon substrates needed in the fabrication process will dramatically lower manufacturing costs, while biomolecular scaffolds, such as DNA templates, can address features below 20 nm. The four main research objectives of the proposal are to 1) integrate low-cost, high-throughput inking and stamping methods to generate large area patterned arrays of DNA scaffolds, 2) engineer larger, well-controlled assemblies of DNA scaffolds, 3) incorporate specific molecular recognition motifs to bind nanoscale electronic materials in high yields and with minimal defects, and 4) fabricate fabricating multiplexed parallel, addressable biosensing electrical arrays. \r\n\r\nAn inexpensive, high throughput method to generate wafer-level arrays of nanoelectronic devices and sensors via benign chemistry and engineering would have an enormous impact on both the electronics and healthcare industries. Despite the wealth of nanoscale materials available, the current limitations of photolithography have prevented the realization of their potential in these applications. The proposed education and research plan will also draw and encourage active participation from teachers and students to help young students learn more about nanoscience and its impact upon society and their everyday lives. In addition, various seminars and interactive demonstrations related to the proposed research will be integrated into existing and new curricula, and open laboratory sessions will be held during university open-house days and on-campus science festivals. \r\n",
