This effort uses these codes on three different fronts: a.) Interference networks, where we use structured codes to align the interference seen at each receiver. The objective is to determine the capacity of this channel to within a constant gap using these codes. b.) Cognitive networks - where we use lattice codes to mitigate the interference seen by both the licensed and the cognitive radios. We exploit code structure to both (partially) learn the interfering signal at the cognitive radio and then use this knowledge to precode/align our interference signal. c.) Secure wireless networks: again, we utilize the structure of the codebook to determine simple transformations at the source in order to keep eavesdroppers in the network at bay. We employ these codes to detect, and depending on code structure, correct for modification attacks on the codebook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
