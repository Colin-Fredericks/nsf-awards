 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nDeep earthquakes, some of which are among the largest and most damaging of all\r\nearthquakes, have been a paradox since their discovery in the 1920s. The combined increase of\r\nconfining pressure and temperature with depth inhibits frictional sliding, the principal earthquake\r\nmechanism for shallow earthquakes, along fault planes beyond depths of a few tens of\r\nkilometers, yet earthquakes occur to depths approaching 700 km. Brittle-like shear failure under\r\nhigh-confinement also occurs with impact cratering in both rock and ice and limits the steady\r\nstate flow stress of highly confined rock+ice mixtures and thus the may provide important\r\nconstraints on the thermomechanical evolution of certain moons and planets. This project\r\nincludes new experiments and modeling aimed at elucidating the fundamental physical\r\nmechanism(s) that underlie localized brittle compressive failure under high confinement.\r\nPreliminary experiments demonstrate a transition in brittle-like failure mode with increasing\r\nconfinement and that the high confinement faults appear not to be friction controlled. Nor do\r\nthey appear to be related to other well established faulting mechanisms, including mode II\r\ncracking, dehydration embrittlement, or phase transformations. Their working hypothesis is that\r\nat play is a fundamentally different faulting mechanism called plastic faulting -- a non-frictional\r\nshear instability aided by adiabatic heating.\r\n\r\nSpirited by past success in using ice as a model material for rock?ice was involved in the\r\ndiscovery of transformational faulting and our own discovery of what appears to be a universal\r\nmechanism of moderate-confinement brittle failure?and encouraged by its marked similarity to\r\nthe behavior of rocks and minerals, this project consists of a three-year program of triaxial\r\ncompression experiments to determine the effects, if any, of confinement, grain size and strain\r\nrate on both the terminal failure stress and the failure mode, with attention to microstructural\r\ndetail, as observed using visual microscopy, cold stage SEM electron backscatter imaging, and\r\ncold room enabled micro-CT tomography. The researchers seek to reveal the\r\nphysics of failure, and then to develop quantitative models of plastic fault initiation that only rely\r\non independently measurable parameters. Such models are prerequisites for any conclusions\r\nconcerning the possible role of a particular failure process in geophysical processes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work also will contribute to Dartmouth's long tradition of involving undergraduates in research, through senior honors theses\r\nand through the Dartmouth?s Women In Science (WISP) internship program. Students involved\r\nin this project will participate in professional development opportunities through Dartmouth's\r\nCenter for the Advancement of Learning and in educational outreach programs, including Junior\r\nScience Caf\u00e9s in regional high schools, Igloo Build programs sponsored by the Montshire\r\nMuseum of Science, and those supported through Dartmouth's NSF-funded Polar Studies\r\nIGERT program, including courses on communicating polar science and the ethics and policy\r\nimplications of polar research, and educational outreach activities with communities in\r\nGreenland.",
