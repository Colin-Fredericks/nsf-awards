 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project \"Microbial Production of Selected Anthocyanins\", aims to establish cost-effective methodologies for the efficient production of anthocyanins from genetically engineered bacteria. Anthocyanins are plant secondary metabolites that are mainly responsible for the colors in plant tissues, primarily reds, purples and blues. They are non-toxic and have been observed to possess antioxidant, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities, thus making them attractive candidates in the pharmaceutical, dietary supplement, and food colorants industries. As the benefits of anthocyanins continue to gain definition, the demand for these compounds is growing exponentially. Unfortunately, the cost of attaining pure or well defined mixtures of anthocyanins using conventional techniques outweighs the potential market return. By using engineered microbes, large batches of selected anthocyanins can theoretically be produced, making compound isolation efficient and cost effective.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are to produce cost-effective natural and non-natural anthocyanins, whose health benefits can be investigated; allow students to participate and train in the ongoing development of a microbial production platform; foster a collaboration between a U.S. academic institution and a U.S. company, and contribute to the expansion of a small specialtychemical company. This project will utilize students to create a biosynthetic system that will produce a vast array of anthocyanins. As these compounds are attained they will be moved to the market place, where they can be further researched by academia, industry and governmental agencies.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).",
