 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award funds the acquisition of an Olympus laser confocal microscope FV1000 with multifluorescence detection at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) that will be integrated into both research and training programs in the Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Material Sciences, Chemical and Mechanical Engineering. This will be the only operational confocal microscopy resource in the North Alabama region. The acquisition of the confocal microscope will provide a critical link between researchers and will be used to support unique training opportunities to exceptional students from all area institutions. The confocal microscope and the establishment of Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy (CFM) facility will allow researchers and students to perform live cell imaging as well as study the histochemistry, morphology and physiology of cells, cellular processes and materials, images which are not sufficiently resolved using conventional microscopes.  The CFM facility will also be an integral part of a variety of training programs. As an immediate impact, it will serve as a training tool for students of advanced microscopy theory and practice while being an important tool for graduate research projects. All students, including women and underrepresented minorities, will be able to participate in training workshops on microscopy techniques to be offered jointly by the primary investigators of this award and the HudsonAlpha education program staff. As a long-term impact, an enhanced microscopy facility on the University of Alabama Huntsville campus will be a nucleation facility for integrated research between science and engineering faculty and students. The facility will have a positive impact on the community by promoting networking opportunities for students.  Results from the research projects will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles, and through student at faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.",
