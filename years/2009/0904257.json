The conference will attract scientists from a wide range of disciplines, from semiconductor thin film growth to biocrystallization and crystallization for pharmaceutical drug delivery.  Sessions devoted to the following timely topics are included:  crystal surface morphology and kinetics, low dimensional crystals, fundamentals of crystal nucleation and growth, large biomolecule crystallization, biocrystallization and biomineralization, organic electronics, advanced electron microscopy, and structure function relationships on catalytic crystal surfaces.  These topics intersect the portfolios of the NSF Biomaterials and Solid State and Materials Chemistry programs, which will provide partial support for the Conference..\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The Gordon Research Conferences have a long standing reputation for providing an informal atmosphere for intimate scientific exchange among scientists from around the world.  The plans for this conference fit this mold very well.  The Vice-Chair and at least 6 of the 19 invited speakers are females.  Participation in the Conference is by invitation, and the organizers describe a plan to ensure participation from a diverse selection of scientists, including especially women, racial and ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and others from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in science.  NSF support will help to facilitate participation by young scientists who might otherwise be unable to attend.  The organizers have given due attention in the expenditure of support funds provided to further the NSF goals of broadening participation and integration of research and education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
