Cooper\r\n\r\nThis three year REU site program at the University of Pittsburgh will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to do hands-on research in the area of Rehabilitation Engineering (RE). Rehabilitation engineering employs a systematic approach to design, modification, customization and/or fabrication of assistive technology for persons with disabilities.  Research efforts in rehabilitation engineering are focused on identifying and addressing problems critical to achieving and maintaining the highest possible level of function in areas related to mobility, communications, sensory (e.g., hearing, tactile, vision) and cognition and in activities associated with employment, independent living, and education. The primary objectives of this program are to provide an exemplary mentoring and resourceful environment that will enable undergraduate students to do the following: 1) transition from dependent to independent thinkers; 2) develop a sense of excitement about entering an engineering or technical field; and 3) be well prepared for future careers. A unique feature of the REU is that the students have the opportunity to experience first had the application of technology to real people in both a clinical and research setting. At the end of the program, participants will prepare a conference formatted research paper and make a formal presentation of their work at a Student Research Symposium. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the research projects, students will also be engaged in a series of enrichment activities that will help them become more confident as researchers, including field trips, seminars, and workshops on disability and technology, design and research practices, scientific writing and presentation of research findings. \r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will be targeted to participants from underrepresented groups, in particular, persons with disabilities and students from African-American, Hispanic and Native American descent.\r\n\r\nThis site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
