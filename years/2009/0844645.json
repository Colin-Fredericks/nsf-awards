 "awd_abstract_narration": "0844645\r\nPetsev, D.N.\r\n\r\nThe physical laws governing the small length-scale transport in micro and nanofluidic channels differ from the macroscopic case. The PI will investigate these laws and focus on transport of fluid, current and solutes in nanochannels fabricated in a silica-based matrix. The PI will test the hypothesis that small current leakage across the silica layers affects the electric field. Testing of the hypothesis that the counterion valence is important for the transport in nanochannels will use the same experimental approaches and will add a level of complexity that will allow a better understanding of the transport in confined fluidic nanochannels in the silica media. Finally, examination of the fluid flow and analyte transport in micro and nanofluidic channels using electroosmotic force generated by remotely operated semiconductor diodes and alternate current fields is planned. This study will introduce further complications due to relaxation and polarization effects related to the ionic distribution in the vicinity of the diode/solution interface. The deep understanding of single and multiphase transport at such length-scales is of paramount importance for the successful implementation of micro and nanofluidics in engineering. The execution of the research will improve the knowledge of micro and nanofluidic systems and the design, fabrication and operation of integrated electronic-fluidic chips for micro and nanofluidic applications. Micro and nanofluidics are important thrust areas for the University of New Mexico in both research and education. Selected topics will be introduced in the Introduction to Transport Phenomena undergraduate course that is taught by the PI.  Dr. Petsev is also developing a new graduate course on the fundamentals of Nanofluidics, which was taught for the first time recently. The University of New Mexico traditionally has a leading role in the education of Hispanic and Native American in New Mexico. The proposed program will enhance and complement the PI's outreach activities for Hispanic students and set up a strong outreach program that includes Native American high school students. In addition, two students from the high school will join the PI's group for summer hands-on research. The goal of this effort is to encourage and augment the college enrollment of Native American students particularly in the areas of engineering and natural sciences.",
