 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry(12)  This project is integrating inquiry-based experiences into two high-profile chemistry courses to promote student learning, engagement, and excitement toward science.  The Analytical Chemistry laboratory is focusing on three primary goals: development of laboratory skills, enhancement of proficiency with analytical instrumentation, and engagement in the process of critical analysis.  In the first half of the course, students are developing laboratory skills and instrumental proficiency by rotating through six different instruments performing quantitative analyses of unknowns.  In the second half of the course, pairs of students are using these skills to design and perform a quantitative chemical analysis of a real-world sample.  The students are responsible for directing each step in the analytical process: sample collection, sample preparation, data acquisition, data interpretation, conclusion formation, and information dissemination.\r\n\r\nSmall groups of students in the General Chemistry II laboratory are engaging in mini-research projects focused on an issue of relevance - the fate of pharmaceuticals in natural waters.  In the first half of the course students are carrying out experiments that prepare them for their research projects.  Then in the second half of the course, each group is developing a hypothesis, creating and carrying out an experimental plan for hypothesis testing, evaluating their results, and presenting their conclusions.  This project is adapting established models of inquiry-based laboratory instruction and implementing them into two popular courses to excite and educate the next generation of scientists.  Assessment outcomes will be of interest to educators across the sciences, because stimulating student learning, interest, and excitement are objectives shared by all.",
