With the industry?s continuous investment (e.g., Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing, IBM Blue Cloud), virtual cloud computing is likely to be a major component of the future IT solution, which will have significant impact on almost all sectors of society. The trustworthiness of virtual cloud computing is thus critical to the well-being of all organizations or individuals that will rely on virtual cloud computing for their IT solutions. \r\n\r\nThis project envisions trustworthy virtual cloud\r\ncomputing and investigates fundamental research issues leading to this vision.  Central to\r\nthis vision is a new security architecture, which harnesses new\r\nopportunities and capabilities such as built-in out-of-band system\r\naccess, processor and hardware support for trusted computing, and\r\nout-of-box examination by hypervisors. This project focuses\r\non key research issues following this security architecture, including new\r\nsecurity services that enhance the trustworthiness of virtual cloud\r\ncomputing, protection of management infrastructure against malicious\r\nworkloads, and protection of hosted workloads from potentially\r\nmalicious management infrastructure.\r\n The research will enable the adoption of virtual cloud computing for critical IT management in industry and government organizations. This project will involve both graduate and undergraduate students, and will produce open source software and tools, which will be made available to the public.",
