 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water vapor is a key element essential to most forms of life and one which connects multiple spheres within the earth system.  Techniques to accurately track its movement and transformations (e.g., use of isotopic tracers for hydrological processes, microphysical studies of in-cloud processes, and representations of water vapor transport and precipitation processes within global atmospheric circulation models) are continuously evolving.  These and other related topics will be the focus of a joint American-European summer school titled \"Water Vapour in the Climate System\", to be held September 14-26, 2009, in Cargese, Corsica.\r\n\r\nA mix of established scientists, students and postdoctoral research associates drawn from diverse communities including numerical modelers, data analysts, and experts in satellite and in-situ observing systems will gather to exchange information on the latest advances and techniques within this active arena of research.  Partner European agencies will supply meeting facilities and host services, while funds distributed under this grant will provide partial travel support for approximately one dozen U.S.-based students and postdoctoral research associates attending this summer school.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the workshop is high because it will bring together both established and early-career researchers from a broad range of sub-disciplines.  Broader impacts stem from the societal importance of global cloud and precipitation processes that hinge on the water vapor cycle, the recruitment of a diverse group of attendees including members of underrepresented groups, and promotion of international collaborations.",
