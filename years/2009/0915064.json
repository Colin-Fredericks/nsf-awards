 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this proposal is the analysis of existing methods, and  the development of new ones, for the task of multi-manifold learning,  where the data is assumed to be comprised of low-dimensional  structures.  The main focus will be in studying the potential of  spectral methods for clustering and modeling of low-dimensional  surfaces embedded in high dimensions; in designing new spectral-based  approached to the task of detection of low-dimensional objects in  point clouds; and the analysis of popular manifold learning  algorithms, especially in terms of robustness to outliers.  A number  of applications will be specifically addressed, for example, motion  segmentation, structure from motion, classification of face images,  segmentation of diffusion tensor images and the characterization of  cosmological models in astrophysics. \r\n\r\nModern high-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional  structures. Such situations arise in image processing; e.g., in  target tracking, where a typical trajectory defines a curve through  successive frames; and also in medical imaging, e.g., in the  examination of vascular networks. The study of the galaxy  distribution, which contains filamentary and sheet-like structures,  is another example.  Traditional methods are known to be ineffective  in this context and the last decade has seen a massive amount of  research aiming at improving on these classical tools.  A number of  approaches for multi-manifold modeling have been suggested, mostly by  computer scientists and engineers.  Applied mathematicians and  statisticians have different perspectives to \r\noffer and their contribution is needed, not only in designing new  algorithms but also (and perhaps especially) in providing theoretical  foundations, which researchers in the field have been asking for. The  research in this proposal will address both issues, developing  rigorous mathematical theory combined with carefully designed  numerical strategies addressing specific applications, such as motion  segmentation, structure from motion, classification of face images,  medical imaging and the characterization of cosmological models in  astrophysics.  The PIs will share their findings through publications  and software, all available online to the scientific and engineering  communities. \r\n",
