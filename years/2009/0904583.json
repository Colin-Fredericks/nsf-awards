 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to investigate a number of topics in the \r\nintersection of geometry, the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE's) and general relativity (GR). \r\nThese topics share a common theme: to investigate solutions of the global Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations for physically interesting situations and to describe the asymptotics of these solutions. \r\nTo do this, problems in Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry have to be solved, and the study of the curvature and geometric quantities especially along null hypersurfaces is required. Recent results obtained by the principal investigator (PI), extending work by D. Christodoulou and S. Klainerman, \r\nprove global existence and uniqueness of solutions of the Einstein vacuum (EV) equations in an asymptotically flat setting under more general conditions leading to borderline estimates. \r\nThe latter indicate that the conditions in the PI's main theorem are sharp in so far as the assumptions on the decay at infinity on the initial data are concerned. \r\nMoreover, the new results describe the asymptotic behaviour for these more general situations.  These new results together with the geometric and analytic theories used and developed in the proof provide the tools required to further investigate physically interesting solutions of the EV equations \r\nfor asymptotically flat initial data. Thus, the PI plans to compute the asymptotics of spacetimes allowing non-isotropic mass. \r\nThis will follow in a straightforward manner from the results obtained in the PI's work. \r\nIt will make it possible to later on attack another main problem, \r\nnamely the investigation of angular momentum at null infinity for more general \r\nsettings. \r\nAiming at this latter goal, this project will study the Cauchy problem for the EV equations in three specific cases, applying the new tools and results to these unexplored situations in order to describe the asymptotics of the corresponding solutions of the EV equations. \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral relativity, as a unified theory of space, time and gravitation, is based on and extends Newton's theory of gravitation as well as Newton's equations of motion. \r\nThe laws of GR are the Einstein equations, linking the curvature of spacetime to its matter content. \r\nExploring these equations will lead to a better understanding of the universe. \r\nTo unravel the complex interplay between geometry, analysis and physics \r\nis one of the richest challenges in GR. \r\nThis project aims to investigate this interaction. \r\nAlong the way, the mathematical tools developed promise to bear fruit in the \r\nanalysis of the many structurally similar nonlinear PDE's. \r\nThe proposed research studies asymptotically flat systems. \r\nIsolated gravitating systems such as binary stars, clusters of stars and galaxies can be described in GR by asymptotically flat solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations, as they can be thought of as having \r\nan asymptotically flat region outside the support of the matter. \r\nIt is very important to understand the asymptotics of such systems also in view of gravitational radiation. \r\nAnd the well-known experiments to detect gravitational waves \r\nare based on the analysis of such asymptotically flat systems. \r\n",
