 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS).  CENS is a multidisciplinary research center focused on developing embedded networked sensing technology and applying the revolutionary technology to critical scientific and social applications.  The Center provides a proven, thoughtful, and organized environment for 10 undergraduates to conduct authentic research and become members of a highly collaborative intellectual community. All of the projects are connected through the common theme of using sensing technology for sustainability.  The research projects focus on developing the SensorKit resource for applications related to resource sustainability. The summer experience includes mentoring, professional development, social events, and a special summer ethics program funded by the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the strong research environment and research team. SensorKit related projects should engage the participating undergraduates in research focused on monitoring factors important in urban sustainability, such as electricity, water, waste, traffic, building and parking occupancy, and public transport usage patterns. In addition to increasing the students' skills, knowledge base, and preparation for future studies, the project has the potential to contribute to research breakthroughs with scientific, environmental, and social relevance.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly women and students from underrepresented groups. The participating faculty members are committed to including under-represented minority students in their research.  Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.",
