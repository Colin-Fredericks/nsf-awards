The BLAST conference series focuses on Boolean Algebra, Lattice Theory, Algebraic Logic, Universal Algebra, Set Theory, and Set-theoretic Topology. \r\nTogether, these areas form a cohesive sub-unit of logic and have strong connections with other mathematical disciplines such as Algebra, Combinatorics, General Topology, and Mathematical Physics.\r\n\r\nThe 2009 meeting will take place August 10--14, 2009, at the New Mexico State University at Las Cruces, the 2010 meeting will take place at the University of Colorado at Boulder, the 2011 meeting will take place at the University of Kansas at Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe BLAST 2009 program includes 8 invited speakers, 4 tutorials, and 40--60 contributed talks. There will be substantial funds designated support travel and lodging for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.\r\n\r\n",
