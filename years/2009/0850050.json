Through its emphasis on Sustainable Innovation Learning Communities, this scholars program seeks to: i) provide both the necessary mission, community, and support needed to increase enrollment of underrepresented minorities and women into engineering; ii) increase retention of this population through graduation; iii) pilot integrated sustainable engineering curriculum which can serve as a national model for similar practice elsewhere; and iv) enhance relationships with employers seeking graduates prepared\r\nto meet the most critical national and international need for engineering in a resource constrained world with global environmental consequences of technology development and usage.",
