 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intelligent Optimal Mechanical Sensorless Control of Variable-Speed Wind Energy Systems Considering System Uncertainties\r\n(NSF Proposal ID: 0901218)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop intelligent optimal mechanical sensorless control for variable-speed wind energy systems.  The approach is to (1) develop a neural-network-based, real-time wind speed and direction estimator and turbine shaft speed estimator, (2) develop an adaptive critic design-based supervisory wind turbine controller, (3) optimize the parameters of the estimators and controller by evolutionary swarm intelligence algorithms, (4) perform a stability analysis for the wind energy systems with the controller, and (5) verify the modeling and control framework and methodology by simulations and hardware implementations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project will investigate in depth the use of bio-inspired design principles to handle highly stochastic, uncertain, and complex processes, e.g., wind energy conversion, in an intelligent way.  Through modeling, control, stability analysis, simulation, and hardware implementation, this project will advance our understanding of bio-inspired modeling, control, and optimization technologies for improving the availability of affordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity from wind.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This outcome of this project will further exploit the benefits of wind power by reducing the cost and improving the efficiency, dynamic performance, and reliability of wind energy systems.  These are essential to reaching the goal of supplying 20% of the nation?s electricity by wind.  New courses will be developed.  Undergraduates and at least one female graduate student will be supported to work on various tasks of this project.  Through the collaboration with the Nebraska Wind Applications Center?s Wind for Schools Program, this project will engage rural K-12 school teachers and students in energy education.",
