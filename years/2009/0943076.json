 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education (DBASSE) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) proposes a RAPID project to create a conceptual framework for conducting a comprehensive evaluation the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS).  The need for such an evaluation is mandated by the Public Education Reform Amendment Act (PERAA) of 2007 and the evaluation must begin in the fall of 2009. Therefore, the framework must be developed within the next several months. This framework will guide the structure, data collection, analysis and timeline for conducting a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of DCPS in terms of impacts on students, teachers and administrators, and the system, with particular attention to issues in STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe framework will examine how the new accountability system has addressed chronic problems in DCPS; components aimed at school staff will look at credentials, retention and instructional practices;the student component will examine a range of outcomes such as achievement, course-taking, and dropout/attendance. The project will be led by a panel of national experts to be identified by the NRC.",
