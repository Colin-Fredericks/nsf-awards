 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to study the process driven evolution of microstructure and properties in mixed-conducting multi-functional materials for electrochemical energy conversion applications. The project is divided into three tasks. In task one, the effect of sequential introduction of proton conductivity, electron conductivity, and electrocatalytic activity onto a silica substrate on resultant microstructure and properties will be studied. In task two, the influence of potential cycling and exposure to strong oxidizing and reducing conditions on microstructure and properties will be examined through accelerated tests designed in close collaboration with industry. The final task will involve in-situ investigation of kinetic and transport properties in fuel cell electrodes prepared using optimized multi-functional materials. Material microstructure will be characterized by XRD, TEM, FTIR and nitrogen physisorption. Kinetic and transport properties will be measured using conductivity and diffusion cells, while electrochemical properties will be estimated using voltammetry and polarization experiments. \r\n\r\nThis research will enhance our understanding of processing-microstructure-property relationships in porous, multi-functional materials and facilitate transformative changes in fuel cell electrocatalyst/electrode composition and microstructure, leading to lower support corrosion, higher catalyst utilization, improved kinetic and transport properties, and lower cost. The insights gained during this study will establish a pathway for future research on the manufacture of high performance multi-functional materials for electrolyzers, unitized regenerative fuel cells, electrochemical hydrogen pumps, and intermediate temperature ceramic fuel cells. The education and outreach activities planned in this CAREER project will enhance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching and learning through course and nationwide workshop offerings. Participation and training of underrepresented groups will be facilitated by actively involving inner-city school students in research and outreach activities. Finally, significant societal benefits through the training of the next generation of scientists and engineers in relevant alternate energy technologies are anticipated.",
