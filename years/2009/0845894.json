 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe World Wide Web is a critical infrastructure that serves our society\r\nby facilitating  information  exchange, business and\r\neducation. As it continues to evolve, the number of web-based\r\nattacks that target innocent web users keeps increasing. \r\nExamples of such attacks include Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection\r\nand Cross-site Request Forgery. Recent attacks on end-users and\r\nonline enterprises through these virulent attacks have resulted in\r\nwidespread damage. Defending these attacks is therefore of very \r\nimportant concern to Internet economy and to  society-at-large. \r\nThis project develops a comprehensive plan for defending web \r\napplications from these attacks.  \r\n\r\nThe technical contributions of this project are in the development of the\r\ntechnologies that  elicit the intended behavior of a web application\r\nand prevent attacks by enforcing these intended behaviors. We build\r\na  framework in which  the intentions of a web application are represented \r\nusing models, which are then enforced to ensure robust prevention of attacks. \r\nThis framework uses novel techniques  based on static and dynamic\r\nanalysis, symbolic evaluation, runtime checking and \r\nisolated execution as foundations. This project also develops\r\ntechniques that enable a web application and a browser to\r\ncollaborate in order to prevent attacks, and apply fine-grained\r\nrestrictions on Web content.  The tools being developed in this project \r\nwill have immediate impact on defending legacy web applications \r\nthat are  vulnerable to these attacks.  \r\n\r\nThe CAREER research project is closely tied with educational\r\nefforts by integrating topics on web security in the undergraduate \r\nand graduate computer security classrooms. Finally, a collaborative \r\neffort with a Chicago inner-city elementary school is also part of this \r\nproject's educational mission.",
