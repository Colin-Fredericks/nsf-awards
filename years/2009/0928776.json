 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to establish a theoretical framework for stochastic, complex systems\r\nsuch that given a specification, we can analyze the system to determine the probability that the specification\r\nwill be achieved and automatically find an input law to maximize this probability. The research approach\r\nprogresses from the adaptation of existing probabilistic specification languages into a form suitable for a\r\ngeneral class of hybrid systems, to the creation of tools for the automatic synthesis of control strategies to\r\nsatisfy a given probabilistic specification, and finally to an implementation of those tools for the automatic\r\ndeployment of mobile robots.\r\n\r\nIn formal analysis, finite models of computer programs or digital circuits are checked against temporal\r\nlogic properties such as safety (i.e., something bad never happens), liveness (i.e., something good eventually\r\nhappens), or richer specifications. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the dual problem of\r\nformal synthesis, where the focus is to construct a control for a continuous system that is safe and correct\r\nby design. These efforts have centered on non-stochastic systems. Real-world systems, however, invariably\r\nevolve under stochastic inputs and all sensors are subject to noise.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will result in general-use computational tools for the analysis and\r\ncontrol of stochastic systems with continuous dynamics. Applications of such techniques are wide-spread,\r\nranging from engineered systems such as power grids, autonomous robots for personal and military use, and\r\nbiomedical devices, to natural systems such as genetic networks up to entire eco-systems. The research is\r\nclosely coupled to an educational and outreach plan, including curriculum development at the undergraduate\r\nlevel, involvement of both undergraduate and high school students in the research, and participation of the\r\nPIs in outreach events such as the Upward Bound program at Boston University.",
