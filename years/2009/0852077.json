Boot\r\n\r\nProposal # 0852077  \r\n\r\nClaudia M. Boot has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Polar Science to study dissolved organic matter in the Arctic. She will conduct her research under the mentorship of Dr. Josh Schimel (University of California Santa Barbara) and Dr. Matt Wallenstein (Colorado State University). Dr. Boot?s research will determine the major components of dissolved organic matter in the three vegetation types (tussock tundra, wet meadow, and shrub tundra), document seasonal variability of those components, and determine the molecular characteristics responsible for the variation. The results will improve models of carbon cycling in the Arctic. The fellowship will introduce Dr. Boot to Arctic research, and she will bring new chemical techniques to the laboratories of her mentors. \r\n",
