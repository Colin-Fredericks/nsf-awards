 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop novel biomaterials with unique properties including self healing and bio-recognition that will be assembled into biomimetic structures, by utilizing biosynthetic hydrogels derived from polyethylene glycol (PEG) that covalently crosslink to produce materials with highly controlled physical properties. In order to enable PEG functional substitution, PIs will develop a method that provides multiple chemical arms on a PEG polymer and hydrogel. Through an interdisciplinary team including materials scientists and engineers, biomaterials will be developed that provide an integrated sensor/actuator technology platform for designing a system with multi-scale unique properties. This bio-inspired sensor/actuator technology can be employed in numerous applications ranging from biomedical to civil applications. This novel material and engineering design will be applied to the development of a nervous system for self-monitoring, self-diagnostics, and self-healing of civil structures, including bridges and high rises. The proposed sensor/actuator platform technology can have extensive applications in medicine, security, and infrastructure systems. Given the research team composed of three universities, this will enable cross-institution educational programs. Furthermore, with the award winning summer camps for the middle and high school students and teachers at the University of Denver, this research will bring new and exciting projects to these outreach programs.",
