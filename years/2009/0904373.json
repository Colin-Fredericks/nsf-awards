 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to provide support for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend a\r\nconference on Engineering Principles for Biological Systems, to be held at Cold Spring Harbor\r\nLaboratory on 10--13 December 2008. The conference is intended to foster cross-disciplinary\r\nexchange of ideas and expertise between engineers, mathematicians and biologists interested\r\nin the analysis of diverse biological systems through the application of engineering principles.\r\nSupport from this grant would be used to help offset the cost of the conference for graduate\r\nstudents and postdoctoral researchers who wish to attend.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Through the process of evolution, living systems retain solutions arisen by\r\nchance to problems they must solve in order to survive. In the past, theoretical biology has\r\nlargely focused on explanations of the physico-chemical mechanisms behind such solutions,\r\nwhile explanation in the form of function-solution pairs has been studied in a relatively ad hoc\r\nmanner and has not been approached from a disciplinary perspective. This conference will\r\npromote the development of an emerging approach to theoretical biology with more formal\r\nemphasis on design or engineering principles. Here, the premise is that although solutions or\r\ndesigns in biological systems are not engineered but instead arise incrementally through natural\r\nselection, they may nevertheless be studied in their existing forms in the framework of\r\nengineering theories developed alongside human-engineered systems.\r\nThis conference is part of a series of workshops and conferences organized by Partha Mitra\r\n(CSHL), Richard Murray (Caltech) and others to help foster a community of researchers working\r\non theoretical frameworks for understanding biological systems across a variety of scales. A\r\nstarting point for these theories can be drawn from courses taught in engineering departments.\r\nThe idea is therefore to start with major existing engineering theories (controls, communication,\r\ncomputation) and to examine whether these apply to biological systems, and if not, what\r\nmodifications are in order. The conference series and this CSHL conference in particular, will\r\nprovide an educational opportunity for biological researchers to learn about engineering theories\r\nwhich may be relevant to their work, and for engineering theorists and computer scientists to\r\nlearn about biological problems they might help to be understood. Each session at the\r\nconference will have a two invited talks, one each by a biologist and a theoretician/engineer,\r\nintegrated with a set of contributed talks, chosen from submitted abstracts.\r\n\r\nDissemination and Broader Impact: The proposed conference will foster this new approach to\r\nunderstanding biological systems and the collaborative culture across disciplines that its\r\nsuccess will require. The conference venue and format are ideal for encouraging open\r\ndiscussion and initiating collaborative efforts, and it is hoped that a continuing series of such\r\nmeetings will also encourage the development of an enduring and progressive theoretical\r\nframework. To complement the direct training opportunity for conference participants, talks\r\npresented at the conference will be put on a website for the benefit of the wider scientific\r\ncommunity. Options will be provided to individual presenters to make their talks publicly\r\navailable through the Leading Strand web site.\r\n",
