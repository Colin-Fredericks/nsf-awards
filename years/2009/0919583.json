 "awd_abstract_narration": "Milkweeds (the genus Asclepias) are beautiful plants that are well known and commonly planted for their ability to attract butterflies.  There are 135 species of milkweed in North America that have all originated fairly rapidly.  This project will use genomic sequencing technology to investigate how the species are related to each other.  DNA sequences will be obtained  from complete chloroplast genomes and 10 nuclear genes from two or more samples of each species.  The goal is to achieve a species level phylogeny of a large, rapidly radiating genus.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of systematic relationships among milkweed species will help to improve the classification of the genus. Furthermore, these results will provide a robust foundation for studies of milkweed floral diversity, pollination biology and biogeography.  Milkweeds have long served as a model system for the evolution of plant defenses against herbivory, and results from this research will contribute to a better understanding of how plants co-evolve with their pests. The methods developed here achieve a savings in cost, time, and effort beyond any previously attained in comparative genomics, and will be directly applicable to phylogenetic, population genomic and ecological genomic studies of animals, fungi and plants. A post-doctoral associate and three undergraduate students will be trained, and two workshops designed to introduce plant systematists to genomic sequencing approaches will be conducted at the annual Botany meetings in 2010 and 2011.",
