Part of the US component of the collaboration is the CINEMA CubeSat Mission.  \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merits \r\nThis project involves the development of new miniaturized instruments and spacecraft for the next generation of space mission in solar, heliospheric, magnetospheric physics, as well as in lunar and planetary science.  The collaborators will develop the CINEMA (Cubesat for Ion, Neutral, Electron, Magnetic field) project, utilizing a magnetometer developed by Imperial College of London, as part of NSF?s CubeSat program. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nUCB/SSL and KHU working together will build up new experimental space instrumentation capability at KHU, provide training and hands-on experience in space plasma physics for both UCB and KHU students.  UCB and KHU students will also work with students at ICL.  Students from the Inter American University of Puerto Rico (IAUPR) will also participate in the development and operation of CINEMA, to broaden participation of underrepresented students in space systems research and in international collaborative projects.\r\n",
