 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concepts and techniques drawn from combinatorial and algebraic topology have been successful at solving a number of fundamental problems common to concurrent and distributed computing. This research focuses on two goals. First, much needs to be done to further explore and exploit the emerging connection between concurrent computing and topology. In particular, there is a need to reformulate classical notions from algebraic and combinatorial topology in terms better-suited to the demands of modeling computation. Second, there are many opportunities to apply techniques based on topology to emerging models and problems, refining and extending earlier results.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, nearly all computers, from supercomputers to smoke detectors, will be shared-memory multiprocessors (often called multicores).  As a result, understanding how to exploit this new-found concurrency is one of the central issues in modern Computer Science.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by EPSCoR\r\n",
