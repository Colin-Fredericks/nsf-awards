 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and meets the requirements established in Section 2 of the White House Memorandum entitled, Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, dated March 20, 2009. I also affirm, as the cognizant Program Officer, that the proposal does not support projects described in Section 1604 of Division A of the Recovery Act. \r\n\r\n   \r\n Enabling Transformational Science and Engineering through Integrated Collaborative Visualization and Data Analysis for the National User Community\r\n\r\nVisualization is one of the most important and commonly used methods of analyzing and interpreting digital assets. For many types of computational research, it is the only viable means of extracting information and developing understanding from data. However, non-visual data analysis techniques, statistical analysis, data mining, data reduction, etc. also play integral roles in many areas of knowledge discovery. This award will, for the first time, provide a comprehensive suite of large-scale visualization and data analysis (VDA) services to the open science community. By leveraging existing tools and techniques, integrating state-of-the-art research products, and providing exceptional user support, we will deploy a national, general-purpose visualization and data analysis discovery environment. The deliverables include:\r\no\ta remote visualization resource of extreme capability (Longhorn):\r\no\t256  nodes (2048 processor cores, 24 Tflops peak) with 512 GPUs, 12 terabytes of aggregate memory, 200 terabytes of local system storage\r\no\ttightly integrated with Ranger (the TeraGrid's inaugural Track2 system) to handle digital assets at the largest scale (and potentially future TACC HPC systems);\r\n\t1. a comprehensive collection of open source and commercial end-user VDA software tools;\r\n\t2. expert visualization support, including advanced interactive user support and training, from a team comprising many of the leading visualization researchers in the US; and\r\n\t3. a framework for rapidly integrating new visualization technologies from leading research teams (including our own) to increase user capabilities throughout the project.\r\naborative Visualization and Data Analysis for the National User Community\r\n\r\n",
