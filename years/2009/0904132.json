It will be co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE). This conference, which is to be hosted by Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey, has been endorsed by the Dean at the University and financial support will also be applied for from TUBITAK. \r\n\r\nThe conference themes are Applied Complex Analysis, Geometric Function Theory, Scientific Computation (including algorithms), Clifford Analysis and Potential Theory.  T he format of the conference is such that young people will have ample opportunities to interact with senior researchers  A key purpose of this event is to promote the formation of collaborations between the younger generation of American complex analysts and their Asian and European counterparts.",
