 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the investigators will study the functions of a family of proteins called calmodulin binding protein 60 (CBP60) in plant defense signaling.  Calmodulin is a small protein that binds calcium ion and regulates the functions of other proteins by binding to them.  Preliminary work in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that two of these proteins, called CBP60g and CBP60h, play partially-redundant roles in plant defense signaling.  Plants lacking both of these proteins produce greatly reduced amounts of the important signaling molecule, salicylic acid (SA), in response to pathogen attack.  Consequently, they are more susceptible to a bacterial pathogen.  The major goal of this project is to understand how the CBP60 proteins function to control activation of defense signaling.  There are four main parts to the project.  In the first part, the investigators will define the site of CBP60 protein action within the framework of the plant defense network.  In the second part, altered versions of the CBP60g and CBP60h genes will be constructed and used to test hypotheses about why the two proteins have slightly different roles in different aspects of defense signaling.  In the third part, proteins that physically interact with the CBP60g and h proteins will be identified.  In the fourth part, the mechanisms by which calcium ion and calmodulin modulate CBP60g function will be investigated.  Science education will be an important part of the work.  Graduate and post-graduate students will receive training and mentoring to prepare them for careers in research and teaching.  Undergraduate students will participate in various aspects of the project.  They will be drawn from programs that encourage participation by members of under-represented groups, and from a network of teacher-scientists, faculty at nearby undergraduate institutions with whom the PI has established relationships.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research increased understanding of how the immune system works in plants.  It comprised several different but related lines of investigation.  In one part, a family of genes encoding Calmodulin Binding Protein 60 (CBP60) proteins was studied.  Mutations in five of the eight genes had no effect on plant immunity, while mutations in any of the other three genes resulted in changes in growth of bacterial pathogen, indicating that these three genes have roles in immunity.  Mutations in the CBP60a gene caused reduced pathogen growth, indicating that the CBP60a protein is a negative regulator of immunity.  Mutations in the CBP60g or SARD1 genes caused increased pathogen growth, indicating that the CBP60g and SARD1 proteins are positive regulators of immunity.  CBP60g and SARD1 act in a partially redundant fashion to activate gene expression of immunity genes, while CBP60a acts to repress such expression.  CBP60a function requires the ability to bind the calcium signal transducing protein, calmodulin, while SARD1 function is independent of calmodulin.  Considered together, our data support a model in which CBP60a represses gene expression in the absence of pathogens.  Upon pathogen attack, CBP60g acts to remove the repression by CBP60a and activate immune gene expression.  Later in the course of infection, SARD1 acts to maintain gene expression. \n\nIn another line of investigation, patterns of CBP60g and SARD1 gene expression were compared with those of other genes.  This analysis revealed a high correlation with genes known to play important roles in immunity.  It also showed that many genes co-expressed with CBP60g and SARD1 include a particular DNA sequence in their regulatory regions.  This DNA sequence is thought to be a binding site for CBP60g and SARD1, suggesting that many of the co-expressed genes may be controlled by CBP60g and SARD1.  This analysis also revealed two genes encoding calmodulin-like proteins that are tightly co-expressed with SARD1.  Calmodulin-like proteins are unique to plants, and their functions are largely unknown.  Analysis of plants with mutations in the genes encoding calmodulin-like proteins revealed that these proteins act as negative regulators of immune responses.\n\nThe project also included study of a Cytoplasmic Receptor-Like Kinase protein called PCRK.  Plants with mutations in the PCRK gene are more susceptible to a bacterial pathogen, indicating that PCRK is important for immunity.  Analysis of double mutant plants showed that the action of PCRK is independent of the activity of salicylic acid, an immune signaling hormone, and partially dependent on jasmonic acid, another immune signaling hormone.  In wild-type plants, immunity can be induced by treatment with small molecules characteristic of microbes, such as a peptide from bacterial flagellin.  This phenomenon is called Pattern Triggered Immunity, PTI.  In plants with PCRK mutations, the PTI response was weak, indicating that PCRK functions in PTI.  Consistent with this hypothesis, an early response characteristic of PTI, deposition of the carbohydrate polymer, callose, was reduced in plants with PCRK mutations.\n\nThe project had an impact on science education.  It supported a Ph.D. student and a post-doctoral fellow.  Both of these trainees are now employed as post-doctoral researchers in other laboratories.  Two undergraduate students completed Honors thesis research working on this project.  A third student worked on the project for several years, has now completed a B.S. degree, and is employed by a biotechnology company as a researcher.  Several other undergraduate students from the University of Minnesota and neighboring undergraduate institutions also gained research experience working on this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jane Glazebrook"
