 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information theory has been used as an organizing principle in neuroscience for several decades. Estimates of the mutual information between signals acquired in neurophysiological experiments are believed to yield insights into the structure of the underlying signal processing architectures. The experimental side of the field has undergone an impressive paradigmatic shift over the last few years, including simultaneous recordings from neuron populations and brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). However, on the theoretical side, only minor modifications to the theory were made. This project aims at transforming the theoretical backdrop of systems neuroscience in general and neural ensemble electrophysiology in particular. To this end, it levies three recent and emerging theoretical advances in the network sciences: (1) the tremendous recent progress concerning the behavior and information-theoretic performance limits of communication networks, fueled by the resounding success of wireless communication; (2) we have recently developed a new information theory of joint computation/communication, showing that for networks with interference, joint computation/communication can be executed much more efficiently - an exponential energy savings as a function of the number of agents involved in the computation - than separate computation and communication (as is classically done in communication systems). Our hypothesis is that such a significant gap must have repercussions in neural systems, and we develop new information measures to look for places where indeed joint computation/communication could be a crucial component of the neural signal processing. Finally, (3), we exploit a new information-theoretic end-to-end perspective on communication systems. All of these methods are applicable only thanks to new emerging data sets pertaining to chronic, simultaneous recordings from large populations of neurons across multiple brain regions. The further acquisition and development of these data sets is therefore an integral part of this research project.\r\n\r\nThis project introduces a set of new information measures that are truly multivariate, and thus a perfect fit for the emerging multi-neuron data sets, and particularly for BMI. This involves both natural extensions of existing information and redundancy measures as well as a new computational information measure that assesses not just the quality of information transfer, but also the computational potential offered by a population of neurons. The project aims to develop a new set of theories, techniques, and methods for dealing with and understanding multi-neuron recordings across spatiotemporal dimensions. If successful, this will provide ideas for new experiments and sharpen our understanding of the connections between communication and computation.\r\n\r\n",
