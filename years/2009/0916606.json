 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer technologies play an important role in modern medicine and life\r\nsciences, especially in diagnostic imaging, human genome study, treatment\r\noptimization, and medical data management.  Many computational problems \r\narising in the field of biomedicine call for efficient and good quality \r\nalgorithmic solutions.  This project aims to develop new geometric \r\ncomputing and algorithmic techniques for solving computational problems \r\nin biomedical and engineering applications.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates a number of geometric optimization problems \r\nthat are theoretically challenging and practically relevant.  The target \r\nproblems belong to fundamental topics of computational geometry, such as \r\ngeometric partition, covering, shaping, approximation, motion planning, \r\nand clustering; they also arise in important applied areas such as \r\nradiation cancer treatment, medical imaging, biology, computer-aided \r\nmanufacturing, and data mining.  Some of the algorithms and software \r\ndeveloped during the preliminary studies of this research have produced \r\nsignificantly better solutions for real application problems (for example, \r\nmuch improved radiation cancer therapy plans over those computed by the\r\ncurrent commercial radiation treatment planning systems).  The research \r\nwill draw diverse techniques from other theoretical areas such as graph \r\nalgorithms, combinatorial optimization, discrete mathematics, and \r\noperations research.  It will also provide a rich source of interesting \r\nnew problems/questions and new ideas to prod further development of \r\nalgorithmic techniques in computational geometry and other theoretical \r\nareas.  This project is expected to generate broader impacts beyond \r\ncomputational geometry and even computer science. It will produce \r\nefficient and effective algorithms and software for solving key problems \r\nin radiation cancer therapy and surgery, medical imaging, biology, and \r\nother applied areas.  Furthermore, the newly developed algorithms and \r\nsoftware will be incorporated into practical applications such as \r\nclinical radiation cancer treatment systems.  Hence, this research will \r\nhelp unite and integrate the power of computational geometry, computer \r\nalgorithms, and modern biomedicine for diagnostic imaging, radiation \r\ncancer treatment, and other applications, and improve the quality of \r\nlife for the patients.",
