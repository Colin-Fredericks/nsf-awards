 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simulating and controlling communities of characters that can \r\ninteract with each other and their environment, and dynamically \r\nreact to changes, is a challenging problem with many important \r\napplications ranging from homeland security (e.g., simulation \r\nof disaster scenarios and responses), to civil crowd control \r\n(e.g., planning exit strategies for sporting events), to \r\neducation and training (e.g., providing immersive museum exhibits \r\nand training systems).  While there are existing methods that \r\nattempt to address the simulation aspect, there is a lack of \r\nmethods that support interaction of multiple types/groups of \r\nagents and little work has been done on the control or steering \r\naspect. \r\n\r\nThis work aims to address these challenges by integrating \r\nroadmap-based planning with agent-based modeling. This hybrid \r\napproach enables the development of methodology for modeling group \r\ninteractions which are also influenced by constraints imposed by \r\nthe environment (e.g., wide or narrow corridors) and techniques, \r\nincluding interfaces that enable planning and experimentation, that \r\ncan scale to large numbers of agents. The results of this work will \r\nbe shared with the community via publications and open source \r\nsoftware.  An anticipated outcome of this research is a tool for \r\nsimulation and control of large crowds at major events (e.g., \r\nsporting events, political rallies, emergency evacuations of a \r\nbuilding, region, or city). This could allow emergency response \r\nplanners to investigate the crowd response when officials are placed \r\nin particular positions, or architects to study how evacuation times \r\nare affected by widening or narrowing corridors.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSimulating and controlling communities of characters that can interact with each other and their environment, and dynamically react to changes, is a challenging problem with many important applications ranging from homeland security (e.g., simulation of disaster scenarios and responses), to civil crowd control (e.g., planning exit strategies for sporting events), to education and training (e.g., providing immersive museum exhibits and training systems) to entertainment (e.g., interactive games).  Moreover, there are many important situations in which the scale is so large as to make automatic methods the only feasible option.  For example, simulations of a natural disaster in a city or a terror attack at the superbowl.  The objective of this project was to develop methods that will support such applications.\n\nThis project has developed several new methods for planning motions of interacting groups of agents in multi-agent systems.  The basic strategy employed in this work was to use high-level maps of the planning space that are common many agents and then to specialize planning for individuals or groups of individuals.  Novel algorithmic approaches were developed that use more accurate agent models that enable more realistic motion for larger numbers of agents.  In a collaboration with researchers in building design, these algorithms were used in evacuation and egress simulations to develop prototypes for tools to study how design decisions impact the flow of agent movement.  An advancement over existing work is that these algorithms support grouping restrictions between agents (e.g., families or other social groups traveling together), and model scenarios with multiple modes of transportation with physically realistic dynamics (e.g., individuals walk from a building to their own cars and leave only when all people in the group arrive).  This project also contributed to the foundations of motion planning with the proposal of a new concept called Reachable Volumes that provide a geometric representation of the regions of space that different parts of a robot can reach.  This concept formed the basis of a new planning space called RV-space where all points automatically satisfy a problems constraints, and in which  motion planning problems that were previously difficult or unsolvable become manageable and in many cases trivial.  Reachable volumes have many other practical uses, such enabling robot operators to see which portions of the space robots can reach.  Finally, this project developed new strategies for parallelizing the state-of-the-art sampling-based planning algorithms, providing the first truly scalable methods and making it possible to apply these strategies to scenarios that were not possible before, such as the large-scale multi-agent systems targeted in this project.\n\nWe maintain a publically available set of motion planning benchmarks on the web.  The models represent a collection of benchmark problems that can be used to compare various motion planning algorithms.  As such, these models are available for public, non-commercial use provided that appropriate reference is made to the source/creator of the model.\n\nTraining and the development of human resources was an important aspect of this project.  A number of graduate students, the majority from groups underrepresented in computing, were involved in this project.  Nine students have already received PhD degrees or will be graduating in the coming year, including four women and four underrepresented minorities.  All of them are planning research careers, with five targeting academia and four research labs.  Additionally, several undergraduates and high school students, the majority from groups underrepresented in computing, have been trained on this project.  Many of these students have co-authored peer reviewed research papers and some have received national recognition for their research, including recognition in the Computing Research Association's Outstand..."
