 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit \r\n\r\nSuccessful control of food pathogens such as Listeria and Salmonella requires the development of new methodologies. Emerging food nanocarriers warrant great potentials for controlled antimicrobial delivery to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination. In the long run, the methodology of nanoparticle-based delivery of antimicrobials may complement or partially replace film-based active packaging. In this project, the goal is to establish a novel strategy to reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in food through carbohydrate nanoparticle-mediated delivery of bacteriocin. Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium will be used as the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria models, respectively. Nisin, an FDA approved potent food-grade antibacterial peptide, will be used as bacteriocin model. Phytoglycogen, a food-based dendritic carbohydrate, will be used to prepare water-soluble functional nanocarriers that are able to absorb nisin for controlled delivery. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this project will integrate nanotechnology with national food safety and security, and create new education opportunities for cutting-edge concepts and practices in food chemistry, food microbiology, and food processing. The outcome of this research will contribute to the reduction of food contamination by pathogens such as Listeria and Salmonella and may help to save lives. Beyond the food area, the knowledge generated from this research will benefit other fields such as the controlled delivery of drugs and nutraceuticals. In an effort to accomplish educational goals, great efforts will be taken for mentoring and training at the high school, college, and industrial levels. This project will provide precious training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students involved as well as for hundreds of industrial personnel attending the Carbohydrate Short Course hosted by the Whistler Center for Carbohydrate Research at Purdue. In addition, the PIs have established a relationship with a local high school for mentoring students in their Science Research course. This project will provide opportunities for these students to work in the real world and to learn from real scientists. To ensure the benefit of this project to underrepresented groups, the PIs will collaborate closely with Purdue administration to identify and recruit minority undergraduate and graduate students for inclusion in the proposed research.\r\n",
