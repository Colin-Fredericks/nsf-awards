 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of this award is to supplement funding from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for supporting the travel of doctoral students at US universities to a two-day conference entitled ?Nano-Bio: the Next Transformative Convergence?.  The conference will bring together eminent researchers from all over the world to (i) discuss the convergence of nanotechnology and biotechnology (Nano-Bio), (ii) review what has been achieved in these fields, (iii) charter future research directions in these technologies with special emphasis on cellular engineering, and (iv) establish collaborations among researchers all over the world.  This gathering of students, eminent researchers, and teachers will provide an intellectually stimulating atmosphere to young talented persons hungry for acquiring knowledge and senior researchers willing to sow seeds for future research in these areas.  Deliverables from this workshop will include a report summarizing discussions held during the two days.\r\n\r\nNano-Bio not only covers many of the formerly specialized sciences and engineering ? e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience ? but it also portends incredibly promising new innovations through the fusion of these earlier disparate fields.  Examples of what Nano-Bio can accomplish include bio-synthetic materials and machines; targeted drug delivery of novel, engineering-designed molecules to efficiently treat cancerous tumors; and smart sensors that can constantly monitor human body?s status. Forums to bring international researchers from different disciplines together offer tremendous value to help forge new collaborations and promote understanding among disparate fields.  The conference?s potential broader impact is to bridge these gaps toward enhancing scientific and technical exchanges at national and international levels.\r\n",
