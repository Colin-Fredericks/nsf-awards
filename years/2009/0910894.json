Ricketts\r\n\r\nThe proposal requests five Shipboard Scientific Support items for the University of Minnesota Duluth; namely an expanded fixed fire suppression system, ship?s service generator overhaul, HVAC up-grades in the dry lab, new RADAR?s, and new life rafts.  All items will either enhance safety or provide greatly improved science support capabilities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The University of Minnesota supports federally funded scientific research on the Great Lakes and routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to the marine sciences.  The R/V BLUE HERON is scheduled to complete over 50 NSF sponsored days in 2009.   \r\n\r\n",
