 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The Washington University REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Ten students will be selected each year to participate in an intensive 10-week research program in Cell and Developmental Biology (CD-BioRAP).  The goals of CD-BioRAP are: 1) prepare students for the rigor of top quality graduate training programs, 2) foster student-faculty and student-student relationships and interactions to provide participants with peer and faculty support, 3) provide professional development to increase confidence and success in application to graduate training programs, and 4) provide a cohort experience for participants. Research mentors are carefully selected to ensure that students have a supportive environment and a research project that will allow participants to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator. In addition, trainees will attend lectures given by a number of distinguished faculty and accomplished graduate students. They will also participate in group team-building exercises and community service projects to encourage group trust and emphasize the importance of peer support in pursuit of a science career.  Applications from individuals who come from rural or inner-city areas, those from institutions where research opportunities are limited, and those from groups traditionally underrepresented in biological research are encouraged.  Students will receive a stipend, housing, meals, and travel to and from the program. The CD-BioRap director and coordinator will utilize several means of evaluating student success while in the program and post-summer. Communication, advising, coaching and support will continue during subsequent years following participation in the program. Additional information can be found at http://dbbs.wustl.edu/,\r\n or by contacting the Program Director, Dr. Kathryn G. Miller at 314-935-7305, miller@wustl.edu or the program coordinator, Ms. Rochelle D. Smith at rsmith@wustl.edu.",
