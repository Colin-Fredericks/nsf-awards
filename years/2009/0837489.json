 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing undergraduate course materials in conservation science, combining scientific work with efforts to conserve biodiversity.  Conservation efforts typically draw on multiple disciplines (e.g. ecology, natural resources, sociology, communications, law, economics, and agriculture), integrating knowledge to guide actions that are jointly more effective in preserving diversity. Modern course materials need to be broader than traditional disciplinary specializations. Also,ideally, course materials for conservation science should be enlivened by activities that connect students to real world efforts to practice conservation and provide skills to work within a culturally-rich, international context. Hence, the course materials are being developed as internet-based and are being made available on a collaborative platform that connects undergraduate students from around the world to each other and to conservation scientists working in real world contexts. The materials are being presented through the development of ten dynamic multimedia case studies that are designed to include high-definition video, maps, text, web-links, Wiki, and audio files. These case studies are being designed so that they can be integrated into existing courses to facilitate their adoption. They are being presented on an updated version of ConservationBridge.org, a social networking system that facilitates communication and collaboration amongst students, educators, and practitioners.",
