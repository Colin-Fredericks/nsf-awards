The request is based on the research and training need for the instrument, the existing infrastructure to accommodate and maintain the instrument, and the institutional commitment for the long-term success of the instrument. A modern TEM capable of lattice imaging, digital programmability, tomography, diffraction, analytical microscopy, and scanning TEM, with remote access capability, would bring tremendous utility to funded and emerging research in South Dakota. The TEM will enable the research activities of faculty members in South Dakota and the Northcentral States region, and enhance the ability of state universities and tribal colleges to provide undergraduate and graduate research training, and K-12 and public outreach. The Engineering and Mining Experiment Station at SDSM&T is an established electron-microscopy characterization hub throughout the state and region, serving both academia and industry, and has the physical and managerial infrastructure in place to operate, maintain, and administer the equipment. A supporting document demonstrates the university's commitment to the acquisition, which includes laboratory renovation, staff, and infrastructure.",
