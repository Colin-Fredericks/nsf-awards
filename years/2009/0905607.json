 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed Concurrent Maude  ( DCMaude )  \r\n\r\nThe rewriting model of computation is simple , yet general and flexible . A system \r\nof any kind , for example , an algorithm , a database , a hardware system , a \r\nprogramming language , a network protocol , a sensor network , or the molecular \r\nbiology dynamics of a cell , can be modeled by a set of rewrite rules that \r\ndescribe the systems behavior . The rewriting model of computation is \r\nintrinsically concurrent , without any need for explicit concurrency constructs .  \r\nAny set of rules that apply to nonoverlapping system components can execute \r\nconcurrently . For a large distributed system such as a network or a cell , this \r\nmeans that at any given time thousands or millions of concurrent transitions may \r\nbe happening in parallel .  \r\n\r\nMaude is a language based on rewriting logic . The current Maude implementation \r\nprovides a high performance rewrite engine , as well as builtin search ,  \r\nunification , and model checking tools to support execution and analysis of \r\nsystems specified in Maude . To realize inherent concurrency of rewriting , the \r\nproposed project will develop an implementation of Maude called Distributed and \r\nConcurrent Maude  ( DCMaude ) that will exploit the concurrency available in \r\nmulticore/multiprocessor machines , and support distributed computing and systems \r\nprogramming . The rewriting semantics of Maude supports seamless transition \r\nbetween concurrent and distributed execution of a system : execution in one \r\nprocess , multiple processes/cores , or multiple machines . In addition to built in \r\nstrategies for concurrency , the design of DCMaude will include a means for the \r\nprogrammer to control concurrency at a high level of abstraction in a \r\ndeclarative way .  \r\n\r\nDC Maude will provide new methods and tools that can significantly improve both \r\nthe design and the implementation of open distributed systems , including \r\nweb-based systems and next-generation networks .",
