The collaborating scientists are Dr. Mostafa El-Sayed, at Georgia Institute of Technology and Dr. Hany el-Nazer, President, National Research Center (NRC) in Cairo. The ASI will focus on mixing the basic fundamental concepts of catalysis and surface science with the most recent advances and developments in the field of nanocatalysis and the new industrial and technological applications related to energy and environmental problems.\r\n The ASI will provide education and training for both U.S. and Egyptian advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Specifically it will: 1. bring 10 Professors and research leaders, 15 graduate students and 5 postdoctoral researchers from multi-disciplinary areas from the U.S. to participate with equal numbers of Egyptian graduate students and postdoctoral researchers over the 12-day ASI. Particular efforts will be directed to identify US members of minority groups to participate in this ASI. 2. make presentations to US and Egyptian students to learn a state-of-the-art, cutting edge important and exciting research dealing with the synthesis, characterization and applications of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials for innovative solutions to the energy, petrochemicals and environmental problems. 3. review the fundamental science dealing with nanoscale phenomena, have in-depth discussions on the utilization of state-of-the-art of technology in research and share information on new breakthroughs in nanocatalysis research for energy, petrochemicals and environmental applications 4. promote and stimulate collaboration in nanotechnology between American and Egyptian researchers with special attention paid to promoting women and African American researchers at the beginning of their careers in international collaboration in areas that have great impact on the World?s energy and environmental problems. 5. establish joint research projects between the participating US and Egyptian institutions, which could lead to economic developments involving the private sectors in Egypt and the US.  The synergism produced by bringing together the US and Egyptian students and researchers in nanostructured materials and nanotechnology is expected to enhance the scientific collaboration between the two countries which will take this field a step closer in realizing its enormous potential for novel nanotechnologies. \r\nIntellectual Merit: The ASI deals with a current and important topic of research with applications in energy, petrochemicals and environmental.  These are important, active areas of research, with many opportunities for increased fundamental understanding, and many important technological applications.  The planned series of lectures will thoroughly cover the field. The expected participants are eminent in their fields. This project will enable new collaborations between the US and the Egyptian researchers in fields that could lead to significant scientific advances and discoveries related to energy and environmental problems. This is expected to enhance the scientific knowledge in these and other related fields, and it may lead to new exciting technologies. \r\nBroader Impacts: The ASI will lead to engaging US graduate students and postdoctoral researchers including underrepresented groups in the international scientific enterprise. It will allow students and scientists from the U.S. and Egypt to exchange their experiences, ideas, and information and to build collaborations to promote nanotechnology for the benefit of the public and private sectors. It is likely that there will be new collaborations amongst the PIs in Egypt and the US, with particular emphasis given to young minorities.  There is strong possibility for young scientists to make international scientific connections early in their careers.  \r\n",
