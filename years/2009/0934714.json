 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program at the University of Vermont (UVM) in collaboration with Burlington and Milton High schools is to address the serious deficiency of highly qualified science teachers in the nation's high need schools by identifying and cultivating a total of 67 STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) undergraduate students and professionals who are interested in pursuing a secondary science teaching career. The program is based on innovative and culturally responsive science pedagogy combined with expertise in up-to-date scientific research and is being implemented in three parts. First, the program is providing 40 undergraduate freshman and sophomore STEM students with opportunities to conduct scientific research and explore science teaching as a career alongside scientists and science teachers through a 10 week summer science program. Second, the UVM Noyce Program is providing 12 junior and senior STEM undergraduates who are pursuing science teaching as a career with scholarships and opportunities to engage in professional internships and peer mentorship programs. Third, the UVM Noyce Program is supporting 15 STEM professionals to pursue coursework at UVM toward a Master of Arts in Teaching degree and secondary science teacher licensure.  The Noyce Program is recruiting a competitive pool of STEM undergraduates and professionals through marketing and advertising that is enticed by Noyce stipends and scholarship support. UVM's Noyce Program is seeking to develop and disseminate innovative pedagogical and mentorship practices that effectively recruit, educate and retain highly qualified and committed future science teachers.",
