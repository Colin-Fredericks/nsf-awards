An inquiry-based teaching approach will be used by fellows to guide 9th grade teachers and students in developing field sampling and spatial analysis skills to address critical ecological issues impacting the local Chesapeake Bay.  High school students will design and build field gear, sample local ponds and lakes, geospatially analyze (GIS) their results across the city?s landscape (Web-linked), and take their results into the neighborhoods surrounding these watersheds to encourage the businesses and residents to be aware of their actions on water-quality and make recommendations for improvement.  The GK-12 project is a partnership between Christopher Newport University, the five high schools of Newport News Public Schools (NNPS), the Engineering Department for the City of Newport News, and HR STORM, a committee of the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission.  \r\n\r\nThis project will set the stage for increased recruitment of minorities into science fields with the recruitment of Fellows from historically black colleges and universities and the prevalence (over 65%) of minority students in the participating high schools.  The project activities, tools and partnerships will be a model for other universities and communities to address local and regional environmental problems while educating their students and residents.      \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the time-period of this project (+6 years), 39 graduate fellows helped guide 48 high school and middle -school teachers along with their 1800 K-12 students in an inquiry-based teaching approach in which the students focused on water pollution issues impacting the Chesapeake Bay.   The graduate fellows assisted  K-12 teachers in the development of new science field and laboratory capabilities while providing their science expertise in the classroom every week over the course of a year.   The K-12 students were intimately involved in designing and building field gear used to sample local ponds and lakes near to their schools (while getting their feet wet!).  Aided by Web-based identification keys designed by CNU Fellows, the K-12 students examined the condition of their watersheds within the context of other schools\u00c6 data across the city\u00c6s landscape.  Fellows led targeted discussions with students on how to apply concepts of environmental stewardship within the urban landscape to improve the health of  their local waterways.    \n\n \n\nThe project established a strong link between our Master of Science degree program and the K-12 schools in two local cities.  Over the course of a year experience (with 1 to 2 classes every day throughout the school year), the fellows interaction with their K-12 students and teachers significantly improved their ability to communicate scientific concepts in different settings and audiences.   The fellows developed leadership and organizational skills in presenting science concepts and training their K-12 students and teacher in field sampling and data analysis.  The fellows developed a peer relationship with their students, sharing their own science research which piqued their student\u00c6s interest in scientific endeavors.  The demographic makeup of our GK-12schools (over 60% minority) tied to elevated student interest in science, sets the stage for an increase recruitment of these students into post-secondary STEM education.  Near the completion of the school year, tours of university research facilities and classrooms provided K-12 students a vision of their potential to attain a higher degree in the STEM disciplines.\n\nThe environmental data generated and outreach performed by this GK-12 program provided information to residences and officials to help manage and improve their local habitats. Hosting a website containing the GK12 project will assist our local and regional teachers to lead similar watershed research in their K-12 classrooms.     \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary J Whiting"
