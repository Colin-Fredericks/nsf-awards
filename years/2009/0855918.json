 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns the potential for real time monitoring of underwater soil compaction using a vibratory plate.  The hypothesis for this research is that real time monitoring of seabed soil compaction can be performed by using the measured vibration characteristics of the vibratory plate and de-coupling the soil skeleton and pore fluid stiffness components.  The research will involve participating in field testing near Chioggia, Italy to collect vibratory plate and in-situ pore water pressure data.  The field testing program is being conducted by the group overseeing the geotechnical work for the Venice lagoon restoration project.  Subsequent analysis of the data and modeling of the vibratory plate/soil system will seek to extract soil stiffness from the vibration data, explore the separation of the pore fluid and soil skeleton phases during interpretation of data, evaluate the influence of excess pore water pressure on stiffness measurement, and evaluate the influence of rocking modes that may exist in the field.  If successful, the findings hold considerable promise for advancement in construction quality control and expediency during off-shore land reclamation and surge protection barrier construction.  Real-time under-water compaction monitoring is not currently possible.  This basic research would potential enable this technology to be developed.  The research will broaden our network of partnerships particularly through this international collaboration.  The results will be disseminated through scholarly journals and conference proceedings.    \r\n\r\nThis research award will provide the PI and an American graduate student from CSM with a significant international experience, and the opportunity to become involved in a major international construction project.  The Office of International Science and Engineering encourages US investigators to form international collaborations such as this, and is co-funding this award. \r\n",
