 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cloud, radiation and precipitation processes are key components of the global water and energy cycle and operate on a wide range of time and space scales. Uncertainties in representing these processes and inadequate understanding of water and energy cycle have been long standing problems for most general circulation models (GCMs). This project aims to investigate the role of cloud, radiation and precipitation processes in the improved climate simulations of global water and energy cycle. The investigator will (a) evaluate modeled dynamic and thermodynamic fields against observations in diurnal and seasonal aspects of temperature, water vapor, cloud amount, liquid and ice water, radiative fluxes, precipitation and surface evaporation, (b) examine the impacts of revised convection closure assumption, triggering mechanism, convective momentum transport and subgrid cloud distribution on the simulations of climate mean state and variability, and (c) assess the water vapor budget and the top of the atmosphere and surface energy budgets during the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events in comparison with those under the normal climate conditions.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this work are educational and in improving understanding of physical processes for water and energy cycle in the climate system and representations of cloud and radiation processes in GCMs, which will enhance the credibility of climate prediction and climate change projections made by GCMs and thus benefit society.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCloud, radiation and precipitation are key components of the global water and energy cycle and operate on a wide range of time and space scales. Their representation in climate model is crucial for predicting global distribution of precipitation and climate variability such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The MJO is the dominant component of the intraseasonal (30&ndash;90 days) variability in the tropical atmosphere. The organized convection coupled with the large-scale circulation is a major feature of MJO with the moist convection initiating over the equatorial Indian Ocean and propagating eastward at a speed of ~5 m s-1 through the Pacific Ocean. There is considerable evidence showing the importance of the MJO in weather and climate (e.g., hurricane activity, U.S. West Coast flooding events, and El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation). But our ability of predicting the MJO is severely limited due to model misrepresentation of convective and cloud key to the MJO. Mostly based on the PI\u00c6s extensive research on convection and cloud, we made three major modifications to the climate model including the convection closure assumption, trigger condition of deep convection, and convective momentum transport. The general agreement of precipitation, cloud and radiation between climate model and observations enhance the credibility of the model for climate prediction. The modifications made in the convection scheme improve the simulations of MJO in many aspects including the amplitude, spatial distribution, eastward propagation, and horizontal and vertical structures, the coherent feature of eastward propagating convection and the precursor sign of convective center. The moist static energy builds up from the lower troposphere 15 to 20 days before the peak of MJO precipitation, and reaches the maximum in the middle troposphere near the peak of MJO precipitation.
