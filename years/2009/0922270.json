The facility will provide a one-stop shop for users at any experience level to obtain instrumentation, software, and instruction in the collection of earth surface data by Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR).   Existing TLS instruments will be made available for community use through UNAVCO.  Ancillary equipment and processing and visualization software would also be made available through the UNAVCO facility.  Development of software tools to establish standard workflows for taking users through all steps of obtaining high-quality surface data and visualizing results will be initiated.  Community education and outreach through the establishment of best practices for equipment and software use, the conduct of numerous classroom and field instructional sessions, and establishment of a data archive and retrieval portal will be supported.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The acquisition and analysis of field data is the cornerstone of the solid earth sciences and these data provide the context and content for most inquiries in geological sciences.  Geoscientists have traditionally collected these data by analog methods (e.g., pencil, pen, and paper).  A fully digital approach is critical, however, so that information is presented in a geospatially referenced frame for data transfer, scale and projection manipulation, and registration between datasets; this approach requires a cyberinfrastructure for the earth sciences.  Geoscientists of the future will collect field data in a digital environment, which will consist of: equipment for acquiring information in a digital and georeferenced format; software that allows seamless transfer, integration, and exploration of data, and; online processing for manipulation of large datasets generated or to be used in the field.  To implement the transition from the analog-dominated system of today to the digital future, the project developed a facility consisting of a pool of shared hardware and software supported with instruction by expert users.  This facility allows users to build and work in a digital environment that represents the earth\u00c6s surface/landscape in 3D with accuracy approaching the scale of a centimeter.\nINTERFACE has enhanced the community capacity to carryout state-of-the-art research by providing the infrastructure needed to support a rapidly growing reseach and educational community in the Earth sciences.  The INTERFACE facility successfuly developed the capacity for sustained community support of Terrestrial Laser Scanning technology through the National Science Foundation UNAVCO facility.  To this end, the INTERFACE project pioneered the development of (1) an improved content and access to the Terrestrail Lase Scanning knowledge base, (2) an expanded educational outreach capacity for students and researchers, and (3) long-term support activities that develop and improve best practices for data acquisition and processing\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John S Oldow"
