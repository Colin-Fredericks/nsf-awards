 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is the acquisition of a deposition tool for the precise sputtering of materials for the study of nanomagnetic computing systems, and a vibrating-sample magnetometer to determine their magnetic properties. The investigators have selected a sputtering system capable of depositing a variety of multilayers with excellent control, which comprises three separate chambers capable of RF/DC co-sputtering and plasma oxidation. The team of investigators will also acquire a vibrating-sample magnetometer/alternating-gradient magnetometer that is capable of generating hysteresis curves for these materials. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit - This equipment will be used for research on nanomagnetic logic. The Notre Dame group has pioneered magnetic quantum-dot cellular automata for digital logic, which are non-volatile, dense, low-power, radiation hard, and operate at room temperature. This new deposition system will allow the development of optimum magnetic materials, input/output structures based on magnetic tunnel junctions, and magnetically-yoked clocking wires.  This work offers the promise of all-magnetic information-processing systems, which combine memory and logic. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts - This equipment will enable advances in nanomagnetic logic, which is becoming an important topic within the larger context of nanoelectronics.  Moreover, this research has implications beyond magnetic logic since the study of magnetic stacks is relevant to commercial magnetic random-access-memory technology.  Laboratory experiences at both the undergraduate and graduate levels will be offered, with participants from both Notre Dame and elsewhere. Moreover, these tools will be used in summer experiences for teachers and their students. Special attention will be given to the Minority Engineering Program and the Society of Women Engineers.",
