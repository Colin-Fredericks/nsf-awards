 "awd_abstract_narration": "Habitat fragmentation is one of the most common causes of species decline and extinction, and the negative effects of fragmentation are predicted to increase as organisms attempt to track changing climates. The preservation and maintenance of landscape connectivity is thus a central priority for conservation. Habitat corridors - narrow strips of habitat connecting otherwise isolated patches of similar habitat - are a widely used to promote connectivity, but evidence supporting the efficacy of corridors has lagged behind their popularity in conservation management plans. Unfortunately, the science and the management of connectivity are still largely separate fields.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is designed to bridge this gap. The project is a large-scale experimental study of the impact of habitat corridors on two plant-animal interactions - insect herbivory and seed dispersal by birds - and the resulting impacts on plant fitness. Insect herbivory can be a primary determinant of plant reproductive success, and long distance seed dispersal by birds is crucial for the population growth of many plant species. The research uses an experimentally fragmented longleaf pine forest to expand and test a behavioral model that links seed dispersal to landscape connectivity, focusing on the influence of fruiting season (summer vs. winter) on disperser behavior, and the importance of these behavioral differences for long-distance seed dispersal down corridors.\r\n\t\r\nThis research extends an ongoing collaboration with the US Forest Service to promote restoration of longleaf pine forests, which are among the most endangered ecological communities in the US. It also addresses salient unanswered questions in conservation biology: how habitat corridors influence plant-animal interactions and ultimately plant fitness. The PhD student and lead scientist conducting this work have an exemplary track record communicating their research to a wide audience through public school teaching, media outreach, and mentoring talented new students.",
