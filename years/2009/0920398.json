 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing environmental threat to karst systems has led to increased research into subterranean ecosystems. However, this work has largely been restricted to subaerial ('dry') caves. Little research has been conducted in submerged caves, which, although difficult to access, represent unique windows into deeper groundwater environments. The objective of this research is to examine the diversity and distribution of microorganisms in these habitats using molecular genetic approaches and DNA sequence analysis. Through collaboration with the Cambrian Foundation, the PI will gain access to microbial samples from several previously unstudied submerged caves in Florida, Bermuda, and Mexico.  Simultaneous assessment of each sites' hydrology and groundwater geochemistry will provide the environmental context for interpreting these data. In addition to discovery of novel microbial species, the research will consider the biological and geological consequences of microbial activity in these ecosystems, filling a fundamental gap in our understanding of the microbiology and geochemistry of karst aquifers and their influence on groundwater chemistry. This has consequences for humans, in terms of contamination of drinking water supplies, and for the preservation of the unique and fragile ecosystems that thrive underground.\r\n\r\nAs part of her partnership with the Cambrian Foundation (Orlando, FL), the PI has developed an ambitious education and outreach program designed to increase public appreciation of these habitats. At the core of the outreach program is a unique experience called 'Human-Remotely-Operated-Vehicle' (ROV), which allows students to directly communicate, via video and two-way audio links, with an investigator in the underwater cave systems - allowing the students to experience this extreme environment from the safety of land. 'Top side' students also participate in a variety of activities designed to help them learn more about the biology and chemistry of these ecosystems.  In addition, the proposal includes opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student research, and requires supported students to participate in the local outreach activities by visiting K-12 classrooms and giving age-appropriate presentations about their research.",
