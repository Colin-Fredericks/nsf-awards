 "awd_abstract_narration": "Assuring deadlines of embedded tasks for contemporary multicore architectures is becoming increasingly difficult. Real-time scheduling relies on task migration to exploit multicores, yet migration actually reduces timing predictability due to cache warm-up overheads and increased interconnect traffic.\r\n\r\nThis work promotes a fundamentally new approach to increase the timing predictability of multicore architectures aimed at task migration in embedded environments making three major contributions:\r\n\r\n1. The development of novel strategies to guide migration based on cost/benefit tradeoffs exploiting both static and dynamic analyses.\r\n\r\n2. The devising of mechanisms to increase timing predictability under task migration providing explicit support for proactive and reactive real-time data movement across cores and their caches.\r\n\r\n3. The promotion of rate- and bandwidth-adaptive mechanisms as well as monitoring capabilities to increase predictability under task migration.\r\n\r\nThe work aims at initiating a novel research direction investigating the benefits of interactions between hardware and software for embedded multicores with respect to timing predictability.  This project fundamentally contributes to the research and educational infrastructure for the design and development of safety- and mission-critical embedded systems.",
