 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to develop an analog, in the homotopy\r\ncategory, of the category of mixed Tate motives which have proved to\r\nbe so important in recent developments in arithmetic geometry. The\r\ncentral idea is to replace the algebraic K-theory of the ring of\r\nintegers in the latter subject with Waldhausen's K-theory of the\r\nsphere spectrum. This would explain the appearance of zeta-values\r\nat odd positive integers in both the theory of motives, and as values\r\nof Igusa's Reidemeister invariants in differential topology.\r\n\r\n Certain values of Riemann's zeta function are widely conjectured to be \r\ntranscendental. These numbers have recently been shown [through work of\r\nConnes, Kreimer, and Marcolli] to play a central and unexpected role\r\nin the theoretical basis for the renormalization techniques fundamental\r\nto perturbative quantum field theory, but WHY they should be so important\r\nis quite mysterious. However, these same numbers are of fundamental\r\nimportance in other parts of mathematics, eg in arithmetic algebraic\r\ngeometry and in differential topology. Their role in algebraic geometry\r\nhas been rationalized by the development of a theory of `motives', and it\r\nseems likely that some version of these ideas can be extended to\r\ndifferential topology as well. The deep links between topological quantum\r\nfield theories and differential topology suggest that this\r\nwill lead to a new level of understanding of the geometric foundations\r\nof phyics.\r\n",
