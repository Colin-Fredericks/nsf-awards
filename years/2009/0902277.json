 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical. This project addresses fundamental materials science synthesis/processing research associated with the integration of high-speed electronics and highly functional sensors on flexible substrates. The primary approach is to explore ion-cutting as a means to transfer single crystalline III-V semiconductor layers onto flexible substrates. Current flexible electronics processes focus on deposited amorphous and/or polycrystalline Si on polymer substrates. Due to the limited tem-perature tolerance of polymers, the carrier mobility of these deposited layers is low and often un-acceptable for many applications even after subsequent laser annealing. The transfer research will focus on, but will not be limited to, the ion cutting technique. A major challenge is understanding ion damage, and how to reduce it in transferred layers. In this joint proposal, UCSD will focus on processing while ASU will focus on characterization. Anticipated benefits of the collaboration include: discovery of the fundamental mechanisms by which single crystalline III-V materials can be transferred to flexible substrates; and establishment of knowledge and expertise in the funda-mental mechanisms associated with synthesis/processing and characterization of devices fabri-cated from ion cut and layer transfer of semiconductor thin films. \r\nNon-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of elec-tronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. The approach is expected to have a significant impact on understanding and enabling future high mobility and optoelectronic devices on flexible substrates. Research will be integrated into class lectures and undergraduate research. The undergraduate students working on this project will be encouraged to participate in annual undergraduate research conferences: EUREKA at UCSD and Fulton Series at ASU. Wafer integration concepts will be introduced to students enrolled in the Freshman Seminar series entitled 'The Technological World' and students from the Preuss School, a public school (grades 6-12) located on the UCSD campus, will be invited to attend the seminar Series. An established collaboration with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, based on the complementary nature of the facilities at both institutions, and past fruitful efforts will be continued. An established col-laboration with African researchers supported by the USAMI, Princeton University will also be continued. Personnel will visit and work with US graduate students on day-to-day research ac-tivities. Additionally, graduate students will be involved in Science is Fun educational outreach with the City of Phoenix Head Start teachers to develop a bilingual, inquiry based curriculum for students and parents. This project will also develop age appropriate scientific demonstrations modules (Collecting Light with Photoconductors and I Like My Days and My Electronics Flexible) based on the benchmarks established by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",

Outcomes from this research will contribute to the growth of a new age of flexible technologies such as solar cells, solid-state lighting, health monitors and probes. Both graduate and undergraduate students who participated directly on this project are well trained and prepared to start productive academic or industrial careers.\n\nBroader Impact: Various aspects of the research programs were integrated into class lectures, national and international conferences. Hence, this research contributed the edification of the students and researcher locally and internationally.\n\nExploring Light and Photodetectors - PreK-K outreach activities shared concepts about light and photodetectors. Most activities were \"hands on.\" Another aim was for none of these materials to be of \"one-time use\" items, hence, the modules were sustainable.\n\n\n\n\"Science is Fun\" - An aspect of Exploring Light and Photodectors demonstration was broadened and content was increased to meet and exceed the State and National Standards for 8th grade students. Graduate and undergraduate students who dedicated their time to work with 8th grade students. Thousands of Phoenix area students, educators, parents, and professionals took part in one or more of the events facilitated by \"Science is Fun\" featuring the Exploring Light demonstration.\n\n\n\nFor many of the participants, one of these experiences was their first introduction to the notion of attending college and to the possibility of a career in- science and technology fields.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Terry L Alford"
