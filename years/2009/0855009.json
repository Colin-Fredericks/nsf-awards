 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Evaluation of the Principles of High-Pressure Torsion for Producing Nanostructured Materials\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL: The processing of metals by severe plastic deformation (SPD) is attracting attention within the materials science community. This type of processing involves introducing a large number of dislocations into the sample by imposing intense strain but without incurring any change in the cross-sectional dimensions of the work-piece. The primary advantage of SPD processing is that it can lead to significant grain refinement without the introduction of residual porosity or contamination. The ultrafine-grained materials processed by SPD exhibit exceptionally high strength and improved toughness at ambient temperatures together with the potential for achieving rapid superplastic forming capabilities at elevated temperatures. This grant is concerned with SPD processing using high-pressure torsion (HPT) where materials are subjected to very high pressures under concurrent torsional straining. Preliminary results around the world demonstrate that HPT processing offers advantages over other SPD techniques because it leads to a smaller grain size often within the nanometer range. This research program addresses fundamental areas of HPT processing: (1) the factors involved in developing homogenization within the material; (2) the significance of apparent saturation grain sizes; (3) the formulation of procedures for overcoming the problem of higher strength accompanied by lower ductility; and (4) the potential for achieving improved mechanical properties by combining HPT with other processing techniques. NON-TECHNICAL: The program trains one graduate student and one post-doc in research methodology and provides opportunities for interactions with other researchers through national and international collaborations. These collaborations involve numerous visitors coming to USC either for a few days or for long-term appointments. Special attempts are made to incorporate members of under-represented groups into the program. Undergraduate students are involved through the development of semester-long projects offered within the Senior Projects Laboratory for students graduating in Mechanical Engineering. Local high school students and their teachers are exposed to the research activities through regular poster presentations and special activities such as the annual USC Open Day during which the campus is open to members of the local community. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe grain size is the most important structural parameter in polycrystalline materials.  It determines basic properties such as strength at room temperature and flow behavior under load at high temperatures.  Conventional themo-mechanical procedures are used to achieve small grain sizes but generally these grains have sizes of at least a few micrometers.  Over the last two decades, procedures have become available for processing metals so that the grains become very small.  These procedures are based on the principle of using severe plastic deformation (SPD) so that many dislocations are introduced into the material and these dislocations can then re-arrange to give a high density of grain boundaries.  One of the most successful SPD processes is High-Pressure Torsion (HPT) where it is feasible to achieve both submicrometer grain sizes (grains having sizes of less than 1 &micro;m) and nanometer grain sizes where the grains are smaller than 0.1 &micro;m (100 nm).  These processed materials exhibit both excetionally high strength and a capability for use in superplastic forming operations at high temperatures.\n\nIn HPT processing, the sample is in the form of a thin disk and it is placed between massive anvils and subjected to a high imposed pressure and concurrent torsional straining.  Special facilities are needed to conduct this type of processing and at present the University of Southern California has one of the few facilities of this type (perhaps the only such facility) in the United States.  In the period of this NSF grant, we have conducted HPT processing on a very wide range of materials including pure metals such as aluminum and copper, various Al and Cu alloys, a duplex steel and bulk metallic glasses.  The results from these experiments show that, as anticipated, the hardness in the central region of the disk is initially quite low and the hardness around the edge is high.  However, there is a gradual evolution towards a good homogeneous microstructure with increasing straining and ultimately it is possible to attain a highly homogeneous structure.  We have conducted additional experiments to evaluate the level of homogeneity attained in the through-thickness of the disks and we have shown that there is excellent homogeneity in face-centered cubic metals such as pure aluminum but there is a high degree of heterogeneity in hexagonal close-packed metals such as magnesium alloys.  These results have important implications for the future use of this technology in industrial applications.  For example, disks processed by HPT are currently under consideration for use in micro-devices and in applications in the electronics industry.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Terence G Langdon"
