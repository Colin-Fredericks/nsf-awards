These preliminary data represent the first direct observation of amyloid nucleation, and working towards a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms governing nucleation, growth, and self-healing properties of these nanomaterials is essential for advancing their potential use as functional, rationally-designed platforms for molecular self-assembly. A model system has been developed in which fluorescent peptides are incorporated into the highly ordered assemblies, and these constructs provide a unique opportunity to deepen understanding of the fundamental pathways for assembly. By combining this well defined and structurally characterized model system with state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy, the research plan has the capability to dramatically advance understanding of these materials. Specifically, it is proposed to apply fluorescence imaging, lifetime imaging, fluctuation spectroscopy, and photobleaching measurements to define amyloid nucleation, elongation and growth as well as the self-healing properties of amyloid nanotubes. The focus will be: Aim 1: Amyloid nucleation.  Characterize aggregate structures, structural changes, and associated kinetics involved in amyloid nucleation. These measurements will exploit the experimental model system which has uncovered the first direct observation of amyloid nucleation. Aim 2: Nanotube elongation and growth.  Directly observe elongation kinetics and make quantitative measurements of single assembly growth rates to better characterize propagation processes. These measurements can determine whether growth is uni- or bidirectional, and coupled with lifetime microscopy can determine whether mature structures are directly assembled or result from relaxation processes following initial assembly. Aim 3: Peptide exchange and self healing of amyloid structures. Useful nanoscale biomaterials require self-healing capabilities, by which damaged regions can reassemble or self-repair. Initial evidence suggests amyloid structures possess this capability. This aim focuses on detailed experiments that are required to understand the self-repair mechanisms.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The proposed studies represent a collaborative effort of the Berland (Department of Physics) and Lynn (Department of Chemistry) labs at Emory University. The interdisciplinary nature of the research provides the opportunity for new training opportunities, both within the Emory community and beyond. A strength of the teaching and research collaboration is that the students are trained in the physical spectroscopy, chemical synthesis, and the analysis techniques necessary to work on interdisciplinary research topics. The co-PI organizes a series of freshman seminar courses called ?Origins of ORDER? (On Recent Discoveries by Emory Researchers) that introduce undergraduate students to cutting edge research. The PI and a recent postdoctoral associate have developed materials for this course, which were used to teach freshmen about fluorescence and fluctuations, and their applications in modern research.  Both PIs for this proposal have a history of supervising undergraduate research projects, providing academic year and summer student training each year.  Beyond the Emory community both PIs have also used the research laboratory to share enthusiasm and excitement for scientific research with those outside the University, including interacting with researchers from other institutions as well as high school students and high school teachers. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project was a highly successful collaboration between the Berland and Lynn labs.  Together, the two labs have developed novel quantitative optical microscopy assays to study amyloid nucleation and growth, and have applied these techniques to study a variety of amyloid nanotube forming peptides and mixtures of peptides.  These studies have led to exciting new insights into the science of amyloid forming proteins.  Significant results include:\n\n \n\n1)    The role of interfaces in amyloid nucleation:  One of the major challenges in amyloid research involves defining the earliest events in the nucleation pathway, and direct evidence about nucleation has remained elusive.  In our research, we have successfully mapped out the role of interfaces in the earliest nucleation events, providing unambiguous evidence that air water interfaces play a critical role in the formation of amyloid self-assembly pathways.  This finding has highlighted important potential control mechanisms for development of amyloid based functional nanomaterials.  It has also provided a mechanism to directly observe (previously elusive) intermediate structures on the pathway from peptide monomers to assembled nanotubes. \n\n \n\n2)    Quantitative Microscopy Reveals Structural Heterogeneity: We have employed a variety of quantitative imaging tools to investigate nucleation and growth, and to map out self-assembly pathways.  Of particular interest is the use of fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM), which measures the average amount of time fluorescent molecules remain in an excited state after laser excitation, before emission of fluorescence photons.  The lifetime is highly sensitive to the nanoscale local environment of the fluorescent molecule, which changes dramatically as peptides move from monomers in solution to peptide aggregates, to nucleating seeds, and finally to amyloid nanostructures.  The use of FLIM microscopy has thus allowed us to map out previously unobservable self assembly pathways.  We believe our observations will clarify some of the longstanding questions in amyloid research, and will also provide important insights into control points for use of amyloid peptides as functional nanomaterials.   Also of interest, we have used FLIM to identify significant structural heterogeneity in amyloid nanotubes, with the surprising but exciting finding that different structures are capable of \"self-propagating\", meaning once a particular structural pattern is achieved any subsequent growth tends to adopt the same structural conformation. \n\n \n\n3)    Development of novel spectroscopy tools:  A final important and impactful result of this project was the full development of tau-fcs (TFCS), a new approach to quantitative molecular spectroscopy in complex environment.  Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) has proven to be a highly valuable research tool to investigate molecular dynamics, interactions, and concentration in complex samples.  However, limitations of FCS methods restricted their applicability for some of the most important questions in nanomaterials research.  We have now fully developed a new conceptual approach to apply FCS methods, and have demonstrated experimentally that this approach (TFCS) is exceptionally effective.  TFCS measurements have dramatically enhanced sensitivity and resolution when compared with standard FCS measurements.  The new capabilities developed from this project will be of significant importance for future amyloid research.  Moreover, these developments will be of significant interest to the broader biological, biomedical, and biomaterials research communities &ndash; with greatly enhanced capabilities to fully resolve the composition of complex molecular mixtures. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Keith M Berland"
