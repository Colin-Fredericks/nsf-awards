 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\n\r\nThe project is developing computer interfaces and new curricula to provide students in introductory renewable energy courses with an interactive, Web-based laboratory using state-of-the-art photovoltaic systems and monitoring equipment. The project team is preparing learning modules for a photovoltaic test facility at the NASA Ames Research Center to enable students to control the azimuth and elevation of a tracking photovoltaic panel to optimize its power output based on real-time measurements of the panels current and voltage. They also are planning additional research making use of nanotechnology, such as quantum wires and dots, allowing students to compare their performance to that achieved with commercial technology. To support the laboratory experience, the investigators are writing Java applets and graphical user interfaces that provide online tutorials and automated feedback tools to measure student learning. By partnering with a two-year Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), they are testing the approach in a different academic setting.  An independent evaluator is providing formative and summative studies to determine how well the students understand the relationship between the measured environmental factors and generator performance. The investigators are disseminating their materials and results through a webpage, tagged with descriptive metadata and linked to the NSDL, and through presentations and publications in the area of undergraduate education. Broader impacts include the partnership with the HSI, the dissemination of the materials, and outreach activities using an existing K-12 program.",
