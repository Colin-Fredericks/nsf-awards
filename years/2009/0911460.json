 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Marcus Weck of New York University who will establish basic design principles for side-chain induced folding processes in random coil polymers. In particular, two classes of interactions will be explored as inducing elements, donor-acceptor interactions and chiral induction. The proposed research will also create polymeric materials with well-defined three-dimensional architectures. Rationally designed side-chain functionalized homo- and co-polymers based on ring-opening metathesis polymerizations (ROMP) are the basis for the proposed study. The next generation of complex, diverse, and highly functionalized polymers will be based on self-assembled 3D architectures and will be useful for a variety of applications including electro-optical, biological, energy, and computer applications. However, basic design principles that would allow for the programmed design, synthesis, and optimization of such materials are not available. The proposed work would allow for the development of such design principles. Furthermore, the design principles that will be developed are not only relevant to the proposed side-chain polymers but can also be translated potentially to biopolymers, main-chain polymers and oligomers. Finally, the outcome of the proposed studies will also allow for the development of new synthetic methodologies in polymer science.\r\n\r\nThe research by Professor Weck could have a significant impact on materials science as it will provide novel polymers to address some key questions from folding, to aggregation, to catalyst design. These can lead to possible uses of the  resulting polymers in biological, electro-optical, computer and energy  industries. The proposed research will be used as an education and outreach tool to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, to initiate an interdisciplinary polymer curriculum at his institution, and to offer workshops to introduce polymer chemistry to faculty at undergraduate institutions. The workshops present basic concepts and experiments on how to incorporate polymer science into the chemistry curricula. Finally, the PI has extensive collaborations with industry on polymer-related problems, transferring knowledge to the private sector, and bringing his science to the marketplace. \r\n",
