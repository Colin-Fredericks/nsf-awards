Its principal goal is the investigation of the\r\ndynamical and geometric structures of \"higher rank\" systems in\r\nthese areas.  These systems also appear naturally in seemingly\r\nquite separate areas such as number theory. The investigator will\r\nstudy rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and\r\nsemi-simple Lie groups and their lattices with the ultimate goal\r\nof classifying such systems under suitable geometric or dynamical\r\nhypotheses. In particular, he will study higher rank hyperbolic\r\nabelian actions on tori and Cartan actions of rank 2.  These\r\nspecial cases, important in their own right, will serve as\r\ntesting ground for more general conjectures. Also, additional\r\ntools for classification are available in these cases.  The\r\ninvestigator will also study actions by semi-simple groups and\r\ntheir lattices preserving affine and other geometric structures.\r\nIn addition, he will analyze Riemannian manifolds (especially\r\nhigher rank ones) and their geodesic flows. Geometric, dynamical\r\nand group theoretic tools will be used in this research.\r\n\r\nDynamical systems and ergodic theory investigate the evolution of\r\na physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in a\r\nfluid flow).  New ideas and concepts such as chaos and fractals\r\nhave changed our perception of the world fundamentally. Dynamics\r\nand ergodic theory provide the mathematical tools and analysis\r\nfor these investigations. Dynamical systems have had a major\r\nimpact on the sciences and engineering. Symbolic dynamics for\r\ninstance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe\r\ncodes for computer science.  Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics\r\nare used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology.  Geometry\r\nis one of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally studies\r\ncurves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their\r\nshapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.\r\nDifferential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now\r\nstudied for its close ties with physics and other sciences and\r\napplied areas (computer vision e.g.) as well as internal\r\naesthetic reasons. Geometry and dynamics are closely related as\r\nsome important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and\r\ngeometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems. One main\r\ngoal of this project studies when two dynamical systems commute,\r\ni.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by\r\nthe other. Important examples of such systems arise from\r\ngeometry.\r\n",
