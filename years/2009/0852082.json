Brown\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThis three-year REU site program at the University of Hawaii will provide research experiences for ten undergraduate students each year in the area of Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) using High Performance Computing (HPC).  The primary objectives of the program are to: (1) introduce engineering undergraduates to HPC applications in engineering; (2 provide research experiences for students that are unlikely to have such experiences (3) advance the research in Mechanical and Civil Engineering through the students' projects, and (4) encourage more students, especially from underrepresented groups to pursue graduate studies and careers in engineering.  \r\n\r\nFirst, the students will participate in overview and introductory lectures to lay the theoretical foundations, coupled with hands-on tutorials using commercial CFD software.  Working in teams with their mentors, the students will carry out advanced applications of CFD in the area of tsunami impact on structures, thermal-fluid modeling of heat sinks, and tsunami modeling.  They will also have the opportunity to work with top-of-the-line supercomputers at the Arctic Region Supercomputer Center (ARSC) as well as on local computers, working on some of the most advanced engineering problems in today's research environment.  The program will culminate with students' making presentations of their work, in a conference format, to their mentors and peers and other invited guests. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this REU Site arise from the participation of undergraduate students who are underrepresented minorities in engineering and science. The involvement of these students in exciting research in Computational Fluid Dynamics using High Performance Computing enhances the likelihood that they will consider post-graduate study and broaden the base of the Nation's technical manpower.  Results of the research will be disseminated at conferences, (i.e. ASME Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering Conference, ASCE/SEI Structures Congress, International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE Symposia) and ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE) and in several journals (i.e. International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, ASME Journal of Heat Transfer, ASCE Structures Journal, etc.).\r\n",
