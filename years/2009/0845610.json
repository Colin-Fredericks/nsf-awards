 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cryptographic hash functions are ubiquitous in modern cryptography.\r\nThey are an integral part of digital signature and public-key\r\nencryption schemes, access control mechanisms, digital time-stamping\r\nroutines, message authentication codes, and file synchronization\r\nutilities. They are implemented in point-of-sale terminals, ATM\r\nmachines, operating systems, web browsers, routers, and mobile phones,\r\nto name just a few.  Yet the design and analysis of hash functions has\r\nreceived relatively little attention from the cryptographic community,\r\na shortcoming underscored by recent high-profile attacks on the\r\noften-used MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to advance our understanding of cryptographic hash\r\nfunctions in theory and practice by developing three complementary\r\nthemes.  First, it further solidifies the formal foundations of\r\nhashing.  This means establishing new and meaningful notions of what\r\nmeans for a hash function to be \"good\".  Additionally it explores the\r\npowers and limitations of new analytic frameworks (for example,\r\nindifferentiability and human-ignorance), and search for a sharper\r\nview of design heuristics (in particular the random-oracle and\r\nideal-cipher models.)  Second, it investigates the design of \"small\"\r\nhash functions, called compression functions, with small domains and\r\nfixed ranges.  Designs based on permutations, blockciphers and\r\ntweakable blockciphers are especially interesting.  Third, it develops\r\nmethods for transforming compression functions into \"big\" hash\r\nfunctions with flexible domains and ranges; traditionally, the range\r\nof a hash function is a string of a single fixed length.  Also\r\ntargetted is the problem of combining the outputs of multiple\r\nprimitives for the purpose of security preservation in the presence of\r\nfaults.",
