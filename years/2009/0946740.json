 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe objective of this EAGER project is to explore a novel concept -  shape memory alloy (SMA) z-pinned sandwich with an integrated, grid stiffened shape memory polymer (SMP) based syntactic foam core for healing impact damage autonomously, repeatedly, and efficiently. In this study, SMA z-pins will be used to achieve autonomous programming and transverse confinement of the SMP foam core. The following will be conducted: (1) select a compatible SMA and SMP pair so that the designed functionality can be achieved; (2) fabricate SMA z-pinned hybrid smart sandwich panel; (3) conduct programming; (4) conduct repeated low-strain rate impact test and self-healing test; and (5) determine the residual strength and self-healing efficiency. \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to the integration of research results into education, graduate student mentoring, involvement of student in lab experiments and curriculum development at both Louisiana State University (LSU) and Southern University (SU).  It will enhance the research and education infrastructure by reforming syllabi of composite materials classes. One graduate student will be directly involved in this project. The opportunities for under-represented minorities will be promoted by directly exposing minority students to this research through seminars and class teaching.",
