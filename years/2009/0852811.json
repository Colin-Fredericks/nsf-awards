 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe research proposed centers on investigations of the structures of sets and\r\nfunctions ordered by relative complexity of computation. Particular emphasis\r\nwill be placed on issues of definability and automorphisms. Also included in\r\nthis area is the analysis of the relations between the difficulty of computing\r\nfunctions and other issues such as rates of growth, complexity of their\r\ndefinitions in arithmetic and the strength of axiom systems needed to prove\r\ntheir existence (reverse mathematics). The emphasis in reverse mathematics\r\nwill be on analyzing basic combinatorial, model theoretic and set-theoretic\r\nprinciples that seem to lie outside the scope of the standard theories\r\nstudied. In addition, a new approach to the issue of classifying the\r\ncomplexity of mathematical constructions based on computability theoretic\r\nnotions will be developed. This approach should allow applications to\r\nuncountable and higher order structures that are either out of reach of\r\ncurrent approaches or (as in the case of analysis on the real numbers) only\r\nhandled through coding into countable structures.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project includes research into a broad range of topics in\r\ncomputability theory and logic both theoretical and applied to other areas of\r\nmathematics and computer science. At the foundational level, this work will\r\nilluminate the nature of relative complexity of computation, the strength of\r\naxioms needed to prove standard mathematical theorems and the relations\r\nbetween these areas. In practical terms, results in this area (computable\r\nmathematics and model theory as well as reverse mathematics) at times indicate\r\nthat there are no algorithms for certain important tasks or that more\r\ninformation than might have been expected is needed to write programs\r\ncalculating the desired results. The work related to automata theory and\r\nautomatic structures is based on a very resource-limited model of computation\r\nthat is often relevant to practical computing problems. The theoretical and\r\nfoundational analysis of structures whose basic relations and functions are\r\ncomputable by such automata should also eventually be of practical\r\nsignificance. The primary focus in the most applied areas to be investigated\r\nwill be the logical and mathematical foundations of hybrid (continuous and\r\ndiscrete) control theory as well as the practical implementation of algorithms\r\nfor these subjects based on the theoretical work being done. Here the issue is\r\nto understand how to mathematically model systems that include both digital\r\n(discrete) input and logical constraints as well as analog (continuous)\r\ninformation and constraints.",
