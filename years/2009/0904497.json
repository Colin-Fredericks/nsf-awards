 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\r\n(Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe problem of providing seamless, integrated querying over multiple\r\ninterrelated sources of information has been plaguing the database,\r\ninformation management, information retrieval, and artificial\r\nintelligence research communities for decades. There have been\r\nsuccessful lines of research addressing specific components of the\r\ndata integration problem, and large \"one-off\" systems have been built\r\nthat successfully integrate specific information sources in specific\r\ndomains. However, a completely general solution to the data\r\nintegration problem is thought not to be realizable.\r\n\r\nThe investigator is developing a new type of information integration\r\nsystem that is both novel and realizable. It is based on the following\r\npremises and components.\r\n\r\n1) The system provides a general data integration solution targeted\r\nfor a certain type of environment: when multiple sources have joining,\r\noverlapping, and potentially conflicting information about the same or\r\nclosely related real-world entities.\r\n\r\n2) The system permits and exploits uncertainty as an integral part of\r\ndata integration: Uncertainty may be present in source data, source\r\nschemata, the integration process, integrated schemata, and integrated\r\ndata. In fact, uncertainty can play a key role successful information\r\nintegration.\r\n\r\n3) The system relies on general-purpose entity-resolution as a\r\nfundamental building block of the integration process and the\r\nintegrated information. Furthermore, the system retains both the\r\nuncertainty and the lineage associated with the entity-resolution\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n4) The system incorporates powerful lineage capabilities, tracking\r\nwhere, when, and how data was produced, how it has evolved over time,\r\nand how it has been combined and manipulated as part of the\r\nintegration process. Lineage is used to enhance the integration\r\nprocess, and it is offered to the end-user in a variety of forms for\r\ndata understanding and conflict-resolution purposes.\r\n\r\nFurther information on the project can be found at the project web\r\npage: http://infolab.stanford.edu/udi/\r\n",
