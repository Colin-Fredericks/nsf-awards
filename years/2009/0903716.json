The Developing American Indian Secondary Educators Project (DAISE) will initiate a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Science education degree program. The five objectives of the DAISE Project are:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Develop and implement a high quality, culturally competent,  sustainable \r\n2. Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education degree program at SKC \r\n3. Increase the number of American Indian  secondary science and math  teachers. \r\n4. Improve coordination of student services between high schools and SKC. \r\n5. Increase the number of American Indian high school students completing higher level STEM coursework. \r\n6. Enhance the SKC faculty, curriculum and infrastructure to enable better  support for American Indian students.",
