 "awd_abstract_narration": "Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for the Ceramic, Composite and Optical Materials Center \r\n\r\n0934300 Clemson University; Dennis Smith \r\n0934258 Rutgers University; Richard Haber \r\n\r\nThe Center for the Ceramic, Composite and Optical Materials Center (CCOMC) will focus on providing a broader range of relevant technologies critical to materials-based companies. Clemson University and Rutgers University are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with Clemson University as the lead institution. \r\n\r\nThe Center for Ceramic Research (CRC) at Rutgers University, a past member of an ending NSF I/UCRC for Ceramic and Composite Materials Center, proposes to join with the Center for Optical Material Science and Engineering Technologies (COMSET) at Clemson University to form the proposed new Center (CCOMC) with new technological thrusts. COMSET has developed a strong industrial base, with three spin-off companies that, combined with Rutgers University, would provide a new and unique research program. The proposed Center (CCOMC) will focus on five thrust areas including ceramic materials and processing, nanoparticulates and processes, opaque and transparent armor ceramics, optical material synthesis and processing, and materials for energy conversion. The proposed research program across the five thrust areas will be carried out by an interdisciplinary group of faculty and across different academic disciplines. The PIs are well-qualified and have adequate resources to conduct the proposed research. Both institutions in this Center plan to use the NSF planning grant fund to hold a meeting with prospective industrial partners to establish the proposed Center's organizational framework, and to establish research projects of greatest relevance. \r\n\r\nThe proposed center (CCOMC) has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US manufacturing by developing new technologies in the ceramic, optic and composite material field. CCOMC has plans in place for involving under-represented groups, to recruit highly qualified faculty and graduate students, and to motivate undergraduate students through unique research experiences and fellowships. Results will be disseminated through semi-annual meetings, publications, and a website for information, results and accomplishments. CCOMC will continue to integrate research and education; and by providing hands-on experience to students, the Center will attempt to motivate students to go beyond common approaches towards learning by hands-on experiences in state-of-the-art facilities focusing on today's relevant materials issues.",
