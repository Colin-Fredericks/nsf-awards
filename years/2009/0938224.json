 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has been awarded a grant to support student and postdoctoral participation in the 6th Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Symposium (BIOT-2009) that will be held October 9-10, 2009 in Lincoln, Nebraska. BIOT-2009 will showcase research and development activities in bioinformatics and computational biology as well as biotechnology, and promote future interdisciplinary activity and research in these areas. The symposium attracts papers and contributions from all over the US and internationally. The conference will energize multidisciplinary interactions among different fields including active discussions between computer scientists and scientists from biology and biotechnology. It will ignite collaborations among different fields, among different states in this region, and between academia and industry. \r\n\r\nBIOT-2009 presents a unique opportunity for students and postdocs interested in research in bioinformatics and biotechnology. To maximize the benefit accruing to those supported, each student and postdoc will present a poster on their research at a special conference session that will receive comment from members of the BIOT-2009 program committee. This activity will integrate graduate students and postdocs into the community by providing them with a forum to talk to the leading researchers in the field about their research. The poster format encourages the student and postdoc participants to begin building a rapport with established researchers. This nurturing effort should pay dividends by more effectively guiding them in this rapidly changing research field. \r\n\r\nAdditional information about the conference and student involvement can be found at http://www.biotconf.org/.\r\n",
