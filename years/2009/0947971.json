Mr. Alexander's participation was suggested by the Arctic Social Sciences and Documenting Endangered Languages Program Directors as an excellent step toward facilitating Mr. Alexander's interests in and efforts toward documenting the Gwich'in language. \r\n\r\nThe conference will assist Mr. Alexander in developing a program for the Gwich'in language in the Yukon Flats and Northeastern regions of Alaska, as well as Canada. The conference will expose Mr. Alexander to other indigenous scholars working with their endangered languages, documentation practices and tools, as well as educational program that he can bring back and apply to the villages in his region.",
