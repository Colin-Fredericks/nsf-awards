 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project explores materials science of high indium content InGaN and InN semiconductors for high-efficiency solar cells and thermoelectric applications. Fundamental studies of metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth of InN and high In-content InGaN (with In>50%) alloys on sapphire and silicon (111) substrates will be conducted. The investigations include the use of alternative precursor (Dimethyl-hydrazine), pulsed MOCVD, InN-GaN superlattices along with various types of characterization to evaluate the potential for solar cell and thermoelectric applications, and to further basic understanding of the doping mechanism for p-InN and p-InGaN semiconductors.\r\nNon-technical: This project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. High-efficiency solar photovoltaic cells have broad potential impact on economy and human life through more efficient electrical energy generation. Thermoelectric materials provide important solutions for device cooling and heat recycling and for electrical power generation. The project allows graduate and undergraduate students to be trained in a multidisciplinary research environment, encompassing the physics of semiconductor, optoelectronics materials and devices, materials science and MOCVD epitaxy, physics of semiconductor nanostructures, and semiconductor device design and fabrication. Graduate students also serve as mentors for undergraduate students conducting independent studies in the PI's lab. Outreach activities focusing on grade 5th - 9th female and underrepresented minority students are included to raise their interest in science and engineering.\r\n",
