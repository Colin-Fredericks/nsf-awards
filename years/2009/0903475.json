 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-part proposal. In the first part, the limit order book of an electronic exchange will be modeled as a queueing system, evolving as a measure-valued process, where the measure in question is the set of order sizes located on the price axis. Like many queueing systems, the evolution of the order book at the level of discrete orders is prohibitively complex. Therefore, the theory of heavy traffic limits for queueing systems will be used to obtain continuous approximations to the discrete systems. In the second part of the proposal, models for asset price volatility will be developed. Local volatility models currently in use describe volatility as a function of time and the underlying asset price. We propose to extend this concept to models in which volatility is a function of time, the underlying asset price, and one or more factors that determine the payoff of derivative securities written on the underlying asset. The third part of the proposal continues work on optimal investment and consumption in the presence of transaction costs. These problems are well understood and there are closed-form solutions in cases where transaction costs are zero, but there are no closed-form solutions in the more realistic case when transaction costs are positive.\r\nIt is proposed to develop asymptotic expansions in the small transaction cost parameter of the unknown solution around the zero-transaction-cost known solution.\r\n\r\nIn overview, it is proposed to build mathematical models designed to reduce risk and increase efficiency in financial markets. Innovations in the financial markets have changed their structure, and analysis needs to keep pace. In particular, the advent of order-driven electronic exchanges has spawned the growth of algorithmic trading, whereby firms trade large quantities of assets quickly. Does this make markets liquid? Does it dampen or amplify volatility? It is difficult to answer these questions because we do not have good mathematical models for these exchanges. Neither can we predict with any accuracy how various order-matching protocols on these exchanges will affect volatility, bid-ask spreads, and general market efficiency. A major part of this proposal is the development of mathematical models for electronic exchanges. A second aspect of this proposal is to improve mathematical models for asset price volatility. The celebrated Black-Scholes model assumes that volatility is constant, but departures from this assumption in financial markets are too significant to ignore. The third part of this proposal is to better understand the effect of transaction costs on problems of optimal investment and consumption. This problem is at the heart of equilibrium analysis of financial markets, but most studies to date make the unrealistic assumption that transaction costs are zero.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research supported by this grant focussed on trading\nof financial securities.  Two outcomes are described here.\nThe first concerns a quantification of\nthe effect of escrowing the performance bonuses of\ntraders.  The second is\nthe development of a mathematical model for trading\non electronic exchanges.\n\nBefore the 2008 financial crisis, major investment banks\nroutinely paid their traders a year-end performance bonus that\nwas sometimes more than half their compensation for the year.\nThis bonus was to some degree based on the amount of income\nthe trader had earned for his or her employer during\nthat year.  Since the financial crisis, firms that employ\ntraders have reduced the size of these bonuses.  They have\nalso placed significant fractions of the bonus in escrow,\nand the trader can withdraw this money only\nafter additional years pass and his or her performance\ncontinues to be meritorious.  It is believed that this\naligns the traders incentives more closely with those of\nthe firm.\n\nAn outcome of the research supported by this grant was\nto show that the practice of escrowing bonuses might or might \nnot align the trader's incentives more closely with those \nof the firm.  The key factor is the patience of the firm.  If \nthe firm cares more about showing its stakeholders \na quick return on investment, then escrowing bonuses\nmakes the trader too conservative and works against this\ngoal. In contrast, a firm that wants to show steady profits over\nthe long term should escrow bonuses so that the trader\nalso adopts a longer term view of profitability.  The\nprecise trade-offs can be quantified in terms of\nthe risk aversion of the trader and the degree to which\nthe firm values present profits over future profits.\n\nThe second outcome of the research is a better understanding\nof the evolution of limit-order books that govern\ntrading on electronic exchanges.  Over the past 25 years\ntrading of stocks and many other securities \nhas moved from open outcry exchanges\nto electronic exchanges, where orders are matched by computer.\nMarket orders are executed immediately at the best price\navailable.  Limit orders specify a price at which the\nagent submitting the order wants the order to execute,\nand since there is usually no one immediately\nwilling to take the other side of these trades at the\nspecified prices, these orders are queued for later\nexecution or cancellation.  The limit-order book is\nthe collection of queued orders.  These are characterized\nby direction (buy or sell), time of arrival,\ndesired price, and size of order.  For liquidly traded\nassets, changes in the limit-order book occur every\nfew milliseconds.\n\nUnder the open outcry system for trading securities,\n\"specialists\" held seats on the exchange and were charged\nto \"make the market liquid\" in whatever asset they\nwere assigned.  They received orders,\nmatched buyers and sellers, and sometimes bought or sold\nfor their own accounts in order to facilitate trading.\nBecause they could see the order flow, they could often\ndetect upward or downward pressure on prices and could\ntrade their own accounts to benefit from that.  For this\nreason, seats on the exchange were highly prized.\n\nThere are no seats on electronic\nexchanges.  The specialists have been replaced to some\nextent by high frequency traders, agents who submit\nand often cancel orders within fractions of seconds.  These\ntraders argue that they provide liquidity.  Other\ntraders on the exchange are not so sure that high\nfrequency traders offer a net benefit.\n\nBecause electronic exchanges are a recent phenomenon,\nthe construction of mathematical models to describe\ntheir behavior is in its infancy.  Consequently, it\nis difficult to pose and answer precise questions about\nthe effect of different trading protocols.  Do the high\nfrequency traders provide a net benefit to others trading\non an exchange?  Would a transaction tax, which would\ndampen high frquency trading, create better prices for\neveryone else?\n\nThe difficulty to overcome in the construction of mathematical\nmodels for the inherently complex evolution of limit-order\nbooks is to capture essential features without creating\na model that is too large and intricate to analyze.\nA second outcome of this research was to develop a\nproto-type model using ideas from the theory of queueing\nsystems, originally developed for telephone traffic and later\nadapted to computer networks, that demonstrates the feasibility\nof constructing tractable yet realistic models of limit-order\nbook dynamics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven E Shreve"
