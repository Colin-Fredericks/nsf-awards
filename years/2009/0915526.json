These investments, however, can be very costly. \r\nConsequently, not all testing resources are supported equally as \r\ncompanies focus their testing efforts on specific and limited types of \r\ntests, ultimately sacrificing timely fault detection. The work proposed will address this problem by investigating strategies for amplifying the power and applicability of testing resources. The strategies will transform existing tests into new tests that add complementary testing capabilities to the validation process. The developed strategies will be unique in their treatment of tests as data.  This will require the development of test representations that can be efficiently manipulated, and test transformations to realize operations that generate new and valuable tests. Test representations that are expressive enough to efficiently encode common forms of software tests will be developed, and transformations that operate both on and across different test representations will be explored. These test representations and transformations will constitute the T2T (test to test) framework and the initial step towards treating tests as data. If successful, this work will help software development companies lower product costs and enhance dependability by amplifying their existing testing resources.\r\n\r\n",
