 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) is the largest ocean ecosystem on Earth, playing a prominent role in global carbon cycling and forming an important reservoir of marine biodiversity. Nitrogen (N2) fixing bacteria (termed diazotrophs) provide a major source of new nitrogen to the oligotrophic waters of the NPSG, thereby exerting direct control on the carbon cycle. Oceanic uptake of CO2 causes long-term changes in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the seawater of this ecosystem.   Therefore, understanding how carbon system perturbations may influence ocean biogeochemistry is an important and timely undertaking.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the investigators will examine how natural assemblages of N2 fixing microorganisms respond to perturbations in seawater carbon chemistry. Laboratory and field-based experiments will be placed in the context of monthly time series measurements on the activities and abundances of N2 fixing microorganism abundances. Together, the project will provide insight into the dependence of N2 fixing microorganism physiology on variations in CO2.  The broad objectives of the research are:  (1) Quantify the responses and consequences of changes in seawater pCO2 on the growth and community structure of naturally-occurring assemblages of ocean diazotrophs; (2) Identify why and how changes in seawater pCO2 influence the growth and carbon acquisition strategies of two model marine diazotrophs (Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera); and (3) Quantify temporal variability in diazotroph community structure and activities at Station ALOHA. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include providing important insights into potential influences of climate change scenarios on ocean biogeochemistry which will be valuable to microbial ecologists, climate change scientists, and biogeochemists. In addition, research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students are planned with an emphasis on participation of women and underrepresented groups in science.",
