 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is exploring a web-based approach for delivering an interactive proposal writing workshop. Highly interactive, on-site workshops, although effective in improving grant writing skills, are costly, time consuming and generally only reach a limited audience. The project is testing whether this type of presentation can be converted to a web-based format. The plans call for a pilot involving at least ten remote sites with ten or more local participants at each.  The web-based model includes a local workshop facilitator to coordinate the activities at each site and to serve as an interface between the participants at that site and the workshop leader.  Survey data is being used to determine the effectiveness of the approach and to identify improvements.  If the interactive web-based proposal writing workshops proves to be effective, the potential for reaching a broader audience of faculty members at diverse and sometimes remote campuses will be greatly enhanced.",
