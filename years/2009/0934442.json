The program shortens the time required to receive an engineering degree and teaching certification from approximately six and a half years to five years.  Most Noyce scholars are completing an engineering degree in addition to the Wisconsin education and STEM teaching requirements.  Scholarships are being awarded to four cohorts of six juniors each during project years two through five.  One-half the scholars will receive three-year scholarships and graduate during the project period.  Six scholars will receive two-year scholarships and six students will have a one-year scholarship funded by this award.  Annual scholarships of $10,000, $12,000 and $14,000 are made during a scholar's third, fourth, and fifth undergraduate years respectively.\r\n\r\nEight local schools representing public, private, urban, and suburban serving students from all economic and ethnic backgrounds are partners in the project.  These schools, Brown Deer High School, Dominican High School, Messmer High School, Milwaukee High School of the Arts, Rufus King High School, and South Milwaukee High School; Fritsche Middle School and South Milwaukee Middle School are high needs schools and serve as the sites for summer activities and co-op teaching experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
