 "awd_abstract_narration": "The supported program of research is in the area of theoretical physics with an emphasis on nuclear physics, neutrino physics, and astrophysics. Theoretical research in these areas is chosen to have a close coupling with the ongoing experimental programs in the United States and abroad.\r\n\r\nNeutrinos, very weakly interacting particles, are produced copiously in certain nuclear reactions, including some taking place in astrophysical sites. Many unanswered questions of contemporary science such as the origin of elements, lack of antimatter in the Universe, and the nature of the dark matter, invisible to direct optical observations, may find answers through a better understanding of neutrinos.  The proposed work aims at a better understanding the properties of neutrinos and the role they play in the Cosmos.\r\n\r\nThis research contributes to the support of national priorities in nuclear science such as the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory and the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.  The principal investigator participates in multidisciplinary research activities that connect particle, nuclear, condensed-matter physics and astrophysics. He is also involved in exposing physics to broader audiences and in a large number of outreach activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\nThis project is concerned with two of the outstanding puzzles of modern physics: After the creation of hydrogen and helium in the Early Universe what mechanism produced heavier elements? Why the visible Universe consists of matter with antimatter mostly absent?  \n \nPossible sites where the heavier elements can be made are supernovae and merging neutron stars. The dynamics of both of these possible sites are controlled by neutrinos, particles with very small mass, no charge and feeble interactions with matter. This project explored symmetries and collective behavior of a very large number of neutrinos produced in a supernova collapse. We also studied counting rates in terrestrial detectors of neutrinos produced in various astrophysical sites.  \n \nCurrently many major accelerator projects in the U.S. and around the world aim to explore the physics of exotic nuclei. Part of the research program in these facilities is to understand how heavier elements are formed.  Our research both in neutrino physics and nuclear structure physics provides crucial theory support for these efforts.\n \nIt has been suggested that possible breaking of the combined charge-conjugation and parity symmetries (CP) in the neutrino sector may be related to the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe.  Scientists in this project provided theoretical support to the experiments which measure a key parameter (neutrino mixing angle theta13) associated with the possible breaking of the CP symmetry in the neutrino sector.\n \nThis project contributed substantially to the support of several graduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our research contributes to the support of national priorities in nuclear science such as the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) and the U.S. Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). We have ongoing participation in international collaborations with Brazil, China, Italy, Japan, and Turkey. We participate in multidisciplinary research activities that connect particle, nuclear, condensed-matter physics and astrophysics. We are involved in exposing physics to broader audiences through web sites, public lectures and ongoing dialogues with journalists and science writers.  \n \nOur activities contribute not only to other ongoing theoretical research, but also to experimental activities in the U.S. and abroad. We also contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists, not only at the University of Wisconsin, but worldwide through various national and international summer schools and doctoral training programs. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Akif Baha Balantekin"
