 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis is an award to cover the travel and expenses of 11 rural Alaskan students, most from underrepresented groups (Alaska Native) and 4 university faculty members to attend the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December 2009.  The Convention brings together scientists, policy makers, NGO's, indigenous people, and the public to discuss issues surrounding climate change. The participation of the students in this conference is part of the Arctic Social Science Program's goals to increase the exposure of rural Alaskan students to science in order to develop their knowledge and hopefully their interest in science studies.  \r\n\r\nThe participation of the DANRD students at the 15th International Inuit Studies Conference in Paris, France, also supported by ASSP, was instrumental in a number of students completing their coursework and degrees.  In this tradition, the PI expects that attendance at COP15 will encourage Rural Development students' interest in science and to pursue science degrees in greater numbers. In addition to attending the convention, the students will meet with students and faculty from the Department of Eskimology at the University of Copenhagen, the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, the Indigenous People's Secretariat of the Arctic Council, and the Greenland Home Rule Government while in Copenhagen.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
