 "awd_abstract_narration": "CPS:Small:Collaborative Research: Establishing Integrity in Dynamic Networks of Cyber Physical Devices\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop energy-efficient integrity\r\nestablishment techniques for dynamic networks of cyber physical devices.  \r\nIn such dynamic networks, devices connect opportunistically and perform\r\ngeneral-purpose computations on behalf of other devices. However, some \r\ndevices may be malicious in intent and affect the integrity of computation. \r\nThe approach is to develop new trust establishment mechanisms for dynamic \r\nnetworks. Existing trusted computing mechanisms are not directly applicable \r\nto cyber physical devices because they are resource-intensive and require \r\ndevices to have special-purpose hardware.\r\n\r\nThis project is addressing these problems along three research prongs. \r\nThe first is a comprehensive study of the resource bottlenecks in current \r\ntrust establishment protocols. Second, the insights from this study are \r\nbeing used to develop resource-aware attestation protocols for cyber \r\nphysical devices that are equipped with trusted hardware. Third, the\r\nproject is developing new trust establishment protocols for cyber physical\r\ndevices that may lack trusted hardware.  A key outcome of the project is \r\nan improved understanding of the tradeoffs needed to balance the concerns \r\nof security and resource-awareness in dynamic networks.\r\n\r\nDynamic networks allow cyber physical devices to form a highly-distributed,\r\ncloud-like infrastructure for computations involving the physical world. The\r\ntrust-establishment mechanisms developed in this project encourage devices to\r\nparticipate in dynamic networks, thereby unleashing the full potential of\r\ndynamic networks.  This project includes development of dynamic networking\r\napplications, such as distributed gaming and social networking, in\r\nundergraduate curricula and course projects, thereby fostering the\r\nparticipation of this key demographic.",
