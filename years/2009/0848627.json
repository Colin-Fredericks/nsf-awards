 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frozen Planet is a landmark multi-media seven-part television series, with complementary website, whose goal is to inform and inspire audiences about the environment and ecology of the Polar Regions and the science being carried out there.  The series will highlight multiple disciplines including climatology, volcanology, geology, glaciology, as well as natural history.  Frozen Planet will be produced in High Definition by the BBC Natural History Unit and Discovery Communications for broadcast worldwide on Discovery Channel in 2011.  The proposal to NSF is for 1) field support for filming various NSF-supported research efforts in Antarctica and 2) funding to cover evaluation of the project?s intended learning impacts in the United States.  Goodman Research Group will conduct the summative evaluation to measure learning impacts centered on the audience?s understanding of the polar environment, the science being undertaken there, and the implication of the new scientific findings to their everyday lives.  For scientific and field support, the production team is collaborating with many organizations in addition to NSF?s Office of Polar Programs including the British Antarctic Survey, the Canadian Polar Continental Shelf Project, and NASA.  Through repeated broadcast, video-on-demand, the website, and DVDs, the project will provide a comprehensive, enduring resource.  The project is anticipated to reach more than 65 million people across the U.S.  \r\n\r\n",
