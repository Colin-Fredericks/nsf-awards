 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Cartographic Association (ICA) has 82 member Countries, each entitled to send representatives to a biennial international meeting. The meetings provide a forum in which all attendees can communicate their own research, and to develop collaborative relationships that last beyond the conference, and sometimes for decades.  This has been the case for many scientists at U.S. academic and government institutions who are conducting research activities in cartography and geo-visualization, and more broadly in GIScience.  Many past attendees have advanced to international involvement and leadership that has encouraged research and its dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe ICA is composed of various commissions and working groups that meet during the conference.  These commissions and working groups are organized around various themes and initiatives, such as internet mapping, education, technology, and map design as just a few examples.  All countries have members on these commissions and working groups, resulting in a national presence by participants from the United States.\r\n\r\nThis project outlines plans to support early career scholars to attend the International Cartographic Association Conferences in Santiago, Chile in 2009 and Paris, France in 2011. The rational for supporting early career scholars is to encourage experiences that facilitate the development scientific research agendas within the broader international community. Scholars early in their careers (for example Ph.D. students and untenured faculty) are most likely to need financial support to enable them to attend international meetings. These scholars are important to the ICA, and their presence at ICA meetings is an investment in United States leadership in cartographic scholarship. \r\n\r\nAttendance at these ICA meetings will enable participants representing the U.S. to share their research with an International community, and to forge international collaborations. A strong United States attendance ensures continued national presence on ICA commissions and working groups.  These ICA Commissions and Working Groups address cutting-edge research, and scholars from the U.S. are integral to them. Participants from the U.S. bring international ideas back to their universities and research laboratories. It is especially inspiring for young scholars to know that an international audience will be hearing the results of their research.  \r\n",
