 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate measurements of the atmosphere?ocean fluxes of trace gases are important to an improved understanding of the cycling of climatically relevant gases. The direct eddy correlation (EC) method, which is considered to be the benchmark for accurate determination of air?sea fluxes of trace gases, relies on high? frequency measurements of the fluctuations of vertical wind velocity and gas concentration, and requires fast response sensors in combination with high sensitivity. These twin requirements have precluded oceanographic use of the EC technique for many species of interest, and direct measurements have been limited mainly to carbon dioxide at relatively high flux levels. \r\n\r\nThe PI?s request funding to develop a fast, highly sensitive, gas concentration sensor, and to integrate it with a sonic anemometer, motion sensing, and data acquisition into an EC flux package suitable for operation from buoys and other platforms, such as ships. Our gas sensor is based on infrared (IR) absorption, but utilizes a novel, highly sensitive, photoacoustic detector. The PI?s expect that this combination will result in an improvement in sensitivity of several orders of magnitude over the IR absorption sensors that are currently in oceanographic use. \r\n\r\nThis proposal was submitted under the US?Ireland R&D Partnership Program by E. Terray (PI-US), WHOI; B. Ward (Partner-IE), National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland; and N. Mitchell (Partner-NI), Queens University Belfast, Northern Ireland (NI).\r\n\r\n",

As a result it is important to know how much CO2 is entering or exiting across the air-water interface.  This quantity is known as the \"mass flux\", and is given by the number of kilograms of gas passing in one second through a square meter of the ocean surface. \n \nSensing the flux of carbon dioxide into or out of the ocean is challenging because it generally is much smaller than terrestrial fluxes (the smaller flux, however, is compensated by the much larger area of the ocean relative to forests, so that the net global uptake of carbon by each is comparable).  The most direct way to determine flux is to measure the concentration of a small volume of gas simultaneously with the component of the wind velocity into or away from the ocean surface.  This requires that very small concentration fluctuations be sensed rapidly. \n \nCarbon dioxide absorbs light strongly in mid-infrared wavelengths.  At the time of our proposal the chief method of measuring CO2 flux at sea involved shining a narrow beam of infrared light through a sample of the gas and measuring the net absorption.
