 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is the development of reliable, high-accuracy and high-resolution biolectromagnetics (BIOEM) simulators that can effectively utilize petascale computational resources to quantify the interaction of the human body with nearby wireless devices.  The investigators are developing two classes of advanced BIOEM solvers based on finite- and boundary-element algorithms to solve coupled electromagnetic and bio-heat transfer equations.  The investigators are, also, deploying the resulting solvers on petascale computers for high-fidelity simulations and cross-validating and verifying the two classes of solvers during development to build confidence in the legitimacy of the new simulation results.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in BIOEM simulation, to accurately model wave interactions with the human body at resolutions never before attempted, to quantify the heating effect of wireless devices on the human body and the electromagnetic effect of the human body on device performance, and to demonstrate that results from these simulations can be used to design safer and more efficient devices.  It is being executed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Texas at Austin?s Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences and the Texas Advanced Computing Center.  The resulting petascale finite- and boundary-element solvers are expected to be useful for many other wave propagation/absorption problems.  The project is training students and postdoctoral researchers and establishing an interdisciplinary community of developers and users fluent in petascale computing.  The investigators are introducing petascale algorithmic concepts, programming techniques, simulators, and applications into graduate and undergraduate courses.  They are disseminating their findings and broadening participation of underrepresented groups through international conferences and peer-reviewed journals, through seminars at nearby universities in Texas, including those with significant underrepresented minority populations, and by releasing the resulting software via open source mechanisms.\r\n",
