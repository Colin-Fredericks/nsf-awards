 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California Berkeley REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during summers of 2009-2012. Ten students will be selected each year to participate in an intensive 10-week research program in Cell, Developmental, and Evolutionary Biology. The goals of this intensive program are (1) To foster an appreciation of how interwoven concepts unite the field of biology across many layers of organizational complexity. Students will participate in a series of faculty seminars including cell, developmental, evolutionary biology and bioinformatics. (2) To foster independent research capabilities. Students will participate in individual research projects based on their interests and the availability of participating faculty. The research experience will be shaped by faculty and doctoral students from the 3 participating units of Molecular & Cell Biology, Integrative Biology and Plant & Microbial Biology. (3) To enhance student success and guide them toward graduate studies. Students will participate in professional development workshops including scientific ethics, writing an effective research statement/application, making effective oral presentations, understanding the funding structure of biology, and more. (4) To become familiar with life at a large research university. Students will interact with undergraduate peers from the Biology Scholars Program (http://bsp.berkeley.edu). Applications from ethnic minority students underrepresented in the sciences and from those who have little opportunity for research experience at their home institution are especially encouraged. Participants will receive a stipend, plus housing, meals and travel costs. Participating faculty are committed to facilitating student success and a diverse bioscience community. More information and application materials are available at http://mcb.berkeley.edu/nsfreu/, or by contacting the Program Director, Professor David Weisblat (reuapplic@lists.berkeley.edu, 510 642 8309).\r\n",

Two additional students were provided research training during the spring semester of 2014 through the no-cost-extension of the grant, for a grand total of 52 trainees.

The high demands for such training is evidenced by the fact that more than 1500 applications were received over the life of this project, for an overall average of 30 applicants for each available training position. To accommodate as many students as possible, a number of students were accepted to the REU program whose stipends were provided by NIH MARC programs at their home institutions. As indicated by the program title, the intellectual goal of this program was not only to provide in depth research training in some specific project, but also to train students in thinking and collaborating across traditional disciplinary boundaries. A total of 28 different UCB faculty mentors (from the departments of Molecular &amp; Cell Biology, Integrative Biology, or Plant &amp; Microbial Biology) assisted by more than 50 graduate student and post-doctoral co-mentors, opened their research labs to these students. The projects undertaken spanned a vast range, from molecular analyses of sub-cellular processes, host-pathogen interactions, the nervous and immune systems and developing embryos to organismal studies of hormonal systems and behavior to evolutionary analysis of fossil teeth.&nbsp; In addition to providing this cross-fertilizing intellectual diversity, the project also aimed to recruit and train participants for the bioscience workforce from an increasingly diverse national population. Toward that end, the 52 trainees included 34 women and 18 men. Eighteen of the participants identified primarily as African-American, 18 others as Latino. Smaller numbers of students had roots in the Pacific Island, South Asian and/or Native American populations. Many of the students were the first in their family to attend college and a few were the first to graduate from high school. Abundant anecdotal evidence shows that each year, the students in formed special bonds and lasting friendships that spanned these vast differences in background and interests. Exit and follow-up surveys confirm that virtually all of the participants have or are planning to go on to higher studies in science.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/01/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Weisblat</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/0852016/0852016_10064075_1427926745925_IMG_0313--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/0852016/0852016_10064075_1427926745925_IMG_0313--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Assembling for dinner\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/0852016/0852016_10064075_1427926745925_IMG_0313--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Assembling for dinner\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REUers congregating for an informal dinner.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">D.
