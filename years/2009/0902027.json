 "awd_abstract_narration": "As lead institution of the Oklahoma State Alliance, Oklahoma State University (OSU) requests a five-year continuation of its Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP) program for a fourth and final period (FY09 ? 13). Alliance members are OSU, the University of Oklahoma (OU), the University of Tulsa (TU); Langston University (LU), an Historically Black College or University (HBCU); and seven regional universities: East Central University (ECU), Northeastern State University (NSU), University of Central Oklahoma (UCO), Northwestern Oklahoma State University (NWOSU), Southeastern Oklahoma State University (SOSU), Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), Cameron University (CU). Most programs are coordinated through multicultural/diversity offices on each campus.\r\n\r\nThis proposal accords with NSF?s goal to increase the number of students completing degree programs in STEM fields from historically underrepresented groups. In Oklahoma, this population consists primarily of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. OSU has the largest Native American enrollment in the United States. The Principal Investigator has more than 30 years experience leading multicultural/diversity programs. OK-LSAMP has developed a variety of innovative academic strategies over 14 years, resulting in a dramatic increase in minority STEM undergraduate enrollment and success, and transition to graduate study. Both OSU and OU have Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) programs in place. The Alliance has a committed mentoring cadre of counselors, faculty, staff and alumni. The OK- LSAMP?s main goal for this phase is to recruit and graduate at least 25% more underrepresented minority undergraduates and graduate students compared to 2007-08 numbers.\r\nProgram activities will be to recruit increasing numbers of students into STEM fields using enhanced recruitment strategies; support students academically and professionally, relying on strong mentoring networks and links to research opportunities such as EPSCoR and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs); prepare students for global success, including Study Abroad, domestic international activities, and Fulbright Exchanges; and to strengthen an infrastructure that supports student success and professional development. An Advisory Board of minority STEM faculty and staff provides culturally sensitive advice to program leaders.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activities will result in increased numbers of a wide range of minority groups in the STEM workforce of the United States. The Alliance provides an important national model for promoting the success of Native Americans ? one of the least represented groups in STEM careers. Results of this research will be disseminated widely to inform understanding of how to encourage and support minority STEM education. Building on well-established relationships with local, state, and Indian Nation authorities, OK-LSAMP can expand its impact into diverse communities. By drawing on Oklahoma?s half century of international outreach experience, students will have tremendous opportunities for global engagement ? an essential asset for career and research success. This program will exert a transformative impact by diversifying and internationalizing the scientific work force of the United States, particularly with respect to Native Americans and other underrepresented groups, and by ensuring that all aspects of America?s cultural and ethnic heritage contribute to future leadership in STEM nationwide",
