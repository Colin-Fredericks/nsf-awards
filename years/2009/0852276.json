Adams\r\n\r\nThis grant is to fund the first ever Undergraduate Knot Theory\r\nConference to take place at Denison University in summer,\r\n2009. Over the last few decades, there has been a dramatic\r\nincrease in the involvement of undergraduates in mathematical\r\nresearch. Knot theory particularly lends itself to this endeavor\r\nsince it is highly pictorial, one can easily stated open\r\nproblems, and students can get actively involved with examples\r\nfrom the first day. A variety of Research Experience for\r\nUndergraduate (REU) summer programs have pursued research on this\r\ntopic. Moreover, there have been various workshops funded by NSF\r\nand the MAA that have helped undergraduate faculty to pursue\r\nresearch with students in knot theory.\r\n\r\nThis conference will bring together a variety of mathematicians\r\nat various stages in their careers: undergraduates who are either\r\ninterested or have already done research in knot theory, graduate\r\nstudents with undergraduate knot theory experience, faculty\r\nmembers interested in working with undergraduates on knot theory\r\nresearch, and four senior researchers in the field who will give\r\nplenary lectures.  There will be a wide range of talks by the\r\nother participants, some on research and some expository.  As a\r\ncenterpiece, we will have a collective problem session to give\r\nparticipants numerous ideas for future research directions.  This\r\nconference will provide an opportunity for students to experience\r\na mathematics research conference that is specifically designed\r\nand directed toward them.  Moreover, the conference will\r\nestablish a supportive network of students and faculty with an\r\ninterest in knot theory research, thus furthering the involvement\r\nof students in the field of mathematics.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.denison.edu/academics/departments/mathcs/unknot\r\n\r\n",
