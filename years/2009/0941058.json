The International Requirements Engineering Conference is sponsored by the IEEE and is the premier academic and industrial event in the field of Requirements Engineering.  The Doctoral Symposium at RE?09 provides a venue for young researchers to access worldwide expertise in software engineering. The Symposium is a one-day closed RE?09 event that provides a forum for Ph.D. students to publicly discuss their research goals, methods, and results at an early stage in their research. The Symposium aims to provide useful guidance to the students from a panel of experts, for completion of the dissertation research and initiation of a research career.",
