 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric models composed of millions (or more) of facets are common today due to improved technologies for generating high-resolution complex models.  The large size makes it infeasible to perform some fundamental geometric operations on these models.  For instance, more than 1.4 billion geometric union operations are required to compute the Minkowski sum of the David model.  Re-designing existing algorithms for large models would require significant time and effort, and may not always be possible.  This project is investigating approximate convex decomposition (ACD), an alternative representation for large geometries that approximately represents the original model using a set of convex objects.  By using the much smaller convex approximation in place of the original model, ACD allows existing (inefficient) methods and software to perform efficiently for large geometries without designing and implementing new algorithms.  An important goal of this project is to develop simple algorithms that not only allow efficient reconstruction but also allow practical implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will make significant contributions to fundamental problems in geometric computing, such as Minkowski sum, continuous motion collision detection, general penetration depth estimation, and swept volume.  Beyond these fundamental geometric operations, this project will provide new ways to handle geometric problems in several areas of robotics (e.g., environment/map representation, motion planning and grasp planning), in pattern recognition (e.g., structural salient feature recognition, visual-based part decomposition and  motif identification in protein structures), and in computer graphics (e.g., data compression, physically-based simulation and skeletonization).\r\nThe software developed by this project will be provided to the public domain.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGeometric models composed of millions (or more) of facets are common today due to improved technologies for generating high-resolution complex models.  Many algorithms for processing such models first decompose the model into convex pieces and then process those pieces separately.  While algorithms for convex decomposition exist, when applied to large and complex models they can be costly to construct and can result in representations with an unmanageable number of components.\n\nIn this project, we investigated a novel representation for large geometries that (approximately) represents the original model with a set of convex objects called Approximate Convex Decomposition (ACD).  By using the much smaller convex approximation in place of the original model, ACD allows existing (inefficient) methods and software to perform efficiently for large geometries.  Since ACD allows applications/users to control how closely a model is approximated and the number of the convex objects in an approximation, it can  provide significant improvement for operations such as Minkowski sum, continuous motion collision detection, general penetration depth estimation, and swept volume, that can only be done efficiently on convex objects and are currently suffering greatly from excessively large decomposition sizes.  We extended the ACD approach by developing new, more robust methods to measure the concavity of vertices of a model and designed a new algorithm we call Fast Approximate Convex Decomposition (FACD) to use this information to determine 'cuts', or sequences of edges, by which to decompose the model into components.  Another accomplishment of this project was to develop a unified framework that can handle a range of data types and generate various approximations including solid-, surface-, and point-based representations of static or dynamic geometries.\n\nA interesting and potentially important new problem - approximate aggregation - grew from our research on ACD.  Approximation is one of the key techniques used in manipulating geometric objects.  Aggregation is a form of approximation that joins objects that are likely to be grouped together as a single unit.  Grouped objects are approximated by shapes that are less conservative, and smaller volume, than other common approximations such as convex hulls or alpha shapes.  Varying the threshold distance that determines the group of nearby objects, we can create a hierarchy of aggregation for any environment.  This can improve efficiency, reduce complexity and generate levels of detail, and has application in motion planning, rendering, cartography and molecular structure design.  For example, we demonstrate how the levels in the aggregation can be used to solve motion planning problems more efficiently in complex environments.\n\nTraining and the development of human resources was an important aspect of this project.  A number of graduate students, the majority from groups underrepresented in computing, were involved in this project.  One student completed her masters thesis on this project and is currently extending this work for her PhD dissertation work.  The REU supplement supported several undergraduates, including a very strong student who was named a finalist for the CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Research award; he was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and now completing his PhD work and is planning a career in academia.  Finally,  several high school students have worked on the project; they were able to contribute to our visualization tool and learn about coding.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy M Amato"
