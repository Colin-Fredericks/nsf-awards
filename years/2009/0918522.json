 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project goal is to develop Smart Graphs, document their effectiveness through rigorous research, and scale the implementation so this technology becomes widely available. The project studies the educational value of \"Smart Graphs\", digital objects that \"know\" about themselves and that provide scaffolding to students to help them learn about graphs and the concepts conveyed in graphs. As planned, digital Smart Graphs can be authored or customized by teachers and accept inputs from students? responses, sketches, functions, models, and probes. The software analyzes the graphs for the kinds of features that experts recognize and then engages students in conversations that instruct and assess.\r\n\r\nThe development of Smart Graphs is based on extensive prior research about students' use and understanding of graphs (TEEMSS II Project).  The project is guided by a collaboration between the Concord Consortium and the Pennsylvania State Department of Education. Pennsylvania's Classrooms for the Future program, through which 40,000 laptop computers are deployed to serve 500,000 students. An outstanding panel of researchers and educators serve as project advisors. \r\n\r\nAfter early development and optimization working with one high school, the technology is fully tested in 24 schools in conjunction with units on force and motion.  Comparison studies (random assignment with implementation delays) provide the sources of data.  The final years are devoted to scaling, reaching 200 teachers in addition to publishers who will be offered support and open source materials.",
