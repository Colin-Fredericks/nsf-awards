The larvae of sponges, clams, snails, worms, etc., swim in the sea for various periods of time and then must settle in the right places to survive, grow and reproduce.  In this way, both desired marine animals, such as those important to marine farming (e.g., clams, oysters, shrimp and lobsters) and undesirable ones, such as those that make up the fouling communities on boats, piers, and power plant pipes (e.g., sponges, barnacles, mussels and tube worms) become established and are maintained.  This research will focus on members of the fouling community and ask questions about how tiny larvae can recognize specific surface requirements and settle onto them in the kinds of very active water movement that characterize all marine habitats.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe communities of animals that occur on the bottom of the sea, from the shallowest intertidal to the greatest depths, are established by the settlement of very small larval stages produced by the animals that make up the communities.  After spending hours to days to months swimming and growing in the water column above the bottom, these larvae must settle, attach and metamorphose (a drastic change in shape and habits from the larval to the juvenile stage) in very precise locations if they are to survive to reproduce. Although it has been recognized that most larvae utilize very specific biological and chemical cues to recognize the right places, how such tiny organisms succeed in the settlement process in the rapidly moving and turbulent flow that characterizes all marine habitats has largely remained a mystery.  Our research thus addressed a series of questions pertaining to larval settlement in a particular habitat, the \"biofouling community\" that characterizes the docks and piers in bays and harbors around the world, as well as the hulls of ships that moor in such bays and the insides of pipes that draw water from the sea to cool electrical plants and industrial machinery. By combining precise measurements of flow characteristics above a distinctive fouling community of animals and microorganisms in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii with studies of the larval development of dominant animals in the community, we were able to identify factors that could be studied in much finer detail in the laboratory. We invented apparatus for use in the lab that would allow us to simulate water flow characteristics above the communities. We could thus study both living larvae as they flowed over living fouling communities (developed on panels submerged for varying periods in Pearl Harbor), as well as passive particles that allowed us to characterize physical characteristics of flow and determine what patterns of movement were peculiar to the living larvae. These studies revealed that larvae of the tubeworm Hydroides elegans are particularly stimulated to settle by bacterial films on new surfaces and they can only recognize such surfaces by physical contacting them. We also learned that the effectiveness initial attachment of several types of larvae varies with the microhabitat where they attach; for many, attachment is strong enough to resist detachment by bursts of flow brought about by passing ship wakes.  By studying behavior of several types of larvae over the same fouled surfaces in both the living state and after turning them into fixed and hardened surfaces, we determined that it is the changing biological/biochemical nature of the surfaces of the biofouling communities that effect the biological changes that take place as the communities develop. That is, it is not just the physical contour of a surface that determines what larvae will settle on it, but the biological and biochemical nature of that surface. Overall, these studies have intensely clarified the biological and physical processes that bring about the establishment of marine bottom communities, as well as their long-term changes.\n\nThe new knowledge obtained in these studies may contribute to the solution of societal problems such as the fouling that occurs globally on the hulls of commercial and naval vessels, slowing their speed and greatly increasing  their fuel consumption and associated costs. Biofouling similarly impacts coastal industries that use seawater to cool their turbines and machines. Overall, this increased energy requirement  leads to increased greenhouse gas production and contributes to the now urgent problem of global climate change.  Larval recruitment is a critical step in mariculture, the farming of oysters, clams, shrimp, lobsters, and related animals, and the results of our research can lead to significant improvements in these ocean-farming efforts around the world.\n\nThese studies have included undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in..."
