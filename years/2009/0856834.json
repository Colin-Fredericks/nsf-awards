 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaborative effort between a four-year school (Arizona State University) and five non-metropolitan feeder schools (Arizona Western College, Central Arizona College, Cochise College, Eastern Arizona College, and Mohave Community College).  The team is working to significantly increase the number of transfer students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, that graduate in engineering and computer science. In order to accomplish this, they are: 1) providing scholarships to students in the feeder schools and to transfer students  at Arizona State University , 2) supporting student outreach activities at the feeder schools, 3) supporting engineering courses at the feeder schools by providing materials, tutoring, local engineering speakers, and tuition scholarships, 4) conducting \"Be an Engineer\" events at the feeder schools for both students and their parents, 5) providing classes, workshops, and seminars using live broadcast and videotape, 6) providing an engaged community of mentors with extensive experience and commitment for all students, 7) hosting an orientation at Arizona State University for engineering transfer students, 8) managing a center where engineering transfer students can study together and get the support needed to survive, and 9) working with transfer students through a time-tested \"career shaping\" academic scholarship workshop program. The project is building on an earlier successful program between Arizona State University and a set of metropolitan community colleges with similar goals. Evaluation efforts, involving formative and summative aspects, are being conducted by internal and external evaluators who are developing and monitoring indices for enrollment, persistence, and graduation.  Broader impacts include the development and dissemination of models for collaboration between community colleges and four-year schools and the efforts to increase the number of women and minorities in engineering.",

We assist students throughout the transfer process and afterwards. Our <em>Academic Success and Professional Development (ASAP)</em> program has focused on specific students: GPA greater than 3.0, full-time upper-division ENGR transfers, US citizens or permanent residents, and unmet financial need. We encourage all graduates to go directly on to graduate-school full-time. We&rsquo;ve graduated program scholars at a near-90% rate; almost 50% &nbsp;continuing directly on to graduate-school; much higher rates than &ldquo;usual:&rdquo; 70% graduation rate for upper-division transfers; less than 15% going right on to graduate-school. The project involved 53 scholars (52.8% either minority or female). In five years, transfer enrollment for the five CCs increased from 80 to 160.</p><p>Activities addressed the entire student-education-cycle: getting CC students to consider an ENGR major, encouragement-and-preparation for transfer, transfer assistance, support-and-encouragement to earn ENGR Bachelors, going directly to graduate-school, ENGR workforce placement. One reason for this &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; partnership was encouraging CC students to &ldquo;stay at the CC to take all the science, mathematics, and engineering (SME) possible and then transfer.&rdquo; Additional courses needed for the two-year-associates-degree would double-count for the university-ENGR-Bachelors and reverse-transfer toward the CC-Associate-degree. Our research showed that 30% of the ASU ENGR transfers, many first-generation, had decided on an ENGR major while at the CC. Larger local-CCs held effective &ldquo;Be-An-Engineer-Events&rdquo; with engineers and engineering students.&nbsp; Because of fewer-students-on-campus, such events didn&rsquo;t similarly-benefit smaller rural CCs. Given this, the project PIs visited SME-classrooms at the CCs (including local high schools). In addition to ASU-to-CC visits, each semester van-loads of CC students were brought to ASU to experience our ENGR Transfer Center and programs. These visits included meeting transfers from their CC already at ASU.&nbsp;</p><p>The PIs surveyed CC students to understand what they like-and-don&rsquo;t-like about ENGR and to identify myths/misconceptions held about ENGR. The top three female reasons choosing ENGR were (in order): money, liked math/science, and career was challenging; for males: money, many job opportunities, and liked math/science. The top six CC-student reasons for not being interested in ENGR were: doesn&rsquo;t sound interesting, not good enough at math, think ENGR is simply too hard, don&rsquo;t like math, not aware of many ENGR job opportunities, and want to work outside (not in an office). In addition, females didn&rsquo;t like physics. The main reason for disinterest in ENGR was: didn&rsquo;t sound interesting. Survey results revealed some common beliefs; e.g. an ENGR must be a &ldquo;brain&rdquo; and love math. Many students were unaware that ENGRs have low-unemployment rates and command the highest-starting-salaries with a Bachelors. Another survey showed that students not interested in ENGR often know very little about it. Since money considerations are important for most students, the topic of money helps capture students&rsquo; attention. Our surveys also showed that each CC needs to be handled individually and carefully because CC student beliefs can vary greatly by school, ethnicity, and gender.
