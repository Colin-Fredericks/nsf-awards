 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Papish at Drexel University to synthesize and study new ligands and complexes; the goal is to mimic the structure and function of important metalloenzymes.  In particular, the Papish group is interested in modeling phosphotriesterase (PTE) because PTE catalyzes the hydrolysis of both pesticides and nerve gases.  New ligands will be designed to mimic the secondary coordination sphere and provide water-solubility, properties that should lead to fast catalysis of important hydrolysis reactions.  The scope of potential research applications is large and includes modeling various esterases, carbonic anhydrase and oxygenases.  Model complexes could provide catalysts for green chemistry applications, including the breakdown of environmental toxins, the harnessing of oxygen as an abundant and environmentally benign oxidant, and the development of a class of ligands that is compatible with water as an alternative to the use of organic solvents. This research project will be used as a means of educating and motivating high school, undergraduate and graduate students to study science by directly involving students in the research.    To illustrate that science and research are viable career paths for currently underrepresented groups, a workshop on 'Careers in Chemistry' that features women and minority chemists will be established.  This workshop will create an informal network of peer and professional role models for students; members of this network can serve as mentors. In addition, they will describe the series of decisions that led them to become successful scientists.",
