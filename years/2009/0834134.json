The Weil-Petersson geometry is recognized for providing important information on the geometry of both the Teichmuller space and the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.  In less than a decade there have been a collection of breakthrough works on Weil-Petersson geometry.  The works are based on a range of approaches and so involve matters of interest and further study for a broad audience.\r\n\r\nThis conference will expose new students and beginning researchers to a variety of standardized techniques in the field.  A number of very recent breakthroughs will be introduced, and open research questions will be discussed.  This will drive further research over the next decade and beyond.  In addition, by having this conference at Central Connecticut State University, a very diverse group of undergraduate and Master\u00d5s level students will be exposed to research level mathematics, which will encourage them to continue their studies.  Many of our students are the first generation in their families to get this far in their studies, and are members of underrepresented groups, who are unfortunately rarely exposed to opportunities such as this.",
