 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds a continuation of core support for the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) at the National Academies of Science.  ILAR is the recognized leader in developing and disseminating guidelines for laboratory animal care, breeding, and use, including the internationally accepted standard Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals); resources for identifying animal models for biological research; and reports on the humane and scientific use of laboratory animals.  The mission includes education and training of scientists and technicians in the care and use of laboratory animals; reduction of pain and distress in research animals; occupational safety and health of employees; and nomenclature of inbred, transgenic, and other genetically defined animals. The program goal is to improve the humane and scientifically valid use of laboratory animals as well as the availability, quality and care of laboratory animals for research.\r\n\r\nILAR accomplishes its goal through a core program, carried out by staff, and a special-project program, carried out by National Academies-appointed experts. Both programs are guided by a 16-member advisory council comprised of experts in laboratory animal medicine, physiology, genetics, medicine, bioethics, and related biological and biomedical sciences. Numerous sponsors fund ILAR?s operations. The funds supplied by NSF partially support maintenance of the web site, publication of ILAR Journal, exhibits at scientific meetings, work of the Council, and general office operations. \r\n\r\nThe many and significant broader impacts of ILAR-sponsored activities extend beyond the U.S. scientific community via outreach to the worldwide scientific community.",
