NSF funds will support two visits by the USF research team.  KRF will fund the Korean team.  The goals are to explore 1) the potential for hosting an international workshop on global sensor networks and 2) the possibility of establishing an international REU site in conjunction with the current REU program at USF.  \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merits \r\nThe project focuses on developing a universal cross-layer wireless sensor network technology, a research area with expansive potential impact in applications.  The potential of this activity has been recognized by the Korea Research Foundation which has provided significant research support as well as travel funding to the Korean partners.  The collaboration will be strengthened with the availability of experimental test bed on sensor networks from Korean industry.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe project will broaden the education and research training of underrepresented students who are currently participants in the Florida Georgia Lous Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, within the USF College of Engineering REU.",
