 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks travel support for the US participants at an international meeting that\r\nwill be held in Rome, Italy,  in 2009. The topic of the meeting will be Kahler and \r\nSasakian geometry. These two flavors of geometry  currently provide us\r\nwith the best methods   available for proving the existence of Einstein metrics on many smooth compact manifolds. The primary intellectual merit of the project stems from the manner in which the meeting is expected to lead to an exchange of key technical insights between leading researchers in these distinct but intimately related areas of global differential geometry.\r\n \r\nInternational meetings play a key role in the development of both pure mathematics\r\nand theoretical physics. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the \r\nreal importance of a new idea or technique really only  becomes a matter of broad\r\nconsensus after it has  been given  prominent treatment at such an international  \r\ngathering. The Rome meeting  will thus  offer a key opportunity to highlight the \r\nground-breaking contributions recently made by US-based  mathematicians \r\n to the study of  Einstein's gravitational field equations in Euclidean signature.  \r\nThis topic  represents an  important arena of  interaction between  \r\nmathematical fields as diverse  as  topology and partial differential equations, and \r\nmoreover  has profound ramifications for areas of theoretical physics such as  \r\nquantum gravity and string theory.  The Rome meeting should thus result in  a \r\nlively exchange of ideas, not only between mathematicians and physicists, but also  \r\nbetween American and foreign scientists. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
