 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clay-rich marine sediments form Earth's main sink for organic carbon. This determines atmospheric oxygen levels, as well as fluctuations of global climate. For example, an increase in carbon burial effectiveness lowers atmospheric CO2 and induces global cooling, with an increase creating the opposite effect. Understanding oceanic carbon burial therefore has a direct bearing on how we model past changes of the earth system and predict future developments, such as global warming due to fossil fuel consumption. This research carries out an ambitious and holistic controlled laboratory examination of the transport, deposition, and degradation of organic matter in clay-rich sediments. It involves construction of a novel, new flume that allows visualization of transported organo-clay flocs and bed forms and allows for the control of temperature and system redox conditions. The work also involves detailed transmission and electron microscopic studies of sediment and organic matter textural relations, a novel integrated organic matter degradation study, and development and parameterization of theoretical and mathematical models of carbon sequestration and degradation. Broader impacts of the work include support of two researchers in an EPSCoR state (Mississippi), student training, and public outreach through YouTube and the Internet. It is also applicable to increasing our understanding of the dispersal of pollutants by sedimentary processes and may also help the search for unconventional fossil fuel resources that can ease our transition to the next generation of fuels and power sources.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe processes that control deposition and burial of organic carbon are at the heart of the Earth's carbon cycle, atmospheric oxygen levels, and fluctuations of global climate.   Roughly half of global organic carbon remineralization occurs in the marine realm, mostly in muddy sediments, and is controlled by a wide range of biological, chemical, and physical processes that operate at multiple time scales and a wide range of physical scales.  Biological and chemical aspects of carbon remineralization have been studied in considerable detail, however, the role of physical mechanisms in the deposition, degradation, and preservation of marine sedimentary organic matter are poorly understood.  This is because sediment clay fabric and physico-chemistry, the key sources of information about the physical aspects, are not readily quantified as, for example, general bulk chemical and biological parameters, and also because historically it was difficult to delineate and observe fabric features that sequester organic matter in clays.  Spatial relationships between organic matter and minerals in marine muds play a critical role with regard to the preservation potential of freshly deposited organic matter.  They impact the effectiveness of bacterial enzymes emitted by sediment pore dwelling microbes, the degree to which organic matter is shielded from enzymes, and the rate at which oxygen can diffuse into the sediment.  The physical form organic matter arrives at the seabed does matter, and the centerpiece of our study is an exploration of the consequences of recent insights into the nature of organo-clay interaction during hydro-dynamic stresses and mud deposition.  Our multi-disciplinary team analyzed sediment samples from a laboratory-based flume that simulated natural conditions under which marine sediment and organic matter might be deposited under controlled conditions.  Flume samples of fine-grained sediment were deposited under experimental conditions of dynamic and static modes of deposition and under four combinations of temperature and oxygen tension (warm oxic, cold oxic, warm sub-oxic and cold sub-oxic).  Analysis of samples addressed clay fabric morphology and sequestration of organic matter.  We tested the broad hypothesis that marine sediment deposited under static conditions would accumulate less organic matter than sediment deposited under dynamic flow conditions.  Also tested was the effect of temperature and oxygen levels on the rate of degradation of organic matter. We found that static deposition of marine sediment results in denser fabric (lower porosity) with less organic matter than its dynamic counterpart.  Differences in fabric led to speculations about the hierarchical structure of small aggregates within larger aggregates that might characterize depositional dynamics.  Many large aggregates were built by attachment of smaller aggregates that formed a complex compound aggregate and the deposits contained considerably more organic matter than their statically-settled counterparts. \n\nUnderstanding the rate of degradation for organic matter is important to support the analysis of flume sample fabric and organic matter sequestration.  Our study analyzed degradation of kelp, as representative organic matter, to provide supporting data for interpreting rates of degradation that were explored in the flume experiments.  Degradation rate was monitored over a period of nearly two years generating data about changes in total organic carbon (TOC) and bulk density of the degraded product that could be used to interpret fabric morphology and dynamics from the flume experiments.\n\nThree-dimensional reconstruction of marine sediment was performed in order to develop a technique for achieving such reconstruction at the nanometer level of sediment clay particle organization.  The utility of such reconstructions was demonstrated by the accompanying analysis of tortuosity, a key factor in the distribution of microbial enzymes that de..."
