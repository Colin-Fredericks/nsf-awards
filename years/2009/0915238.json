 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to develop, analyze and implement optimization\r\nalgorithms that integrate multilevel iterative solvers, adaptive mesh refinement methods, \r\nand so-called `all-at-once' methods for the solution of optimization problems \r\ngoverned by advection dominated partial differential equations (PDEs). \r\nThe presence of strong advection in the governing PDE creates many challenges for\r\nthe numerical solution of these optimization problems, beyond the challenges already\r\nencountered in the numerical simulation of single advection dominated PDEs and beyond\r\nthe many difficulties in solving PDE constrained optimization problems with weak or no advection. \r\nOne reason  for the additional challenges arising in the optimization context is the presence of the \r\nso-called adjoint equation, which is also an advection dominated PDE, but with advection \r\ngiven by the negative  of the advection in the governing equation. This can cause significant \r\nand perhaps unexpected differences in the behavior of discretization schemes and iterative \r\nsolvers when they are extended from the application to single advection dominated PDEs \r\nto the solution of PDE constrained optimization problems.  This research will analyze \r\nthe sources of these differences, their impact on the quality of computed solution\r\nand on the efficiency of solution algorithms. Another goal is to devise modifications of \r\nmultilevel iterative solvers, adaptive mesh refinement methods, and so-called KKT solvers to\r\nmake them robust against the presence of advection.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany important real-life applications  such as the shape optimization of technological devices, \r\nthe optimal control of systems, and the identification of parameters in environmental\r\nprocesses lead to optimization problems governed by systems of advection dominated\r\npartial differential equations. This research addresses mathematical and algorithmic\r\nissues that are crucial for the reliable and efficient solution of these problems. It will lead\r\nto a better theoretical understanding of the solution properties of these optimization problems \r\nas well as to new computational tools for their  reliable and efficient solution. Furthermore, \r\nit will provide training opportunities for students in an important area of computational science.",
