 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)\r\n\r\nThe project is addressing the learning of mechatronics in engineering technology through hands-on experience in the laboratory and through internships.  It is enhancing six existing courses in electrical and mechanical engineering technology; developing two new mechatronics engineering technology courses; and establishing one new mechatronics laboratory facility to provide hands-on experience in designing, controlling, and integrating packaging machinery systems.  In doing this it is incorporating experiential learning to make the courses more beneficial, practical, and appealing to students. The investigators are partnering with local industries, which are donating new equipment and hiring a substantial number of interns from this program. Formative and summative evaluations, under the direction of an experienced evaluator, are being performed at appropriate times for assessment of curricular materials, objectives, outcomes, student learning, experiential learning, and overall impact of the grant. The dissemination plan includes conference presentations, journal publications, participation in industry trade shows, and industrial publications. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the materials, efforts to recruit minority students into the program, a focus on making the laboratory material gender neutral, and providing graduates that meet the needs of local industries.\r\n",
