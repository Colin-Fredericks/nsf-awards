 "awd_abstract_narration": "An unanswered need in oceanography is to sample the ocean at higher-resolution spatial and temporal scales than presently possible. Although current systems have led tomany important discoveries, oceanographers would agree that many fundamental processes are presently unobservable due to the sparseness of the sampling geometries. Examples include the estimation of subsurface particle trajectories for ascertaining sewer effluents, the measurement of horizontal and vertical diffusivity, and the submesoscale vorticity and vertical excursions of isopycnals. These examples require versatile, quasi-Lagrangian sensors that profit fromthe same interactions generated by ocean circulation that the oceanographic ecosystemrelies on. We propose an original oceanographic observatory system based on small, inexpensive, buoyancy con- trolled drogues capable of scientific data analysis and coordinated motion control within the shear layers of the ocean circulation to monitor flows of nutrients, behaviors of animals, coastal circulation, and pol- lution dispersion.\r\n\r\nThe PI's propose to developdistributed, Lagrangian sensing systems that can both track currents and sense the environment has never been approached or accomplished. The proposed ocean sampling mobile sensor network pose exciting research challenges that go well beyond any particular discipline, as they require the integration of the sensing and control aspects of the drogues with the data processing and computational analysis tailored to the specific ocean applications. Deployed over coastal areas of tens of kilometers, small armies of such drogues will concurrently map currents and sense the environment. Such vehicle swarms offer the opportunity to sample oceanic processes on space-time scales that were heretofore unobtainable while being transported at low Reynolds numbers. Since individual drogues are not tracked underwater and only relay sensed information when they are at the surface, our proposed observatory system requires minimal supporting infrastructure. With the computational tools and algorithms developed under this project, the drogues would be built at a fraction of the cost of current ocean sensor technologies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe investigators propose outreach through high schools, community workshops, and a science festival. The investigators mention a focus on diversity. Successful development and deployment of the technology will have substantial impact of high social relevance, and the connections with the California Ocean Sciences Trust will help to ensure successful knowledge transfer. The investigators also propose a suite of other broader impacts activities, including course development and display at a local festival.",
