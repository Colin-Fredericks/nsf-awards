Searson of Johns Hopkins University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the complex interplay between the substrate, nucleation, and surface chemistry that dictates the shape and orientation of islands in electrocrystallization. Since the properties of solid materials are often dependent on crystallographic orientation, the ability to manipulate the shape and orientation of islands in electrocrystallization is crucial to the optimization of electrode materials for fuel cells, batteries, solar energy conversion, as well as in a wide range of other applications. Graduate, undergraduate, and area high school students will be trained in all aspects of the proposed research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe impact of this project is in two main areas.\n\n \n\n(1) The structure and properties of electrodeposited thin films and nanostructures are determined in large part by the kinetics of island growth. For example, the island growth mechanism dictates island shape, island orientation and island density, parameters that, in turn, control the thickness at island coalescence and macroscopic properties such as grain size and texture.  With the increasing demand to fabricate materials and structures at nanometer length scales, it is critically important to advance the scientific understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of island growth.\n\n \n\nIn this project we provided new insight into the role of the nucleation overpotential in dictating island growth in both the kinetic and diffusion-limited regimes.  We also contributed to the analysis of nucleation kinetics and the spatial distribution of islands through analysis of the near neighbor distance.  We developed a mechanistic analysis of island growth in the kinetic regime from analysis of island volume and area, and provided comparison to other methods including Avrami analysis, scaling analysis, and analysis of the power spectral density.  With increasing emphasis on deposition of ultrathin films and nanostructures, advances in our understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of island growth may have broader impact in applications from the deposition of arrays of catalyst islands to the deposition of thin films.\n\n \n(2) Semiconductor quantum dots represent an important class of nanocrystals.  In this project, we made three significant contributions to the field: (a) We developed an energy - band model that explains the characteristic blinking behavior of quantum dots reported in the literature and provides insight into features such as the grey state, the power law distribution of on- and off-times, and the power law exponents.  (b) We performed quantitative characterization of the composition &ndash; property relationships for lipid layers on water soluble quantum dots.  This work provides a scientific foundation for design of surface modification methods for specific application.  (c) Using the knowledge gained in these systematic studies we demonstrated absolute quantitative profiling, spatial mapping, and multiplexing of membrane biomarkers using functionalized quantum dots.  This work may have broader impact in nanotechnology, and the development of bioassays and biosensors.\n\n \n\nThis project contributed to the training of several graduate students and introduced numerous undergraduate and high school students to science and engineering research.  One high school student, one undergraduate student, and one REU student were co-authors on publications resulting from this project.  Graduate students participating in this project contributed to annual workshops for high school-science teachers, and a laboratory class for graduate students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter C Searson"
