This work is accomplished by bringing together principles of physics and materials science in practical wafer scale semiconductor manufacturing, enabling new, low cost products.\r\n\r\nThe thermoelectric power generation devices to be developed in this work are key to realizing the often touted but yet unrealized societal benefits of thermoelectric power generation. Examples of benefits that can be forseen in the initial target market, the transportation industry, are economic benefits for the public from reduced fuel consumption and reduced environmental impact due to more efficient operation.",
