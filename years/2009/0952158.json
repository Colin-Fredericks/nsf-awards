It can be cost competitive with energy derived from fossil fuel, and predictions are that it will provide up to 11% of the global energy production in 2020. Emphasis in this area in the past has been mainly on the development of larger wind turbines where the design was mostly conventional and the technology was based on earlier research and development. Aerodynamics seems to haven take a backseat compared to other components deemed more important such as gearbox, generator, structural design of the blades, and controller design. Clearly, a renewed and substantial effort has to be made to address the aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Research is needed in the following areas: (1) Understanding of the relevant physics for both, the controlled and uncontrolled flow, with particular focus on the interaction of separation and transition which is of high relevance for wind turbine applications; (2) advancement of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes and turbulence modeling capabilities; (3) development of physics based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) which can predict unsteady aerodynamic loads, and (4) prediction and reduction of acoustic noise which has an impact on the public acceptance of wind turbines. This proposed research will address the first key area. The PIs will explore if computational fluid dynamics on a scale that has not been attempted for wind turbine applications can lead to true breakthroughs in the understanding of the relevant physics for the controlled und uncontrolled flow. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed research will broadly benefit society as it will make wind energy more affordable and thus allow for a reduction of the carbon based energy production. It will also help reduce the dependency on foreign energy resources and raw materials. The PIs will seek cooperation with wind turbine manufactures to assure that our proposed research is aligned with the needs of the wind turbine industry. They will also seek cooperation with government research labs as well as national and international research institutions. The proposed research will also advance basic science and technology in the emerging field of active flow control which will benefit other disciplines. Results will be presented at interdisciplinary conferences and published in the appropriate journals. Part of the proposed experiments will be accomplished by undergraduate students. The PIs have access to a 2m wind turbine demonstrator which will be made available to high schools and other educational institutions to foster basic science education with focus on energy sustainability and environmental awareness. By attracting attention from the local press this work will create community interest in wind energy. Part of the proposed research will be accomplished within the framework of two established and very active international student exchange programs (University of Stuttgart, Germany, and ENSMA, Poitiers, France).",
