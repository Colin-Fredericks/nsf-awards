The acquisition of a FEI NOVA NanoSEM 230, Ultra High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) capable of electron beam (e-beam) lithography provides the capability and reliability necessary for interdisciplinary research in the new Materials Science and Engineering Ph.D. program at Texas State University.  This instrument eliminates barriers to research productivity presented by the existing antiquated SEM capable only for larger scale imaging, and enables the platform for interdisciplinary research linking innovation and discovery between the physical, engineering, and biological sciences.  This Field Emission (FE) SEM combines high- and low-voltage ultra-high resolution with an imaging resolution of 1.0 nm and a writing resolution of nominally <10 nm at 30 kV.  Importantly, 20-nm patterning can be done routinely. The system features: a high stability ultra-high brightness FE electron source with high beam current capability; low pattern distortion and drift; high precision stage and pattern overlay; environmental SEM technologies; high speed electrostatic beam blanker; and gas injection systems for direct e-beam writing of nanostructures.  The e-beam writing capability enables fabrication of structures applicable to multidisciplinary problems such as investigation of nanostructure based photonic or electronic biological sensors for molecular recognition, nano devices for more efficient energy conversion, and the spin physics of magnetic nanostructures. The SEM?s accessibility, ease of use, and consistency make the e-beam system ideal for integration into our educational and research programs benefitting undergraduate, graduate and post doctoral students.  The core faculty involved in this project at Texas State, which anticipates achieving Hispanic Serving Institution status next year, will use the instrument to enhance outreach programs to assure the maximum opportunity for training and research by a diverse population of students.  \r\nLayman Summary: The ability to both pattern and image at the nanoscale is indispensable for present-day materials science.  The acquisition of an Ultra High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) capable of electron beam lithography provides this necessary capability for interdisciplinary research in the new Materials Science and Engineering Ph.D. program at Texas State University. This instrument eliminates barriers to research productivity presented by the existing antiquated SEM capable only for larger scale imaging, and provides the platform for interdisciplinary research linking innovation and discovery between the physical, engineering, and biological sciences enabling advances in nanoscale materials research for health, energy and security applications. The electron-beam writing capability enables fabrication of structures at the nanoscale (10-7m - 10-9 m) applicable to multidisciplinary problems such as investigation of nanostructure based biological sensors for molecular recognition, nano devices for more efficient energy conversion, and the spin physics of magnetic nanostructures.  The SEM?s accessibility, ease of use, and consistency make the electron-beam system ideal for integration into our educational programs benefitting undergraduate, graduate and post doctoral students.
