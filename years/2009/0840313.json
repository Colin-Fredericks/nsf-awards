 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cryptoclub:  Cryptography and Mathematics Afterschool and Online is a five -year project designed to introduce middle school students across the country to cryptography and mathematics. Project partners include the Young Peoples Project (YPP), the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and Eduweb, an award-winning educational software design and development firm. The intended impacts on youth are to improve knowledge and interest in cryptography, increase skills in mathematics, and improve attitudes towards mathematics. The secondary audience is leaders in afterschool programs who will gain an increased awareness of cryptography as a tool for teaching mathematics and adopt the program for use in their afterschool programs. Project deliverables include online activities, online cryptography adventure games, interactive offline games, a leader's manual, and training workshops for afterschool leaders. The project materials will be developed in collaboration with YPP staff and pilot tested in Year 3 at local afterschool programs and YPP sites in Chicago in addition to four national sites. Field testing and dissemination occurs in Year 4 at both local sites in Chicago and national locations such as afterschool programs, science centers, and community programs. Six 3-day training workshops will be provided (2 per year in Years 3-5) to train afterschool leaders. It is anticipated that this project will reach up to 11,000 youth, including underserved youth in urban settings, and 275 professional staff. Strategic impact resulting from this project includes increased awareness of cryptography as a STEM topic with connections to mathematics as well a greater understanding of effective strategies for integrating and supporting web-based and offline activities within informal learning settings. The Cryptoclub project has the potential to have a transformative impact on youth and their understanding of cryptography and may serve as a national model for partnerships between afterschool and mentoring programs.",

In addition, the project offered training and resources for teachers and informal educators to introduce their students to an exciting and important application of mathematics in a playful and engaging way. The materials were tested by teachers and students in an iterative design process over six years, including a 2012-13 field test in 29 national sites.

Some activities involve moving around, for example, following a trail of encrypted clues to find a hidden treasure, or running back and forth in a relay race, competing to be the first to gather and decrypt the parts of a secret message.

The CryptoClub Website <a href=\"http://cryptoclub.org/\">(<em>cryptoclub.org)</em></a>, developed in collaboration with Eduweb, provides additional opportunities for applying and learning cryptography. &nbsp;It includes cipher tools for encrypting and decrypting, message and joke boards where users decrypt messages or submit their own encrypted messages, historical comics about cryptography, adventure games that involve secret messages, and a treasure hunt clue-generator for teachers to create land-based treasure hunts with encrypted clues. Currently the games include <em>Desert Oasis</em>, which uses the Caesar cipher, <em>Rogue Computer</em>, which uses the keyword cipher, and soon-to-be released <em>Village of Numbers</em>, which uses the additive cipher. All three combine an element of adventure with cryptography activities. Each can be played without previous knowledge of the others and each can be enjoyed multiple times.</p>\n<p>The website has a registration system, so users can keep track of their progress and earn points for activities they complete. In addition, there is a private group system, so CryptoClub leaders can set up a private message board for their students.

Others find the website independently and are not connected to any organized educational program. &nbsp;The growing number of users come from all around the world and every age group.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The website is being rebuilt using HTML5 to enable multiplatform deployment and 3D games developed in Unity.
