 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel award supports participation in the ACM SIGCOMM 4th International Conference on emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies (CoNEXT) held between December 1-4, 2009 at Rome, Italy.\r\n\r\nThis technical conference addresses a range of important networking issues, including: internet measurement and modeling, wireless networks, mobile and cellular networks, ad hoc and sensors networks, economic aspects of the internet, network security issues, data center networks, peer-to-peer and overlay networks, routing and traffic engineering, delay and disruption tolerant networks, and new networking protocols and architectures. The Re-Architecting the Internet workshop which is co-located with CoNEXT 2009 is of special interest as it addresses the important area of novel networking technologies that will shape the future of Internetworking. Thus attendance at CoNEXT provides a valuable research and career development experience for graduate students from United States academic institutions. Participants have the opportunity to present their work and technical sessions, as well as interact with peers engaged in state-of-the-art research in the field. \r\n\r\nOf special significance, the conference offers a student workshop that will enable students to present and obtain feedback on their work in progress. Approximately 7 to 10 US-based graduate students are provided the opportunity to attend CoNEXT. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited travel funds to attend conferences; attendance at such events is an important part of their educational experience.",
