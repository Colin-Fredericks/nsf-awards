 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nTo improve disk I/O performance, one may integrate multicore processors with parallel disk systems. Unfortunately, architectures and data processing algorithms for multicore-based parallel disk systems are still in their infancy. This motivates us to develop novel architectures for parallel disk systems, where significant multicore processing power and memory are integrated into parallel disk drives. This CAREER project provides the first parallel disk system in which large parts of data and I/O processing are offloaded to multicore processors, embedded in disk drives. The proposed techniques and mechanisms are highly adaptive to dynamic workloads with both large and small disk requests, making modern parallel disk systems leverage multicore processors for better performance and scalability.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this CAREER Development project is to build hardware and software parallel disk architectures that put substantial multicore computing power on disks. The research consists of three basic tasks: (1) designing hardware and software architectures for multicore-based parallel disk systems, (2) developing multicore-based data processing techniques, and (3) building software performance models and an analysis toolkit. The educational plan include: (1) establishing a storage systems laboratory; (2) developing new courses; (3) implementing the concept of a mini-conference to educate students; and (4) increasing underrepresented student involvement in research activities. In addition, the project would benefit society by developing hardware and software modules for next-generation parallel disk systems, where multicore processors and disk drives are tightly integrated to boost disk I/O performance.",

Infrastructure Outcomes.</strong> We developed a multicore-based architecture (or MOD for short) for parallel disk systems.

The architecture consists of three major components: a host processor, a DRAM memory module, and an array of multicore-based disk subsystems. Each multicore-based disk subsystem contains an embedded multicore processor, a controller, a DRAM memory chip and a disk drive. I/O buffers with a size ranging from several megabytes to gigabytes are residing in the memory modules. The second MOD configuration (hereinafter referred to as intraMOD) is designed to cope with intra-disk parallelisms, meaning that a single multicore processor is used to coordinate, schedule, and combine results from multiple disk drives. intraMOD is similar to the interMOD architecture except that data processing in all the disks are offloaded to one embedded multicore processor. The following critical questions are raised when we introduce the concept of intraMOD.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/06/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xiao&nbsp;Qin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0845257/0845257_10026935_1470516107336_Fig1Architecture--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0845257/0845257_10026935_1470516107336_Fig1Architecture--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"System Architecture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0845257/0845257_10026935_1470516107336_Fig1Architecture--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"System Architecture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The prototype of multicore-enabled smart storage.
