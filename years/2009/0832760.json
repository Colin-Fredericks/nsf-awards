 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (UW NSEC) addresses grand challenges associated with directed assembly of nanoscale materials into functional systems and architectures through the use of self-assembly, chemical patterning, and external fields.  To realize that mission, the NSEC includes interdisciplinary research teams to 1)  explore and develop new materials and processes for advanced lithography in which self-assembling block copolymers are directed to adopt morphologies that advance the performance of nanomanufacturing processes, 2) explore directed assembly at the nanoscale through the synthesis of biologically-inspired organic nanostructures in which functional side-chains display unique ordering, in terms of both sequence along a backbone and three-dimensional arrangement in space, and 3) explore and harness non-equilibrium processes, including the use of external fields, to manipulate the assemble nanoscale objects, including particles and macromolecules in simple and complex fluids.  The outcomes of the NSEC?s transformative and interdisciplinary activities are to revolutionize nanomanufacturing and the discovery and control of new materials and material architectures. Examples of applications of the NSEC?s fundamental research include bit patterned media for data storage, potential manufacturing techniques for the semiconductor industry to keep pace with Moore?s Law, new materials with antifungal properties, development of optical mapping platforms for high-throughput analysis of entire genes, and development of liquid-crystal plasmonic based sensors for toxicants and biomolecules. UW NSEC research teams are also proactively engaged in 1) investigating the biological effects and environmental fate of engineered nanoparticles, with a particular emphasis on understanding how surface chemistry impacts uptake and biological activity in a zebrafish embryo model and is influenced by environmental weathering, and 2) basic research on communication effects and public opinion that will help us build an in-depth, empirical understanding of the psychological processes through which lay audiences make sense of complex information conveyed through the Internet.  Shared facilities support these efforts as well as provide state-of-the-art infrastructure for internal and external users from academia and industry alike.  The breadth and scope of the research programs and associated investigators provide the foundation for extensive interactions with companies, particularly the semiconductor industry and members of the NSEC-enabled UW Advanced Materials Industrial Consortium.  Finally, the NSEC operates an ambitious and unique education and outreach program aimed at cultivating the next generation of nanoscale science and engineering experts with diverse and interdisciplinary backgrounds. Key programs include research experiences for undergraduates, research experiences for teachers, an NSEC fellowship program, an international research program for graduate students with collaborators on five continents, SCI ENCountErs, a highly successful pilot after-school program involving the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County that excites predominantly middle school students from underrepresented groups with innovative hands-on science activities, and a partnership with the Independent Laboratory Access for the Blind project to increase access to scientific careers for those who are blind and visually impaired.\r\n\r\n",
