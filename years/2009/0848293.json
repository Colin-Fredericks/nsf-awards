 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Lawrence R. Sita at the University of Maryland, College Park to investigate mechanisms for the coordination polymerization and selective oligomerization of 1-alkenes as mediated by molecularly-well-defined transition metal complexes.  Novel dynamic and reversible bimolecular processes that are competitive with first-order chain-growth propagation are being identified and established as mechanistic control points by which the production of a near continuum of different polyolefin grades between two limiting materials can be accomplished using only a single catalyst.  When combined with living coordination chain-transfer polymerization, it is anticipated that practical commercial volumes of these new polyolefin materials can be realized.  The supported work further provides a critical vehicle through which outreach activities will be conducted to educate the general public regarding the current needs, limitations, and impact of the global polyolefins industry and related research. Students conducting the studies receive training in both fundamental and practical apsects of chemistry and will be well prepared to enter the workforce.\r\n\r\nCivilization and the quality of life as we know it is wholly dependent upon \"plastic\" materials prepared through the coordination polymerization of ethene, propene, and higher 1-alkene using catalysts that are largely discovered in empirical fashion.  Detailed investigations of mechanistic processes that govern these catalysts can provide new and transformational strategies by which the range of plastic materials can be greatly increased while dramatically reducing the research and development cycle.",
