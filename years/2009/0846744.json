 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is  to develop an integrated educational and research foundation to explore biomimetic nanocomposites containing ultra-long hydroxyapatite nanofibers for biomedical, especially orthopedic, applications.  The main objective is to fabricate surface modified ultra-long hydroxyapatite nanofibers and fabricate and evaluate the composites containing these nanofibers. It is expected the long nanofibers are very strong and can also provide good reinforcing effects.  The research tasks include a) development of nanofabrication techniques for hydroxyapatite nanofibers with length up to several millimeters by combining biomimetic and engineering approaches, b) surface modification of the nanofibers, and c) fabrication and mechanical and biological evaluation of the resulting nanocomposites for orthopedic applications.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will make great contributions to fundamental understanding of biomineralization and biomimetic nanofabrication, and also enhance the infrastructure critical to future fabrication of one dimensional inorganic nanofillers and their nanocomposites. The proposed research may also provide a disruptive technology that may eventually lead to non-metal orthopedic implants suitable for load bearing applications, which may benefit millions of Americans with osteoporosis or at risk. Furthermore, the proposed educational and outreach efforts are designed to: 1) introduce graduate and undergraduate students to the basic scope and frontiers of nanomanufacturing and nanocomposites and educate more engineers with a multidisciplinary background; 2) actively involve underrepresented groups in laboratory research; and 3) promote the public awareness of nanotechnology and enhance the public image of engineers and scientists.\r\n",
