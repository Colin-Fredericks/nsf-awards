 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to establish new results in different topics of \r\nstochastic analysis.  First  a new approach for  proving the smoothness \r\nof the density for solutions to stochastic partial differential \r\nequations will be introduced. This method is based on a stochastic \r\nversion of Feynman-Kac's formula for the Malliavin derivative of the \r\nsolution.  Moreover, the techniques of Malliavin calculus will be \r\napplied to  derive upper and lower Gaussian estimates for the density of \r\nthe solution.  A second objective of the project is  to obtain results \r\non the rate of convergence of Euler-type numerical approximation schemes \r\nfor stochastic differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian \r\nmotion.  The application of the techniques of Malliavin calculus to \r\nanalyze numerical approximation schemes for backward stochastic \r\ndifferential equation is also one of the  topics of the project.  \r\nAnother   research direction  deals with the proof of central and \r\nnoncentral limit theorems for  a large variety of functionals of a \r\nGaussian process, including multiple stochastic integrals, and weighted \r\npower variations. The project also aims to establish  Feynman-Kac's \r\nformulas for the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation driven by a \r\nfractional multiplicative  Gaussian noise.\r\n\r\nStochastic analysis is an active area in mathematics which is motivated \r\nby the study of ordinary and partial differential equations perturbed by \r\na random noise. These equations play a central role as models in many \r\nareas of physics and economics.  The  application of these equations in \r\nconcrete problems requires suitable numerical approximation schemes,  \r\nand  convenient estimates   for the probability distribution of the \r\nsolution.  This project aims to make new relevant contributions to these \r\nproblems,  by  developing and applying  powerful  mathematical \r\ntechniques such as the Malliavin calculus. On the other hand,  motivated \r\nby some applications in hydrology,  telecommunications and mathematical \r\nfinance, there has been a recent interest in input noises possessing a \r\nlong memory property such as the  fractional Brownian motion. The \r\ndevelopment of a stochastic calculus  with respect to these long memory \r\nprocesses is also one of the aims of  this project.\r\n",
