 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0913175\r\nReed\r\n\r\nThis is an exploratory project for a limited survey for variability with time scales less than ten minutes.  By obtaining data on 40 sample fields known to contain a variable star, this preliminary study will develop a reduction and analysis pipeline for variability of differing types over many time scales, determine the sensitivity of various survey cadences, search for new types of variability, and determine if a much larger survey is warranted.  The main goal is to sample the sky on timescales less than one minute, to determine if new phenomena exist which have heretofore gone unnoticed because of low temporal sampling.  This trial will determine the optimal temporal cadence to detect both short period and long period phenomena, and provide accurate statistics correlating magnitude range with detection limits so as to optimize exposure times.  Since it is likely this survey will discover many new variable stars of known types, it is important to understand the temporal and brightness variation limits of the equipment and of any data.\r\n\r\nAlthough this study will extend our knowledge of the physical properties of known variable types, the most exciting prospect is the chance to uncover new, previously unknown phenomena.  A survey of this sort will naturally uncover many types of mostly stellar variability, and all data for these stars will be available on-line, so that interested astronomers can perform their own studies.  Undergraduate students (supported from other funds) will take part in obtaining, reducing, and analyzing the data.  They will also be involved in establishing the reduction and analysis procedures and correlating with known variable stars. This will give them a very rounded background in stellar astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis work is funded from the Stellar Astronomy theme of the Division of Astronomical Sciences, as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research.",
