 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silk is essential to the ecology and evolutionary success of spiders. Despite the clear significance of silk to spiders, little is known about how silk genes are shaped over time by natural selection. This project furthers investigation of the evolutionary and functional changes of silks spun by species of the genus Aliatypus. These spiders rely on silk for constructing burrows and trapdoors, without which they could not survive. Silk genes from different Aliatypus species will be sequenced to determine the relationships and rates of change among the genes. These results will reveal how silk evolves among closely-related species and how molecules adapt to local environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nDue to its extraordinary mechanical properties, spider silk is being used to develop novel biomimetic materials that are tougher than Kevlar but also biodegradable. This research will help bioengineers understand which elements of silk sequences correspond to particular functions or environments. Additionally, understanding the dynamics of silk gene variation has relevance to other repetitive, structural proteins, such as biomedically important collagens, elastins, and amyloids. Furthermore, Starrett will contribute to the cataloging of native fauna in the biologically diverse Southwest and enable undergraduates to gain both field and laboratory research experiences.\r\n",
