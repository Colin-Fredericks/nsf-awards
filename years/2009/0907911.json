 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Steven Spangler (University of Iowa) will explore turbulence in the interstellar medium and the role such turbulence plays in interstellar processes.  Methods of inquiry in the research program include (1) new radio-astronomical observations using the Very Large Array (VLA) of extragalactic radio sources viewed through HII regions, (2) new observations at low radio frequencies of nearby pulsars with the VLA and the Murchison Widefield Array, and (3) examination and re-analysis of extensive spectroscopic measurements of turbulence in nearby interstellar clouds.  Specific research projects to be undertaken in the grant period are the following: (1) Faraday rotation observations will be made with the VLA of a sample of about 150 extragalactic radio sources viewed through 6 HII regions and their associated bubbles; (2) low frequency (less than 100 MHz) scintillation measurements will be made of four pulsars which are weakly scattered and viewed through the \"Local Bubble\": the scintillation data will be examined for the presence of \"pulsar arcs\", which contain information on the distance and distribution of turbulence along the line of sight; (3) an existing, high quality set of measurements of absorption lines due to nearby interstellar clouds will be analysed for the information it contains on the properties of turbulence in these clouds; (4) the properties of turbulence in the lightly ionized molecular clouds, and its interaction with molecular ions, will both be investigated.\r\n\r\nThis research will benefit society as a whole through the individualized training of young scientists in the methods of physical science research, the capabilities of radioastronomical and radiophysical measurements, and in fundamentals of plasma physics.  Dr. Spangler's mentorship of University of Iowa undergraduate and graduate students will continue under this award.  This research program also has an outreach component, consisting of an association with amateur astronomy groups in Iowa, particularly the Cedar Amateur Astronomers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit of Project \n\nThe purpose of this research project was to better understand the interstellar medium of our galaxy, the Milky Way.  The interstellar medium is the gas that fills the huge empty spaces between the stars.  The parts of the interstellar medium that most interested us were the ionized component, meaning that the atoms in the gas are broken into positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons.  In the terminology of physics, this makes it a plasma.  \n\n A main interest of this research was to study turbulence, or random motions in the interstellar plasma, similar to turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere that one encounters in airplanes. Of particular interest to us was the degree to which this turbulence resembles that which exists in the outer atmosphere of the Sun (the solar corona), and the space between the planets.  Turbulence in the corona and interplanetary space has been extensively studied, and we know quite a bit about it.  \n\nA result of our research is that the interstellar turbulence is similar to that in the solar system in some ways, but differs in others.  The interstellar turbulence appears to dissipate, or damp out, in a similar fashion.  However, a difference is that interplanetary turbulence appears to show a degree of order (called anisotropy) that is missing in at least some types of interstellar turbulence.  \n\nAnother major area of research activity was studying the degree to which young clumps of stars, called star clusters, modify the gas of the interstellar medium from which they form.
