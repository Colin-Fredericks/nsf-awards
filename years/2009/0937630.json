 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on Dr. Recker's past work in the area of enhancing technology integration into instructional development for teachers.  The project uses the web-based teacher authoring tool, Instructional Architect (IA) and a technology-oriented teacher professional development model, called DLConnect. Together, these help K-12 teachers in creating classroom activities for their students using online learning resources found in the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) and on the web. The current project substantially revises the IA tool and enhances the DLConnect teacher professional development (TPD) model to help teachers integrate NSDL resources with effective, inquiry-oriented pedagogical practices. A rigorous research program examines and evaluates the impact of this model on teachers' and their students' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior toward technology-oriented instruction. Quantitative and qualitative research methods are used to assess and evaluate research outcomes. Quantitative methods use quasi-experimental studies to compare the inquiry-oriented TPD with the existing, technology-oriented TPD model. Qualitative methods use in-depth case studies to help explain results. This project supports teachers in crossing the 'last mile' between producers of online resources and the teachers who use them.",
