 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric dust is an important component of physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring on the surface of the Earth. Dust is an important result of erosion and results in the remote deposition elsewhere of essential plant nutrients and other chemicals. The relative role of humans in dust generation is the subject of much conjecture supported by very little actual data. Preliminary data from lake sediment records show that for a mountain range in the western United States, dust deposition in the time period since the mid 19th century is five to seven times higher than average rates over the past several thousand years. This increase coincides with the rapid land use change of the western states that occurred after the construction of railroads and introduction of livestock in the late 1800s. This apparent increase results in many fold increases in the deposition of nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus to downwind high elevation areas, with potentially profound implications for both the source and sink ecosystems.  This project will lead to a new regional reconstruction of western dust deposition based on analyses of high elevation lake sediment cores. Diatom composition in the cores will help establish more complete understanding of biological responses to changes in dust deposition. \r\n\r\nThe issue of dust is not just academic. The results have implications for everything from chemical teleconnections across regions of the United States, to understanding the mechanisms behind changes in reflectivity and melting rates of alpine snow in the Rockies, and understanding trends in regional air quality and connections to changes in land use. The project will include the training of a postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student, and two undergraduate students. The portion of the work in Colorado will be carried out under the auspices of a newly developed science education and outreach effort titled the San Juan Collaboratory, designed to provide scientific information and educational opportunities to rural southwestern Colorado.",
