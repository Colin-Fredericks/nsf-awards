 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nPhotosynthetic organisms contain protective mechanisms that allow them to dissipate excess solar energy not needed for photosynthesis.  This protective process is called nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ).  Among its critical components are xanthophyll pigments, the oxygen-containing derivatives of carotenes.  These molecules are also thought to play a role in regulating energy flow as solar energy absorbed by photosynthetic organisms is converted into electrical potential.  The molecular features that control these processes are not well understood.  In this research, biochemical and spectroscopic experiments will be carried out to uncover the controlling factors for NPQ and energy flow regulation in plants and algae.  Various proposed molecular mechanisms will be tested to see how the processes function. The overall objective of the project is to examine these processes in detail in order to understand how photosynthetic organisms protect themselves from high light stress and how they regulate energy flow.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\tThe educational and training contributions of the work are that students will gain experience in the techniques for the isolation, purification and characterization of complex biological materials and in sophisticated molecular spectroscopic methods.  The training will foster organizational and problem-solving skills, writing reports and publications, and making presentations at scientific meetings where the results of the studies will be openly disseminated.  The students will also travel to the laboratories of our collaborators as needed to bring these studies to fruition as rapidly as possible.  Thus, the project provides exposure to a broad spectrum of experimental methodologies and professional experiences which will be valuable for the development of the participating students as independent scientists.  The outreach contributions of the project will include active participation in the Northeast Alliance University of Connecticut Summer Research Program for Underrepresented Minority Students in STEM Fields, the University of Connecticut NSF REU program, the Northeast Middle School Science Bowl, and Odyssey Day for Gifted and Talented Middle School Students.  The intellectual merit and societal benefits of the research program are that it will enlarge our view of how photosynthetic organisms are protected from excessive light energy absorption and respond to varying environmental conditions while maintaining efficient energy flow essential for survival.  Lessons learned from how photosynthetic organisms function in this manner can be used in the development of novel solar energy conversion devices.",
