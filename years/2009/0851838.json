 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center will provide a research program to undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Ten students will be selected to participate in an 11-week research program. The program will allow students an opportunity to obtain significant research experience in the areas of plant and life sciences. Students will conduct a research project under the guidance of senior scientists at the Danforth Center, an independent non-profit private research institute located in Saint Louis, Missouri and dedicated to fundamental research in plant science leading to discoveries for the benefit of human health and nutrition and agricultural sustainability. Students in all life science fields, not just those interested in plant science, can benefit from the program. The REU program exposes students to a rich research environment due to the wide range of expertise present, including cell biology, molecular biology, structural biology, biochemistry, microbiology, chemistry, computational biology, bioinformatics, developmental biology, genetics, genomics, and plant pathology. Each student will design and conduct a laboratory research project in collaboration with a faculty mentor, present findings in a final symposium, and prepare a written report summarizing the research. The research component is supplemented with additional educational activities, including workshops in proteomics, microscopy, and tissue culture and transformation. Weekly meetings feature guest speakers and discussions covering topics that include guidance in written and oral reports, career options, ethics in science, and the impact of, and controversies surrounding, agricultural biotechnology. More information is available at http://www.danforthcenter.org/internship, or by contacting Dr. Mark P. Running (mrunning@danforthcenter.org, 314 587-1641).",
