In this symposium, recent developments in the theory, applications and measurements of hysteresis, micromagnetics and spin dynamics phenomena will be presented. Hysteresis is a widespread phenomenon, studied most intensively in magnetism, but also found in areas outside of magnetics, such as economics, precision controls, mechanics, and many other fields. Micromagnetics is a nanoscale model\r\nof ferromagnetic materials, which provides a complementary view of magnetism, and is important also for its role in modeling electron spin dynamics, which is the basis for the emerging technology of spintronics. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe symposium will provide a special occasion for engineers, mathematicians\r\nand physicists to present and exchange ideas, methods and results. The support being sought under this proposal is to support part of the travel expenses of\r\ngraduate students to attend and participate in the Symposium.",
