Several books on this topic have\r\nbeen published since 2002, in addition to special features in journals. This Chapman Conference\r\nwill examine the ecohydrological changes taking place in semiarid landscapes, across elevation\r\nand precipitation gradients. The conference goal is to help scientists from different disciplinary\r\nbackgrounds and land managers better understand and address the substantial changes occurring\r\nin semiarid landscapes. This conference builds on the success of a previous Chapman Conference,\r\nEcohydrology of Semiarid Environments, held in 2002.\r\nIt is anticipated that approximately 100 participants will attend this conference, with a\r\nmix of 20% by invitation, ~80% contributed, and about 25% will be young scientists and students.",
