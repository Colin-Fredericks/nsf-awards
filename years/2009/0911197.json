Prof. Chabal and his students will examine the surface chemistry and chemical functionalization of technologically important semiconductor surfaces and nanostructures. The group will employ surface infrared spectroscopy, arguably the most discriminating and versatile technique to derive chemical and structural information, in conjunction with spectroscopic ellipsometry, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to study chemical processes on Ge, SiC and other III-V semiconductor surfaces. The study will be carried out in close collaboration with several theory groups in order to develop detailed understanding of the reaction pathways and product structures. The study will provide students with a unique opportunity to train in an interdisciplinary field which is of great interest to the chemical and semiconductor processing industries. Prof. Chabal and his students will contribute to various activities at UTD aiming to increase the number of students from under represented groups in science.",
