 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe development of renewable energy sources to supplant fossil fuels is of utmost importance. Plant biomass, chiefly lignocellulose, has great promise as a renewable source of energy. Exploitation of lignocellulose is likely to involve the use of microorganisms that can convert it into fuels like ethanol, butanol, or biodiesel derived from triacylglycerols and wax esters. Streptomyces bacteria, a large genus of soil-dwelling actinobacteria, have great potential as lignocellulose biorefineries because they are known to metabolize components of lignocellulose and can produce biofuels. While much is known how streptomycetes degrade cellulose and hemicellulose, comparatively little is known about the genetics and biochemistry underlying their catabolism of the lignin component of lignocellulose. An understanding of lignin depolymerization and catabolism is essential for exploitation of Streptomyces bacteria for the production of lignocellulosic biofuels. The project will employ molecular biology and microbiology methods to shed light on lignin degradation and lay the groundwork for microbial conversion of plant biomass into biofuels. Lignin degradation is well understood in fungi, but it is poorly characterized in bacteria. Thus, the project will enable compelling comparisons of this fundamental biochemical process in different kingdoms of life. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. \r\nThe principal investigator is a member of an under-represented group and has recruited women and under-represented groups to join him in his research. To further involve individuals from under-represented groups, he has formed a partnership with his alma mater, Morehouse College, a historically black college. During the project, he will host a student from Morehouse in his laboratory for mentored research. The principal investigator is also integrating research and education through an unusual partnership with teachers and their students at East Providence High School. He is jointly working to discover new lignocellulolytic streptomycetes. The collaborative project will expose students to research methods and raise scientific literacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
