 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Title: CSR:Small:Collaborative Research: Combining Static Analysis and\r\nDynamic Run-time Optimization for Parallel Discrete Event\r\nSimulation in Many-Core Environments\r\nInstitution: SUNY at Binghamton\r\nAbstract Date: 07/06/09\r\nThis project investigates how a new processor paradigm (multi-core architectures)\r\nchanges the way Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) is done. This topic is\r\nimportant given the wide use of simulation and the emergence of multi-core\r\narchitectures. PDES is likely to play an increasingly important role in discrete event\r\nsimulation as Moore?s Law is sharply curtailed and explicit parallelism becomes the\r\nmajor avenue for improving performance of sequential applications. Improving PDES\r\nperformance translates to improved.\r\nDiscrete Event Simulation (DES) is widely used for performance evaluation in many\r\napplication domains. The fine grained nature of PDES causes its performance and\r\nscalability to be limited by communication latency. The emergence of multi-core\r\narchitectures and their expected evolution into manycore systems offers potential relief\r\nto PDES and other fine grained parallel applications because the cost of communication\r\nwithin a chip is dramatically lower than conventional networked communication. Absent\r\nthis dominant effect, PDES performance will be determined by issues such as load\r\nbalancing, synchronization and optimism control, and the choice and configuration of\r\nvarious other algorithms and data structures of the simulator. Operation in a manycore\r\nenvironment introduces new system tradeoffs that must be effectively balanced by the\r\nsystem software. Primarily, the pressure on the memory system and resilience to load\r\nfluctuations will emerge as critical issues that we address in the proposed research.\r\nFinally, the more predictable nature of communication cost in this environment (due in\r\npart to the more frequent synchronization possible between nearby cores) can be\r\nexploited, especially by static analysis, for effective simulation.\r\nAs multi-cores become the default microprocessor architecture, applications that are\r\nperformance constrained must evolve to use parallelism to take advantage of the\r\nresources available on the cores. This project?s new PDES can have a significant\r\nimpact on a number of applications that rely on discrete event simulations. The PIs plan\r\nto incorporate the research results into a graduate level course on parallel simulation\r\ntechniques and to involve undergraduate students in the project.",
