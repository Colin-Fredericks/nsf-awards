 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emerging field of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy has entered an exciting phase with large-scale interferometric GW detectors (LIGO, GEO600, TAMA300, and Virgo) taking data in either science or engineering runs.  The LIGO project completed its landmark fifth science run (S5) in 2007 and will begin a new one (S6) in summer 2009. This award supports research in three critical areas relevant to LIGO data analysis: (i) searches for a cosmological or astrophysical GW background, (ii) a statistical search for GWs from gamma-ray bursts, and (iii) detector characterization.\r\n\r\nThe first project will improve our sensitivity to GW backgrounds that have a non-uniform distribution of power on the sky.  The second will develop methods to optimally use the information provided by NASA missions (Swift and Fermi) in GW searches.  The third will use advanced data mining methods to develop a better understanding of real data, which will benefit the sensitivity of all GW searches. Three graduate students will receive direct training in GW data analysis, thus adding to the growing community of researchers in this emerging field.  Since the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) is an Hispanic serving institution, the research activities will expose students who are traditionally under-represented in the areas of science and technology to forefront scientific research.  On-going major outreach programs at UTB will be able to leverage this research, creating awareness among high-school students about exciting scientific projects such as LIGO.",
