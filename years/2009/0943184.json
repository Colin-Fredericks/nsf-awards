 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). In highly dynamic information environments, how can spontaneous, self-organizing teams solve ill-defined problems? Networked individuals and affinity groups are increasingly engaged in voluntary and collective problem solving. Their voluntary virtual organizations have learned to harness the collective problem solving abilities of diverse groups. This study deeply examines voluntary teaming behavior in a subset of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) called Alternate Reality Games to discover the life cycle dynamics and characteristics of sustainable, results-oriented online teams. Because online teams, especially in Alternate Reality Games, depend upon far-flung volunteers working together through technology, the negotiation of group dynamics, problem definition and problem resolution is an ongoing, transparent process. Their reliance on technology renders the process of collective problem solving visible and available for study. \r\n\r\nWith the lens of collective storytelling, this project identifies inflection points and obstacles to problem solving. Collective storytelling is the co-construction of a story by a group to make sense of ambiguous information. Since the collective story is constantly negotiated, analysis provides insight into how players work together and choose how to solve problems. The project?s first aim will be to assess the relationship between teaming and collective storytelling through content analysis of critical gaming episodes. The second aim will be to create case studies comparing problem-solving instances to identify principles of teaming and characteristics of sustainable teams. This includes investigations into how teams handle disruptive behavior and conflicting information, thus unifying the spontaneous and potentially volatile efforts of diverse individuals. The third aim is to characterize and describe the life cycle of voluntary virtual teams. This study provides a deep understanding of collective problem solving in voluntary virtual organizations, a critical step for technology developers, decision-makers, and individuals to succeed in a world increasingly dependent on networked volunteers solving real problems together.",
