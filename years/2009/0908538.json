Typical liquid crystals are nematic and smectic\r\nliquid crystals, consisting of rod-like molecules that tend to\r\nalign themselves lengthwise along a common axis, called the\r\ndirector.  The local orientation of a nematic liquid crystal is\r\ndescribed by the director field.  However, in smectic phases the\r\nmolecules of the liquid crystal also tend to lie in layers.  To\r\ndescribe the local orientation, a smectic order parameter must be\r\nintroduced in addition to the director field.  The free energy of\r\nsmectic liquid crystals has a resemblance to the Ginzburg-Landau\r\nenergy for superconductivity, and it is a nonlinear, nonconvex\r\nsecond order energy.  While nematic phases are rather well\r\nunderstood, the mathematical theory of smectic phases is\r\ncomparatively underdeveloped.  This study consists of two main\r\nprojects.  In the first project, the investigators advance the\r\nmathematical understanding of smectic liquid crystals in the area\r\nof instabilities driven by external magnetic fields, by means of\r\nmathematical analysis and numerical simulations.  Partial\r\ndifferential equation methods for phase transition, calculus of\r\nvariations, Gamma convergence theory, and bifurcation theory are\r\nemployed.  In the second project, the investigators study\r\nferroelectric liquid crystals such as smectic C* and bent-core\r\nphases, which are named after the bent or banana-shaped\r\nmolecules.  The response time of bent-core liquid crystals is\r\nonly in the range of microseconds and thus this material offers\r\nhuge potential for many applications.  The investigator studies\r\nan electrodynamic model of the molecular reorientation of\r\nferroelectric liquid crystals. \r\n\r\n     Liquid crystals are used in many different applications such\r\nas optical switching devices and temperature sensors.  Nematic\r\nliquid crystal materials have been widely studied because of\r\ntheir applications to flat panel displays.  However, it is known\r\nthat ferroelectric liquid crystals such as smectic C phases with\r\nchiral molecules exhibit much faster switching times.  Thus\r\nunderstanding the features of smectic liquid crystals such as\r\ndefect structures and switching dynamics is a very important\r\nissue in practical applications. \r\n",
