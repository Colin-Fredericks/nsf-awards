 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is considering security and timing as primary concerns, re-envisioning computer architecture and network algorithms to provide a robust foundation for CPS.  The approach is rethinking the hardware and software divide, providing true process concurrency and isolation.  Extending these benefits to the communication network so integral to CPS, multicast and security innovations that consider CPS constraints will be proposed.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide computational and communication foundations for CPS through the following tasks.  (1) An open source hardware design will be created.  Abandoning the error-prone paradigm of shared memory communication, Precision Timed (PRET) processors for dataflow computations will be extended.  (2) The hardware/software interface will be investigated specifically for PRET architectures.  (3) A routing algorithm considering the CPS constraints will be investigated.  The constraints include efficiency, adaptability, scalability, simplicity, and security.  (4) Distributed Source Coding for CPS applications will be studied with focus on challenges from small packet sizes in these applications. \r\n\r\nThis project will engage the community and students in multiple grades and institutions, through the following undertakings. (1) A package for education and research in CPS will be assembled. This package and the material from this project in the form of tutorials, publications, and curriculum will be available to other institutions.  (2) New courses will be created integrating research results into education.  (3) A diverse group of students including women and minorities will be recruited.  (4) Two applications will be implemented in the fields of medical devices and emergency response.",
