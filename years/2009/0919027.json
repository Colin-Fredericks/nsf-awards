 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nBinuclear iron enzymes are widely distributed in nature and catalyze an extensive range of medically, industrially, and environmentally important reactions. These reactions all involve the activation of oxygen by very similar binuclear iron active sites. Intermediates can be trapped in these reactions and small binuclear iron designed peptides are available as models for these enzyme active sites. This research project involves using a wide variety of spectroscopic techniques combined with quantum mechanical calculations to understand the reaction mechanisms of this large class of enzymes and how apparently similar binuclear iron active sites perform very different functions. The achievement of these goals, in part, requires the development of new spectroscopic methods and definition of their information content from quantum theory. These studies define geometric and electronic structural contributions to O-O bond cleavage. Research also focuses on defining structural contributions to the complementary reaction of O-O bond formation by manganese cluster sites in photosynthesis. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe enzymes being studied are important in industrial synthesis, bioremediation, greenhouse gas elimination, iron metabolism, and as drug targets. The insights derived from these studies are being applied toward the development of new heterogeneous and bio-inspired catalysts. New spectroscopic methods, developed as part of this research program, have applications to a wide range of problems in chemistry, biology, materials and environmental sciences. The spectroscopic/electronic structure expertise of this research program is made available to the scientific community through a wide range of collaborations, which also leverage the impact of this research. This research provides students with a unique opportunity to use a variety of spectroscopic methods, develop new spectroscopic methodologies, and learn computational approaches to chemistry. The availability of such a wide range of techniques and theoretical insight allows students to learn to integrate these approaches to solve important problems in science. The students trained in the PI's lab (an equal gender mix) have become significant contributors in academics (> 40) and industry (> 50). This research group extensively participates in undergraduate teaching, mentoring women in science and outreach into the community to expose elementary school students in low-income areas and middle school females to science and careers in science. Through general seminars on spectroscopic methods, editing numerous books and thematic volumes, course readers, and significant participation on a range of editorial boards, this research program promotes the information content and utility of spectroscopic methods to problems in chemistry and biochemistry",
