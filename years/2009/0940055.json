 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to partially support the participation of 55 students and other early-career investigators in a Mineralogical Society of America (MSA) short course on \"Diffusion in Minerals and Melts\". It is expected that this short course will educate and train a large number of graduate students and practitioners on diffusion in minerals and melts, and the various geological applications. \r\n\r\nDiffusion is due to random motion of atoms, ions and molecules in solids, melts, fluids, and gases. Even though the process is microscopic, the effects can be macroscopic. For example, the initial phase of a gas-driven eruption is powered by bubble nucleation and growth, which is in turn controlled by diffusion that brings gas molecules into bubbles. Crystal growth and dissolution, key processes in magma solidification and evolution, are partially controlled by diffusion. Homogenization of zoned crystals and equilibrium between minerals require diffusion. One of the most important applications of diffusion is the inverse problem, to infer thermal histories such as closure temperature, apparent equilibrium temperature, and cooling rates from diffusion properties. Thermochronology and its applications to tectonic and erosion rates require a thorough understanding of diffusion in minerals. Furthermore, many geospeedometers for inferring cooling rates of rocks involve diffusion. In order to help students and practitioners to understand the basics of diffusion, and more importantly the experimental diffusion data and their applications to geological problems, the proposers will organize a Short Course on \"Diffusion in Minerals and Melts\" as part of the highly successful Short Course series by the MSA.  Associated with the Short Course will be the publication of a RiMG (Reviews in Mineralogy & Geochemistry) volume. \r\n\r\nThe Course will focus on diffusion at high to moderate temperatures in minerals and silicate melts. Although theoretical aspects will be covered, the emphasis will be on fundamental details of diffusion for direct application to geological problems, including (1) experimental methods, (2) analytical techniques, (3) a summary and assessment of diffusion data in minerals and melts (including the data and equations), and (4) various geological applications. The RiMG volume resulting from the Short Course will be a useful reference for high temperature diffusion in geology, where readers will find the necessary theoretical background, detailed discussion about experimental and analytical methods, and evaluated diffusion data. An online supplement of all collected data in a unified format will be posted on MSA web site.",
