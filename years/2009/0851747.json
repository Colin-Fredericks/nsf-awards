 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Nebraska REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Ten students will be selected to participate in a 10-week research experience in redox biology under the guidance of experienced faculty mentors. Redox biology includes oxidation-reduction linked biological reactions, redox signaling and regulation, and cellular defense mechanisms that minimize oxidative damage/stress. The summer program will enable students to explore fundamental redox processes related to biotechnology and the environment. The goal of the training program is to involve undergraduate students in broad-based research and significantly impact their career decisions. REU participants will conduct individual research projects under the guidance of a faculty mentor in the Redox Biology Center. The mentors offer a breadth of multidisciplinary approaches and share a common goal of understanding critical redox-active processes. Students will receive experimental training in a variety of areas including molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, and protein crystallography, and will utilize state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. In addition, students will attend journal club meetings, career development seminars, lunch discussion groups, and social activities. The program will conclude with students presenting their research findings at a poster session. Participant selection will be based on academic achievements, research interests, and career goals. Students at smaller institutions with limited research opportunities and those from underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply. REU participants receive a stipend, full room and board, and travel assistance. More information can be found at http://www.unl.edu/RedoxBiologyCenter/summer.shtml, or by contacting Dr. Donald Becker at dbecker3@unl.edu or 402-472-9652.",
