Smith\r\nProposal number: OS-0920114\r\nTitle:  \"Prezygotic Interspecific Reproductive Barriers in Nicotiana\"\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nGenetic, geographic and ecological processes can isolate related plants resulting in the evolution of new species. Reproductive isolation is a very important component of this process that determines whether closely related plants are sexually compatible as part of the same or different species (speciation).  Therefore, reproductive barriers facilitate the evolution and maintenance of new species. This project takes a biochemical approach to identify the proteins and mechanisms that regulates sexual compatibility among related plant species. Identification of the mechanisms will lead to a better understanding of the way plants evolve and how new species develop. This project also has direct application to understanding the production of seeds and fruits, which is very important for plant breeding and crop improvement. Plant breeding often relies on the introduction of new traits via interspecific hybridization between cultivated species and wild species, which is often prevented due to species-specific reproductive barriers. Despite the impediment that reproductive barriers create for interspecific gene transfer, little is known regarding the mechanisms and responsible gene(s). The goal of this project is to identify the protein(s) that determine sexual compatibility among related species.\r\n\r\nThis study has brought together three researchers with distinct and complementary skills in diverse areas of protein purification, reproductive biology and genetics. The project will integrate knowledge and technologies into academic courses, create new educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and actively involve students in supervised and independent research.",
