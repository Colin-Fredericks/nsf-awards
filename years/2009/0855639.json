 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to explore the physics of heteronuclear models: coupled atom-molecule systems where heteronuclear or polar molecules are formed from atoms of distinct species via interspecies Feshbach resonance or photoassociation.  The technique of the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage will be generalized to multi-level atom-molecule systems for the purpose of an efficient generation of  polar molecules.  The same technique is also applied to create a large angle atom-molecule beam splitter, which serves as the building block for an atom-molecule interferometer, capable of measuring changes that are phase sensitive not only to atomic but also to molecular beams. Electromagnetically induced transparency is studied as an  tool for detecting exotic phases in two-states fermionic models, taking advantage of the exceptionally high spatial and frequency resolving powers of modern lasers.  Phase separation in which different phases repel each other into separate spatial regions is studied with a new attitude, in which phase separation is considered as offering new opportunities for building quantum devices of practical importance.  A separated quantum phase inside an optical cavity is studied not only as a fundamental nonlinear system for the exploration of cavity quantum electrodynamics but also as a tool for precision measurement of quantum phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide more competitive research programs to students at Rowan, a predominantly undergraduate public institution.  Students are provided with chances to collaborate with the PI's former students (currently at other graduate institutions), and visiting Ph. D students or scholars from collaborating institutions, all of which represent opportunities that are traditionally only accessible to students at large research universities. The goal is to equip Rowan students with the research experience and the skills that will enable them to compete with those from nationally-recognized universities in future graduate studies or other scientific careers.  This project also aims to motivate the PI to further his effort in integrating research into teaching while advancing discovery and understanding through his active research program.  The goal is to provide undergraduate students with a more direct path to advanced research topics in atomic physics and quantum optics, while at the same time to lay groundwork that enables the students to expand comfortably into any advanced areas of study in the future.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMolecules are inherently much more complex in energy spectra than their atomic constituents.  Thus, after the experimental realization of the trapped Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), achieving molecular BEC has been regarded as another milestone in the field of ultracold atomic physics.  A major focus has been the coupled atom-molecule system where the atom-molecule conversion is accomplished either via photo- or magneto-association (Feshbach resonance). In such a system, a combination of a Raman laser field and a photo- or magneto-association field can prepare the system in a coherent population trapping state (CPT), from which atomic BECs can be coherently converted into molecular BECs by the technique of the stimulated Raman adiabatic rapid passage (STIRAP).  The technique of STIRAP has been generalized to a chainwise coupled atom-molecule system, for efficiently generating ground polar molecules, where additional intermediate states and Raman laser fields are introduced to form a chain of Lambda subsystems.  It was found that the intermediate Raman lasers not available to the single Lambda model can be used to overcome the deficiencies inherent of the single Lambda STIRAP scheme.\n\nHow to distinct and detect quantum phases in an indisputable fashion has remained a central problem in the study of ultracold atomic physics.  A detection scheme was considered in which a relatively strong coupling and a weak probe laser field are applied, respectively, between an excited and a ground state and between an excited and a spin-up state. This atom-laser arrangement forms a Lambda-type energy diagram, which facilitates the use of the principle of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) to determine the nature of pairing between spin-up and spin-down states in the two-component interacting Fermi gas.  A detection theory, formulated using both quantum optics and condensed matter physics approach, was applied to analyze the EIT spectrum.  A quasiparticle picture, which consists of a particle and a hole branch, was introduced to provide a natural and intuitive interpretation to the double EIT feature that characterizes the probe spectrum of the two-component Fermi gas operating in the boundary between the normal state and the superfluid state.  It was demonstrated that the EIT technique offers an extremely efficient probing method and is capable of detecting the onset of Cooper pair formation.\n\nThe ability of an optical cavity to provide feedback between input and output light fields can result in the modification of the atom-photon interaction in a highly nonlinear fashion. In particular, when atoms inside the cavity are in a BEC state, such nonlinearity can be Bose enhanced so that a cavity field at the level of a single photon can significantly affect the collective atomic motion.  This enhanced nonlinearity finds widespread applications including cooling cavity opto-mechanical systems.   A spin-1 spinor BEC confined in a unidirectional ring cavity was shown to exhibit simultaneous bistability both in optical and matter fields when atoms are subject to both a pump field and a cavity field of suitable polarizations.  It was shown that a combination of cavity-induced phase shift and intrinsic spin-exchange interaction of a spinor BEC leads to very strong matter-wave bistability.  Thus, this model provides a new playground for exploring the spinor dynamics and cavity nonlinear optics.\n\nA single-component Fermi gas only supports Cooper pairs with odd parities, such as the p-wave pairing, which are typically strongly suppressed owing to the centrifugal barrier in the scattering potentials of waves with finite momenta.  A three-dimensional mixture between a single-component nondipolar Fermi gas and a dipolar condensate was considered, where all the dipoles are oriented along an external field. The dipolar interaction constitutes a control knob inaccessible to nondipolar bosons.  Thus, mixing in dipolar bosons may open up new possibil..."
