Engineering principles will supplement basic science studies in engineering relevant fields (e.g. physics, chemistry, computer science and mathematics) through coursework, research, support programs and service projects. With a B.S. degree in the new Morehouse Pre-engineering program, graduates will be able to articulate to graduate engineering programs.  Graduates of the Morehouse pre-engineering program who continue their engineering education in graduate school will possess the leadership, social proclivity and academic breath obtained with a liberal arts degree and the engineering competency of an advanced degree.",
