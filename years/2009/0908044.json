Multi-object spectroscopy with Magellan/IMACS will be used to spectroscopically confirm ~3000 AGNs, reaching the classical Seyfert/quasar boundary at a redshift of 3 and including about 300 quasars with redshift > 3. The deep multiwavelength observations will allow studies of the total AGN energy density in the universe, including a bolometric luminosity function for obscured AGN to redshift ~1 and Type 1 AGN to redshfit ~4.  Time domain data will be used to measure reverberation between the continuum and the lines.  \r\n",
