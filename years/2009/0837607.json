 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\n  The ChemPRIME (Chemical Principles through Integrated Multiple Exemplars) Program is developing an approach to learning chemistry that presents Concepts in a logically developed order common to many popular texts, but allows students to choose from a wide variety of Exemplars, or subject-specific examples that illustrate the concepts, arranged in Tracks that run through the entire course.  ChemPRIME applies the tools of chemistry to issues or subjects that students are interested in.\r\n \r\n\tChemPRIME retains the advantages, and sheds the disadvantages, of previous approaches to teaching chemistry, by retaining the hierarchical development of theory while allowing students to choose cases or applications of the theory that motivate them to learn.  This project is developing exemplars for most of the concepts included in a typical general chemistry course spanning tracks like Geology; Physics/Astronomy; Engineering; Everyday Products; Sports, Physiology and Health; Biological Science; Liberal Arts; Environment and Forensics.  ChemPRIME offers an opportunity to integrate frontier developments in chemistry into the curriculum while reflecting the field's increasing contributions to other disciplines.\r\n\r\n\tChemPRIME is being developed as a MediaWiki\u00ae text in combination with the course management system Moodle\u00ae. Both MediaWiki\u00ae and Moodle\u00ae are open source, making the project readily available and adaptable by others. ChemPRIME will be disseminated through the Chemical Education Digital Library, a Pathway in the National Science Digital Library, and will draw upon and contribute to the various disciplines designated as NSDL Pathways.  The ChemPRIME design invites all users to contribute exemplars from their fields of expertise or interest.",
