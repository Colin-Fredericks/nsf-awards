Sharp, a 146' general purpose research vessel as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. University of Delaware will provide one or two shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V Sharp to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. In addition to these basic support functions, the technical support group will maintain and provide portable multibeam sonar and undulating vehicle systems to qualified users requiring those services in support of their funded research programs on R/V Sharp or other UNOLS vessels, as schedules allow. \r\n",
