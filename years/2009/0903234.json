 "awd_abstract_narration": "The issue addressed in this project for Mississippi, and perhaps other states in the Nation, is that K-12 educational systems have not been able to keep up with the changing requirements for graduates who wish to go directly into the industrial workforce. This is particularly acute in the realm of contemporary technology. This project develops a series of classes for 7th-12th grade teachers that facilitates the integration of contemporary high technology  knowledge into their regular classes. Through this mechanism, students should be better prepared to enter industry directly or to proceed into the community college system. Thus, the industries in the region should find high school and community college graduates who are better prepared for the modern day workforce within their geographical region.",
