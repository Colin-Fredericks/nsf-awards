 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award for a research program in cosmic ray astrophysics focused on the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO), an instrument designed to investigate the origin and nature of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays having energies above 10^19 eV.  Data from the PAO will help to answer a number of the most fundamental questions about cosmic ray origins, composition, acceleration mechanisms, and propagation effects and may shed light on hadronic physics at center-of-mass energies up to 450 TeV.\r\n\r\nThis group has led the development of the offline analysis software framework and made contributions to physics analysis. They plan to continue their role in software development and to extend their analysis efforts using new data. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the program includes the development of technologies and methodologies which cross domains such as connections with computer science and laboratory-based particle physics, and a vigorous outreach program involving regular newspaper, radio, and television appearances in several countries.\r\n",
