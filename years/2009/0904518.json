This project will seek to address this lack of information in the context of work by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on nanotechnology. This work brings together the key global nanotechnology players, both from OECD and non-OECD countries, through their involvement in the OECD Working Party on Nanotechnology (WPN).\r\n\r\nThis work strives to improve and help develop comparable indicators, statistics and quantitative analysis on global nanotechnology developments and its impacts. The project will combine quantitative work on indicators and statistics with qualitative company case studies.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide a sound statistical and knowledge base for policy-making and impact assessment in this field, highlighting the specific dimensions of nanotechnology, as well important differences in developments across countries and application areas, that area essential for tailored and coordinated policy efforts world wide.",
