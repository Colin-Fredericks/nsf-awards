 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PI will study swarms experimentally and theoretically from the perspective of non-equilibrium statistical physics. The project will implement a fully controlled laboratory setup for interactive swarming experiments with fish and also use previously collected data on the collective motion of locusts. The project will contrast both systems using detailed, and idealized, swarming models to study the specificities and universality of their dynamics. Statistical physics concepts will be applied to search for generic characteristics of swarms that stem from common survival constraints. Detailed digital tracking of all individuals in a swarm will be used to investigate biologically meaningful swarming states. Comparisons will be made with equilibrium and non-equilibrium physical systems such as liquid crystals, spin-systems and granular materials. The project will achieve this by: 1. Building controlled laboratory experiments where hundreds, or thousands, of fish will be tracked concurrently and their response to stimuli recorded. 2. Developing detailed, and idealized, models to capture specific and universal aspects of swarms, respectively, and to develop new (physics-inspired) analytical tools for swarms such as correlation lengths, clustering, information flow, defect dynamics etc. 3. Investigate collective effects that are typical of non equilibrium dynamical systems such as scaling-laws, pattern formation, or transitions. 4. Testing if some swarming states follow a generic behavior due to the system adaptations and, if so, exploiting the consequences of this for theoretical analysis. The research will improve our understanding of swarming systems in particular and self-organization in general by combining experimental and theoretical approaches from biological and physical perspectives. It will set up new experiments and statistical measurements that can be used beyond the proposed context. It will explore the interactions between mechanical effects and behavioral adaptation across scales, furthering our understanding of non-equilibrium systems. In addition we will pursue a universal description of certain swarming states by hypothesizing that evolved critical-like behavior may exist. The interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of this project will be emphasized through the development of a strong outreach program for the public understanding of science. Swarming demonstrations capture the imagination and allow meaningful and creative interactions allowing the fundamental principles of collective behavior to be explored from a range of complimentary perspectives.",
