 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests funds from the National Science Foundation to help defray the cost of organizing the 2009 Meeting of the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF2009) of the American Physical Society on July 26 - 31, 2009, at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan. The funds are to be used entirely to support graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who otherwise could not afford to attend the conference. The organizers will waive the registration fee for these students and postdocs, and to pay for housing costs and some travel. \r\n\r\nAt the 2009 Division of Particles and Fields Meeting the latest results in both experimental and theoretical particle physics, particle astrophysics, cosmology, and heavy ion physics will be presented in plenary and parallel sessions. Many of the talks at this meeting will be presented by younger physicists, including the graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who will be supported by this grant. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts are as follows: The proposed program of the 2009 Meeting of the Division of Particles and  Fields will promote general interest in science while advancing discovery. It will include a special lecture given to the public. The organizers will invite a speaker who is known to the public and who can present forefront results in high energy physics in a popular manner.",
