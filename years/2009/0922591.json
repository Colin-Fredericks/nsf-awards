 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grand Valley State University (GVSU) has received an award from the National Science Foundation to purchase an automated genetic analyzer and spectrophotometer for use in interdisciplinary faculty and student research and teaching.  The instrumentation will be used by faculty across a variety of biological disciplines including Molecular Ecology, Behavioral Ecology, Physiology, and others.  Investigations designed to leverage the new equipment include: 1) studying the role of hybridization in biological invasions, 2) probing the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, 3) assessing physiological changes in altered gravity conditions that simulate life on the International Space Station, and 4) examining the population genetics of cooperation and altruism in social insects.  The instrumentation will heavily impact student training at GVSU, an undergraduate institution, by providing numerous research opportunities, experiences, and skills for students.  In addition, the instrumentation will be incorporated into a number of courses in the Biology, Cellular and Molecular Biology, and other departments.  This National Science Foundation award will enhance the research environment at GVSU, and will therefore encourage and prepare students for careers in science.  Findings and results from the research projects will be presented at regional and national meetings, and in peer-reviewed journals.",
