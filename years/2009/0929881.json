 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a time critical (RAPID) response cruise by a coalition of investigators to examine a newly discovered explosively erupting undersea volcano (Mata) in the Western Pacific Ocean. The discovery of actively erupting undersea volcanoes is a rarity and data that addresses many fundamental geological, hydrothermal, volcanic, and biological issues will be collected. The volcano being investigated is presently erupting unusual lavas of compositions indicative of the initial stages of arc formation. As such they have an unusual chemistry and are thought to be associated with hydrothermal fluids of exotic and extreme compositions. The likelihood that novel and previously undiscovered microbiological life forms associated with these fluids is a study target. Short lived radiogenic isotopes in lava samples from the volcanic vent will be measured to obtain an eruptive timeline. Coexisting hydrothermal fluids and erupted lava samples will be examined to elucidate the relationship between volatile and element partitioning between solid and fluid phases during this type of magmatism. Broader impacts of the work include graduate student training, support of a PI whose gender is under-represented in the sciences, support of PIs from an institution in an EPSCoR state, and public outreach. Outreach to the Tongan people in terms of presentations on research activities and results will also be carried out.",

The eruptions were discovered by chemical and physical characteristics of the seawater above the volcanoes in Nov 2008, after which a team of us proposed to get US shipboard assets back to the area asap to make observations of the volcanology, hydrology, gas output and deep seafloor ecology, all of which are known to change rapidly during and after eruptions.  This grant covered two components of the research: Geological/volcanological/geochemical studies of eruptiing and/or recently erupted lavas, including producing short-fusw, high resolution (+- a week or two) eruption ages using radioactive 210Po in the lavas (half life of 138.4 days) and geochemical studies of organic chemicals and biomarkers in vent fluids.

See our shipboard blog at laueruptions.blogspot.com for intitial discoveries and descriptions..\n\nSubmarine eruptions in the deep sea (below about 3000 ft water depth) are the dominant form of volcanism on Earth, but because they are so remote and difficult to detect, we have very few observations of them in the aftermath and before this program had never witnessed one.  The closest we've come to seeing one is observations of a moderate depth, comparatively small eruption at NW Rota Seamount in the Mariana Islands back in 2004.  This time around, we witnessed an active eruption at WW. Mata volcano, which has a summit at 1200 m water depth (about 3700 feet).  The spectacular eruptuion included both lava flows and huge gas fueled explosions of molten magma fragments.  The chemistry of the lavas was boninite, a very rare magma type only found in young subduction zone environments, and not known to have erupted on Earth in the past 2 million years.  This discovery added to the exitement and scientific relevance of the findings of the research expedition, bercause for the first time ever we were able to study the chemistry and natural radioactivity of a fresh sample of this rare rock type, allowing us to decipher how it formed and the timescales of the magmatic processes involved.\n\nMany of the results of this expedition and follow up lab work are still in the processes of being published.  Two papers are accepted for publication and co-authored by this project's lead investigator (one about the West Mata eruption and one about volcanic plumes above the NELSC eruption site).

All of the latter contribute to the broader impacts of the research.\n\nThis intellectual merit of the study can be summarized as having greatly increased our understanding of:\n\nthe causes and consequences of explosive volcanism in the sea\nthe time scales of magma formation and eruption processes in the deep sea\nthe time scales over which deep sea organisms coloize new volcanic terrain \nthe types and quantities of volcanic gasses that enter the ocean at eruption sites\nthe types of complex organi..."
