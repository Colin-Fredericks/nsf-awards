The dates of the event are May 23-May 25, 2009. The conference features two one-hour lectures by keynote speakers in the fields of algebra and representation theory. The rest of the talks will be 20/40 minutes in length and will be presented by graduate students. The organization of the conference is also taken by graduate students from the hosting university.\r\n\r\nThe topics of the conference  cover  interactions between algebra and representation theory, in particular, ring theory, commutative algebra and its applications to algebraic geometry, homology theory, representations of  finite groups, Hecke algebras, algebraic groups, quantum groups, Lie algebras, vertex operator algebras. One of the main goals of the conference is to increase the interaction of graduate students from different universities. The participants will  communicate on the research progress, develop presentational skills, get aquainted with future collegues and find the connections  for future collaboration. Women and minorities are encouraged to particiapte in the conference.",
