Over the past decade, sculpted excitation methods have been developed to tackle problems with broad spectral windows and collection of large proton nD-NMR datasets. These capabilities are now a feature of state-of-the-art instruments. The applicability of these NMR methods will be demonstrated for studying fluorine in the structures of important fluoropolymers being developed by DuPont. The materials to be studied include: Nafion\u00ae fluorinated ionomer or its precursor (used as proton exchange membranes in fuel cells); Krytox\u00ae perfluoro(polyalkyl ether) (used as performance lubricants in computer disk drives and aerospace applications); Tedlar\u00ae poly(vinyl fluoride) (used in high performance coatings for protection in architectural and extreme environments); and Teflon-AF\u00ae and Viton\u00ae fluoroelastomer (used in other applications requiring the unique properties and inertness of fluorinated materials). \r\nThe unique expertise and resources present in the University of Akron (UA) NMR group and the groups at DuPont Central Research & Development (DCRD) are keys to the success of this project. The UA group has years of experience in applying nD-NMR to the characterization of polymers. The DCRD groups provides many interesting polymer structure problems having scientific and commercial significance, provide access to fluoropolymer synthesis and characterization facilities, and have expertise essential for understanding the polymer chemistry of the materials to be studied. The collaboration with an industrial partner assures that the results will be applied to commercially significant problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this proposal involving collaboration between U. Akron and DuPont scientists is to apply state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to study the structures of commercially important fluoropolymers being developed by DuPont. The materials to be studied include: Nafion\u00ae fluoropolymers, used in the construction of fuel cells); Krytox\u00ae fluoropolymers, which are used as lubricants in computer disk drives and in aerospace applications; Tedlar\u00ae fluoropolymers, which are used in high performance coatings in architecture and for protection in extreme environments; and Teflon-AF\u00ae and Viton\u00ae fluoroelastomers, which are used in applications requiring their unique properties and inertness. This collaboration with Dupont will assure that relevant problems will be studied at a fundamental scientific level and that the results will have commercial implications. \r\nAfter graduation, many of the students trained in this project will continue to apply their knowledge to studies in polymer science and related fields. The specific NMR expertise unique to the UA research group is important to industry, as it is the only academic group in the country to focus on advanced solution NMR studies in polymer science. Additionally, researchers at many companies and universities have made use of the unique capabilities at the UA to solve difficult research problems. This important resource will be maintained through continued funding of a strong NMR research group. The students to be initially assigned to this project are all from underrepresented groups.",
