The participants are taking four of the booklets in the National Academy of Sciences Ocean Science Series as the point of departure for developing concrete exhibit and program ideas to exchange, entertain, educate, and empower the public.  The four themes are: Coastal Hazards, Ocean Pollution, Marine Ecosystems and Fisheries, and Oceans and Human Health.\r\n\r\nWorkshop participants are exploring and evaluating several modes of communicating with the public and preparing a tool kit for each theme.  Each tool kit will include: a revised booklet based upon the NAS document;a set of references suitable for the general public; a set of recommended films and exhibits on the topic that have worked for general audiences; and concrete ideas for connecting with the public.  In addition to traditional modes of communicating with the public, a variety of social networking techniques are being explored.",
