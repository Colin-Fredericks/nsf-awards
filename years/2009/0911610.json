 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the efforts of Professor Craig L. Hill of Emory University to prepare and characterize new classes of polyoxometalate (POM) complexes containing either terminal ruthenium-nitrido bonds or late transition metals with terminal metal-oxo bonds.  The catalytic abilities of these complexes are under investigation.  In another project, robust chiral microporous solids are prepared via self-assembly methods and form the first enantiopure polyoxometallates that can undergo asymmetric oxidation catalysis.  As with most catalysis reactions, new products may be obtained more selectively, under milder conditions (air oxidation, water-compatible), and at a faster rate. The final aspect of this work includes studies of ion pairing and transport in inorganic cluster compounds which contain structurally well-defined internal water pools.  These later studies have relevance to biology, medicine and geology.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hill is actively engaged in collaborations with several Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), primarily undergraduate institutions and international groups (in Germany and France).  He is the current co-chair of the NSF Inorganic Workshop as well as the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Complexity.",
