 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to investigate the physics of micro/nano droplet formations and the resultant micro/nano structures fabricated using a hybrid manufacturing approach. The approach is to generate droplets at varying length scales (micro to nano) that will be selectively deposited on different substrate designs. Nanoimprint lithography will be used to fabricate nanometer sized patterns of varying topographies that will be deposited using the direct-write inkjet system. The ability to change drop and resultant feature sizes (micro to nano) on-the-fly with multiple material jet heads will create an effective method of building functionally-gradient materials. This research will unravel intriguing multiphysics phenomena that occur within the complex spatio-temporal domains of nanodroplet formation via molecular dynamics modeling. Experimental design and ultra high speed photography investigation will establish relationships among process parameters such as charge potentials and fluid properties for optimal nanoscale feature deposition. The educational objectives include the (1) integration of nano/micro manufacturing and computational modeling coursework into undergraduate and graduate curriculum, (2) implementation of research experiences for a predominantly minority student population and (3) societal dissemination of nanotechnology. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the proposed hybrid approach will enable the selective manufacturing of micro/nano heterogeneous structures with high aspect ratios, overhanging features, and multiple material compositions in a matrix formation. This work will give insight on the structural and functional integrity of nano and micro structures formed. Societal impact initiatives include nanotechnology education to the general public at the local science center and summer outreach camps to under-represented high-school students. A fundamental understanding of the nanoscale droplet dynamics and resultant micro/nano structures will revolutionize the fabrication of a diverse application base including functionally-gradient materials, regenerative tissue scaffolds, and bio-chem sensors that lead to next-generation devices and systems.\r\n",
