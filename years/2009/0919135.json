 "awd_abstract_narration": "An international symposium, Systems Biology: Integrative, Comparative, and Multi-Scale Modeling, will be held at Iowa State University, June 11 - 14, 2009. The Symposium will emphasize integrative and comparative systems biology, with sessions on modeling in contexts that include genomics and network control of transcription, protein interactions and metabolism in plants, animals and bacteria.  The integration of biology, computation and technology is critical for further advances in understanding complex biological processes such as organismal physiology, ecosystem sustainability and biomass and livestock production. The Symposium is organized to maximize communication at both formal (plenary talks) and informal (poster sessions, roundtable discussions, social events) levels for speakers and Symposium attendees. Broader impacts include a session for scientists and students to examine multidisciplinary educational issues related to training in bioinformatics.  Participants will evaluate types of bioinformatics training being used to educate undergraduate and graduate students at small colleges, doctoral granting institutions, as well as through peer-to-peer interactions and on-line learning.  The majority of the budget will be used to fund travel grants for students and postdoctoral associates, with an emphasis on encouraging members of under-represented minority groups to participate.",
