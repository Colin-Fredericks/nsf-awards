 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nSince the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, banning the use of methyl bromide (CH3Br), other halocarbons, and chlorofluorocarbons, the concentration of these substances in the atmosphere have declined.  This suggests the ocean should also have lower values than prior to the phaseout assuming the rates of biological production remain unchanged.  A scientist from Texas A&M University will be conducting measurements of these parameters during cruises in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basin to assess the spatial and temporal variability of surface ocean concentrations and saturation states of CH3Br and other halocarbons.  In addition, the scientist will investigate the relationship between the distribution of CH3Br and the other halocarbons and remotely sensed oceanic parameters such as sea surface temperature.  Lastly, any potential changes in the biological production or degradation rates of CH3Br would be ascertained.  Results from this research will advance the understanding of the role of the ocean in the cycling of atmospheric halocarbons, as well as further our knowledge on the origin and cycling of these components in seawater.  This scientific progression will allow scientist and modelers to develop the predictive capability on how air/sea fluxes of oceanic trace gases will respond to global changes in atmosphere/ocean chemistry and climate.  \r\n\r\nAs regards broader impacts, understanding the results and impacts of environmental policies and protocols that have already been enacted, such as the Montreal Protocol, is important in assessing the potential ramifications of enacting new environmental policies.  Results from this study would be incorporated into the teaching materials for the proponent's graduate and undergraduate classes.  One graduate student would be supported and trained as part of this project.",
