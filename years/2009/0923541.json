The proposed acquisition consists of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) pumped by a degeneratively-amplified, mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser and a CCD-based pump-probe transient spectrometer.\r\nThe broad spectral tunability coupled with a high temporal resolution provides remarkable flexibility to support a diverse array of research topics that represent a unifying theme of nanophotonic materials and devices. The topics to be covered are: (1) ultra-compact, ultra-fast optical processing on a DNA nanobreadboard, (2) photonic crystal slow wave devices, (3) photothermal cancer therapy, (4) characterization of multilayer high-k dielectrics using photon-assisted tunneling, and (5) ultrafast protein conformational change dynamics. This capital equipment acquisition offers a basic infrastructure upon which a core group of research instrumentation will be built.\r\nThe acquisition also has a broader impact on graduate and undergraduate education, as well as outreach activities. These goals will be pursued by a concerted effort to build a quantum optics and nanotechnology graduate program; by a focus on the involvement of undergraduates in cross-disciplinary research; by a mentoring effort to ensure involved undergraduates consider graduate study in science or engineering; by new undergraduate and graduate learning modules involving the laser system; and by several outreach activities in collaboration with the Discovery Center of Idaho.",
