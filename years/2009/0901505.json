 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe behavior of harmonic functions and potential functions for\r\nprocesses that have jumps will be studied. In particular, \r\nhow does smoothness in the coefficients of the operators translate to\r\nthe smoothness of harmonic and potential functions?\r\nSecondly, uniqueness for several probability models that have origins in\r\nmathematical physics and mathematical biology will be investigated. \r\nOne model is that of stochastic partial differential equations in one \r\ndimension with a space-time white noise as a driving term. A second model \r\nis that of superprocesses with branching interactions.\r\n\r\nIn recent years researchers in mathematical physics, economics, and\r\nmathematical finance have realized that to adequately model real-world\r\nphenomena, the possibility of jumps must be allowed. For example, an\r\nunexpected discovery or unexpected regional conflict might cause a sudden jump\r\nup or down in stock prices. However, some of the very basic questions\r\nabout models that incorporate jumps are as yet unanswered. One of the areas\r\nto be investigated is the regularity of such models. A typical question is:\r\nif the initial data is perturbed slightly, is it true that the behavior of\r\nthe model at future times will also be only slightly perturbed?",
