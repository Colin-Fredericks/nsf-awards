Crooks of the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct research on the synthesis and characterization of novel dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) containing less than 250 atoms. More specifically, alloy and core/shell bimetallic DENs consisting of one noble metal and one non-noble metal, and DENs consisting of one metal and one metal oxide will be synthesized and characterized by EXAFS, high-energy XRD/pair distribution function analysis, and near-atom-resolved STEM/X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy methods.  The materials are specifically chosen to be model nanoparticle catalysts that are small enough to accommodate discrete Fourier transform (DFT) calculations, allowing comparison of the experimentally determined properties of these structurally-complex nanoparticles with theory.  This establishes a route to the fundamental understanding of catalyst operation through structure-function relationships, which is a central challenge in the field of catalysis.  This research will expose students and postdoctoral researcher to high quality research through training on state-of-the-art instruments, workshops and other innovative educational activities. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCatalysts are important materials that reduce the energy required to produce the products used in every-day life.  There are a number of different approaches for discovering new catalytic materials that are more active and selective: (1) chemical intuition; (2) rapid screening of large random libraries of materials; (3) computation.  The last of these, computation is undoubtedly the most effective, but computational scientists have not had good experimental models against which to benchmark their results.  The purpose of our study is to develop methodologies for synthesizing materials against which calculations can be directly compared, and equally importantly to develop the characterization methods required to ensure that the comparison is robust.\n\nAccordingly, in this project, we expanded our studies of the synthesis and characterization of dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) containing &lt; 250 atoms in two new directions.  Specifically, we synthesized and characterized alloy and core@shell bimetallic DENs consisting of one noble metal and one non-noble metal (CuPd, CoPd, and NiPt).  These types of materials were expected to have emergent properties that are not a simple linear sum of the individual properties of the component metals.  We also proposed to synthesize and characterize DENs consisting of one metal and one metal oxide (for example, PdRuOx and AuNiOx).  Such materials are potentially good models for supported heterogeneous catalysts.  The proposed bimetallics and metal/metal-oxides are unique in that well-defined materials on this size scale have not previously been prepared or characterized.\n\n The characterization component of this research project was equal in significance to the synthetic aspect.  It included the use of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and high-energy XRD/pair distribution function (PDF) analysis.  Both of these methods can be carried out on dry DENs (for comparison to TEM data) and DENs in solution (for comparison to light-scattering and catalysis data).  Additionally, a collaboration that will lead to the first example of near-atom-resolved STEM/X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis of particles in this size range is underway.  In-situ analysis by EXAFS and quick-EXAFS (QEXAFS) were also used to study the surface properties of bimetallics and the conversion of bimetallics to metal/metal-oxide DENs, respectively.\n\n The synthesis and complete characterization of these materials is important, because both types of materials are small enough to accommodate sophisticated first-principles calculations.  Therefore, the main intellectual merit of the proposal is that the target materials are high quality, structurally complex nanoparticle models containing an appropriate number of atoms that are now available for comparison to theory.  Prior to this project, no such materials existed because of the difficulty of preparing and characterizing them.\n\n There are a number of obvious broader impacts related to this proposed research progress.  These include training of graduate and undergraduate students in fields related to sustainable energy and a clean environment.  Students working on this project have also had the opportunity to travel to other universities and National laboratories, to collaborate with colleagues who are experts in electron microscopy, light scattering, high-energy X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.  Indeed, students from my group routinely travel to synchrotron facilities to carry out such studies.  Additionally, the materials described in this proposal have been specifically chosen to be model catalysts. \n\n To ensure that there will be a \"next generation\" of scientists interested in entering the field of electrocatalysis a colleague and I co-organize a scientific meeting known as the Potter's Lodge Meeting (PLM) on Electrochemistry.  This is a small meeting, typically 15 people, held in a remote location in the Adir..."
