Althouse\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funding to enhance the UNOLS West Coast Winch Pool which supports scientific operations aboard vessels in the US academic research vessel fleet as well as other US government-owned research vessels.  The bulk of the funds provided will purchase portable winches and other components to support science operations at sea.  This year?s funding request for the West Coast Winch Pool will include administrative and maintenance support for the pool in general as well as purchase of the following items:\r\n\r\n1.\tSlip Ring for existing 0.681 fiber optic winch\r\n2.\tTwo (2) Deep Sea Mooring Recovery Winches\r\n\r\nThese winches and handling systems will support a wide variety missions on all UNOLS vessels.  The UNOLS West Coast Winch Pool, and corresponding East Coast Winch Pool at WHOI, will also serve to ensure that the equipment meets current UNOLS standards, provides commonality of design, and provides proper maintenance, administrative and logistical support to the academic fleet and the science community at large.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed UNOLS West Coast Winch Pool.  The shared-use equipment purchased, and the administrative structure established to support the equipment, will provide improved services to both the vessel operators and the scientific community.  The Winch Pool structure will also ensure proper maintenance of equipment, commonality of design, compliance with current standards, and efficiencies to NSF with regard to logistics, tracking and oversight of shared-use assets.  The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.  Scripps participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events, student tours, and hosting of government officials, dignitaries, and science communities while its vessels are in foreign ports. \r\n\r\n",
