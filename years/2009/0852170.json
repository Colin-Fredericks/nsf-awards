 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating in the Conference ``Twenty Years of Wavelets\"  that will take place May 15-17, 2009  at DePaul University, Chicago, IL.  Support will be provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for some plenary speakers. It is understood that much of the funding will be directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain senior participants will be funded as well.\r\n\r\nThe program will feature about thirteen invites speakers, who will deliver one-hour lectures, and a number of contributed talks. The principal objective of this conference is to provide a forum for presentation of the current state of the art of the theory of wavelets as well as for dissemination of recent results and discussion of outstanding problems. Another, equally important, objective towards this end is to involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and mathematicians from other under-represented groups.  Several junior scientists and graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.",
