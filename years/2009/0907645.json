 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bio- and Nano-mechanics and their applications are playing an increasingly important role in the growth of the global economy.  Based on the interplay between bio- and nano-mechanics, the new generation of bio materials has unique structure and properties, and could advance both science and engineering. To promote the international collaboration among researchers, educators, students and practicing engineers, the objective of this project is to organize the 2nd US-China NSF Workshop and Summer Institute of Bio- and Nano-Mechanics and Applications (UCWSI2009), to continuously exchange the research and educational advances as well as technological innovations in this rapidly evolving area, and to identify the future tasks. To meet the urgent need for the US students (who have had no exposure to Asian culture) to get the real experience and to leverage the financial support from the local organizing committee, the UCWSI2009 will be held at Dalian University of Technology in China in summer 2009. The UCWSI2009 consists of a summer institute and workshop with sessions in different areas of bio and nano mechanics and materials. In the summer institute, comprehensive lectures including lab visits will be delivered to young faculty and students by the leading experts in the field, while active researchers will exchange recent results in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe UCWSI2009 could promote the international collaboration in research, education and development, and make an immediate contribution to the progress of nano and bio science and engineering by disseminating the new findings and integrating different team efforts among active researchers, educators, students and practicing engineers. A special effort will be made to invite participants from the groups underrepresented in science and engineering. Thus, the UCWSI2009 would have an international impact on developing complementary approaches that are mutually beneficial, and accessible to the whole community.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by OISE.",
