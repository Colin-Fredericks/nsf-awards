 "awd_abstract_narration": "For fifty years, the Tibetan Plateau has been recognized as the largest topographic feature that perturbs atmospheric circulation.  It serves as an ideal field laboratory for understanding the geodynamic processes that build high terrain.  Accordingly, the growth of the plateau should have altered atmospheric circulation and therefore written an evolving paleoclimatic signature not only on eastern Asian regional climates, but on global climate as well.  Despite many recent studies, we still do not know precisely when the Tibetan Plateau reached its current dimensions and how it perturbs atmospheric circulation.  This project brings together geodynamicists, atmospheric scientists, and paleoclimatologists in a multidisciplinary study of the when and the how.\r\n\r\nOne of the major goals of the project is to quantify the extent to which Tibet has grown by crustal thickening, by thrust faulting and folding, by flow within the crust that redistributes material there, or by replacement of cold mantle lithosphere with hotter material (all in a state of isostatic equilibrium). Such quantification will take big steps toward the understanding of how high plateaus are built and how continental lithosphere deforms, topics at the forefront of geodynamics. \r\n\r\nDetermining how Tibet has grown will require determining when crustal shortening and thickening occurred, using basic field methods and modern laboratory techniques, and quantifying paleoaltitudes with new isotopic tools. Applying such paleoaltimetric techniques, however, requires an understanding not only of how the atmosphere transports isotopes, but how the evolving high terrain affected surface temperatures at times in the past. Even if the project?s focus were solely on how Tibet has grown, a meteorological component of the study, focused particularly on eastern Asia?s hydrological cycle, would be necessary. \r\n\r\nMost continental paleoclimatic indicators are thought to be more sensitive to precipitation than to temperature, and among the unknowns of future climate, the hydrological cycle stands out.  Accordingly, a major focus will be on understanding how high terrain like Tibet affects the hydrological cycle of eastern Asia, and China in particular. These studies will focus on: (1) how the plateau, as both a topographic obstacle and a sink for solar radiation, affects atmospheric circulation; (2) how the atmosphere transports stable isotopes (\u00e418O and \u00e4D); (3) how it affects mid-latitude climate variability, including how, via lee cyclogenesis, it lofts and transports dust, and (4) how vegetation feeds back on atmospheric circulation and the hydrological cycle.  As links from geologic processes occurring at multi-Myr time scales to those on human time scales, the Principal Investigators plan studies that specifically examine paleoprecipitation over the past few hundred thousand years, using both loess deposition and speleothems that quantify paleoclimate. \r\n\r\n",
