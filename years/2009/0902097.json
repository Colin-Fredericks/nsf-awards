 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project investigates the emergent processes being developed by public information officers as they make use of disaster-relevant information available through new social media.  Peer-to-peer communication, through mobile and online technologies and the activities of citizen journalists and other networked members of the public, have made possible the ability of government officials to tap into public communications in near-real time.  Processes to facilitate information access, retrieval, interpretation, verification, and validation are being defined as decision makers and public servants recognize the potential value of new social media in disaster response.  To study these emergent processes, we will conduct field observations within a Joint Information Center during the Democratic National Convention, collect relevant documents such as Media Monitoring and Analysis reports, and conduct face to face interviews with key informants who supported DNC media monitoring activities or were actively engaged in policy and agenda setting for new social media during the DNC response. Analysis following from observations, interviews, and secondary document analysis will provide theoretical developments in the areas of public policy, information and communication technology-enabled warnings and risk communication for extreme events, and contribute to knowledge on the nature of emergent practices around the uses of new social media for crises and disaster.\r\n\r\nDue to the groundswell of technology development, the increase in public participation in new social media, and the resulting questions about effective, and appropriate, ways to access and utilize information flowing peer-to-peer in disaster, this research will have direct benefits to emergency managers and public officials tasked with ensuring safety and security to the public at risk. Investigation into these emergent processes will have direct effects on the development of plans and policy for future disaster events among all levels of government.",
