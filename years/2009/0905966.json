 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Minority Postdoctoral Fellowship will create new knowledge about the relationship between residential segregation and crime.  This project will develop statistical and economic models to ascertain the direction of causality between segregation and crime, in addition to investigating the optimum levels of racial integration that minimize crime rates.  Previous research has not given much attention to these questions and consequently overlooks the possibility that residential segregation may not cause crime if levels of racial segregation remain stagnant while crime rates decline.\r\n\r\nUsing a uniquely constructed dataset, the Fellow will investigate how the stability of neighborhood racial segregation is causally related to the precipitous and unexpected decline in crime during the mid to late 1990s.  This period presents a unique opportunity to understand whether the decline in crime was caused by segregation stabilization or slight gains racial integration because of vast economic expansion and minimal changes in residential locations by race.  By holding constant the level of segregation, or when increases in segregation cease for a neighborhood, the Fellow will dissect changes in crime rates that would not be due to increases in segregation beyond its initial neighborhood level. This would be evidence that segregation does not cause the waxing or waning of crime rates. The major implication would be that crime rates cause segregation or have no effect.\r\n\r\nThe Fellow will use cities that did not experience changes in their segregation measures as counterfactuals for cities that experienced change by employing an innovative and new methodological technique in experimental and causal studies: the synthetic control method.  This method will allow the Fellow to make causal inferences in comparative case studies with aggregate data, even if the data contain a single city that is exposed to an event or intervention (segregation stability) over time.  \r\n\r\nThis research project will be conducted at the University of Washington, under the direction of Dr. Ross Matsueda in the Sociology Department.  Dr. Matsueda?s current and previous work explores the role of segregation, racial perceptions, and urban structural inequality in explaining urban crime patterns using a variety of statistical methods. His research incorporates social demography with careful analyses of crime, and the University of Washington has both the relevant contacts and intellectual resources necessary to carry out the Fellow?s proposed research and training in crime, methods, and demography.\r\n\r\nThe Fellow intends to expand his training by auditing courses on crime, graphical information systems, and statistics (Bayesian and hierarchical models).  The fellowship tenure will enable the Fellow to submit dissertation articles for publication, complete and present this proposed project, and attend departmental seminars in demography, statistics, and sociology.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The PI also co-authored a technical report on population estimates and the NLSY79 for the Pew Public Safety and Mobility Project, which was published on Harvard University?s website and later reprinted in Introduction to Forensic and Criminal Psychology, 4th Edition by Howitt Dennis.  PI-Sykes also co-authored a chapter in The Benefits (and Burdens) of the American Community Survey (ACS), edited by the Committee on National Statistics for the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe intellectual merit of my work has focused on the demographic consequences of mass incarceration.  Specifically, my post-doctoral research investigated how the exclusion of inmates from national household-based surveys affected estimates of fertility, educational completion, and voting.  This research resulted in a number of broader impacts, that resulted in my coauthor/mentor presenting our research findings to national agencies and policymakers, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2013); the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) (2013); and the Parental Incarceration Workshop, convened by the American Bar Foundation, at The White House (2013).  Also, our research findings were showcased in national magazines and non-profit organizational reports that reach a broad audience, including the \"State of the Union\" issue of Pathways magazine (2017), published by Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality; the Population Reference Bureau?s (PRB) research on parental incarceration (2014); and the Vera Institute of Justice?s parental incarceration report (2016).\n\nIn addition to producing original research, PI-Sykes completed post-doctoral research training in criminology and quantitative methods at the University of Washington.  He audited several courses, including graduate courses on Criminology in the Department of Sociology and Game Theory in the Department of Economics.  He also attended weekly departmental colloquia in criminology, sociology, and demography.  \n\nAs a part of PI-Sykes? academic training, he taught one class a year in the Department of Sociology.  During the Winter of 2010, the PI taught an undergraduate course on criminology to prepare him for an academic position.  He also taught a course on population problems during the Winter of 2011.  \n\nFinally, during Fall 2010, PI-Sykes applied and interviewed for academic positions.  Unfortunately, the lingering effects of the Great Recession meant that there were few advertised positions for tenure-track assistant professors.  However, PI-Sykes secured a tenure-track position at DePaul University during 2011-2014 before being hired at the University of California-Irvine in Fall 2014.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/20/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bryan L Sykes"
