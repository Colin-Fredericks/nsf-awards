The project is prototyping and producing 12 open-source, validated interactive exhibits about proportion: fractions, ratios, similarity, scaling, and percentages, basic concepts for understanding Algebra.  The eight best exhibits will be replicated for each MathCore museum and the exhibits will be supported by a limited-access website designed to support and extend repeated use of exhibits and further exploration of ratio and proportion.  Selinda Research Associates will conduct a longitudinal evaluation of the project. CRSME will conduct a research study of selected exhibit prototypes to investigate when children start to work on proving relations between similarity and proportion in informal settings, the relationship between children's artwork and mathematical insight, and the roles of bodily activity in learning to see relations in similarity and proportion.  Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications, at professional meetings, at the Association of Science and Technology Center's RAP Sessions at the NCMLS, and through the project's website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA partnership of four science museums (Explora in Albuquerque, NM; the Museum of Life + Science in Durham, NC; the Museum of Science in Boston, MA; and the Science Museum of Minnesota in Saint Paul) and two research centers (the Center for Research in Mathematics and Science Education at San Diego State University and TERC in Cambridge, MA) worked together to develop a set of interactive exhibits on the mathematics of ratio and proportion.  The exhibits were designed to involve visitors\u00c6 bodily motions, to promote conversation, to be accessible to many audiences, to serve repeat visitors, and to provide evidence of use by past visitors.  The museums produced and tested 18 prototype exhibits, replicated four copies of eight of these, and installed them at each of the museums.  All exhibits had simple titles (e.g. Sensing Ratios) that referred to the math concepts involved.  In order to encourage exploration, labels in English and Spanish provided challenges for visitors (e.g. \"Practice doubling the size of objects in three dimensions &ndash; height, length, and width.\") rather than detailed instructions and content explanations.  A longitudinal research program recruited four parent/child respondent groups to visit the exhibits at each of the four museums six times over 18 months.\n\nIntellectual merit\n\nThe project produced exhibits to invite and support repeated use by family visitors over many museum visits.  Relevant factors to the success of the exhibits were incorporating kinesthetic exploration, parental involvement, exhibit open-endedness and responsiveness to visitors, and learning support tools.\n\nThe summative research study of four parent/child pairs at each of the four museums over a period of 18 months found:\n\nmost respondents enjoyed the exhibits, with some exhibits emerging as favorites over the course of the study;\nrespondents engaged with the exhibits in many different ways, and increased the sophistication of their engagements over time; \nthere were many indications that visitors to all four exhibitions engaged with math and math-related concepts in many different ways, especially through using their bodies and moving in space; \neven as they engaged with the exhibits, many visitors did not see themselves engaging in math because they correlated mathematics with manipulating numbers; and\nthe exhibition seems to be engaging visitors on many mathematical levels, from making basic qualitative comparisons between (what the mathematically inclined would call) variables to (somewhat less frequently) using mathematical tools like measuring and graphing to (much less frequently) using numerical ratios and proportions to meet challenges set by the exhibits or by others in their groups.\n\n\nThe research work of the project has contributed theoretical advances regarding the roles of gestures in the development of mathematical imagination and the relationship between mathematics learning and the development of fluency with physical mathematical tools.  Through case studies of visitors who engaged with an interactive mathematics exhibit in a science museum, we found that the emergence of perceptuomotor integration supports mathematical imagination.  We found that the gestures that visitors make when working with math exhibits mark profound transformations of participants\u00c6 experiential histories and open up their insights into the math that they are trying to imagine.\n\nBroader impacts\n\nThe summative study found that the most effective visitor experiences were at exhibits that didn\u00c6t simply have multiple challenges or ways for visitors to interact, but rather had a variety of appropriate ways for kids of various ages/stages of mathematical development to engage in productive and satisfying ways, and for adults of various levels of sophistication and math ability to find ways to support and facilitate their children\u00c6s interactions, even when those ways included parents and children learning together, side by side. Because they wer..."
