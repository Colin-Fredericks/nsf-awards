 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)\r\n\r\nThe project is implementing an introductory nanotechnology course for undergraduate Applied Engineering Technology (AET) students.  The course includes hands-on laboratory and project-based components using the Lean Six Sigma methods and principles. These are introducing AET students to the foundations of nanotechnology and exposing them to exciting discoveries and applications in this emerging field through classroom instruction, guest lectures, and laboratory practices. The course includes the characterization of nano-manufacturing pilot-scale processes using lean manufacturing principles and statistical control methods for these processes. The course is also being offered at several community colleges and high schools that have an ongoing partnership with the principal investigator's institution.  The evaluation effort, led by an independent expert, is using document analysis, surveys, and direct observations to monitor the project's progress.  The instructional materials and project results are being disseminated through website postings, through presentations at conferences, through journal articles, through the community college partnerships, and through programs for K-12 teachers.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the materials, the outreach to community college faculty members and high school teachers, and a special focus on recruiting minority students.",
