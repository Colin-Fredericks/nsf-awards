 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue work on the development of methods for the formation of C-C and C-N bonds by facile oxidative reactions.  While dimerizations of phenol derivatives are well-recognized processes, little progress has been made in the development of catalytic asymmetric methods for the formation of chiral biaryls via oxidative dimerization.  Studies to further elucidate the mechanism of the complex catalytic cycles involved will be undertaken.  Hypothesis driven screening of ligands with transition metal oxidants will be carried out to identify new useful catalysts.  The developed catalysts will also be used to discover new oxidative reactions.  \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Marisa Kozlowski of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania.  Professor Kozlowski's research efforts revolve around the development of facile oxidative methods for the formation of C-C and C-N bonds.  Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as oxygen is used as the terminal oxidizing agent.  Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and materials science industries.",
