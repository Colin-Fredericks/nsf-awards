 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue work on the development of novel methods for the construction of biaryl compounds.  During the upcoming funding period, research will be focused in three areas.  First, the development of enantioenriched methods for constructing biaryl compounds using chiral dienes will be studied.  Current methods are limited by substrate scope and scalability.  Second, the synthesis of a series of axially chiral biaryl amino acid compounds and their coupling within standard polypeptide chains will be explored.  Axially-chiral amino acids are a new class of peptide mimetics and will provide novel tools for biochemists.  Third, the utility of ortho-nitro phenyl alkynes to undergo [3+2] dipolar cycloadditions will be investigated.  Previously, the feasibility of [4+2] cycloadditions has been demonstrated using this protocol and this new study will help to expand the scope of this cycloaddition approach to polyaromatic compounds. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Rich Carter of the Department of Chemistry at Oregon State University.  Professor Carter's research efforts revolve around the development of novel methods for the construction of complicated polyaromatic compounds.  Such compounds have considerable applications as ligands in the field of asymmetric catalysis as well as key pharmacophores in the pharmaceutical industry.",
