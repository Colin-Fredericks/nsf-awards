 "awd_abstract_narration": "0824683\r\nSchiller\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis proposal seeks funding to upgrade an existing Thermo Element 2 ICP-MS with an Apex-Q high-sensitivity inlet system, a membrane desolvation system, an SC-Fast autosampler, an Apex-FAST inlet system and an additional mass flow controller/regulator for methane introduction in the nebulizer gas mixture. These upgrades will increase system sensitivity, reduce oxide isobaric interferences, improve sample throughput, allow saline sample analysis, and improve overall performance. The ICP-MS upgrades will have a significant impact on several existing projects: 1) elemental analysis will help elucidate the sources, fate and transport of trace metals and colloidal material in the Yukon River system in Alaska, offering insights into watershed changes resulting from Arctic warming. 2) Trace elements will be used in conjunction with nutrient data to determine water movements and sources within the Louisiana Shelf system. The methane introduction system will reduce sample prep. And, 3) Trace element distributions will be assessed in oceanic systems to better understand Al, Ga and Mn cycling and their impact on oceanic primary productivity. Users at SM, outside universities, government agencies and commercial entities are also identified in the proposal \tShiller will be responsible for interfacing the new instrument upgrades. The facility works as a fee-for-service laboratory, charging different analysis rates for university, government and commercial users. A full-time technician is employed to operate the instrument. Researchers are also allowed to visit the facility to aid in sample preparation and analysis. The USM ICP-MS facility serves an array of users both inside and outside the USM community. Greater sensitivity, sample throughput and more robust, less time-consuming analyses will allow the facility to serve more customers and obtain higher quality data. The PI has three PhD and one MS student who use the instrument for their education and research. The lab has sponsored an REU summer student and a high school volunteer.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
