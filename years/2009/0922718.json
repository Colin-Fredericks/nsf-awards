 "awd_abstract_narration": "The LI-COR Infrared Imaging System acquired with this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will enhance protein based research by several Colleges, Research Centers, and regional collaborators located near Erie, PA. Specific projects focus on the determination of toxin abundance and distribution by phages and bacteria in nature, identification of genes involved in axon pathfinding in zebrafish, and examination of gene expression patterns involved in wound healing, ripening of tomatoes, and cold tolerance in insects. These projects representing diverse fields of Biological and Biochemical study will allow for state of the art training in protein analysis for undergraduate students with plans to pursue graduate studies or science careers. Moreover, class based laboratory projects in courses including Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Instrumental Analysis will allow for further training of hundreds of undergraduate students with various backgrounds and interests in research advancement not directly related to these specific faculty mentored research projects.  Results of the research projects enabled by the LI-COR system will be presented by Mercyhurst students and faculty at regional or national meetings, published in peer-reviewed journals, and made available on the departmental WWW-site.",
