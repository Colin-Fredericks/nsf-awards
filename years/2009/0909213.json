The format follows one\r\nintroduced by Oxford University applied mathematicians in 1968,\r\nwhich has been replicated frequently in the UK, Canada, Europe,\r\nand in various other countries (there are 8-10 such workshops\r\neach year).  The format consists of an initial presentation of a\r\nnumber of problems by industrial scientists/engineers.  The\r\naudience is then organized into small groups to work separately\r\non each problem for 3-4 days.  An oral reporting session\r\nconcludes the week, followed by a written report on each problem\r\nsome weeks later.  The participants in the workshop consist of\r\nfrom 30-40 graduate students and about 30 faculty, and with an\r\nexpectation of at least 6 problems from industry this means that\r\neach problem is worked on by 10 applied mathematicians.  The\r\nworkshop is preceded by a student modeling camp which follows a\r\nsimilar format except each problem is presented by a faculty\r\nmember.  Some of these problems may have been partially addressed\r\nby the faculty presenter, others not, and the aim of the camp is\r\nto bring the student participants into the culture of intensive\r\ngroup work, and to give them confidence in starting the week when\r\nALL the participants start on NEW, practically-important problems\r\nknowing that their experience and hard work will prove fruitful. \r\n\r\n     Apart from a substantial record of success in providing\r\nanswers to the problems (this is catalogued at a web-site where\r\ne-prints for 250 individual reports from recent workshops are\r\navailable in many, quite diverse, application areas), there are\r\nmultiple goals for the event: establishment of closer connections\r\nbetween industrial and academic scientists; education of students\r\nand faculty about the requirements of industry in the use of\r\nmathematics; training of students in group participation projects\r\n(the norm in industry), and the experience of working alongside\r\nfaculty and joining in the ups and downs of intensive work where\r\nprogress is measured by an industrialist in need of a result. \r\nProblems committed to the workshop include one from a\r\nsemiconductor company for modeling current flow in a new design\r\nnanoscale transistor, and two from bio-tech companies, one\r\nrelating to a medical device that has unwanted internal\r\nvibrations and the other needing statistical modeling for\r\nmicro-array analysis.",
