 "awd_abstract_narration": "New, GK-12: A Multi-Disciplinary Research and Teaching Program in Biomedical Engineering for Discovery and Understanding of Cell Communication\r\n\r\nThis inventive program is designed to train a new generation of scientists in biomedical science and engineering who are inter- and multi-disciplinary in their training, better equipped for multilevel communication across ages (GK-12) and fields (engineering, biology, and chemistry), and finally prepared to take leadership roles for scientific inquiry and progress into the 21st century. The research component consists of activities in silicon sensor design, modeling, and understanding how molecules move and the functions of multi-cellular tissues and organ systems in response to external chemical and physical stimuli through intercellular communication. The research is critical for continued understanding and advances in some of the fundamental questions facing biology and medicine, and ultimately our society for better quality of life. The educational component consists of activities to advance biomedical engineering and to provide innovative changes to graduate education by developing a new generation of scientists with transferrable skills in global culture and diversity, leadership, civic and public engagement, innovation, ethics, and communication. The graduate fellows and doctoral advisors collaborate with K-12 teachers to make new STEM content using engineering approaches accessible to K-12 STEM education. The participation of industry partners provides practical experiences for graduate fellows, teachers, and K-12 students in the program.\r\n",
