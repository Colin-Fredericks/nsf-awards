 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the\r\nevaluation and optimization of a promising sorbent, Silica-Titania Composites\r\n(STC), for mercury removal from coal-fired power plant scrubber water to\r\nbelow 10 ppt. Coal-fired power plants are a predominant mercury emitter in\r\ngases and liquids. There are no commercial technologies for mercury removal\r\nfrom scrubber water to levels anticipated under future regulations (i.e., 1 to\r\n10 ppt). Sol-gel Solutions, LLC (Sol-gel) has obtained mercury concentrations\r\nbelow 1.3 ppt when evaluating the STC for mercury removal from a mixed\r\nwastewater from a coal-fired power plant. These levels would comply with the\r\nGreat Lakes Initiative, a strict criterion that will be enforced in parts of\r\nthe U.S. in 2010. The objective for the proposed project is to optimize the\r\ntechnology for mercury removal from scrubber water from several coal-fired\r\npower plants, with the ultimate goal of designing a commercial system. It is\r\nexpected that the STC will effectively remove mercury to below 10 ppt, with\r\nthe potential of being recovered and reused.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are the protection of humans and\r\nwildlife from exposure to mercury. In humans, this exposure may impair\r\nneurological development, particularly in fetuses and during early childhood.\r\nA key element of the proposed work will be the promotion of interest in\r\nscience and engineering via dissemination of the learnings from the proposed\r\nwork and related fundamental science to high school and community college\r\nstudents, among others, via a targeted \"webinar\" and newsletter.",
