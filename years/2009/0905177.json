 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nConcurrency-related vulnerabilities are pervasive in modern computing \r\nsystems. Concurrency exploits include time-of-check-to-time-of-use \r\n(TOCTTOU) race conditions in file systems, attacks on signal handlers, \r\nand evasive malware that uses concurrency to escape sandboxing \r\nmechanisms. As processors feature ever more parallelism, and \r\ncomputers process more of our sensitive data, defending against \r\nconcurrency attacks is a key challenge for the coming decade. \r\n\r\nThe first goal is to protect legitimate applications from concurrency \r\nattacks when they access system resources (e.g., prevent TOCTTOU \r\nattacks on file accesses and exploitable race conditions in signal \r\nhandlers). The objective is to provide application programmers with \r\nmechanisms and policies for synchronizing access to system resources \r\nso they can avoid unintentional vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nThe second goal is to provide strong confinement of untrusted code in \r\nthe presence of concurrency, i.e., blocking intentionally malicious \r\nbehavior. Today's malware abuses concurrency mechanisms to bypass and \r\ncircumvent containment mechanisms like reference monitors and system \r\ncall wrappers. Providing robust system support for containing \r\nmalicious code is a critical challenge in intrusion detection and \r\nprevention. \r\n\r\nModern computing systems fundamentally depend on concurrency for their \r\nperformance and functionality. Making sure that concurrency is used \r\nsecurely is essential for building a trusted cyber infrastructure. \r\nThis research will have a significant impact on the practical \r\ndevelopment of secure software, and enable security-critical \r\napplications to realize the performance benefits of today's highly \r\nparallel systems.",
