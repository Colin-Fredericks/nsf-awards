Austin State University, five east Texas school districts (Nacogdoches ISD, Lufkin ISD, Palestine ISD, Tyler ISD, and Rusk ISD), the Region 7 Education Service Center, and the non-profit Educational Advancement Foundation. The partners are working together to develop and retain sixteen Master Teaching Fellows who will be secondary mathematics leaders able to facilitate efforts to improve mathematics instruction in their respective schools and districts. The Fellows are participating in a leadership training program that provides in-depth study of mathematics and educational leadership, are providing mentoring to inservice and preservice teachers, and are functioning as content specialists within their districts on a variety of advanced mathematics topics. Fellows are also participating in leadership training to include differentiated instruction for diverse populations and inquiry-based/discovery learning. The project is being rigorously assessed to determine the impact of the program on the Fellows' content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, instructional practices, and leadership knowledge, ability, and practice and ultimately the impact of the program on their students' mathematics learning and participation in advanced-level mathematics courses.",
