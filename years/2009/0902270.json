 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFinancial support is requested to provide travel funds to ten graduate students, ten postdocs, and ten junior operator theorists in the United States who do not have support from NSF or other sources. The funds would allow these thirty mathematicians to attend the International Workshop in Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA 2009), to be held at CIMAT (Center for Research in Mathematics), Guanajuato, Mexico, during May 25-29, 2009. The PI is a member of the Scientific Committee of IWOTA 2009. Primary consideration will be given to requests for travel funds coming from women and members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences.\r\nThe International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA) has met biannually since 1981, and more frequently in recent years (starting in 1995), rotating  among twelve countries on four continents. The original concept of the workshop was as a satellite conference for operator theorists to the broader based international symposia on Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS). While this concept is still in place, the scope of IWOTA has broadened considerably in recent years and the Workshop has now attained an independent identity as a major world-wide conference for recent developments in core operator theory and its applications.\r\n\r\nThis award is being co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
