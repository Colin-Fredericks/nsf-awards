 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a high-performance system to target individual bio-species with dramatically enhanced specificity and sensitivity. The approach is based on utilizing smart nanoparticles, encapsulating various chemicals and equipped with homing features, to provide a vehicle for pin-point delivery of payloads at a nanoscale with high efficiency. Current systems utilize drugs with very low specificity resulting in serious side effects and poor system response. Organic-inorganic nanoparticles will be functionalized with antibodies for specific binding to circulating tumor cells flowing in complex mixtures to improve the system performance.\r\nThe intellectual merit lies in the goal of selectively capturing a rare moving bio target that is still a tremendous engineering challenge. Metastatic cancer cells circulating in the blood stream will be targeted. To meet this challenge, unique trans-membrane cell-cell adhesion molecules are used as receptors. The antibodies on the hybrid nanoparticles, having a liposomal bilayer structure and a silicate surface, are used as homing ligands for selective binding to the target cell receptors.\r\n\r\nThe project could have a major impact by applying the proposed methodologies not only to detection but also diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of diseases. An automated immunoassay employed at the point-of-care with enhanced specificity will increase the efficacy of patient treatment helping eradicate diseases such as cancer. The proposed project directly supports the Bio-MEMS educational program currently under development; it incorporates workforce development by providing an opportunity for students to carry out advanced interdisciplinary research. Science education outreach for K-12 and general communities will also be arranged.\r\n",
