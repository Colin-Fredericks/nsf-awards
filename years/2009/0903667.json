 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Video Bioinformatics Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) brings together expertise from engineering, information technology and life sciences to open new doors by enabling the study of continuous and dynamic biological processes in living systems that are captured live by video in real-life experiments. Traditionally, living systems have been studied as static images; scientists must infer the processes that produce growth, disease, healing, and death. The scientific community does not yet have a systematic way of examining moving biological images and understanding their dynamics. This IGERT addresses the need by bringing experts from widely divergent backgrounds and by integrating multiple imaging modalities with computational techniques for video data mining, knowledge discovery and visualization. Each student will participate in an intensive summer workshop before the first year of graduate study.  A new interdisciplinary curriculum will train the next generation of engineers and scientists to solve old and new biological and computational problems. Information technology students will learn about the unique needs of studying living systems, and develop methods to enhance the study of these systems. Students in the life sciences will learn how to develop and apply effective computing techniques to dynamic biological problems. Interdisciplinary project-oriented team-taught courses and group projects are important educational elements. The program provides continuous mentoring, teaching and leadership opportunities, internship in industry or government, weekly seminars, yearly retreats, and workshops on ethics and communication skills. The program will aggressively recruit students from groups underrepresented in science and engineering.  The research impacts a large number of fields where one must analyze massive video datasets and need highly efficient and effective ways to retrieve information.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",

A great benefit will be increased productivity, improved sensitivity, and enhanced analysis of data. Spatiotemporal video analysis, querying and indexing may benefit a large number of fields: news, entertainment, weather bureaus, libraries, and security/intelligence agencies all must analyze massive video datasets and need highly efficient/effective ways to retrieve information.</p>\n<p>We developed an innovative graduate research, education and training program that provided a balanced education for students (without increasing their course load) with disparate backgrounds in engineering, computer science and life sciences. Our unique curriculum was based on the fact that both genome sequences and video imaging are essential to understand the dynamic processes of living things. The challenge was to design an innovative and highly interesting interdisciplinary curriculum and training program that exposes students to multiple imaging modalities at varying spatial and temporal resolutions and associated computational methods for video mining and knowledge discovery. Our interdisciplinary education effectively fused life sciences with engineering and computer science.</p>\n<p>We developed and received approval from the various Academic Senate Committees for seven new IGERT graduate courses in Electrical and Computer Engineering: EE 270 Introduction to Video Bioinformatics, EE 271 Multiscale Analysis of Biological Systems, EE 272 Introduction to Imaging Bioinstrumentation and Analysis, EE 273 Live Imaging and Analysis of Cellular and Molecular Behaviors, EE 274 Introduction to Medical Imaging and Analysis, EE 275 Project in Video Bioinformatics and EE 276 Colloquium in Video Bioinformatics. EE 270, 271, 272, 273, and 274 are cross listed with the Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics (GGB) graduate program. EE 271 is cross listed with Bioengineering. These courses are required courses for all IGERT fellows. Non-IGERT students also take these courses. The courses are shared by the IGERT faculty. Each course carried two units and there was a lab every week during the 10 week quarter. Life sciences and engineering students were paired in a team. We provide continuous mentoring, teaching and leadership opportunities, internship in industry/government, dedicated space, internal/external program assessment, weekly seminars, yearly retreats, and workshops on ethics and communication skills.</p>\n<p>We recruited a total of 31 fellows, of whom 25 are expected to complete PhD and 6 MS degrees. There were 16 males, 15 females and 10 under-represented minorities (URMs). IGERT fellows have been placed in both academia (as tenured Assistant Professors, Post-doc at Yale, Loma Linda Univ., UCLA, etc.) and industry (Abcam, Honeywell, APL/JHU, Brain Vision,

This will advance a wide range of biologically important areas from the discovery of proteins to improved quality/yields of agricultural products and human health. A great benefit will be increased productivity, improved sensitivity, and enhanced analysis of data. Spatiotemporal video analysis, querying and indexing may benefit a large number of fields: news, entertainment, weather bureaus, libraries, and security/intelligence agencies all must analyze massive video datasets and need highly efficient/effective ways to retrieve information.\n\nWe developed an innovative graduate research, education and training program that provided a balanced education for students (without increasing their course load) with disparate backgrounds in engineering, computer science and life sciences. Our unique curriculum was based on the fact that both genome sequences and video imaging are essential to understand the dynamic processes of living things. The challenge was to design an innovative and highly interesting interdisciplinary curriculum and training program that exposes students to multiple imaging modalities at varying spatial and temporal resolutions and associated computational methods for video mining and knowledge discovery. Our interdisciplinary education effectively fused life sciences with engineering and computer science.\n\nWe developed and received approval from the various Academic Senate Committees for seven new IGERT graduate courses in Electrical and Computer Engineering: EE 270 Introduction to Video Bioinformatics, EE 271 Multiscale Analysis of Biological Systems, EE 272 Introduction to Imaging Bioinstrumentation and Analysis, EE 273 Live Imaging and Analysis of Cellular and Molecular Behaviors, EE 274 Introduction to Medical Imaging and Analysis, EE 275 Project in Video Bioinformatics and EE 276 Colloquium in Video Bioinformatics. EE 270, 271, 272, 273, and 274 are cross listed with the Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics (GGB) graduate program. EE 271 is cross listed with Bioengineering. These courses are required courses for all IGERT fellows. Non-IGERT students also take these courses. The courses are shared by the IGERT faculty. Each course carried two units and there was a lab every week during the 10 week quarter. Life sciences and engineering students were paired in a team. We provide continuous mentoring, teaching and leadership opportunities, internship in industry/government, dedicated space, internal/external program assessment, weekly seminars, yearly retreats, and workshops on ethics and communication skills.\n\nWe recruited a total of 31 fellows, of whom 25 are expected to complete PhD and 6 MS degrees. There were 16 males, 15 females and 10 under-represented minorities (URMs). IGERT fellows have been placed in both academia (as tenured Assistant Professors, Post-doc at Yale, Loma Linda Univ., UCLA, etc.) and industry (Abcam, Honeywell, APL/JHU, Brain Vision, etc.).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bir Bhanu"
