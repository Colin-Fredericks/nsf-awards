 "awd_abstract_narration": "The search for a quantum theory of gravity has seen progress with the advent of string theory and loop quantum gravity, but both lack direct contact with experiment. The PI proposes a five-year plan that can potentially resolve fundamental problems in cosmology and particle physics by developing new models that arise from theories beyond the standard model and quantum gravity. Additionally, he proposes new observational schemes to test these models. The PI's long-term research plans over the next five years focus on two themes. One is at the Interface of Particle Physics and Cosmology where he hopes to look at the consequences for LHC physics of his new model that unifies gravity with the electroweak force.  He will also investigate the phenomenological consequences of a Supersymmetric extension of this model.   The second area concerns the nature of the cosmological singularity. The PI has proposed several novel theories based on modifying gravity and will also consider the experimental consequences of these models.   The outreach part of this Career program will consist of \r\nthe PI giving a two-week course on Music and the Cosmos, which will be hands on presentation on the physics of sound and musical instruments. These lectures will be presented to urban high school students through the Upward Bound Summer Science program at Penn State. The PI will also serve as both a research and long-term career mentor for two minority undergraduate students each year, by creating two summer research positions in his group through this award.\r\n",
