 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dance flies (Diptera: Empididae: Empidinae), a lineage of over 2,000 species, exhibit a suite of specialized mating behaviors and morphology that place them among the most commonly cited examples of sexual selection in insects. They are the subject of many detailed behavioral studies and textbook examples.  This collaborative study integrates molecular, behavioral and morphological data collection to develop a comprehensive evolutionary classification for the Empidinae.  Evolution of behavior and sexual morphology is studied within specific focal clades to identify key traits involved in swarming, sex-role reversal, presentation of nuptial gifts (\"ballooning\"), and intersexual conflict.  Genetic data are used to frame and inform tests of evolutionary hypotheses concerning generation of diversity in dance flies and examine the implication of these findings other organisms. Project results will test long-standing hypotheses on mating system evolution and provide key empirical evidence in support of the hypothesized link between sexual selection and diversification rate dynamics in a diverse lineage of insects. \r\n\r\n The project involves academic training and a program of outreach, including educational material that will be presented via the project website, and online resources for undergraduate and K-12 levels.",
