 "awd_abstract_narration": "Assessment/Research (99)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the development of interactive help and support systems for novice and expert users of the Student Assessment of their Learning Gains (SALG) course, department, and evaluator websites.  The SALG is a web-based, course-evaluation instrument that focuses on students' assessments of how effectively course-design and teaching methods help them make learning gains. The expanded help and support systems increase the usability of the SALG sites for course, program, and departmental evaluation and enhance the power and number of ways that users have to interact with each other.  \r\n\r\nImprovements to the SALG websites include three types of enhancements.   First, the user-support functions expand the help sections on course, department, and evaluator sites by the inclusion of interactive tutorials and \"Tips and Tactics\" sections.  These sections consist of advice about strategies and best practices and an archive of white-papers/articles on the SALG and links to articles on the use of SALG by others.  An interactive forum provides a platform for users to access immediate practical help and to engage in discussions on broad issues concerning the assessment of learning.  Second, the department site contains additional functions to assist users in exploiting the capabilities of the site by incorporating additional controls and features to assist in departmental level evaluation.  Third, in addition to increased functionality to support program evaluation using the SALG, the evaluator site is a repository for SALG-like instruments (e.g., the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) instrument) and includes an interactive forum for sharing information, resources, and expertise on assessment, evaluation, and student learning.",

At the time of the award, the SALG Development Group was working on two additional SALG websites under NSF Award #0613426. A SALG site for departments was released as a beta version in early 2009, but the proposed site for program evaluators was not completed.

In 2009, ~1400 faculty had created SALG accounts, 900 surveys had been completed, and 21,000 students had been surveyed. Currently, the SALG site shows 9905 instructor users, 9268 completed surveys and 214,223 student responses. As of mid-2011, 181 users had created ~1860 <em>department</em> instruments, administered over 260 surveys, and collected data from ~3500 students. Currently, 4147 SALG departments have created 21,738 department instruments, 712 surveys have been conducted and over 199,000 students have responded to those department surveys. Our user community is not only growing, the growth curve is accelerating. We started a user group, and conducted an extensive needs analysis that helped us better understand why people adopt the SALG and how they use it. We also formed collaborative relationships with several large STEM-education reform groups and with the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. We are working with two universities piloting the use of SALG as an institution-wide assessment instrument. We also developed Student Assessment of their Improvement in Learning (SAIL), a paper-and-pencil assessment instrument based on SALG principles, which has proved effective in short-duration and informal educational settings.
