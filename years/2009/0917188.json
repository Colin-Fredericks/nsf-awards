 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic System Level  ( ESL ) designs , specified behaviorally using\r\nhigh-level languages such as SystemC , raise the level of hardware\r\ndesign abstraction . This approach crucially depends on behavioral\r\nsynthesis , which compiles ESL designs to Register Transfer Level  ( RTL )\r\ndesigns . However , optimizations performed by synthesis tools make\r\ntheir implementation error-prone , undermining the trustworthiness of\r\nsynthesized hardware . \r\n\r\nThis research develops a mechanized infrastructure for certifying\r\nhardware designs generated by behavioral synthesis . It entails\r\ndeveloping a certified  \" reference flow \" of synthesis transformations . \r\nThe reference flow is disentangled from the workings of a production\r\nsynthesis tool through new formal structure called  \" clocked control\r\ndata flow graph \" ( CCDFG ) formalizing internal design representation . \r\nGiven an ESL design and its synthesized RTL , certification entails the\r\nfollowing automatic steps : ( 1 ) extracting initial CCDFG ; ( 2 ) applying\r\ncertified  \" primitive transformations \" from the reference flow ,\r\nfollowing the application sequence by the synthesis tool , and  ( 3 )\r\nchecking equivalence between the transformed CCDFG and RTL . Theorem\r\nproving is used to certify primitive transformations off-line ;\r\nequivalence checking accounts for low-level transformations and\r\nmanual tweaks . The correspondence between the transformed CCDFG and\r\nthe synthesized hardware makes equivalence checking efficient . \r\n\r\nThe project facilitates development of scalable and trustworthy\r\nhardware : adoption of ESL approach expedites design cycle while formal\r\nanalysis guarantees trust in the synthesized hardware . The reference\r\nflow makes explicit key design invariants implicitly assumed by\r\nsynthesis tools , facilitating development of more aggressive synthesis\r\ntools . Finally , the tight integration of two complementary techniques\r\n--- model checking and theorem proving  --- in the certification is\r\napplicable to other domains .",
