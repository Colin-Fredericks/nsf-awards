 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wake Innovative Noyce Scholars Program (WINS) is recruiting, training, and mentoring 32 highly qualified students to become high school teachers in the disciplines of Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. Candidates are participating in a 13-month education program leading to teacher licensure (grades 9-12) and a Master's degree in Education.  This project includes a unique combination of training in both content areas and educational practices, including four key components: content, pedagogy, diversity, and leadership. Intellectual merit involves analysis of the strategies and refinements of the innovative recruitment, training, and mentoring activities to determine their effect on teacher outcomes as well as high school student outcomes.  The broader impacts of this program are production of committed and effective teachers, who will stimulate and guide the development of future generations. The WINS Scholars are becoming innovative teacher-leaders who maximize the science and mathematics achievement of students in high-need schools and serve as models for other teachers and schools. Research studies documenting all facets of the program are being planned for dissemination in presentations and publications to facilitate development of a national model for improving teacher education and retention.",
