 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protists are an essential component of microbial food webs and play a central role in global biogeochemical cycles, and thus are key players in sustaining the healthy functioning of any ecosystem. Over the past few years a rich diversity of protists has been revealed in a range of extreme environments, indicating that the frontiers of eukaryotic life are still being explored. Only recently, one of the most extreme marine environments known to science was discovered in the eastern Mediterranean Sea at a depth of ~3500m, namely deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs). These basins are characterized by extremely high salt concentrations (up to saturation) that have been considered anathema to life. Instead, highly diverse communities of bacteria exist in the waters of these basins. With the exception of a preliminary study to this proposal that indicated a diverse and active assemblage of protists in the water column along the halocline and below the halocline, these DHABs remain largely unexplored regarding eukaryotic life forms. The sediments of the DHABs have not been explored for protists at all. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will collect water column and sediment samples on a short cruise to two basins with different brine chemistries. An exciting combination of molecular, cultivation-independent and culture-based approaches will be used to study the microbial communities of Bannock and Discovery Basins as well as determine adaptive strategies of marine protist communities to hypersaline, anoxic environments and the degree of their potential impact on biogeochemical cycling as a result of their predation activities, the degree to which the dominant protists maintain bacterial or archaeal symbionts, and the identity of those symbionts. Methods to be employed include RNA-based sequence analysis of diversity based on 18S rDNA genes, statistical analyses of community composition and phylotype richness, geochemical documentation of the water column and sediments using classical and microelectrode approaches, expression profiling using 3'-UTR fragments of mRNAs, sequencing of complete gene transcripts for proteins appearing to confer adaptation to hypersalinity, analysis of the proteome signatures, FISH-SEM to characterize novel extremophiles, CARD-FISH to identify eukaryote prey and putative symbionts, and TEM to assess morphology and endobiont presence in common benthic morphotypes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.\r\nHypersaline environments rank highly in the list of extreme systems that have attracted increasing notice in science as well as by the lay public. For example, considering predictions of increasing temperatures and drought in certain regions of our planet, the number of hypersaline habitats may increase dramatically causing this ecosystem to gain importance on a global scale. Thus, an understanding of the ecosystem in these habitats will help predict future ecosystem functioning due to global change. From a different perspective, revealing the mechanisms of adaptation to high salinity has become a major objective, both for biological science and for potential commercial exploitation of natural products associated with those adaptations. Additionally, this project has varied educational components, ranging from middle school to graduate studies, and outreach opportunities for secondary school science teachers and the lay public. For example, this project will partially support one graduate student, who will join the research cruise to gain first-hand oceanographic experience and augment their knowledge of marine microbial ecology and physiology. The methodologies and results of this project will be presented at a well-established annual workshop for middle and secondary science teachers from around the world.",

Driven by the needs of this project, a new water-column sampler (the Microbial Sampler-Submersible Incubation Device (MS-SID)) was developed for collecting filtered and unfiltered water samples and preserving them <em>in situ </em>in order to minimize biases associated with sample handling and recovery from the deep ocean. This instrument is helping to reshape how microbiologists examine communities in the deep sea and is now available for use by the wider community. Using this instrument we conducted the first grazing study to determine the impacts of protist phagotrophy on microbial communities in deep-sea waters. These studies included DHAB halocline waters and applied <em>in situ</em> approaches to assess impacts on carbon turnover in the deep sea. This showed that protist phagotrophy turns over approximately 25% of the prokaryotic biomass daily, and likely contributes significantly to new sources of labile organic carbon at these sites/depths. Using the MS-SID we conducted the first direct comparison of metatranscriptome results for a deep-water (2200m) sample collected using this technology vs. traditional Niskin-bottle water collection with subsequent on-deck water processing. This revealed the importance of using <em>in situ</em> approaches for precise assessments of <em>in situ</em> activities.
