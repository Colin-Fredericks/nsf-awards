 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike most bioinformatics data, such as DNA sequences and protein\r\nstructures, pathways show the interactions of different bio-chemical\r\nentities. Thus, each entity or subpathway can have a function in its\r\npathway that the pathway can not realize without it. Formulating these\r\nfunctions presents exciting computational challenges. \r\n\r\nThis proposal develops algorithms for efficient and accurate\r\ncomputational analysis of pathways. The first step in achieving this\r\ngoal is to build a mathematical model for functions of pathways and\r\nsubpathways. This proposal defines the function of a subpathway as its\r\ncontribution to the steady state of the entire pathway. Computing this\r\ncontribution is a difficult problem especially for gene regulatory\r\npathways.  Existing methods can compute this for metabolic pathways,\r\nbut they do not scale to even medium sized gene regulatory\r\npathways. This proposal develops efficient methods for computing\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nFinding the subpathway that has a desired function is a challenging\r\nproblem. There is no clear way of searching for subpathways with\r\ndesired functions using existing tools. This proposal develops\r\nefficient algorithms for searching subpathways with desired function.\r\nThis proposal takes this one step further, and develops mathematically\r\nsound algorithms for comparing two pathways so that the entities that\r\nmap are functionally, homologically and topologically similar.  This\r\nproposal also explores feature and reference-based index structures\r\nfor biological pathway databases.\r\n\r\nFurther information on the project can be found at the project web\r\npage:\r\n\thttp://bioinformatics.cise.ufl.edu/",
