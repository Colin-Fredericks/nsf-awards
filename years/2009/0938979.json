 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support two researchers from the University of Hawaii on a planning visit to Canada in 2009.  The primary goal of the visit is to initiate a long-term collaboration between researchers from the University of Hawaii and the University of British Columbia to advance the proficiency of students in physics, chemistry, biology, and geology through engaging new courses on global environmental challenges.  The planning visit will enable the researchers to develop and assess the effectiveness of a new undergraduate curriculum on global environmental challenges for non-science majors.  The team will adapt a scientific approach to teaching and developing the curriculum.  Specifically, the team will:\r\n-\testablish what students should learn from the introductory courses, \r\n-\tscientifically measure what students are learning,\r\n-\tadapt instructional methods and curriculum, and\r\n-\tincorporate effective use of technology and pedagogical research to achieve desired learning outcomes.\r\nThe team plans to disseminate the effective strategies and courses to all community colleges and universities in the University of Hawai'i system, as well as University of British Columbia.",
