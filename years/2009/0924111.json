Support is provided for such activities from the Oceanographic Technical Services Program at NSF primarily to address concerns regarding anthropogenic noise impacts on marine mammals by the large seismic arrays on R/V Marcus G. Langseth operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.",
