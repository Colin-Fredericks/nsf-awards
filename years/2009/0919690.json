 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe Aegean Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Workshop has two main objectives: (i) to bring together a group of US researchers and their foreign counterparts to address, discuss and identify common priorities and approaches for collaboration on four specific nanoscale research areas: (i) Nanoelectronics and Nanophotonics; (ii) Nanofabrication, Nanoscale Sensors and Devices; (iii) NEMS and Nanosystems; and Nanotechnology Applications (Bio, Energy, Environment, Human Health).  The second objective is to provide an opportunity to several US graduate students to gain international research experience, meet, discuss and present their work via poster presentations and be exposed to such an interdisciplinary environment.  The presentations and follow up discussions will present knowledge, identify bottlenecks but also priorities and opportunities and nurture interactions between US and foreign researchers.  The workshop can stimulate new research ideas leading to novel concepts and applications that will be of utmost importance to US graduate students and junior researchers.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop provides an excellent venue and environment for the exchange of ideas and open discussions that allow for the presentation of the researchers? latest work, augmenting efforts to advance the research frontiers in this field via international collaborations.  The workshop will provide a significant opportunity for human resource development and graduate education, training and exposure to an interdisciplinary international environment.  An elite volume will be published with all invited presentations, poster student presentations and discussion summaries.  In addition, participants can submit manuscripts based on their presentations for consideration for publication to a number of referred journals.  Attraction of underrepresented minorities will be pursuit through the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers (housed on UT Arlington campus).  The theme of the proposed workshop also impacts fields of critical technological importance to the U.S. including microelectronics, nanotechnology, and bioengineering.\r\n",
