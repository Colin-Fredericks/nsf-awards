 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaborative effort between a four-year school (Arizona State University) and five non-metropolitan feeder schools (Arizona Western College, Central Arizona College, Cochise College, Eastern Arizona College, and Mohave Community College). The team is working to significantly increase the number of transfer students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, that graduate in engineering and computer science. In order to accomplish this, they are: 1) providing scholarships to students in the feeder schools and to transfer students at Arizona State University , 2) supporting student outreach activities at the feeder schools, 3) supporting engineering courses at the feeder schools by providing materials, tutoring, local engineering speakers, and tuition scholarships, 4) conducting \"Be an Engineer\" events at the feeder schools for both students and their parents, 5) providing classes, workshops, and seminars using live broadcast and videotape, 6) providing an engaged community of mentors with extensive experience and commitment for all students, 7) hosting an orientation at Arizona State University for engineering transfer students, 8) managing a center where engineering transfer students can study together and get the support needed to survive, and 9) working with transfer students through a time-tested \"career shaping\" academic scholarship workshop program. The project is building on an earlier successful program between Arizona State University and a set of metropolitan community colleges with similar goals. Evaluation efforts, involving formative and summative aspects, are being conducted by internal and external evaluators who are developing and monitoring indices for enrollment, persistence, and graduation. Broader impacts include the development and dissemination of models for collaboration between community colleges and four-year schools and the efforts to increase the number of women and minorities in engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the summer of 2009, Mohave Community College in collaboration with several other colleges across Arizona and Arizona State University was awarded a grant entitled: \"Collaborative Research: Motivated Engineering Transfers -- STEM Talent Expansion Program (METSTEP)\", referred to as the METS grant.  The main goal of the grant was to increase the number of STEM graduates, especially women and minorities, from rural Arizona communities by establishing transfer degrees in STEM fields at these colleges and promote these degrees through scholarships and activities.  It was felt that community colleges were more assessable to those students in rural communities, both financially and geographically, and that increasing the number of students transferring from them to four year schools would increase the number and quality of talented engineering and computer science graduates, as was one of the focuses of the solicitation.\n\nUnlike some of the other community colleges included in the grant, Mohave did not at the time of the award have either an engineering or computer science degree.  The first few years of the grant cycle were spent hiring qualified faculty, designing and approving the core curriculum and degree pathways, and recruiting the initial cohort of students into the program.  The engineering program started accepting students in 2011 and the computer science program started accepting students in 2013. Though the cohorts were small, the programs continued to increase in size even during times when the overall student population of MCC was decreasing.\n\nThere were four general categories that MCC grant funds were spent on: scholarships, student travel, material support, and the PI?s stipend.  The majority of the funding (around $60,000) went to scholarships to encourage potential students to try out STEM degrees. These scholarships were of two types: small scholarships to encourage students to participate in the informational trip to ASU?s (METS) transfer center, and larger scholarships to pay for tuition and fees involved with taking an introduction to engineering class.  As both the engineering program and computer science program started two and four years, respectively, after the start of the grant, three no cost extensions were sought and granted by the NSF.  The scholarship money for the years without active programs was utilized in the extension years. \n\nThe second category was trip support itself.  Every year, potential transfer students were taken to ASU?s METS transfer center to tour the campus, receive financial aid information, and visit the Fulton undergraduate research symposium.  Three of the students participating in the trip eventually went on to participate in the symposium itself, and two of those went on to doctoral programs.  Two trips also took over 50 high school students to ASU to promote STEM fields, though this portion of the grant was discontinued due to lack of high school faculty support.\n\nThe other two categories were material support and the stipend for the PI.  The stipend allowed for the creation of these reports and to track the various demographics of students in the programs.  Material support allowed for the purchase of general equipment for use by the introduction to engineering projects, which over the years have been utilized in many creative engineering projects such as informational kiosks and arcade machines via purchased raspberry pi microcomputers.  The 3D printer purchased was also utilized in Arizona Science Foundation grant supported STEM camps held on the college, as well as use with STEM clubs found on the campuses.     \n\nIn all, the grant spurred the creation of two programs of study at MCC in the STEM fields and allowed at least twenty two Mohave students to earn transfer degrees with little debt. Many students both in high school and college were exposed to career education in STEM fields and given scholarships to attend MCC.  Material and equipment was purchased and used in other STEM promoting functions.  Finally, even though the grant is ending, MCC remains committed to STEM majors both by continuing to offer all needed STEM classes and by using a new NSF supported scholarship program to promote these degrees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russell Cox"
