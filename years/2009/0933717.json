 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop of about 15 experts explores future research directions in cognitive radio networks. The team members have all been involved with early projects aimed at demonstrating the potential of cognitive radio platforms. Based on the results of several projects conducted over the past few years, the PIs believe that the time is right for a large-scale testbed project aimed at conclusively demonstrating the benefits of this technology, at scale, with applications, and in real-world deployment scenarios. \r\n\r\nThe PIs: (a) Develop a scientific perspective that clearly articulates research questions and challenges that need to be addressed that need to be solved to build Cognitive Radio systems, (b) define the required infrastructure to carry out the science, (c) develop and present a coherent road-map agenda, (d) define educational outreach activities that will engage teachers/students in this effort.\r\n\r\nThe availability of a general-purpose platform that can serve as a microprocessor-like universal platform for wireless system development and deployment is potentially transformative. Such a platform and one or more test-bed facilities available to the broader community of computer scientists and engineers could unleash a wave of innovation in system design to cope with the problems of scale and performance that come with ubiquitous dense deployment.",
