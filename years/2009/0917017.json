 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological advances in positioning, sensor and monitoring\r\ntechnology drive data acquisition devices to generate massive streams\r\nof data.  The goal of this research is to develop a new class of\r\nhigh-performance stream data management systems capable of coping with\r\nscenarios with infinite data arriving in large volumes, and with\r\nnear-real time response requirements.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed query processing paradigm, \r\ntermed the multi-route query mesh model (QM), overcomes a\r\nmajor limitation in current query optimizers, both static and stream\r\nones alike, namely the assignment of a single `best' query execution\r\nplan for all input data.  This approach, being based on the strong\r\nassumption of data uniformity, results in substandard performance for\r\npossibly all data items.  Instead, query mesh adopts a processing\r\nstructure composed of a data classifier and a multiple route plan\r\ninfrastructure.  Different learning models can be plugged as\r\nclassifier logic into the QM model.  Given the complexity of the QM\r\nsolution space, cost-based search heuristics are designed to\r\nefficiently find high-quality query meshes.  QM is adaptive supporting\r\nthe detection and incremental modification of the QM classifier and\r\nits routes.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the design, development and\r\nevaluation of a novel multi-route paradigm for stream query\r\nprocessing, -- a perfect middle ground between the two current\r\nextremes of single-plan versus route-less solutions.  Experimental\r\nstudies compare query mesh to state-of-the-art solutions.  QM impacts\r\nsociety by facilitating a wide range of stream-centric applications,\r\nincluding medical out-patient monitoring, emergency management, and\r\nbusiness intelligence processing, and by integrating project\r\nactivities with education.\r\n\r\nFurther information on this project can be found at the project\r\nweb page:  http://dsrgweb.cs.wpi.edu:8180/DSRG/",
