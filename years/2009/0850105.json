Since the most\r\nabundant living organisms on Earth are bacteria, the majority of these viruses are\r\nphages, the viruses which infect bacteria. Through their diverse lifestyles and gene\r\nproducts, phages play important roles in horizontal gene exchange, in structuring\r\nnatural microbial communities, and in global biogeochemical cycles. Phages carry\r\ngenes for some of the deadliest toxins known and can also carry genes which confer\r\nadaptive advantages to the hosts they infect. Furthermore, phage genes and the\r\nproteins they encode are the outcome of evolution over eons, the products of which we\r\nwould be able to exploit if only we could decode the information in the phage DNA\r\nsequences. The number of available phage genome sequences is increasing rapidly; on\r\nthe other hand, they represent the largest global reservoir of uncharacterized genetic\r\nmaterial. Bioinformatic tools necessary for interpreting this data has lagged behind the\r\ngrowth in genome sequences. Grants to develop a platform and toolbox of\r\ncomputational tools for phage genome analysis have been awarded to support\r\ncollaborative research in the laboratories of Drs. Robert Edwards, Department of\r\nComputer Sciences, San Diego State University, Mya Breitbart, College of Marine\r\nSciences, University of South Florida, Jeffrey Elhai, Biology Department, Virginia\r\nCommonwealth University and Matthew Sullivan, Department of Ecology and\r\nEvolutionary Biology, University of Arizona. Dr. Elhai is an Associate Professor, the\r\nother three investigators are Assistant Professors. This collaborative project is creating\r\nnew computational tools to establish a consistent nomenclature for phage genomes, to\r\nannotate phage sequences, both from completely sequenced phage genomes and from\r\nenvironmental phage metagenome sequences. Most importantly, this project will\r\nengage a wide spectrum of researchers, regardless of their computational background,\r\nto access the wealth of information contained in phage genomes through familiar\r\ngraphical interfaces. These collaborators have developed an extensive and far-reaching\r\neducation plan that targets high school students, undergraduate students and graduate\r\nstudents. The students trained in the use of the tools will rotate into trainer roles via user\r\nforums and workshops. The postdocs will be working across all the labs and thereby\r\ngain an unparalleled panoramic view of phage biology.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0850356 PI Name:Edwards, Robert\r\nPrinted from eJacket: 03/10/09 Page 1 of 1",
