 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will collect student and faculty-level data from individual campuses and aggregate information at the campus, alliances and program wide levels.  The AGEP Tracking System and Registry (AGEP TSR) will be a new approach to obtaining and analyzing key data on AGEP program effects and the systematic approach could serve as model for other NSF programs.  Currently, the American Institutes for Research (AIR) serves as the evaluator of the national AGEP program and this project expands the role of AIR to:\r\n\r\n- Assist up to three AGEP grantees in learning how to input data into the system and on how to use AGEP-TSR in ways that strengthen the individual Alliances? data collection efforts;\r\n\r\n- Design survey instruments that can be attached to AGEP-TSR and used for data collection at the national and local levels;\r\n\r\n- Monitor the quality of the data collection system and the reports generated ;\r\n\r\n- Make presentations to NSF and to the AGEP community based on data collected through AGEP-TSR;\r\n\r\nThe features of the tracking system will focus on participant tracking, participation tracking, and data collection, report generating, and building a registry of AGEP graduates.  The project will provide insight on whether participation in AGEP sponsored activities generates positive or negative outcomes.",
