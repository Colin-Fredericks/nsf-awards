 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Rhett C. Smith at Clemson University to develop and study two exciting new classes of materials featuring remarkably well-defined and tunable molecular-level organization of organic and hybrid organic/organometallic pi-systems. The unique, shape-persistent scaffolds he will employ ensure specific alignment of adjacent pi-systems. The mode of inter-pi-system interaction enforced will in turn predispose each material to idealized performance in a given technological application (i.e. some modes are ideal for photovoltaics, others for light emitting devices). In addition to their great potential for highly coveted technologies such as lightweight solar cells, thorough characterization of the opto/electronic properties of these materials will reveal fundamental insights into how molecular-level organization dictates performance and elucidate how privileged material combinations act synergistically, thus forwarding rational design strategies for next generation technologies. The molecular scaffolds that are employed include novel oxacyclophane constructs and light-harvesting phosphines used for organometallic polymers.\r\n\r\nThis work will also have a broader impact on science education through a variety of synergistic activities. The overarching aim of these educational activities is to increase awareness and participation in physical science. These efforts involve a service learning program, outreach and the development of polymer science courses guided by modern education theory and learning models. New course materials include projects-based polymer laboratory modules designed to mimic the graduate school research experience for undergraduates. Undergraduate research mentoring is also a key component of the educational plan. This award will support salary for undergraduates in the summer, and for their travel to conferences, better preparing these young scientists for careers in research. \r\n",
