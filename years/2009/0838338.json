 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Metabolically Active Transient Storage Model\r\nfor Predicting Nutrient Retention in Streams\r\nRoy Haggerty, Alba Argerich, David D. Myrold, Eug\u00e8nia Mart\u00ed & Nancy B. Grimm\r\nTransient storage has become one of the most important concepts in hydrology in the past 25 years,\r\nhelping to predict solute and heat transport in streams, and it is one of the most frequently quantified\r\nprocesses in stream ecology. However, recent research shows that transient storage has minimal\r\nexplanatory power for nutrient retention in streams. This is a paradox because nutrient retention is\r\nclosely tied to aerobic metabolism, which in turn is very strongly tied to hyporheic exchange, a major\r\ncomponent of transient storage. Further, other processes that retain nutrients (sorption of phosphorus,\r\nand anaerobic microbial processes) also should happen preferentially in transient storage zones.\r\nConsequently, it is surprising that transient storage has not been a better predictor for nutrient\r\nretention.\r\nWe hypothesize that nutrient retention is mostly associated with transient storage that is\r\nmetabolically active. Metabolically active transient storage (MATS) is defined as water with velocity\r\nmuch slower than the mean in which there is significant primary production or respiration. We\r\npredict that MATS will include much of the hyporheic zone and some benthic areas of pools. Given\r\nknown mechanistic relationships between nutrient transformations and metabolism, we predict that\r\nMATS zones will also be hotspots for nutrient retention.\r\nWe have done preliminary work to develop a MATS-sensitive tracer, resazurin. Resazurin quickly\r\nreduces to resorufin in the presence of aerobic respiration. Our tests indicate that it is feasible to use\r\nresazurin in streams to measure MATS, and that a standardized methodology to measure MATS can\r\nbe adopted similar to what is commonly done with a conservative tracer (e.g., NaCl) to measure\r\ntransient storage.\r\nWe will conduct a series of column and mesocosm experiments to relate nutrient retention to\r\nmetabolism (focusing on respiration). We will also test the relationship between resazurin reduction\r\nand respiration in different substrates and multiple sediment samples, and further characterize\r\nresazurin sorption, photodegradation, and degradation. We will then conduct field experiments,\r\nadding nutrients and resazurin in streams. These will primarily be conducted in heterotrophic, lownutrient\r\nstreams of Oregon, but a few experiments will also be conducted in Arizona and Spain to\r\nadd a gradient in metabolism and dissolved inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus (DIN:P) ratio.\r\nInjections will also be carried out at different times of the year encompassing a metabolism gradient\r\nwithin the Oregon streams, so that our interpretations are not limited to inter-stream variability.\r\nStreams will be surveyed and geomorphically characterized to help control for physical differences.\r\nA preliminary model of MATS is presented, and will be further developed during the study. A\r\ncomputer code will be updated and released that can model and do parameter estimation for reactive\r\ntransport in streams in the presence of MATS, where the timescales of exchange may be the\r\nconventional exponential distribution or another distribution.\r\nBroader impact: Correlation of nutrient retention with MATS would improve our understanding of\r\nthe hydrologic component of nutrient retention and help us to predict transport of nutrients in streams.\r\nResazurin reduction could prove a valuable tool for measuring MATS, and open the way for a tracerbased\r\nquantification of respiration. Lastly, we will work with an elementary school to gauge a stream\r\nand collect stream nutrient data as part of their science curriculum. The data are important to the\r\nCity of Corvallis because of a proposal to use a large quantity of treated wastewater for irrigation in\r\nthe watershed that the stream drains, and there is no gauge.",
