FSRS is a unique spectroscopic method that can probe vibrational modes over a very broad spectral window with femtosecond time resolution while maintaining high spectral resolution. The first application will be an exploration of excited-state structural dynamics of nucleic acids, specifically the structural evolution of model nucleotides and DNA oligomers after photo-excitation.  This work will provide new understanding of the effects of ultraviolet light on DNA, which can includes photo-damage and the production of skin lesions.  The second project will develop two-dimensional FSRS to probe vibrational anharmonicity, especially for molecules in pure and mixed solvent environments.  Vibrational anharmonicity is the mechanism that drives heat conduction through molecules.  Hence, these experiments will illuminate the mechanisms of heat dissipation and thermal degradation in biology and molecular electronics.  \r\n\r\nDuring the five-year project, graduate students, postdoctoral scientists and undergraduate researchers will be trained in a wide variety of experimental and theoretical techniques.  Optics designs developed during this project will be published online, thus becoming available to a wide community of ultrafast spectroscopy researchers.\r\n",
