With an objective towards biological engineering of \"humanized\" lux-based bioluminescent bioreporters for autonomous sensing of hyper and hypothyroid states, it is hypothesized that new biophotonic silicon platforms can be fabricated to intelligently diagnosis and respond to health related insults.  The intellectual merit of this research advances our understanding of coordinate multi-gene expression in mammalian cell lines and promotes novel strategies for controlling gene expression in mammalian cells using electrical induction.  The research has broader impacts and benefits society because it structures a new foundation for future lab-on-chip array sensors for metabolic monitoring in blood, breath, saliva, urine, and perspiration and for applications in in vivo whole-body imaging.  The multidisciplinary nature of the research additionally promotes teaching, training, and learning at a level where the boundaries of biology and engineering merge, thus creating a cross-training regimen critical to advancing the biotechnological knowledge of participating graduate and undergraduate students.",
