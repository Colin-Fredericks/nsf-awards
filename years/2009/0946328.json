 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to hold a workshop on operations management and logistics, behavioral game theory, and computational/algorithmic game theory.  The purpose is to create opportunities for cross-disciplinary exchange and crossover of findings from one discipline to the other for the benefit of all. There has not been, to our knowledge a workshop/conference that has included a focus on supply-chain and logistics games and on enriching the state of the knowledge of such games by cross-pollination with behavioral and computational game theory. Since the three main game-theoretical streams represented in this workshop are quite new all three emerged in the last decade or so there is a very strong impetus for learning and exchange from one arena to another.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this workshop will produce a research framework for further efforts in these fields and produce possibly new research avenues from the cross pollination.  While one may stake a claim for more coherence among participants and topics, empirical findings show that this may result in clustering and exclusion. Findings also show that heterogeneity ought to lead to a larger involvement with respect to broader interest and participation. Thus, this workshop's mixing of three separate academic communities linked together by their common game-theory base should create a fertile environment that moves forward the academic frontiers of their individual disciplines and discovers new frontiers for exploration.",
