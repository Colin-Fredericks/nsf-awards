 "awd_abstract_narration": "The John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of New York (CUNY), a leading minority- and Hispanic-serving institution proposes to recruit talented, financially needy students to participate in a well focused S-STEM program.  Motivated students will gain access to a program that encompasses computer science, mathematics and forensic science.  \r\nThe program for students will include extensive academic advisement, peer and faculty mentoring and career development counseling with the goal of promoting academic success, participation in scholarly research and entry into graduate/professional schools and STEM careers.  A broad advertisement of the program to potential recruits will be maximized by integrating the S-STEM program into the College's existing scholarship infrastructure.  This will also add to the efficiency of the program and reduce administrative costs.  A minimum of 33 students per year will be awarded scholarships up to a maximum of $4,000.",
