 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Logical Framework for Self-Optimizing Networked Cyber-Physical Systems\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop foundations for the newly emerging\r\ngeneration of networked cyber-physical systems. The approach is based on a\r\ndistributed logic of cyber-physical systems together with distributed\r\ncross-layer control and optimization strategies to enabled local actions to\r\nmaintain or improve the satisfaction of system goals. The framework will be\r\nimplemented first in simulation, then on one of SRI's robot platforms, and\r\ndemonstrated in the context of networked mobile robotic teams, a particularly\r\nchallenging application.\r\n\r\nNetworked cyber-physical systems present many intellectual challenges\r\nnot suitably addressed by existing computing paradigms. They must\r\nachieve system-wide objectives through local, asynchronous actions,\r\nusing distributed control loops through the environment. A key\r\nchallenge is to develop a robust computational foundation that\r\nsupports a wide spectrum of system operation between autonomy and\r\ncooperation to adapt to uncertainties, changes, failures, and resource \r\nconstraints, in particular to limitations of computational, energy, \r\nand networking resources.\r\n\r\nThe results will have a variety of applications including distributed\r\nsurveillance, instrumented pervasive spaces, crisis response, medical\r\nsystems, green buildings, self-assembling structures, networked\r\nspace/satellite missions, and distributed critical infrastructure\r\nmonitoring and control. There is also potential for integration\r\ninto SRI's commercial robotic platform. Results will be publicly\r\navailable from a project web site, and tutorial material will be\r\ndeveloped for students and researchers. A multi-disciplinary research\r\nseminar will be sponsored by SRI. The coPI is female with a strong\r\nrecord of mentoring female students and young researchers, including\r\nthe project's female postdoc.",
