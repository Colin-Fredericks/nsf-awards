 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses questions regarding the chemical processing in fog of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are known to be toxic. Specifically: Is there a possibility that fog processing of PAHs could transform them to oxidized compounds (oxy-PAHs) or particles? Might some of the oxy-PAHs be toxic? If so, these compounds might also represent a potential health threat if they are inhaled in a foggy environment. The approach consists of field determination of phase distributions of PAHs and oxy-PAHs throughout smog-fog-smog (SFS) cycles near Fresno, CA and/or at Louisiana State University. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts include new perspectives on the cycling of PAHs in atmospheric waters, which are of interest to a broad range of scientists. Graduate students from underrepresented groups are being trained through their participation in the project. Also participating is a faculty member from Prairie View A&M University, a Historically Black College-University institution. Research results are being incorporated into undergraduate courses taught by the principal investigator.\r\n",
