These areas are of importance to various disciplines within the broader realm of Transport Phenomena. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. Under the preceding common theme, the conference will provide for the exchange of information on new scientific results, particularly results involving interdisciplinary aspects. In previous conferences in this series, the cross-cutting aspects of space science and technology were addressed, and forums were provided for the synthesis of knowledge that has been acquired over the last several years, and for exploration of opportunities for collaborative research activities. Transport Phenomena encompassing both heat and mass transfer are indeed ubiquitous to many areas in the natural sciences, as well as engineering. While research over the last two decades has provided significant new insight into various physical phenomena, the new and upcoming scientific problems have brought about the interdisciplinary dimension to modern scientific research. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. There is at present a need to provide direction for research in which fluid flow and other transport processes form a common basis for many investigations. For example, in physiology and medicine as well as in materials processing, fluid, thermal and mass-transport aspects have gained primacy among various researchers, and the sharing of expertise has become a necessity for technical progress. The conference will therefore provide for the free flow of ideas under the common theme of Transport Phenomena to promote healthful new research programs. The conference will include the active participation of a diverse cadre of researchers including students and individuals from underrepresented groups. As in previous conferences, the proceedings will be published after a peer-review process.",
