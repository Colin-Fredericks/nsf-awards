 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the reasons for under representation of women in the field of computer science (CS). The investigation will include a series of experimental studies.  There are numerous theories that explain the gender inequality in CS. The main hypothesis of the study is that it is not the genetic predisposition or an unwillingness to put in late hours but the stereotypical image of CS that impinges upon women's ability to see themselves in the field. The research will examine the gender difference in CS as a function of social factors. A series of controlled behavioral studies will be conducted in which two orthogonal dimensions related to the image of computer scientists are independently manipulated: gender and stereotypicality (i.e., the set of stereotypes widely associated with the group, such as affinity for video games and social awkwardness). These will be conducted across three domains through which stereotypes of CS are communicated: the media, classroom environments, and peer interactions. \r\nThe study's findings will have impacts on STEM fields which are looking to increase their diversity. The impact of stereotypes across three age groups (college, high school, and middle schools students) will be tested. The study will lead to the development of a virtual psychology laboratory that can be used well beyond the project duration to study stereotypes. One primary goal of this study is to disseminate findings broadly to schools, universities and the general public so more positive educational environments can be developed to nuture the interest and aspirations of women to enter the STEM fields.",
