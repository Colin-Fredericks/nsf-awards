 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EAGER award is to provide estimates of the potential for heat island mitigation with the use of pervious concrete systems as compared to more traditional concrete pavement systems. The enhanced porosity and interconnected pore networks in pervious concrete are known to aid in storm water runoff control, but its effect on urban energy issues such as the heat island effect are unknown.  This exploratory effort will involve collaborating with researchers who have collected thermal data on comparative pervious and traditional concrete pavement systems in Iowa and obtaining thermal data from a comparative site being analyzed for stormwater benefits by the EPA. The research will analyze the thermal data on a macroscopic scale to determine overall heat fluxes within the layers of comparative pervious and traditional concrete pavement systems under various weather and diurnal conditions. Layers in each system will be separately analyzed for heat gain or loss over specific timeframes in order to compile overall heating and cooling budgets under the conditions of the test sites. \r\n\r\nThis study will start to develop a knowledge base of the impacts that very pervious pavement materials may have on urban energy storage and transfer. Future research will help scientists, designers, sustainability standard developing organizations, and decision makers better apply their use to maximize potential runoff pollution prevention benefits, while minimizing urban heat island and climate impacts.  The results will be disseminated via traditional academic methods of conferences, journal papers, course development, and workshops.",
