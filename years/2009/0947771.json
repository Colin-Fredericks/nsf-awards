Such flexible polymers could be applied as an insert on food packaging products, or as a swab in a hospital setting which, upon recognition of pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Listeria, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Legionella, undergo a color change providing manufacturers, consumers, and healthcare workers with a facile method for identifying contamination.  The proposed polymer thin films consist of a layered structure which changes thickness upon recognition of small molecules, \"autoinducers\", that bacteria secrete to communicate with each other.  The thickness change results in a color change which can be visually observed. Sensors based on such block copolymer films will be unique in their ability to selectively recognize bacterial signaling molecules without the need for additional dyes or ligands. This will result in a radically different approach for sensor fabrication, resulting in low-cost sensors for quality monitoring and preservation of a large number of food products. \r\n\r\nThe education activities to be undertaken in this work are designed to educate and train a next-generation engineers that embrace diversity as a strength. We have several initiatives planned including specific programs that assist in undergraduate and graduate education, graduate student mentoring, and training of high school students from schools in minority-rich communities.",
