 "awd_abstract_narration": "Full Center Proposal for an I/UCRC for Multiphase Transport Phenomena \r\n\r\n0934374 Michigan State University (MSU); Charles Petty \r\n0934338 University of Tulsa (UT); Ram Mohan\r\n  \r\nThe purpose of this proposal is for the Center for Multiphase Transport Phenomena (MTP) to complete the fifth year of the first five-years (Phase I).  MTP is a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) with Michigan State University (MSU) as the lead institution, and the University of Tulsa (UT) as an additional research site.  \r\n\r\nThe Center focuses on the development and validation of Multiphase Transport Phenomena (MTP) models and computational methods motivated by problem-oriented research such as, advanced filtration processes, multiphase separation processes, advanced fuel sprays, coking furnaces, and fuel cells. During the fifth year of operation, the Center will focus on two signature technologies: the cross flow filtration hydrocyclone in support of cleaning produced water on offshore platforms; and, next generation multiphase turbulent models in support of computational fluid dynamics.  Both of these initiatives are expected to have a significant and transformative impact on engineering design and education in the area of multiphase transport phenomena.   \r\n\r\nThe Center provides new industrial interactions, support of pre-doctoral and post-doctoral students, and opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training.  The early training of students in the Center will catalyze the integration of research and education in the field of multiphase transport phenomena.  The Center has set up a program for recruiting, mentoring, and retaining minority and women graduate students in engineering.    These students will also participate in weekly meetings with other minority students as part of a university wide program.  Industrial internships for Center graduate students have been an essential element of the training and technology transfer mission of the MTP I/UCRC.  Several former students are presently full-time employees of member companies and serve as advisors to the Center.  If awarded a Phase II in the near future, the Center plans to initiate an international research component in the area of produced water in collaboration with universities and petrochemical companies in Brazil and elsewhere.\r\n",
