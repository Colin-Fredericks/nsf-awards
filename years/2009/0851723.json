 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Ten students will be selected each year to participate in a ten-week interdisciplinary research program focused on the structure and function of proteins. Student participants will be engaged in an intensive hands-on experimental training and independent investigation in the areas of biochemistry, biophysics, cheminformatics, computational chemistry, enzymology, marine biology, molecular biology and plant biology. In addition to research, students will participate in a series of weekly enrichment seminars focusing on scientific communication, graduate school admissions and scientific career options. Opportunities for integration into the university research community will be provided through periodic social activities and field trips with REU faculty mentors, graduate students, and undergraduate students from other university summer research programs. It is hoped that the overall REU experience will promote student persistence in the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. Students will be recruited from across the nation while maintaining a special interest in providing research opportunities to women, underrepresented minorities, and students from institutions with limited resources for research. Rising sophomores, juniors or seniors majoring in biochemistry, biology, biophysics, chemistry, computer science, engineering (chemical/biomedical), mathematics or a related discipline will be eligible for participation in the program. All participants will receive on-campus housing, meal and travel allowances, and a stipend.

Dotson / Co-PI &ndash; Ronald W. Woodard\nNSF Award Number: 0851723 \n(2009 &ndash; 2011)\n \nProgram Outcomes Report\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nEach summer ten undergraduate students were selected to participate in the Interdisciplinary REU Program in the Structure and Function of Proteins at the University of Michigan.  A major focus of this program was on exposing students to the nature of interdisciplinary research.  Student participants were engaged in a ten-week period of hands-on experimental training and independent investigation in the areas of biochemistry, biophysics, cheminformatics, computational chemistry, enzymology, marine biology, molecular biology and plant biology.  The research projects featured in the program all involved studies of the structure and function of proteins. In addition to the research experience, students participated in a series of enrichment seminars focusing on scientific communication, graduate school admissions and scientific career options.  It was hoped that the overall experience would enhance the educational development of participants while also assisting them in clarifying both their academic and career goals.  Based on survey results, 100% of the participants from years 1 and 2 reported some degree of intellectual growth as a result of the program.  Such enhancements included: 1) increased confidence and curiosity; 2) increased interest in taking advanced courses and courses of an interdisciplinary nature and 3) a greater degree of understanding of course material.  Survey results also indicated that 100 % of the program participants from years 1 &ndash; 3 indicated that the experience was effective in assisting them in clarifying their academic and career goals.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe Interdisciplinary REU Program was successful in recruiting an average of 400 students per year from across the nation.  The program was also successful in providing opportunities to students from institutions with limited resources for research, with over 80% of the participants coming from such institutions and to students from underrepresented minority groups, with over 40% of participants coming from such groups.  It is hoped that the research experience along with the enrichment activities will promote student persistence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines.  To date, 50% of the participants who have graduated are pursuing graduate (Ph.D. / M.S.) degrees in science or engineering disciplines. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cherie R Dotson"
