 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tomato family (Solanaceae) includes many wild species that are excellent models for understanding how plants reproduce, whether they hybridize, and how their genomes evolve.  This project will develop new genetic markers and use them to study evolutionary relationships among species and populations in the tomato relative Lycium.  Lycium is distributed throughout the world and has evolved many complex ways of breeding.  This project combines studies in the field and in the lab to discover the history of species distributions worldwide and the evolution of sexual strategies in flowering plants. This work thus uses genomic resources developed for the economically important tomato family applies those to an evolutionary study.  \r\n\r\nThis research will also contribute significantly to undergraduate education and training by involving diverse students at various stages of their careers in all aspects of the project, including travels to collect plant materials and attendance to professional meetings to present their research.  Students will be trained in molecular methods and sequence analysis, population genetics, and phylogenetic systematics and reproductive evolution.  Contributions will be made to summer programs that provide training in molecular biology, systematics and genomics for high school science teachers, as well as to curricular development at Amherst College.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project centered on the development and application of novel genetic markers to examine evolutionary relationships among species and populations in the plant genus Lycium (tomato family, Solanaceae).  Lycium has emerged as an excellent natural system for understanding the evolution of hybridization, polyploidy, and reproductive strategies that promote outcrossing in plants [i.e., the evolution of separate (versus combined) sexes and the evolution of physiological mechanisms that prevent self-fertilization].  A robust understanding of evolutionary relationships is critical to such studies, and this project took a novel approach by integrating phylogenetic systematics and molecular population genetic studies to understand evolutionary relationships among species, demographic histories within species, and the evolution of reproductive strategies in flowering plants.\n\nWith field research in diverse geographic locations, this research has generated thousands of new collections including flowers and leaf material, as well as contributing accessions for deposition in herbaria.  Additionally, this research developed extensive genomic resources including traditional plastid and nuclear sequence data and genome-wide data, which will also be useful in related groups of plants.  These data include broad sampling across the cosmopolitan genus Lycium, in addition to more focused studies of four species with newly discovered variation in ploidy and sexual strategy.  In these species, we have documented the presence of polymorphism in both ploidy level and reproductive strategy (i.e., separate or combined sexes). \n\n\nThe intellectual merit of this work lies in its significant contributions to the study of the economically important tomato family and the larger scientific community via the development of genomic resources for use in evolutionary and phylogeographic studies.  This research has also contributed significantly to undergraduate education and training by involving diverse students at various stages of their careers in all aspects of the project, including fieldwork to collect plant materials and conduct controlled pollination studies, attendance at professional meetings to present their research, and co-authorship of publications.  A total of 33 undergraduate students and one graduate student were trained as part of this project.
