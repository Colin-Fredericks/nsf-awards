 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nStorage system researchers have typically used I/O traces from various sources to drive their analysis and research.  However, these I/O traces fail to adequately capture the effect of I/O on application performance.  Moreover, they do not scale with other parts of the overall system whether it be application, systems, or processor.  As a result, it is difficult to replay the trace for use in storage systems evaluation.  This is particularly problematic since many of the extant publicly available I/O traces are quite old.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the project is to provide to the storage research community a set of traces that will allow for accurate replay and evaluation of storage technologies.  The traces will be from real systems at different levels of the storage system hierarchy including network layer, file system, and low-level disk.  These include traces that do not currently exist in the storage community such as iSCSI traces, virtual machine traces, and MS Exchange traces.  The project will also provide a set of tools for tracing application dependent I/O, replaying traces, and analysis. The tools and collected traces will be made available as a community resource through publicly available sources.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include providing tools and traces that can assist storage system researchers in developing new I/O system technologies.  Since storage systems are critical to the current information-based economy, advances in understanding I/O system behavior should be highly beneficial.  It should also be useful to data-intensive applications of national interest such as the genome project, weather simulation, and digital libraries.",
