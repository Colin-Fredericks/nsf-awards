 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, \"NUE: Integration of Nanoscale Devices and Environmental Aspects of Nanotechnology into Undergraduate Engineering and Science Curricula\", at the University of Cincinnati (UC) under the direction of Dr. F. James Boerio, will enhance undergraduate education at UC by introducing two new courses entitled Nanoscale Devices and Environmental Aspects of Nanotechnology into the undergraduate engineering and science curricula.  The new courses will build on the background that students have gained in two existing NUE courses entitled Introduction to Nanoscale Science and Technology and Experimental Nanoscale Science and Technology to provide students at UC with outstanding eudcation in nanoscale science and engineering. All four courses will be offered yearly, forming the basis for a minor focused on interdisciplinary nanoscale science and technology that UC will develop subsequently, and will be cross-listed by the Colleges of Engineering and Arts and Sciences, making them readily available to students in many different disciplines.\r\n \r\nThe broader impact of this project will include adapting the experimental modules for presentation to students in grades 4-12 through an extensive outreach program; addressing the need for a technologically advanced workforce in Ohio in the area of nanomaterials and nanotechnology; addressing the need for an educational enterprise that creates such a workforce; and making the experimental modules associated with the new courses available to all universities participating in the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Revolutionizing Metallic Biomaterials in which UC partners.",
