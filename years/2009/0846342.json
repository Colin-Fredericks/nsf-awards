Research activities will include development of capabilities for air pollution modeling at multiple scales with the CMAQ and CALPUFF models, for local passive sampling and analysis (of NOX, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and acetaldehyde), for urban growth modeling, and for integration and geospatial analyses.  These will be applied to estimating spatial patterns of air quality around Tampa, to determining current equity effects by comparing air quality with population distributions, and to studying impacts of two alternative future urban growth patterns (suburb-oriented versus \"smart growth\" development).  Educational activities will involve development of an exhibit for a nearby science museum in Tampa.  The exhibit will use inquiry-based learning techniques to teach content.  Evaluation of the exhibit will be designed to assess the effectiveness of enhancing the interest of girls in STEM.  Research and education activities will be integrated by including research results in the exhibit content and in the PI's courses, by involving several students in project research and in exhibit development, and through student writing on project activities for both research and education journals.",

Levels of most of the pollutants studied were found to be highest near large roadways and in more urbanized areas, particularly over the long-term.  Short-term high levels were also found near industrial sources and power plants.  Living in a more urban area and spending more time travelling were found to contribute to higher exposure to air pollution.  On average, blacks, Hispanics, and people in low-income families were found to be disproportionately exposed over the long-term to higher pollutant levels at their residences and elementary schools.  Conversely, these same groups disproportionately reside further from regulatory air quality monitoring sites.
