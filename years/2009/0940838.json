 "awd_abstract_narration": "An international workshop on ?Changes of the Greenland Cryosphere? is scheduled to take place August 25-27, 2009, in Nuuk, Greenland. The workshop will cover a broad range of topics on the experimental and theoretical investigations of the Greenland ice sheet, sea ice and permafrost. The workshop will contribute to an exchange of information on changes occurring in Greenland and the surrounding ice-covered oceans and frozen ground. It will include invited presentations by leading scientists and engineers involved in monitoring and modeling rapid changes in the Greenland ice sheet, sea ice and permafrost. This proposal requests funds to partially support travel and other related expenses for the participation of US graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and early-career scientists in the workshop. The PI requests funds to partially support about 15 participants. He also proposes to hold a small meeting of US researchers involved in research of the Greenland ice sheet to discuss and plan focused observations and modeling activities on one or two key outlet glaciers.",
