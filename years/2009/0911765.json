 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the efforts of Professor Joseph M. O'Connor of the University of California San Diego to investigate late-metal metallacyclobutene complexes.  Such complexes have been proposed as key intermediates in a large number of important metal-mediated transformations, including alkyne polymerizations, enyne methathesis reactions, and in the synthesis of cyclopropenes, furans, pyrones, and benzannulated compounds.  The development of new synthetic routes to these targets maximizes the potential for subsequent reactivity.  Isolable metallacyclobutene complexes allow for: a) structural studies, b) well-defined reactivity studies, c) the development of new reactions, d) appropriate modeling of key steps in reactions which are thought to involve metallacyclobutene intermediates, and e) applications of metallacyclobutene-derived products in many areas of the chemical sciences.  Undergraduate and graduate students trained in the area of organometallic chemistry are well-positioned to make important contributions to both industrial and academic endeavors which require interdisciplinary research in areas such as materials, inorganic and organic chemistry.",

In an effort to facilitate the observation of a vinylcarbene intermediate, we prepared and characterized metallacyclobutene 1-TIPS (Figure 2).
