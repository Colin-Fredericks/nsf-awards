 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to detect biologically modulated signals from beneath tissue will allow for the development of implantable biological sensors that overcome the need for frequent blood sample collection. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in developing a fundamental understanding of noninvasive depth-resolved detection and monitoring of micro-retroreflectors in turbid media, and of imaging contrast mechanisms for reflectivity modulation by biologically-mediated self-assembly of nanoparticles on the retroreflector surfaces. This work is expected to create a sensor platform that can be non-invasively detected below tissue and which also has applications to improved immunoassays, cell sorting, microarray applications, and in vivo monitoring of bioagents. The broader impact of this work lies in the education, outreach, and recruitment of students (including underrepresented minorities) to Engineering through 1) Integration of research results in Engineering courses and lectures; (2) Student summer research opportunities, (3) High school teacher/student outreach, (4) Middle/High school student demonstrations during UH Preview Days, and (5) International education conferences.   The broader technical impact of this project extends from non-invasive physiological and biomedical monitoring, to cell sorting, immunoassay and nucleic acids assays.",
