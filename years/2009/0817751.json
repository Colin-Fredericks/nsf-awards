 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year effort to produce models of the high latitude ground magnetic field variations as function of the solar wind and IMF conditions.   The work uses the same technique of spherical harmonic expansion that has been utilized in the existing ?Weimer models? of ionospheric electrodynamics. In the new model the scalar magnetic potential will be matched to ground based magnetometer measurements.  First, a static baseline model will be developed.  Next, dynamical information where the magnetic field is perturbed due to sudden pressure pulses in the solar wind will be included through a superposed epoch analysis, equivalent to a disturbance-response classification process.   Datasets from the Canadian CARISMA chain, the Greenland Chain, and the Virtual Global Magnetic Observatory residing at Virginia Tech will be used together with solar wind data from the ACE satellite.   \r\nThe new models will have widespread utility within the space science community and also has the potential to contribute directly to improved space weather forecasts and/or nowcasts in the near-term future. \r\n",

The simultaneous measurements of the solar wind and IMF were also required, and were obtained from NASA's \"Advanced Composition Explorer\" (ACE) satellite, that was launched in 1997.   These data that were collected and processed for a time span of eight years.\n\nAnother activity was the creation of a list of \"magnetospheric substorms\" during the same eight-year period.  A graduate student had developed this list, and used it to map the progression of the geomagnetic variations during substorms, that occur when there is a release of energy that was accumulated in the \"tail\" of the Earth's magnetic field, due to stretching by the solar wind.  This work was done for a Masters thesis, which was completed in 2012.\n\nFigure 1 shows maps of all three vector components of the magnetic perturbations, from the final version of the prediction model.

The X, Y, and Z maps show the magnetic perturbations that are in the Northward, Eastward, and Vertical directions.  It has been noticed that the maps of the vertical perturbations strongly resemble the patterns of the overhead, field-aligned currents in the aurora (Northern Lights).\n\nThe model has been running on a web server for over two years, using input from the real-time measurements in the solar wind.  The data from NASA's ACE satellite are obtained through the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, and the maps show conditions that are expected approximately one hour into the future.  This is possible since the radio signal from ACE reaches the Earth before the IMF in the slower solar wind can arrive.  Continuous updates are shown at http://mist.nianet.org/weimerGeomag.html.  Figure 2 shows an example from this web site.\n\nComparisons of this new model's calculations with actual measurements at different locations show very good results, particularly at low frequencies.  In the magnetometer measurements there are random and unpredictable variations at higher frequencies, that are not reproduced as well with the model, but they tend to occur in relative proportion.
