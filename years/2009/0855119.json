 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs research will encompass a broad program of studies, including nuclear physics, particle physics, general relativity, string theory and cosmology. Fundamental impacts will come from phenomenological studies in nuclear and particle physics, which will extract the fullest possible implications of data from existing experiments and those anticipated in the near future. Such work is important in testing the validity of the currently accepted Standard Model of elementary particles, as well as providing tools for the anticipated discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model. Further fundamental impact will come from theoretical work in general relativity, string theory and cosmology which will probe the foundation of our most basic concepts about the Universe by exploring new theories which aim to extend what is already known.  In particular the PIs will work on hadronic parity violation, Baryogenesis, rare charm decays, higher derivative gravity theory, and Randall-Sundrum models of black holes. They also intend to work on effective theories of gravity, cosmology and dark energy. Broader impact will accrue through participation in novel interdisciplinary courses presenting a panorama of science to highly motivated students.  Further impacts will come from a unique venture \"Big Bang Radio\" which will present frontier science to a general audience through well-crafted radio programs.  The PIs have also been involved in writing a second edition of dynamics of the standard model and Kastor has created an interdisciplinary course-Cosmos to Humanity given through the universities honors program.",
