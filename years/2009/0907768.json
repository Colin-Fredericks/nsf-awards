 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests partial support for The Wabash Seminar, along with its annual Miniconference.  It is devoted to stimulation and dissemination of significant contributions to Modern Analysis in the Midwest region. For about 40 years of operation, it has earned a national and international reputation for its success, and has provided a unique opportunity and an excellent environment for young researchers, visitors, postdocs and graduate students to meet regularly and exchange ideas with leading experts in the fields. \r\n\r\nThe Wabash Seminar and Miniconference series will bring together functional analysts and their students in the Midwest region. This will further contribute to fruitful interactions of experts working in different areas of operator algebras and operator theory. During the past years the seminar and the conference have attracted numerous faculty members, postdocs, and Ph.D students from Indiana University, IUPUI, Purdue University, University of Illinois, University of Cincinnati and Washington University at St Louis.  The Wabash Seminar series offers an excellent opportunity to the junior people to be exposed to and to be informed of the latest major mathematical developments in Modern Analysis. These contacts develop very often their mathematical taste and could influence very beneficially the future directions of their research.\r\n\r\n",
