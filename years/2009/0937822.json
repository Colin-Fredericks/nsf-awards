 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project aims to understand and develop systems for\r\nmaintaining superlinear indexes for streaming data.  A superlinear\r\nindex provides search capability over an abstract space that cannot\r\neasily be linearized (totally ordered). In contrast, a linear index,\r\ntypified by a B-tree, supports point and range queries on totally\r\nordered data.\r\n\r\nExamples of superlinear indexes include multidimensional indexes,\r\nwhich can be over a geometric domain, such as geographic data, or\r\nwhich can be over multiple linear indexes; and full text queries,\r\nwhich can include searching for a particular word or substring.\r\n\r\nThe superlinear indexes found in today's databases cannot support high\r\nrates of insertion.  On traditional mechanical disk drives, the\r\nexisting superlinear indexes can only support about one hundred\r\ninsertions per second in the worst case.  For many important\r\napplications, that is too slow, and so database users often avoid\r\nsuperlinear indexing.  Even traditional linear indexes based on\r\nB-trees cannot support the high insertion rates demanded by many\r\ndatabases.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates streaming superlinear indexes, that is,\r\nindexes that efficiently support full text or multidimensional\r\nqueries, and can be updated at speeds that are related to disk\r\nbandwidth rather than seeks per second.\r\n\r\nAmong the significant research issues are the following: (1) design\r\nefficient files structures for streaming superlinear indexes; (2)\r\ninvestigate how streaming superlinear indexes might pave the way to\r\nimproved file systems; (3) determine whether cache-oblivious\r\nalgorithms technology can enhance streaming superlinear indexes; and\r\n(4) program complex data structures for transactions and recovery.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will show how to build filesystems that\r\nachieve dramatically better performance than today's B-tree-based\r\nfilesystems, how to maintain rich geometrical data and\r\nmultidimensional nongeographical databases in real time, and how to\r\nmaintain full-text searchable databases in real time.  For example,\r\nsome of today's file systems try to maintain an full-text index to\r\nfind strings in files quickly, but these systems often fall behind at\r\nhigh data write rates.  A streaming superlinear index would allow such\r\na file system to keep up, and would improve the usability of both\r\nhigh-end storage systems and relatively small consumer storage systems\r\nthat are nonetheless too large to index with today's indexes.\r\n\r\nThe researchers are developing course materials on streaming indexing\r\ntechnology which will be made freely available under the MIT\r\nOpenCourseWare initiative (http://ocw.mit.edu).\r\n\r\nFurther information on this project may be found at the project\r\nweb page:   http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/superlinear-indexes",
