This project has three distinct directions, motivated by\r\nthis interplay between different fields. The primary one is a\r\ndetailed study of deformations of such curves, for arbitrary as\r\nwell as generic complex structures. It aims at the fundamental\r\nunderstanding of properties of pseudo-holomorphic curves,\r\nincluding Gromov-Witten invariants (counts of such curves) and\r\nmore qualititative aspects of their behavior (e.g. existence,\r\nuniruledness, etc.).  The aim of another direction is to apply\r\ntechniques employed in the PI's proof of the string theory\r\nprediction for the genus 1 GW-invariants of a quintic threefold\r\nin many other setting, testing additional mirror predictions and\r\ngoing beyond them. The third direction would further develop the\r\nPI's local excess intersection approach and its applications to\r\nclassical enumerative geometry.\r\n\r\nString theory is a physical model that represents elementary\r\nparticles by vibrating strings with the aim of unifying the four\r\nfundamental forces of nature. As such srings move in space, they\r\nsweep out Riemann surfaces, also called holomorphic curves. While\r\nstring theory is one of the main paradigms in physics today, it\r\nhas yet to make any experimentally testable predictions. However,\r\nit has generated plenty of mathematical predictions and led to\r\nfundamental developments in symplectic topology and algebraic\r\ngeometry, especially in relation to (pseudo-) holomorphic\r\ncurves. This proposal aims to further test string theory\r\nmathematically, while deepening the mathematical understanding of\r\nsuch curves with an eye toward applications to more classical\r\nproblems in geometry. Some of the projects in this proposal will\r\npursued by graduate students under the PI's supervision.\r\n\r\nThis award is jointly supported by the programs in Geometric Analysis and in Algebra, Number Theory, and Combinatorics.",
