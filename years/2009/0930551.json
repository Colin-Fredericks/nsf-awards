 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clay-rich marine sediments form Earth's main sink for organic carbon. This determines atmospheric oxygen levels, as well as fluctuations of global climate. For example, an increase in carbon burial effectiveness lowers atmospheric CO2 and induces global cooling, with an increase creating the opposite effect. Understanding oceanic carbon burial therefore has a direct bearing on how we model past changes of the earth system and predict future developments, such as global warming due to fossil fuel consumption. This research carries out an ambitious and holistic controlled laboratory examination of the transport, deposition, and degradation of organic matter in clay-rich sediments. It involves construction of a novel, new flume that allows visualization of transported organo-clay flocs and bed forms and allows for the control of temperature and system redox conditions. The work also involves detailed transmission and electron microscopic studies of sediment and organic matter textural relations, a novel integrated organic matter degradation study, and development and parameterization of theoretical and mathematical models of carbon sequestration and degradation. Broader impacts of the work include support of two researchers in an EPSCoR state (Mississippi), student training, and public outreach through YouTube and the Internet. It is also applicable to increasing our understanding of the dispersal of pollutants by sedimentary processes and may also help the search for unconventional fossil fuel resources that can ease our transition to the next generation of fuels and power sources.",
