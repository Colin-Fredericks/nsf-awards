 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many successful large-scale software systems share a fundamental characteristic: their modular structures enable system-wide advances though distributed and parallelized improvement of modules. However, merely breaking software into modules, without assessing the interplay between a design and the organization that must instantiate it, does not always ensure that parallelized, module-wise evolution is effective. In particular, mismatches between design and organizational structures can result in expensive inter-team communication costs, exacerbated by barriers such as differing time zones, languages and cultures.  This research aims to formally express and quantitatively assess the key characteristics of software structures that allow for system-wide evolution through distributed module-wise contributions, and to account for the relationship between design structure and organizational structure, as it impacts software quality, productivity, and survival.  The work will explore a computable socio-technical model, associated metrics and automated analysis techniques to improve the conduct of software development. The approach will allow designers to assess and manipulate software designs at early development stages so that modules can be defined and implemented by independent teams, shortening development time, facilitating changes, and minimizing coordination costs. The results will be demonstrated on large software systems, working with industrial partners who wish to understand the impact of these techniques.",
