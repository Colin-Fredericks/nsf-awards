 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past 10 years, there has been a major revolution in the biological/life sciences as a result of the remarkable development and subsequent generation of a vast quantity of data from genome sequencing efforts. Genome sequencing is a process that determines the identity and order of an organism's DNA; thus providing a blueprint for the genetic code underlying all of the processes of life.   This has been highlighted by the recently completed draft sequence of the human genome, a notable technical achievement made possible by the development of powerful computational hardware and software.  The availability of complete genome sequences is providing the foundation for understanding how organisms (from microbes to humans) function, develop, evolve and interact with pathogens and assorted environmental cues.  This has led to a transformational change in the field of biology stemming from the development of next-generation ultra high-throughput, ultra low-cost DNA sequencing technology ( e.g. Roche 454), which serves as the basis for this proposal. What used to take several months, can now be done in several hours. The Roche 454 FLX will be used by more than 60 faculty members and their research staff, including post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students at Texas A&M University.  Applications and research programs include:  dissection of sorghum drought tolerance, functional and metagenomic analysis of biological communities for cattle and rumen  bacteria, disease resistance  and  an analysis of microflora in ocean drilling programs, among others.  Dissemination of data and project outcomes will be available on the Institute for Plant Genomics and Biotechnology website (http://ipgb.tamu.edu), research publications, relevant scientific meetings and during our scheduled campus-wide annual meeting.",
