 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).   \r\n\r\nGeoscience Research at Storm Peak (GRASP) creates a field research experience for a diverse group of undergraduate students with the goal of helping participants develop skills in critical thinking and research techniques.  This program has been designed to help students cultivate enthusiasm for scientific inquiry, self-esteem, self-discipline, and commitment while building relationships with Earth scientists. Future students will be assembled from a growing number of partnership institutions (Howard University, Tennessee State University, Colorado State University at Pueblo, Adam State College, Hampton University, Bronx Community College of CUNY, Mesa State College, and York College), including several Historically Black Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions.  A new strong asset for GRASP is our link with the Pathways to Earth Science Education program. On the summit of Mt. Werner near Steamboat Springs, Colorado, Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) provides an ideal location for hands-on experiences in atmospheric science.  While at SPL, students will work in small groups pursuing research projects of their own choosing under the guidance of an individual instructor.  Data collected will be the basis for continuing student research projects.  Additional components include a tour of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), meeting with student participants of the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research (SOARS) program, and presentation of continuing research projects.  A reunion workshop will be held for all GRASP participants at Howard University each winter.  New strategies - including social networking sites, an ambassador program, and on-line videos - will be employed to recruit students.   A full evaluation of GRASP will be conducted to explore effectiveness of the proposed strategies.",
