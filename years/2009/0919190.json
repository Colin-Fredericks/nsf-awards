 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research aims to understand the evolutionary, genetic and developmental processes responsible for adaptation in nature. Whereas most mice have dark brown coats, beach mice that inhabit Florida's coastal shores have light coats as an adaptation for camouflage in their sandy habitat. Using a combination of fieldwork, genetic crosses and modern molecular biology, the proposed project will: (1) understand the origin of the genetic variants that cause adaptive coloration, (2) elucidate how these genes act during development to produce color variation, and (3) functionally test the individual and combined effects of these genes to reconstruct the step-by-step evolution of color differences in these mice.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project uses several approaches to study the ultimate and proximate causes of adaptive change, providing a framework for the evolution of biological diversity. The project's integrative nature provides an ideal training environment for students. Moreover, because the relationship between color and natural selection are so straightforward, the proposed work is an appealing example of adaptation. As such, there are two specific outreach goals. First, a series of teachable units for high school teachers will be designed as downloadable lesson plans, slides and accompanying materials to convey basic evolutionary principles to students. Second, in conjunction with Harvard's Museum of Natural History, a short video seminar and self-tour activity will be produced for visiting school groups. This presentation will highlight both the research process as well as basic lessons in evolutionary biology.",
