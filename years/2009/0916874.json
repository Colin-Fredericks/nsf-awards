 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the importance of uncertain data for a large number of applications,\r\nthere has been significant recent interest in database support for uncertain\r\ndata. Existing work in this area includes new models for uncertain data,\r\nprototype implementations, and efficient query processing algorithms for\r\nspecific types of queries. Despite the recent efforts, several important aspects\r\nof uncertain data management remain unexplored. This project addresses two\r\nof these areas: Query Optimization and Support for Non-Relational Operators.\r\n\r\nThe first goal is about efficient execution of uncertain data queries. As with\r\ntraditional data, efficient execution is necessary for ensuring the viability of\r\nuncertain data management systems. However, due to the complications of\r\nensuring correct results, and the need for CPU-intensive operations over\r\nprobability distributions, the goal is critical and challenging. In this project,\r\nautomatic query optimizations are developed, through query rewriting rules\r\nthat involve probability threshold operators, corresponding access methods,\r\nand cost estimation functions.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of handling uncertainty when dealing with non-relational\r\noperators has been expressed in many domains. The project aims to\r\nadvance the capability of tracking the exact impact of uncertain inputs as\r\ndata is processed by arbitrary programs, leveraging advanced techniques\r\nfrom the area of program analysis. A key problem with traditional Monte\r\nCarlo based solutions lies in correctly identifying independence in the output\r\nof Monte Carlo simulations. Data lineage tracing, which identifies the set of\r\ninputs used to compute an output value, is used to address the challenge.\r\nFurthermore, a program dependence tracing based approach is devised to\r\ntrace the propagation of uncertainty during execution of arbitrary binary\r\ncode. The technique does not rely on Monte Carlo simulations, and does\r\nnot require access to source code or domain knowledge.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page:\r\nhttp://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/sunil/uncertainty\r\n\r\n",
