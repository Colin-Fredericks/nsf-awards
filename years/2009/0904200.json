The project aims to study the outer\r\nautomorphism group of a free group via analyzing the interaction\r\nbetween the Culler-Vogtmann Outer space (the traditionally\r\nconsidered free group analog of the Teichmuller space) and the\r\nspace of geodesic currents on a free group. A geodesic current is\r\na measure-theoretic generalization of the notion of a closed\r\ncurve or a conjugacy class. The space of geodesic currents turns\r\nout to be a natural companion of the Outer space and studying\r\nthem together should produce substantial new information of the\r\ndynamics and geometry of the outer automorphism group of a free\r\ngroup. A key tool to be used for such study is the so-called\r\n``geometric intersection form'' introduced in the earlier work of\r\nthe proposer. Specific questions to be studied include: studying\r\nthe geometry of various free group analogs of the curve complex,\r\nconstructing domains of discontinuity and developing a theory of\r\nconvex co-compactness for subgroups of the outer automorphism\r\ngroup of a free group, developing a theory of generalized (or\r\n``non-commutative'') currents, and others.  In combinatorics and\r\ncomputer science there is an active search for theories of words\r\nbased on domains other than an integer segment (e.g.  the integer\r\nlattice of the Cayley graph of a free group). The theory of\r\ngeneralized currents, introduced in the proposal, provides a good\r\nmodel of this kind that should be useful in the study of words\r\nbased on non-linear domains. The proposal aims to develop this\r\ntheory further and to investigate in more detail the interactions\r\nbetween geometric group theory and computer science that arise in\r\nthis context.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to study dynamics and geometry of the\r\nouter automorphism group of a free group, one of the most\r\nmysterious, interesting and least understood mathematical\r\nobjects. Among the key ideas is the use of a new tool, called a\r\n``geodesic current'', which allows one to bring substantial new\r\nmachinery and techniques from analysis and ergodic theory to the\r\nsubject. The project will also explore, via the notion of\r\ngeneralized geodesic currents, interactions between geometric\r\ngroup theory and computer science, aimed at understanding new\r\ntypes of data structures - namely words that, unlike standard\r\nwords, are not written on straight line segments.  A significant\r\ncomponent of the project includes REU (``Research Experience for\r\nUndergraduates'') activities, that will involve\r\nU.S. undergraduate students in advanced mathematical research and\r\nhelp prepare them for future careers in science and technology.\r\nThe proposed research has served as a basis for a project, funded\r\nfor two years, under the umbrella of the UIUC-CNRS institutional\r\ncollaborative agreement, for collaborative research in geometric\r\ngroup theory between researchers from UIUC and Marseille. The NSF\r\ngrant will be used to expand and enhance that project, to involve\r\nadditional research groups and to further build up institutional\r\ninternational research ties between UIUC and CNRS.\r\n",
