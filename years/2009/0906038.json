 "awd_abstract_narration": "The projects in this proposal aim to advance existing and to create new\r\napproaches to attack existence problems of prescribed curvature type that\r\nare of interest in geometry and mathematical physics. The P.I. proposes to\r\nrefine techniques from his previous work to address existence, regularity,\r\nand global properties of apparent and generalized apparent horizons in\r\ngeneral relativity. In particular, the P.I. plans to investigate these\r\nquasi-local notions of the event horizon in light of certain lower order\r\nfeatures, much akin to those of minimal and constant mean curvature\r\nsurfaces, for their relation to positive mass type theorems, and in\r\nparticular to the space time Penrose conjecture. In a separate project, the\r\nP.I. plans to study the extent to which these techniques can be adapted to\r\ninclude an existence theory for a wide range of embedded hypersurfaces of\r\nprescribed curvature. A second, independent direction in the proposed\r\nresearch is a potentially open-ended collaboration with N. Kapouleas on\r\ngluing problems for constant mean curvature surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe projects in this proposal are inspired and driven by allowing\r\nanalytical, geometric, and physical intuition to guide one another in the\r\nspirit of R. Schoen and S.-T. Yau. The special surfaces whose existence and\r\nproperties will be investigated here are relevant in a wide variety of\r\ngeometric and physical contexts, in particular in mathematical relativity -\r\nEinstein's theory of gravitation. A major objective of the proposed\r\nresearch is to exploit a parallel between well-known properties of soap\r\nfilms on the one hand and the geometry of black hole boundaries on the\r\nother hand. Through this connection, powerful techniques from analysis and\r\ngeometry have entered the picture and are now at hand to further our\r\nunderstanding of the geometry of black holes. \r\n",
