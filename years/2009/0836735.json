 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now widely recognized that halogen atoms play a major role in tropospheric chemistry.  However, models under-predict the concentrations of photochemically active precursors by at least an order of magnitude.  This project is directed to resolving this discrepancy through a series of laboratory studies of the thermal and photochemical reactions of sea salt that have not before been investigated.  The objectives are to: (1) measure chlorine (Cl2) production from reactions of salt mixtures representative of fresh and aged sea salt; (2) quantitatively assess the change in the photochemistry of sea salt particles as their chemical composition changes in a manner similar to that during transport in air; (3) elucidate the kinetics and mechanisms of oxidation of organics on sea salt \"from the bottom up\" by hydroxyl radicals generated in and on particles from nitrate and nitrite ion photochemistry.  The intellectual merit lies in a deep understanding of sea salt chemistry that can be used in models of the marine boundary layer and other regions having suspended salt particles, and that will help to resolve the large discrepancies between measurements and model predictions of halogen atom precursors in the troposphere.  This large disconnect is important to elucidate because tropospheric halogen chemistry impacts the formation and removal of O3, a toxic air pollutant, greenhouse gas and precursor to highly reactive OH radicals, as well as particle formation and growth that impacts public health, visibility and climate. \r\n\r\nThe research will provide new insights into the importance and impacts of the photochemistry of the nitrate and nitrite anions which are incorporated into sea salt as it is transported in air, and into the impacts of organic coatings believed to exist on these particles.  This research will also provide training to undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists that is both broad in terms of atmospheric chemistry, yet deep in terms of the specific chemical knowledge that is developed and experimental experience gained.",

Finlayson-Pitts\nDepartment of Chemistry\nUniversity of California Irvine\nIrvine, CA  92697-2025\n\nTwo thirds of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans.  Wave action generates tiny particles of sea salt, about the size of one thousandth of a human hair.  These particles are transported in air and encounter a variety of trace gases with which they can react. This results in the release of highly reactive species which feed back to impact the levels of important gases in air, such as ozone.   In addition, the particles are exposed to sunlight which can also cause chemical reactions within the particles that affect both the particles and the surrounding gas phase.  The goal of this research project was to elucidate the nature of these reactions and their potential impact on air quality and climate change.\n\nThis chemistry was studied by generating model sea salt particles in the laboratory and studying how they reacted on exposure to light, ozone and the highly reactive hydroxyl free radical which drives the chemistry of the atmosphere.  A particular focus was on the impact of organic coatings on the chemistry of the sea salt particles.  These organic coatings arise from exposure of the sea salt particles to biological materials in ocean water\nas the particles are ejected into air. Through this research, we discovered:\n\n(1) New mechanisms of reaction of ozone with the organic coatings on sea salt that had not previously been recognized. This suggests the formation of highly reactive peroxides may occur on surfaces in air under some conditions;\n\n(2) The organic coatings on the salt particles can be oxidized by reaction from the \"bottom up\" via highly reactive intermediates generated within the particles on exposure to light, not just from the \"top down\" as previously thought;\n\n(3) Oxidation of a biogenic hydrocarbon commonly emitted by pine trees forms an aromatic hydrocarbon in small yields.  This is a surprising result but if it occurs for other biogenic hydrocarbons as well, this process may contribute to unrecognized sources of aromatics in air;\n\n(4) Enhancement in the photochemistry that releases oxides of nitrogen and highly reactive halogens into the gas phase via an unexpected synergistic interaction with the halide ions in sea salt.\n\nOur research has contributed to our understanding of the fundamental processes that ultimately connect the impact of sea salt chemistry to visibility, climate and health.  It has demonstrated the close interconnectedness of halogen chemistry in the troposphere with the formation and loss of ozone, a greenhouse gas and a toxic air pollutant for which air quality standards are set.  It has also elucidated the close relationship of sea salt particles, organics and oxides of nitrogen in air.  This has implications for chemistry in the Arctic snowpack as well as in mid-latitudes, including polluted and remote regions.  The data generated in this research provide important inputs for quantitative computer models of the atmosphere and hence predicting impacts of air quality on visibility, climate and health.\n\nTwo graduate students, one undergraduate, two postdoctoral fellows and a project scientist as well as the PI have been involved in this research; six of the seven are female.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows presented the results of this research at many national meetings.  One of the graduate students won a poster award at an ACS National Meeting.  The PI gave a number of talks to K-12 students and teachers.  The PI has also maintained a close relationship with faculty at California State University Los Angeles (CSULA), a predominantly undergraduate institution with a high percentage of\nunderrepresented minorities in science. Finally, the PI is a major contributor to a summer teacher workshop directed to middle and high school teachers. It provides the cu..."
