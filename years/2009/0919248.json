 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is creating instructional materials designed to help students achieve the professional growth needed in team-based design projects and professional practice and to empower faculty for effective assessment-driven development of the students' ability and attitudes in teamwork and professional development.  The project builds on a prior NSF funded project and involves a diverse set of institutions. Curriculum materials are being designed to connect with students' previous experience and knowledge, develop knowledge with underlying structure or organization, construct understanding in the context of an engineering design, and refine understanding through focused feedback. Instructional activities engage learners in content and the professional community, using steps such as: motivation/purpose, posing inquiry questions, individual exploration, group processing, application of learning, and reflection.  Instructor guides are being developed to coach educators on how and when to use instructional materials and assessments for best results in their design classes.  Evaluation efforts include qualitative and quantitative measures (surveys, focused interviews, and student essays) to monitor progress on each project outcome.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the project's instructional material.",
