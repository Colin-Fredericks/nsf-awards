A need persists to develop predictive models that can be utilized as design tools for development of nanostructured bulk thermoelectric materials, which can be formed quickly and, potentially, inexpensively. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Two-component granular nanocomposites will be investigated from analytical as well as experimental perspectives. A microscopic model will take into account the electronic structure properties of the materials, as well as granular characteristics such as the interface barrier and size. Of particular importance will be the interplay between electronic structure changes due to doping of the individual components, and the scattering from the grain interfaces. The experimental research will involve synthesis and characterization of these materials. Measurements will serve as benchmarks for the proposed theory, and will also guide the research. The systems to be investigated are two-phase granular nanocomposites such as lead telluride/europium telluride, lead telluride/bismuth telluride, lead telluride/metal, and bismuth telluride/metal. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Development of inexpensive, highly efficient thermoelectric materials is a key to realize large scale conversion of waste heat to high grade electrical energy. Other potential benefits include, for example, displacement of compression air conditioners in automobiles, possibly leading to substantial reductions in leakage and emissions of harmful refrigerants into the atmosphere. \r\n\r\n",
