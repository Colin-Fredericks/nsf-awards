 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this investigation, both laboratory studies and astronomical observations will be performed related to H3+, the simplest molecule with more than two atoms.  The infrared spectrum of H3+ will be measured with record precision, enabling new tests of theoretical calculations.  The reaction of H3+ with molecular hydrogen (H2) will be measured at the lowest temperatures yet, to probe interesting quantum mechanical effects and support astronomical observations.  The infrared spectrum of the larger hydrogen ion H5+ will also be measured to provide constraints on the reaction mentioned above.  In terms of astronomy, large telescopes will be used to measure the abundance of H3+ in various clouds of gas between the stars, and the effect of the reaction of H3+ with H2 on interstellar H2 and H3+ will be modeled.\r\n\r\nThis program can be expected to have several broader impacts because of its interdisciplinary nature and its development of novel experimental approaches.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the young interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry.  The integration of research and education will continue to be fostered through the development of new courses in astrochemistry.  Interactions between scientists who consider themselves primarily physicists, chemists, or astronomers will be encouraged by an astrochemistry seminar series and also through the organization of a regional astrochemistry consortium.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nH3+ is the simplest molecule with more than two atoms, and is also an important molecule in the chemistry that occurs in the space between the stars.  We have engaged in an interdisciplinary program of laboratory measurements and astronomical observations to better understand the details of how this molecule reacts with molecular hydrogen, how it reacts with electrons, and how it is distributed among its different energy levels in interstellar space.\n\nIn our laboratory in Urbana, we have used an infrared laser to study the dependence of the reaction between H3+ and H2 on the configuration of the nuclear spins of the molecules.  We have also developed a piece of equipment that can produce H3+ in such a way that a particular nuclear spin configuration is enhanced, and we characterized this equipment using an infrared laser.  We then took this equipment to Heidelberg, Germany, and measured the dependence of the rate of the reaction of H3+ with electrons on the nuclear spin configuration.\n\nUsing large infrared telescopes around the world, we have measured how much H3+ is present in interstellar space, and how it is distributed among its nuclear spin configurations.  We combined our laboratory measurements with theoretical models to gain the first insights into why this distribution is not consistent with the known temperature of the interstellar clouds we've studied.  We also discovered a large amount of H3+ in a cloud that is interacting with the remnant of an exploded star (supernova), which suggests that H3+ may be produced by high-energy particles formed in these remnants.\n\nAlso in Heidelberg, we measured the nuclear-spin dependence of the reaction of H3+ with H2 in a very cold environment called a cryogenic ion trap, which has a temperature comparable to interstellar clouds.  This direct measurement helped confirm our understanding of the nuclear-spin distribution of H3+ in interstellar clouds.\n\nIn our laboratory in Urbana, we have also developed a new scheme to measure the spectrum of H3+ with much higher precision than has been previously possible.  We have also taken initial steps towards the development of a new type of laser based on solid hydrogen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin J Mccall"
