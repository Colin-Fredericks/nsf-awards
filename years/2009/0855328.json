It is expected that\r\nthe conference will host 50?80 participants, including 40?50 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  This will be the seventh annual meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium series. The first meeting in the series was held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, in the fall of 2003, and since then meetings have been held each fall. The focus of the meetings is on operator algebras and non-commutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas from number theory to quantum physics. In addition to facilitating interaction between researchers in the field, the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposia are forums in which young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the eastern region of the United States can acquaint hemselves with current issues at the forefront of research, present their own work, and interact with senior mathematicians in the field.\r\n\r\n",
