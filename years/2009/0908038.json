 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eric Feigelson (Pennsylvania State University) and his collaborators will carry out a multi-faceted investigation into the astrophysics of massive star-forming regions (MSFRs). This work is founded on the recent recognition that sensitive high-resolution X-ray images of rich young stellar clusters and their associated gaseous environments give critical information unavailable at longer wavelengths. The Chandra X-ray Observatory provides large, well-defined, and nearly disk-unbiased samples of pre-main sequence and massive cluster members with negligible contamination from older field stars. These X-ray sources have subarcsecond positions, are readily associated with stars from infrared (IR) surveys, and can be identified even through heavy absorption. When these stellar sources are removed, the X-ray images reveal faint diffuse emission produced by shocked O star winds suffusing HII regions on parsec scales.  Combining the X-ray-selected sample with IR-excess sources, established from near- and mid-IR surveys, will result in the best stellar census available with thousands of low-mass, hundreds of intermediate-mass, and dozens of OB stellar members in 20 MSFRs with ages less than or equal to 8 million years, lying within 4 kiloparsecs of the Sun.  Using this uniform, detailed database, the team will then pursue astrophysical investigations into the structure and origins of rich stellar clusters, and their feedback onto their natal clouds. The work is conducted in collaboration with expert, international groups located at the University of Exeter, McMaster University, and the University of Leeds.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing detailed understanding of the 20 targeted MSFRs, this work should significantly deepen our general astrophysical understanding of star formation in the Galaxy. These results will strengthen our ability to predict the evolution of protoplanetary disks in hostile environments near OB stars. This work also represents an early synergism between high-energy X-ray astronomy and ground-based optical/IR astronomy for understanding the complex processes of star formation and Galactic ecology.  Members of this team will also conduct a program of outreach to an underserved population of rural Americans who have little access to modern science and technology. During the award period, they will participate in a new program of in-service workshops for both rural and urban secondary school science teachers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost stars form in massive molecular clouds dominated by rich clusters with luminous O-type stars.  But the complex distributions of obscuring clouds, bright nebulosity, and irrelevant older field stars prevent straightforward construction of a census of young stars formed in the cloud.  The MYStIX Project funded by this grant overcomes this problem to a considerable degree by combining samples from X-ray images obtained with NASA\u00c6s Chandra X-ray Observatory, near-infrared images obtained with the United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope, and mid-infrared images obtained with NASA\u00c6s Spitzer Space Telescope.  The resulting sample of ~31,000 MYStIX Probable Complex Members in 20 cloud complexes between 0.5 and 4 kiloparsecs from the Sun is the most comprehensive census of young stars obtained to date.  \n\nThe attached figures illustrate some of the findings.  Figures 1 and 2 show one of the 20 MYStIX star forming regions, first as a smoothed X-ray image and then as a decomposition into several elliptical subcultures.  Figure 3 displays the distribution of MYStIX stars in various fields with color scaled to total stellar population density.  Figure 4 shows one of the unexpected results - a stellar age gradient from the center to the edge of a rich cluster known as the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024).  The blue color in Figure 5 shows the previously unmapped hot gas in the NGC 6357 star forming region, visualizing the generation of the Galaxy\u00c6s hot interstellar medium.  \n\nBroad new insights into star formation in cloud forming complexes have emerged.  Star clusters form at many locations and times in dense cloud cores.  Some members are concentrated in small dense clusters within molecular cloud cores, but more are dispersed throughout the region from clusters formed several million years ago.   Rich clusters are not formed monolithically in a single event, as intra-cluster age gradients are present.  Complicated processes involving cluster merging, expansion and evaporation are likely operative.  The ionized HII regions produced by the rich clusters are suffused with very hot X-ray emitting gas; this is very difficult to detect and has been best revealed in MYStIX images.   However, the environment of HII regions is not as hostile to the protoplanetary disks as once thought.  Studies of star formation in these molecular clouds in the Galaxy today gives hints about the conditions under whcih the Sun and its Solar System formed several billion years ago.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric D Feigelson"
