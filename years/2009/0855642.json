 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many technological marvels in modern society rely upon our ability to\r\nunderstand and control the properties of materials on a microscopic\r\nlevel, such as tuning the electrical conductivity in semiconductors that\r\nare used to make computer chips. In the last decade, there have been\r\ngreat advances in the creation and study of ultracold clouds of gaseous\r\natoms, which are cooled by lasers to temperatures around a millionth of\r\na degree above absolute zero. Ultracold atoms made in this way have the\r\namazing property that their interactions can be arbitrarily controlled,\r\nwhich opens the possibility of using them to make designer materials or\r\ntest models of complex and important phenomena such as high temperature\r\nsuperconductivity. The tool currently used to control these interactions\r\nis the application of a strong magnetic field, but magnetic fields have\r\ndisadvantages; it is difficult to quickly change large magnetic fields\r\nor vary fields on small length scales. Prof. Killian's research group at\r\nRice University in Houston, Texas will develop new techniques for\r\nmanipulating atom-atom interactions using lasers, which are much more\r\nflexible and may open the way to new applications such as laser beams\r\nmade of atoms instead of light, or the ability to make new states of matter.\r\n\r\nThis work will also involve at least two graduate students and one\r\nundergraduate student, and it will train them for high-technology\r\ncareers in optics or materials. The ultracold atomic physics laboratory\r\nat Rice also has a partnership with the Houston campus of Yes Prep High\r\nSchool, a highly successful charter school targeting disadvantaged\r\nyouth. This collaboration brings high school students into the\r\nlaboratory for term-time visits and summer camps, and introduces them to\r\nthe excitement of science at the frontiers of discovery in hopes of\r\ninspiring them to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math\r\ncareers. Basic atomic physics experiments such as these are laying the\r\nscientific and human resources foundation today for the technological\r\nmarvels of tomorrow.",
