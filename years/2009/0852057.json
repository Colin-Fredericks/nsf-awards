 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a REU Site in the Department of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.  The program is called 'Back to the Future' and will offer a unique 10-week summer research program that integrates Metallurgical Engineering projects with historical, cultural and artistic significance. Ten undergraduate students will be recruited each year for three years from regional tribal colleges and universities nation-wide. Planned REU activities make use of the research facilities of the Advanced Materials Processing Center on campus and involve faculty members from different departments.  In addition to the research projects, the REU students will participate in a number of professional skills development activities, such as technical communication training, seminars and hands-on workshops on Archaeometallurgy, Art and History of Metallurgy. Participating students will have opportunities to present their research results at South Dakota State Capital, Pierre, and in national meetings of professional societies. \r\n\r\nThis program is responsive to the National Research Council report 'Globalization of Materials R&D' that details a need for increased research and development of metals in the U.S.A. The proposed new approach of this program i.e., an emphasis on understanding the historical and artistic context of Metallurgical Engineering research projects is expected to provide a richer learning environment for undergraduate students. This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. Within NSF, this award is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division of Engineering Education Centers in the Engineering Directorate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) \"Back to the Future Site\" at the South Dakota School of Mines is an integrated 10-week summer research program focused in Metallurgical Engineering.  Undergraduate students from many engineering and science disciplines work with a team of faculty mentors on important topics in Metallurgical Engineering including advanced alloy development, materials joining, nanotechnology, minerals processing, microstructural characterization, and corrosion engineering.  Many of these topics have the potential for far-reaching impact in terms of public welfare by increasing the efficiency of power systems, increasing sustainability of structural materials, and bolstering domestic development of important natural resources.   Figure 1 shows an example of the results from one of the research projects that embodies the Back to the Future theme &ndash; namely historic significance.  This research project investigated the corrosion properties of steel from the U.S.S. Arizona memorial. The left side of Figure 1 shows corrosion rates measured from the steel.  The right side of Figure 1 shows the internal structure of the steel. \n\nIn, addition to conducting research, students participate in a highly advanced professional development program with technical seminars on global trends in metallurgy and an integrated technical communications program.  The results are that nearly 50% of the participants have either published or presented their research at a regional or national conference.  Engineering faculty have also teamed with faculty from the humanities to develop supplemental workshops and activities in the art and history of metallurgy to provide a unique historical framework for current research, hence the \"Back to the Future\" theme.  These activities have included artistic metal working, blacksmithing, and casting.  Figure 2 shows an example of one such workshop where the REU students being led through a workshop on the art of blacksmithing given by master blacksmith Jack Parks, Piedmont, SD.\n\nAssessment data shows positive student experience in the program as shown in Figure 3 Underrepresented students including women and Native American students are advanced by the program.  During the first funding period, over 20% of participants were Native American and over 40% of participants were female.   Preliminary assessment data suggests the unique nature of site supplemental activities (focused on the historic, artistic, and cultural impacts of metals) may help to attract and retain students from these underrepresented groups.  Evidence also suggests that a richer learning environment may be created in engineering by providing this context in the liberal arts.  The unique learning environment may help to enhance educational opportunities for students of different learning styles or typologies.   Finally, REU students participate in outreach activities designed to expose young middle and high school students to the science and technology disciplines.  Figure 4 shows an example of outreach activities with Native American high school students from South Dakota.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/25/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael K West"
