 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the project is to develop and deploy a repository that supports the sharing and transition of model-driven development (MDD) experience and knowledge to a broad community of researchers, practitioners, and educators. MDD research focuses on developing techniques and technologies that enable generation of dependable software from abstract models. The Repository for Model Driven Development (ReMoDD) will contain documented MDD case studies, models illustrating good and poor modeling practices, and educational material. The ReMoDD platform will provide interfaces and interchange mechanisms that users and tools can use to retrieve and submit artifacts. MDD researchers can use ReMoDD artifacts to evaluate research results, and to perform comparative and empirical MDD studies. Practitioners and students can use the resource to gain better understanding of MDD practices and techniques, while educators can use ReMoDD to share teaching experience and materials. The development of ReMoDD is a collaborative effort involving teams from Colorado State University (CSU) and Michigan State University (MSU). The teams will interact with the MDD community to collect and evaluate candidate ReMoDD artifacts. An Advisory Board of leading MDD researchers and practitioners has been established to ensure that ReMoDD becomes a useful and sustainable community resource.",
