 "awd_abstract_narration": "Businesses and other organizations increasingly rely on business\r\nprocess management, and in particular the management of electronic\r\nworkflows underlying business processes. These workflows are often\r\ncentered around a database. They are typically very complex and prone\r\nto costly bugs, which leads to a critical need for computer-aided\r\ndesign and static analysis tools. Such tools would result in enhanced\r\nfunctionality, as well as increased confidence in the robustness and\r\ncorrectness of complex business processes.  They would potentially\r\nbenefit a wide variety of applications ranging from e-commerce to\r\ndigital government to healthcare and scientific applications. \r\n\r\nClassical software verification techniques applicable to static analysis \r\ninclude model checking and theorem proving. However, both have serious\r\nlimitations: Model checking requires finite-state abstraction, which\r\nresults in serious loss of semantics for both the business process and\r\nverified properties. Theorem proving is incomplete and requires expert\r\nuser feedback. This project proposes an alternative approach to\r\nstatic analysis. Instead of applying general-purpose techniques with\r\nonly partial guarantees of success, it aims to identify restricted but\r\nsufficiently expressive classes of business processes for which sound\r\nand complete static analysis can be performed in a fully automatic way.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the target of verification consists of semantically rich\r\ndata-aware workflows, in contrast to the traditional process-centric\r\nworkflows. Data awareness is a feature of central importance in\r\napplications such as the above, which has recently led to the\r\nemergence of a new approach to workflow specification in which data is\r\npre-eminent. This approach, introduced by IBM, focuses on data records,\r\nknown as \"business artifacts\" or simply \"artifacts\", that correspond\r\nto key business-relevant objects, their life cycles, and the\r\nservices (or tasks) that are invoked on the artifacts.\r\nIBM's artifact-centric approach has been demonstrated to yield\r\nsubstantial improvements to the operations of medium- and large-sized\r\nbusinesses. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the present project is to develop\r\nnew tools for the high-level specification and verification of such\r\ndata-centric business processes. The project investigates the\r\ntrade-offs between the expressiveness of the specification language\r\nand the feasibility of the analysis tasks. It aims to establish\r\ntractability boundaries for static analysis and to develop practical\r\nalgorithms and heuristics. Tools are to be developed for carrying out\r\nanalysis tasks, that will be integrated with Siena, IBM's prototype\r\nfor compiling artifact-centric business process specifications into\r\nworkflow support code. The technical problems raised are\r\nintellectually quite challenging, and bring into play techniques from\r\nlogic, automata theory, computational complexity, algorithms, and\r\ncomputer-aided verification. The resulting static analysis tools have\r\nhigh potential for becoming a transformational technology in the area\r\nof business processes.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page\r\nhttp://db.ucsd.edu/artifacts\r\n\r\n",
