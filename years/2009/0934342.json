 "awd_abstract_narration": "Center for Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing \r\nIIP- 0934342 \r\nUniversity of Michigan \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to renew the University of Michigan's participation in the Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing center, an I/UCRC center that was created in 2002. The center was initially established as a single university center and currently has grown to a multi-university center with participation from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Southern Methodist University. The main focus of the center's research is in laser applications for advanced manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed work is to develop atomic level understanding of the laser materials processing needed for intelligent manufacturing. The knowledge gained will lead to new and novel materials and manufacturing methodology. In the past four years, the University of Michigan site has made a big stride in developing and implementing application-driven basic research for laser-based advanced manufacturing. The University of Michigan site is working effectively as it is well supported by industrial members and the projects are challenging and clearly important. The equipment at the University of Michigan is substantial and the projects discussed, ranging from laser welding to mathematical modeling of residual stresses in direct metal deposition, are ambitious and worthwhile. \r\n\r\nLaser processing techniques are expected to increase well beyond the applications of today as research provides improved development of this important process. The integrated effort of multi-university center for laser applications provides a great benefit to the society in terms of helping US industries to be more competitive in advanced manufacturing. The University of Michigan site will provide education and training to prepare students to meet future workforce needs. The university will provide a unique experience to graduate students who can interact and collaborate with industrial researchers and engineers. The university will continue to involve undergraduate students through REUs. \r\n",
