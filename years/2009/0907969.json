 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program will examine the reionization of the Universe in both hydrogen and helium, combining analytical and numerical approaches to elucidate the physics underlying reionization and how it is influenced by the nature and abundance of the ionizing sources and the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM).  The analysis will be further employed to consider the impact of reionization on observable signatures of this process, including fluctuations in 21 cm radiation from hydrogen at high redshifts, surveys of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies, spectra of gamma-ray bursts, and the statistical properties of the Lyman-alpha forest. The results of this investigation will be used to guide optimal observing strategies for ongoing and future experiments to investigate emission from high-redshift galaxies, quasars, and diffuse gas in the IGM.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work include training of underrepresented students, and public outreach through visualizations and simulations accessible through the web.  \r\n",
