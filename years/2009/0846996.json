The considered problems are nonlinear variational\r\nor partial differential equations, and the degeneracy in question\r\ncan take various forms: loss of dimension, loss of regularity, or\r\nunboundedness.  The first set of questions relates to the\r\nmathematical theory of nonlinear elasticity, which studies large\r\nmechanical deformations of three-dimensional elastic bodies.  The\r\ninvestigator undertakes a long-term research program, with the\r\nscope of: deriving lower-dimensional shell theories through the\r\nmethods of Gamma-convergence and understanding their connections\r\nwith the geometry of the mid-surface, analyzing the\r\n(infinitesimal) isometries of surfaces and the effects of\r\nrigidity on the derived theories, studying nonlinear phenomena\r\nsuch as buckling and blistering for a given shell under\r\ncompression (one application is related to plant growth).  The\r\nsecond set of questions in this project relates to fluid\r\ndynamics.  Boundary irregularities of various structures and\r\nscales are considered in the limit when the boundary behavior\r\nbecomes degenerate.  Other problems concern traveling fronts in\r\ncombustion in unbounded channels, and the dynamics of solutions\r\nwith large initial data under the Navier boundary conditions in\r\nthin three-dimensional shells. \r\n\r\n     Because elastic thin (or otherwise \"degenerate\") objects of\r\nvarious geometries are ubiquitous in the physical world, the\r\nprecise understanding of laws governing their equilibria has many\r\npotential applications.  For example, many growing tissues\r\n(leaves, flowers, or marine invertebrates) exhibit complicated\r\nconfigurations during their free growth and one would like to\r\nreproduce them with man-made means.  A related long-standing\r\nproblem in the mathematical theory of elasticity is to rigorously\r\npredict theories of such lower-dimensional objects starting from\r\nthe nonlinear theory of full three-dimensional objects.  For\r\nplates, a very recent effort has lead to rigorous justification\r\nof a hierarchy of such theories, depending on the magnitude of\r\nthe applied forces and resulting in stretching, crumpling,\r\nbending, or a combination of these.  For shells (when the\r\nmid-surface is curved), despite extensive use of their ad hoc\r\ngeneralizations in the literature and engineering applications,\r\nmuch less is known from the mathematical point of view.  The\r\ninvestigator identifies several nonlinear problems in continuum\r\nmechanics of solids and fluid dynamics, naturally posed in\r\nspecific degenerate domains, with the intention of rigorously\r\nunderstanding the behavior of the system based on general\r\nprinciples.  At the heart of the program are interesting\r\nconnections between calculus of variations, differential\r\nequations, geometry, material science, fluid dynamics, numerical\r\nanalysis, and even biology.  They have a potential to deliver\r\nuseful observations in e.g. structural mechanics, while\r\nintegrating the goal of exposing scientific results to a broader\r\ncommunity at various education levels. \r\n",
