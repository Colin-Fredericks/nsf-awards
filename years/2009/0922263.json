 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds which permit Drs John Gabrieli and Robert Desimone to purchase an Elekta Neuromag system for human brain imaging. The instrument will be integrated into the Martinos Imaging Center at MIT and will complement the Center's existing neuroimaging capabilities currently based on magnetic resonance imaging. The Neuromag has 306 MEG channels plus up to 124 channels for simultaneous EEG. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a powerful technology for noninvasive imaging of human brain activity. It measures magnetic signals given off by active brain cells and it combines good spatial with very high temporal resolution. In particular, MEG makes it possible to study the flow of information through the brain during cognitive tasks and can reveal the high-frequency oscillations which are fundamental to the physiological mechanism by which different brain areas communicate with each other. The technique therefore is extremely well suited to answering a wide range of basic questions about human brain function. For example it has made important contributions in areas such as somatosensory and auditory processing, and particularly in the study of language, a distinctively human capability for which the rapid neural processes involved are not well resolved by fMRI. It is also possible to use this technique on children, including newborns, and this approach has the potential to transform understanding of early brain development including development of perceptual abilities, language and many other aspects of brain function.\r\n\r\nAlthough the justification for purchase of this instrument rests on the basic research which will be performed and the insights into normal brain functioning which will result, MEG also has clinical applications. It is a potentially powerful tool for translational research, for example for identifying patterns of brain activity that might serve as biomarkers for brain disorders. The instrumentation can also be used to study the neural effects of educational interventions in such areas as reading or musical training and as a basis for developing human brain-machine interfaces.",
