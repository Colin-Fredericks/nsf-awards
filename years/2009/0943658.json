In China, rapid urban growth in many areas (such as Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi Province) has put heavy strain on the water and ecological systems such as Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China and an important ecosystem in the world.  At the present time, Poyang Lake is still relatively clean compared to some other major lakes in China, such as Lake Tai, but it is being threatened by erosion, pollution (such as heavy metals), and eutrophication.  With China's rapid economic growth, the pressure for industrial and other urban development is very intense.  The supported U.S. participants in the workshop will meet with Chinese colleagues to exchange expertise and experience with regard to potential and probable development of the Poyang Lake region.  Workshop topics include: water and watershed pollution control-strategy and techniques, ecosystem protection and restoration, source water protection, eutrophication control-experiences and new strategies, and water pollution control-economic aspects.  It is an explicit goal for international collaborative research projects to evolve from this workshop.  \r\n\r\nThis grant is supported jointly by OISE and ENG.",
