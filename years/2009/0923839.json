 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nPutinar\r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at sponsoring the travel of a number of young researchers and \r\nmathematicians belonging to under represented minorities from US to the Fields Institute, \r\nto attend the meeting \"Multivariate Operator Theory\", for the duration of a week in \r\nAugust 2009. Multivariate operator theory is a very dynamic branch of modern analysis \r\nwhich has emerged in to a full area of research in the last two decades with contributions \r\nfrom classical operator theory, differential geometry, complex analysis of several \r\ncomplex variables, Lie group representations, global analysis and local commutative  \r\nalgebra.  Its fundamental interdisciplinary structure makes imperative that the various \r\ngroups of experts meet regularly and exchange their latest ideas and contributions. The \r\nconference will have a modest schedule with significant breaks to allow collaboration, \r\ndiscussion of new problems and informal interaction. The young participants will have a \r\nunique opportunity to have an overview of the field of multivariate operator theory, to \r\ngrasp its present challenges and meet experts in contingent areas of mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe impact of the meeting beyond operator theory, to areas of differential geometry, \r\ncomplex analytic geometry, function theory, index theory and group representations will \r\nbe significant. The well established existing links between these fields (for instance via \r\nK-theory, or via topological cohomology) offer a solid framework for sustaining the \r\ninterdisciplinary component of the meeting.",
