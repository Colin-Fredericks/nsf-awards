 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the improvement in electric machine operation when unidirectional motion is taken into account, since the vast majority of generators and motors rotate in a single direction.  The approach is to precisely sculpt the stator and rotor surfaces, thus affecting the electromagnetic field in the air gap so that the production of electromechanical torque is increased. The transformative value of this approach rests in its generality, being applicable to rotating machines of any power rating, material, or type. \r\n\r\nThis research will involve analysis using the electromagnetic finite element method embedded inside an optimization loop, by adapting shape sensitivity-based design methods. This work is important because (1) it will advance our understanding of electromechanical energy conversion; (2) it will lead to generic methodologies for obtaining optimal machine designs; and (3) it involves multidisciplinary research in electric machines, power electronics, numerical computation, and optimization.\r\n\r\nThis research will result in lighter-weight, more efficient, and more cost-effective solutions for electromechanical energy conversion for virtually all generation and motion applications. Hence, its overall environmental and economical impact will be tremendous.  The project will contribute to the education of power engineers at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and a conscious effort will be made to recruit underrepresented students. Additionally, the PI will establish mentoring relationships with local high-school students. A series of distance education courses, short courses, and seminars will be developed.  Finally, the research insights and results will be integrated into a textbook on optimal electric machine design.\r\n\r\n",
