 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been extensively researched as a promising alternative to single atoms for the study of quantum physics and development of quantum technology. In this research program the PI will use photonic crystal structures to modify and enhance QD properties, allowing coherent interactions between a QD and a photon field. Such interactions are essential elements of photonic quantum information processing. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The PI aims to design, fabricate, and optically characterize nanophotonic devices to coherently control and probe the quantum mechanical wavefunction of quantum dots on ultra-fast timescales. The devices will be composed of photonic crystal cavity-waveguide structures that have the ability to localize light to within a cubic wavelength.  This localization creates strong interactions between a QD and an optical field, which will be used to investigate opto-electronic devices with improved performance, study basic physical properties of QDs, and create entanglement between QDs and photons. In addition, QD-photon entanglement will be studied as a method for creating optical interconnects between spatially separated QDs to develop integrated quantum devices.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The proposed research will help develop new fundamental concepts in the control of semiconductor nanostructures at the quantum level, as well as coherent light-matter interactions.  The proposal also includes an extensive educational outreach effort. The PI has recently developed an undergraduate summer internship program which enables University of Maryland students to participate in leading research.  He will expand this program to include local high school students.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this program was to investigate strong interactions between quantum dots and photonic crystal structures in order to engineer and control light-matter interactions.  These interactions play a crucial role in photonics and open up the possibility for opto-electronic devices operating at low energy levels.  Initially, we explored these nonlinearities for developing all-optical switches that operate at extremely low energy levels.  All-optical switching is an important component in optical communication and network applications.  Such switches typically rely on conventional nonlinear materials that exhibit only a weak nonlinearity and thur require large optical energies.  Our device structure was able to switch one light beam with a second light beam composed of only approximately 100 photons, which was a world record switching energy at the time.  Further improvements could reduce these energies down to the single-photon level, representing the fundamental limit of optical switching.\n\n \n\nBecause our device works very close to the quantum limit, it can also enable new types of optical switches that exhibit quantum mechanical behavior.  These quantum switches serve as the fundamental building blocks for quantum networks and quantum computers that enable unconditionally secure communication and exponential speedup of computational algorithms.  To demonstrate such a quantum switch, we exploited the bright exciton states of a quantum dot in order to store quantum information within the switching device.  The quantum state of the dot then applied a polarization rotation on a photon, implementing a fundamental operation known as a controlled NOT (cNOT) gate.  The cNOT gate is a universal quantum operation that can be used to implement all quantum logic. \n\n \n\nOne of the limitations of our quantum switch was that it exhibited poor quantum coherence properties.  To improve the coherence, we have recently demonstrated an analogous quantum switch that utilizes a single trapped spin in a quantum dot.  Spin provides a pristine quantum system that can support four orders of magnitude longer coherence times and fast all-optical control.  Using this spin system coupled to a cavity, we have demonstrated a single-photon spin switch, where the state of a photon conditionally flips the spin-state of the dot.  This spin-switch is a crucial building block for quantum networks. \n\n \n\nIn addition to the fundamental breakthroughs we have described above, we have steadily engineered and pushed the device performance.  We have developed novel planar integrated devices that can enable chip-integration with a nanoscale device footprint. We have also developed in-situ tuning methods for aligning multiple devices spectrally, a key requirement for device integration.  These improvements demonstrate a promising pathway to ultra-compact quantum devices operating at high bandwidths and extremely low energy consumption.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edo Waks"
