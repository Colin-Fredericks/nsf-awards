 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to investigate the static and dynamic characteristics of magnetically actuated compliant micromanipulators and to realize innovative design and advanced control, enabling multi-axis scanning of three-dimensional micrometer/nanometer objects. The proposed approaches consist of three phases. First, static and dynamic models of the compliant manipulator will be developed and multi-axis magnetic actuation will be analyzed. The aim is to enable rational design and characterization of multi-axis probing systems. Second, advanced control schemes will be developed to enable multi-axis scanning of three-dimensional objects. The multi-axis scanning scheme can operate at contact mode as well as tapping mode. Third, a two-axis scanning probe microscopic system will be realized. Compared to other attempts to achieve greater access to three-dimensional samples, which use specialized probes and require a priori knowledge of the pose and nominal geometry of the sample, the two-axis scanning probe microscopic system can be employed to scan three-dimensional objects with unknown geometry. \r\n\r\nUpon successful completion, technological innovations created from this award will open up important new research applications in manufacturing. Compared to conventional scanning probe microscopes, which are two-dimensional planar tools, the two-axis scanning probe microscopic system is a three-dimensional surface tool. It represents a transformational change in how scanning probe microscopy can be used in ultra precision manufacturing. \r\n",
