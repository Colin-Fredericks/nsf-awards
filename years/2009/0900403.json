 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support LaserFest, a collection of public outreach and education efforts surrounding the 50th anniversary of the invention of the laser in 2010.  The primary goals of the project are to: 1) inform students, educators, legislators, and the general public about the impact of the laser, and 2) illustrate the importance of scientific and technological innovation, using the laser as a specific example.  LaserFest is designed as an outreach activity. Scientists will collaborate with media and outreach professionals to bring the message of LaserFest to as broad an audience as possible. Communication will be achieved by means of personal appearances in lecture and demonstration shows, through an extensive body of information conveyed on the web and in video presentations, and by leveraging LaserFest activity through media coverage. A principal gauge of the success of the celebration will be through evaluating audience feedback, and tracking web traffic and media exposure.  This award is cofunded by the Physics Division, the Division of Materials Research, the Chemistry Division, and the Division of Multidisciplinary Activities.",
