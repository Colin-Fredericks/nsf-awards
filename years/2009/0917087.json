In such dynamic environments, network algorithms for quality of services (QoS) provisioning  hinge heavily on state information exchange, and  network functions are intimately tied with the  complexity of message passing. This project aims to pursue a systematic characterization of the impact of message passing complexity, a fundamental yet under explored area. Under such a common theme, the proposed research is organized into two coordinated thrusts.\r\n\r\n1) Thrust I  focuses on the impact of message passing complexity on effective throughput and  delay performance of wireless scheduling. Novel vacation models are developed to account for signaling complexity, and effective throughput is studied using the fluid approach and delay analysis is carried out by diffusion approximation. \r\n\r\n2) In Thrust II, noisy feedback models are devised to  account for message passing complexity in distributed rate control algorithms using various optimization methods, and stochastic stability is characterized accordingly.  The framework here provides a platform to compare different rate control algorithms in terms of complexity and robustness.\r\n \r\nThis project will significantly advance the understanding of the impact of message passing complexity on QoS provisioning in  stochastic wireless networks. The study on open problems, such as delay performance of wireless scheduling, will open up new research directions in this area. Undergraduate students  will get involved to carry out  network performance measurements in this project.\r\n",
