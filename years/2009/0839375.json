 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop innovative technology for conducting the diagnosis and prognosis of vibro-acoustic characteristics of a complex machine. This technology aims to offer substantial advantages over current technologies such as experimental modal analysis (EMA) and operational modal analysis (OMA). EMA and OMA attempt to gain an insight into the integrity of a vibrating structure by extracting modal parameters. The knowledge acquired cannot be used in noise abatement, however, because modal parameters have no direct relation to sound. The new technology exploits the concept that sound and vibrations are two different physical phenomena, and will enable users to obtain a clear and better understanding of the root causes of vibration-induced noise. Also, the input data to this technology can be collected by using non-contact, non-invasive measurement equipment. Hence, users can use this new technology to tackle noise and vibration issues of a complex machine running in its native and normal operating condition.\r\n\r\nThe potential outcomes of this project should broadly impact science and technology in sound, structures, and their interactions. Additionally, the knowledge gained will have a profound impact on noise and vibrations, including not only diagnosis and prognosis, but product quality control and product testing because noise is an indicator of defects in products at various stage of a manufacturing process. Noise is also a significant health and environmental issue. According to the National Institute of Health, over 10 million Americans suffer permanent noise-induced hearing loss and about 30 million Americans are exposed to daily noise levels that eventually impair their hearing. The proposed technology will enable users to identify and abate undesirable sound and vibrations in the most cost-effective manner. Use of the proposed technology will significantly enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing industries in the United States in tackling a variety of noise and vibration issues.",
