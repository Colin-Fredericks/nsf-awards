 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\"\r\n\r\nCurrently plasmon resonances are mostly studied numerically or experimentally by using a ?trial-anderror?\r\napproach, i.e., by probing nanoparticles with radiation of various frequencies and polarizations.\r\nThe goal of this project is to advance novel techniques for the direct analysis of plasmon resonance\r\nfrequencies and plasmon modes in nanoparticles by treating plasmon resonances as an eigen value\r\nproblem. The main emphasis of the research work on this project will be the development of novel\r\nboundary integral equation techniques for the time-domain analysis of plasmon resonances, finding the\r\nconditions for efficient coupling of incident radiation to specific plasmon modes, and the study of\r\ngeneral physical properties of plasmon resonances. It is expected that new powerful software tools will\r\nbe developed for the design of promising engineering nanostructures. It is also intended to explore the\r\ndevice applications of plasmon resonances in semiconductor nanoparticles where these resonances can\r\nbe controlled through optical manipulation of the conduction electron density. This controllability is\r\nespecially promising for the development of all-optical nanotransistors. Furthermore, the research\r\nactivities on this project will include the study of applications of plasmon resonances in both thermally\r\nassisted and all-optical magnetic recording as well as the elucidation of the electromagnetic mechanism\r\nof surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).",
