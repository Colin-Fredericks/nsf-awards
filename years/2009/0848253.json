 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project focuses on the development of a product line of miniature pumping systems for the controlled delivery of fluids in ultra-low flow rate range (nanoliters to microliters per minute). This line of micropump systems will provide pulse-free flow and controlled micro-volume dispensing in this challenging low volume regime. The non-mechanical nature and operating principles of this pump afford an unusual degree of freedom in pump design. The ability to tailor the shape and size of the micropump to specific applications can be very valuable, particularly in small devices where the available space is significantly constrained (for example, point-of-care devices, portable chemical and biological analysis systems, and micro-dosing devices). \r\n\r\nThere is a growing diversity of chemical and biological analyses that are taking place within small chips, as well as in the rising demand for ultra-small dosing systems. Such analyses are continuing to shrink in size and measurements that have conventionally been performed in a laboratory and are now being adapted to handheld devices. These micro-analysis systems can provide immediate results without waiting for laboratory analyses. For example, the analysis of blood samples is being adapted to small devices, so important results are available at the point-of-care. Likewise, the desire is growing for small, portable dosing systems for animal studies and for human medications (like insulin and chronic pain management). All of these applications require micropumps for the controlled delivery of compounds. Fundamental engineering constraints mean that conventional mechanical pumps cannot be simply decreased in size to meet this challenge. These miniature non-mechanical pumps require very little power, can be controlled to deliver at constant flow rate or specific dispensing volumes, and offer the pulse-less flow that is not accessible by other pumps. This provides a significant market opportunity in the liquid pumping market (roughly $160 million presently), into the animal dosing (valued at approximately $90 million per year) and human drug delivery (valued at $80 billion presently) markets.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "SBIR Phase II/TECP/IIIB (#0848253) \nShape Variations in the Development of Miniature Micropumps \nSBIR Phase II/TECP/IIB Project Outcomes Report for General Public\n\n \n\n The overarching goal of this Phase II project is to apply our innovative electrochemical actuation technology, ePump&reg;, to develop and commercialize a product line of miniature pumping systems for controlled delivery of fluids in the ultra-low flow rate regime.    The project resulted in the development of two stand-alone pumping systems:  the  ePump Solvent Delivery System&trade;, and the vivoPump Animal Dosing System&trade;. ePump is an electrochemical actuation technology that SFC Fluidics uses to make microfluidic pumps.  The non-mechanical nature of the pumps allows them to be made in virtually any shape of size, use very little power, and provide truly pulse-free flow.

NSF funding in the form of a TECP extension to the Phase II grant allowed remote operation functionality to be added to the Model 190.  Several of these have been sold to various research institutions and tested by medical device manufacturers.  World Precision Instruments, Inc. (WPI) is in negotiations to carry the Model 190 as one of their pumps for use in the research market.  The Model 190 is currently listed on their website (www.wpiinc.com, product # SF-PF190), and it has been displayed it at several trade shows.

Additionally, WPI works with several animal research labs and will facilitate the initiation of the beta testing of the Model 220 wireless pumping system. \n\n            The biggest confirmation of the ePumps\u00c6 imminent success has been the development of a partnership between SFC Fluidics and a major medical device company to develop a pump for a specific high-value target application.  The work done in this Phase II, especially Phase IIB, has led to a development agreement between SFC Fluidics and this company.  Many of the Objectives of the Phase IIB were geared toward pump functionality required by the company.  Thankfully, the Phase IIB funding allowed SFC to advance the pump technology to the point that we have been commissioned by this company to develop an ePump system specific to their needs.  The advantage of ePump is that it can meet target flow specifications in an embodiment that is small, can be battery operated, is inexpensive enough to be disposable and is accurate and reliable.  SFC is currently working closely with the scientists, engineers and business development team of the medical device company to develop the pumps, valves, and control system that they need. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Forrest Payne"
