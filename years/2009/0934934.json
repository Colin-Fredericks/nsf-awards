 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\r\n\r\nThe MOEBIUS project is addressing the serious shortage of highly qualified secondary mathematics teachers by recruiting, preparing, placing and helping to retain mathematics teachers in the greater Los Angeles area. The MOEBIUS project is combining an innovative curriculum with an effective support network to increase success of students interested in teaching careers resulting in an additional 40 STEM teachers.  MOEBIUS is coupling the Three R's framework (Rigor, Relevance and Retention) developed for this project with the newly established Blended Mathematics Teacher Preparation Program at California State University, Los Angeles to improve the preparation and retention of students. The Blended program is preparing students in a considerably shorter time by combining requirements for the undergraduate degree in mathematics and those of the California Single Subject teaching credential. The Three R's framework is providing students with much needed support for future success via three professional development modules. Upon completion of the program, Noyce scholars are being placed in schools of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest school district in California.  MOEBIUS is demonstrating the effectiveness of these novel approaches toward teacher preparation and retention, and is providing a national model for best practices in mathematics teacher training. In addition, MOEBIUS is increasing the diversity of this highly qualified teacher workforce by effectively engaging, recruiting, training and placing students from this minority-serving institution.",
