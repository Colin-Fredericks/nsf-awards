 "awd_abstract_narration": "0824930\r\nBest\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis proposal seeks funding to acquire a high-resolution, dual-frequency, multibeam echo-sounding (MBES) system for fluid and morpho-dynamics of aquatic systems impacted by sedimentary processes. Proposed is a Seabat 7125 system from Reson Inc. This unit operates at 200/400 kHz and has a 128\u00b0 sector allowing 0.5\u00b0X2.0\u00b0 and 0.25\u00b0X1.0\u00b0 beam widths. The system will be deployed on a new 22-foot aluminum workboat with twin engines, generator and power supply conditions appropriate for supporting the MBES. The boat/MBES system will be housed a t the USGS Water Science Center allowing rapid response deployment. 3D data will be used to derive bottom topography, bedform characteristics and grain size distributions. Temporal variation in these properties will be assessed. Backscatter will be analyzed to better understand water column conditions and track gas bubbles, fish, and other organisms. Additionally, suspended sediment and fluid velocity will be assessed acoustically. Several studies which will gain substantially from the new acquisition are 1) spire tower formation by thermophilic bacteria in Yellowstone Lake, 2) ubran channel flow in Chicago, 3) river channel confluence and bifurcation dynamics, 4) sand transport in lakes and rivers, 5) mine tailing dispersal and sedimentation in lakes, and 6) the temporal and spatial behavior of shear layers in natural rivers. Studies will be completed through a combination of field study and numerical simulation. The MBES system is perfectly suited to capturing high-resolution, temporal and spatial data needed for multiple studies. \r\n\tThe management plan has UIUC and USGS forming a committee to oversee purchase, Installation and MBES usage. The PIs will serve on the committee. The committee will arrange yearly user-group workshop(s). The MBES system will be utilized for stated projects, but will have broad applicability to applied and societally-relevant environmental concerns. The MBES will serve as the foundation for a facility accessible to undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. The MBES will allow direct interfacing with the USGS and incorporation in mission-oriented projects.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
