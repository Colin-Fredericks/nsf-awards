 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed work is to demonstrate devices that utilize intersubband transitions in arrays of quantum boxes (QBs), to achieve room-temperature, continuous-wave (CW) oscillation in the mid-infrared (IR) wavelength range, with low heat-dissipation powers. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe novel approaches proposed are: 1) the use of block-copolymer lithography for the realization of arrays of 20-25 nm-diameter QBs; 2) the use of deep quantum wells for the QB active material for strong carrier confinement; 3) the use of selective regrowth of high-bandgap barriers to confine carriers in the plane of the QBs..\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe realization of uncooled, CW mid-IR sources will make possible hand-held, real-time sensors for a wide range of noninvasive medical diagnostics and enable exciting developments such as practical sensing of chemical agents and explosives. A central goal and natural outcome of this project is the research-based education of both undergraduate and graduate students. The students will be involved in all aspects of the research within an established collaborative team-based environment. The proposed program provides opportunities for outreach to underrepresented groups through our ongoing partnering with the existing college and NSF Center-based programs at the University of Wisconsin. \r\nThe realization of the proposed QB lasers will have a transformational impact on both the science and technology of mid-IR lasers because reducing the heat dissipation by two orders of magnitude will lead to uncooled devices, which in turn will revolutionize the mid-IR sensors industry since hand-held sensors would become available for a vast array of applications.\r\n\r\n",
