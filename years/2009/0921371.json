Although this species is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, a form of reproductive diapause (analogous to hibernation) has evolved. This trait is an essential fitness component, varies in natural populations, and is regulated by the gene couch potato. The specific aims are: 1) to elucidate how couch potato governs diapause and associated traits such as aging and stress tolerance; 2) to identify additional genes and pathways that are involved in adaptive evolutionary responses to climatic variation; 3) to examine the evolutionary history of the couch potato gene region and evaluate its role in the expansion out of ancestral tropical habitats. \r\n\r\nDiapause in D. melanogaster is an excellent system for investigating how organisms adapt to variable climates. Diapause has wide-ranging effects on other traits including lifespan and aging, and this research will contribute to the understanding of the genetic control of lifespan and senescence. Many agricultural pests also diapause, and results from this project are directly applicable to understanding the genetics of diapause and population control in these taxa. In addition, these investigations have bearing on understanding evolution in novel environments, evolutionary response to climate change, and genetic tradeoffs in other organisms. Broader impacts also include education and training at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels. The investigators will continue to work with the G. W. Carver High School in Philadelphia to develop their science curriculum, and develop outreach activities with elementary and secondary schools throughout the Philadelphia School System. Finally, the project will contribute to an exhibit on the genetic response to climate change for 'Our Changing Earth' at the Franklin Science Institute.",
