 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hooked on Photonics (HoP) is an REU program offered in collaboration with the NSF-funded Science and Technology Center on Materials and Devices for Information Technology Research (MDITR). MDITR is focused on the development of photonic materials and devices for applications ranging from telecommunications to solar-energy harvesting. The Center is based on the broad technical mission to understand the basic molecular and structural nature of non-traditional (i.e., organic) materials; synthesize and process molecular systems that have novel properties; and design and fabricate useful low-cost devices with superior properties to existing technologies. In HoP, students participate directly in the ongoing research in MDITR. A unique aspect of HoP is that participants are located on the three main campuses of MDITR: University of Washington, Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Arizona. In addition to participating in cutting-edge research programs, HoP students also benefit from the variety of multi-campus educational programs offered by MDITR. This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
