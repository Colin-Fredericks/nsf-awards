 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Hawaii proposes to support technical services on R/V Kilo Moana (KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The proposal requests support for basic services and specialized services.  For basic services, they will provide two shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V Kilo Moana to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The Institution also supports some operations on the Research Vessel Ka`imikai O Kanaloa (KOK), which is not a UNOLS\r\nvessel, but does support some federally sponsored research, including some for NSF. As part of basic services, they will maintain and operate a multibeam sonar system (both 12 kHz and 95 kHz instruments are available) on the KM.  As specialized services, they offer two towed seafloor mapping systems (HAWAII MR1 and IMI-30) for shallow- or deep-towed imaging and bathymetry, and they provide services to evaluate the quality of data from acoustic current profilers installed on UNOLS vessels.  The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.\r\n",
