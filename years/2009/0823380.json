 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Andrews Forest is located in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon, one of six original Long-Term Ecological Research projects that began in 1980. It was built on a long research history by the Forest Service and has a record of ground-breaking science and application to forest management and conservation. The terrain is mountainous and with strong environmental gradients. The forest features tall, old-growth conifer stands and high plant biomass, as well as younger, second-growth stands as the products of watershed level experiments. Although no ecosystem response to climate change has yet been detected, it is predicted to occur and regional signals are beginning to emerge. Downscaling climate change predictions from global models to predict impacts at this level is complicated by the complex terrain and forest structure. Computer models have been developed to help predict how terrain and forest structure mediate regional climate signals at local scales. Climate change may have direct affects on high elevation ecosystems, but effects lower down may be mediated indirectly by changes in the dynamics of organisms, insect outbreaks, fire, and consequent effects on nutrient availability. A cyber-forest will be developed to provide new data on air-shed dynamics to parallel the historic focus on water-shed dynamics. \r\n\r\nWestern Cascade forests are highly valued for ecosystem services, including timber, water, recreation, biodiversity and aesthetics. Because of their value to society, there has been a long and intense debate about the management of the resources as represented by this site. As a result, the investigators have developed strong relationships with local interest groups, NGOs and resource management agencies. These partnerships have led to significant technology transfer and outreach. A K-12 schoolyard program has numerous educational partners, while the new cyber-forest will contribute to new education and outreach efforts.\r\n",
