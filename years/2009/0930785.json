The U.S. team, led by William Regli and Rachel Greenstadt, brings expertise in artificial intelligence, wireless networks, privacy and security to a three-year collaborative program with Czechs partners who have complementing strengths in multi-agent systems and meta-reasoning.  In Prague, the IRES program will be headed by Michael Pechoucek, in the CTU Department of Cybernetics. These U.S. and Czech mentors share the goal of contributing to the field of agent communications while providing the graduate and undergraduate students they mentor with early career research experience in design of systems that are tolerant of severe disruptions and interference. \r\n\r\nDuring the course of the collaborative IRES, the US-Czech team will integrate three areas of their current research in emerging communication and collaborative intelligent systems to provide broad and promising new topics for student projects. The focus areas include: 1) agent communication in constrained environments, 2) metrics on multi-agent systems, and 3) design patterns for multi-agent systems. Overall, the combined efforts of researchers and students are expected to contribute to improvements in network centric intelligent systems.  \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary IRES in engineering and computer science fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge and engaging students by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  Broader impacts include early career introduction of U.S. junior researchers, including women and minority students, to experts in the international research community who are involved in the design of agent based systems as well as innovative modeling.  The results of this well balanced U.S.-Czech IRES program are expected to enhance performance in mobile agent-based computing.",
