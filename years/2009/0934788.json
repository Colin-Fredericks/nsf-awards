 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\r\n(Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nSeven science and five mathematics majors are being awarded scholarships during each of the first three years of the project leading to the production of thirty-six middle and high school STEM teachers.  Both one and two-year scholarships are available.  Most mathematics majors are expected be in their last two years as an undergraduate and would receive two-year scholarships.  The science majors may have already completed an undergraduate degree and receive a one-year scholarship to complete a MAT program or be in last two years of a five-year double major undergraduate program and receive a two-year scholarship.  The double major consists of a science discipline major and a science education major.  It is anticipated that most of the science scholars are enrolling in the five-year undergraduate dual major option.\r\n\r\nThe university has a partnership with the North Carolina Community College system and is recruiting extensively throughout system for students interested in a pre-college teaching career.  Another partner is the Latham Clinical Network, a thirty-five member network of school districts.  Thirty-four of the school districts are classified as high needs districts.  The Noyce scholars are completing their service requirements in one of these largely rural high needs districts. The Scholars receive support as new teachers through an induction program that includes  a virtual learning community as well as face-to-face mentoring.",
