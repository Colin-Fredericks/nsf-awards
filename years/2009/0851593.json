 "awd_abstract_narration": "This University of Nebraska-Lincoln's REU Site will provide a research experience for undergraduates during the summers of 2009 thru 2011. This REU Site is supported by the NSF REU Program and by the Department of Defense through the Awards to Stimulate and Support Undergraduate Research Experiences (ASSURE) program. The REU Site program focuses on bioenergy research using microbes or plants. Ten students will receive hands-on research experience in one of twelve laboratories under the guidance of an experienced faculty mentor. Students will receive a $4,500 stipend for 10 weeks (June through mid-August). On-campus housing, travel to and from the lab, health insurance, and other minor costs are provided at no cost to participants. Research will be coordinated with seminars, lunches, career guidance, industrial exposure, group activities, and a research symposium. Students will get training in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and the physiology of selected model systems. They will engage in a debate on how to achieve sustainable energy supply for meeting a key national challenge. Upon completion of the REU program, students will be better prepared for future opportunities as researchers in bioenergy, including graduate education. The program is open to all undergraduate students enrolled in biology, chemistry, or engineering. Underrepresented minorities and students from colleges with limited research opportunities are encouraged to apply. Lincoln is a safe, midsize city with diverse and inexpensive entertainment, extensive bike paths and over 100 parks.  More information is available at http://www.unl.edu/summerprogram/program_bioenergy.shtml, or by contacting Laurie Einspahr (leinspahr2@unlnotes.unl.edu; Tel 402-472-1106), or the Program Director, Dr. Paul Blum (pblum1@unl.edu; Tel 402-472-2769).",

Active learning arising from research experiences strongly impact career decisions. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) offered undergraduate students an interdisciplinary summer REU experience that promoted interest in bioenergy systems. Top-ranked faculty sponsors taught science through hands-on research and facilitated cohort experiences. The project trained participants in the emerging area of bioenergy systems and stimulated their interest in STEM careers and education.\nAward 0851593 REU Site: Integrated Development of Bioenergy Systems provided support over a three year period to enable students to come to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for a 10 week summer research experience related to bioenergy sciences. During this period a total of 31 student were admitted and completed the REU program.

The microbiology and plant biology of bioenergy systems is an emerging topic of national relevance and a central component of crosscutting initiatives in Microbiology (MBI) and Plant Sciences (PSI) at UNL. It is imperative that society develop sustainable energy supplies and recognize that microbes and plants are essential for this goal. Microbial studies focused on biotransformations of energy sources, regulatory networks, and resource competition while plant studies focused on RNAi, organellar, and lipid biology. This REU Site stimulated participant interest in these aspects of bioenergy. Participants underwent training in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and the physiology of selected model systems. Research occured within 12 participating laboratories all belonging to the MBI/PSI efforts and housed in several departments. These environments provided novel interdisciplinary atmospheres with important benefits. The summer program included training in professionalism and provided individual career mentoring and cohort activities.\nBroader Impacts. This project extended a successful (internal) summer research program for undergraduates with a record of accomplishment for attracting women and minorities, to a larger student body thereby increasing the overall scope and effect of the program. Research and education of undergraduates (REU) created an interdisciplinary atmosphere to address nationally recognized workforce needs. Participant students were encouraged to pursue careers in STEM in conjunction with career guidance and industrial exposure. The program\u00c6s successes were disseminated through established networks and institutional programs.\n  Normal 0     false false false  EN-US X-NONE X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                     \n\n /* Style Definitions */\n table.MsoNormalTable\n\t{mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\";\n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;\n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0;\n\tmso-style-noshow:yes;\n\tmso-style-priority:99;\n\tmso-style-parent:\"\";\n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\n\tmso-para-margin-top:0in;\n\tmso-para-margin-right:0in;\n\tmso-para-marg..."
