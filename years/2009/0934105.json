This is the fifth OSA sponsored IPNRA Topical Meeting.  Integrated photonics and nanophotonics are the topics of the meeting.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nOSA has organized the meeting to be in the form of contributed papers, presentations by invited speakers, and publications.  OSA has invited speakers from the worldwide scientific community (Europe, Japan, and USA) to present major new developments.  The selection of accepted papers meets rigorous standards.  The meeting will feature innovative science and engineering results and explore areas of applications.   A conference program and technical digest will be published with research details.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe meeting promotes student education by creating an opportunity for networking, one-to-one research discussions, and exposure to recent major developments.  Student participation at the IPNRA Topical Meeting will help to maintain and foster a pool of trained engineers and scientists in integrated photonics and nanophotonics.",
