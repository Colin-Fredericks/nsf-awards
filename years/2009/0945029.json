 "awd_abstract_narration": "Indonesian Seas provide the best opportunity to recover high-resolution climate archives from the western equatorial Pacific. The planning visit grant will allow the PI and two students to travel to Indonesia in order to initiate new research collaboration between USA and Indonesia to study the paleoceanography and paleoclimatology of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. This proposed study builds upon previous collaboration that has yielded important insights about possible controls of climate variability in this region. During the visit we will meet with scientists and government officials in order to develop this new collaboration and to examine their research ships and equipment. The students will have an opportunity to actively experience the discussion of establishing a joint international study, will meet with potential collaborators and will present their own work in the USA. This will be a unique opportunity for them to learn what it takes to do science in remote unconventional places.\r\n\r\n",
