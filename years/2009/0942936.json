 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSince the early 1990s, some useful optimization algorithms have emerged from the social and biological sciences in their studies of animal flock behavior and swarm intelligence. It has been observed, for example, that while individual agents in an animal colony are not capable of complex behavior, the combined coordination among multiple agents leads to the manifestation of regular patterns of behavior. Several algorithms have been developed to model the movement of animal flocks. These investigations are proving useful in modeling and understanding complex phenomena and in developing applications in areas ranging from biology to nanotechnology. The research involves investigating interconnections between these studies on swarm intelligence in the biological and social sciences, and more recent studies on adaptive networks in system theory. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdaptive networks consist of isotropic nodes spread over a geographic domain. The nodes sense the environment and attempt to understand a phenomenon of interest based on their noisy observations and without any node taking a central control role. The nodes cooperate with each other through local interactions and adapt their states, and the network topology, in response to data collected at the nodes and data received from their neighbors. Information arriving at a node propagates throughout the network by means of a diffusive process. The diffusion of information results in a form of collective intelligence as is evidenced by improved learning and convergence behavior relative to non-cooperative networks. A closer study of the dynamics of swarm behavior and adaptive networks can suggest alternative techniques for designing adaptive networks and for understanding flock behavior, with potential impact on the applications that can be motivated from these developments.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
