Escalating energy and reliability problems with nanometer technology scaling are making over-provisioning and static allocation of resources less viable for meeting increasing performance demands.  This exploratory research investigates new and innovative on-chip network designs and network-driven shared resource management techniques that have the broader impact of laying important groundwork for realizing adaptive, fault-resilient, low-cost, energy- and performance-efficient multicore parallel computing systems with hundreds to thousnads of nodes.",
