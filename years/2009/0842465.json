 "awd_abstract_narration": "The global climate is undergoing changes in temperature and precipitation that are altering the abundance and distribution of species around the world. Species that are important from conservation, ecological, cultural, and economic perspectives may face decline and extinction in coming decades. Phenology, the timing of biological events, has emerged as a key indicator of species response to global warming and other aspects of climate change.  Phenology includes the flowering and leafing out dates of plants, first arrival dates of birds, and other events throughout the year. The ability of scientists to predict how climate change will affect species and biological communities remains very limited, especially at the scale of countries and continents. Researchers in this project will study the year-round phenological trends since 1953 of numerous plant and animal species using data from 176 meteorological sites across Japan and South Korea. These records cover more species, a longer time period, and more sites than any comparable data set from the United States, and can be used to develop innovative methods of analysis that can be applied to species in the United States and elsewhere. At field sites in Japan, the researchers will examine ecological interactions, e.g., between plants and pollinators, to determine the potential for ecological mismatches among species with different responses to climate change. The U.S. researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students and will work with scientists from Japan, South Korea, China, and Europe, and the new U.S. National Phenological Network, thereby strengthening international connections among climate change researchers.",
