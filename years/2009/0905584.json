 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rewriting model of computation is simple, yet general and flexible. A system of any kind, for example, an algorithm, a database, a hardware\r\nsystem, a programming language, a network protocol, a sensor network, or\r\nthe molecular biology dynamics of a cell, can be modeled by a set of\r\nrewrite rules that\r\ndescribe the systems behavior. The rewriting model of computation is\r\nintrinsically concurrent, without any need for explicit concurrency constructs.\r\n\r\nAny set of rules that apply to nonoverlapping system components can execute concurrently. For a large distributed system such as a network\r\nor a cell, this means that at any given time thousands or millions of\r\nconcurrent transitions may be happening in parallel.\r\n\r\nMaude is a language based on rewriting logic. The current Maude implementation provides a high performance rewrite engine, as well\r\nas builtin search, unification, and model checking tools to support\r\nexecution and analysis of systems specified in Maude. To realize\r\ninherent concurrency of rewriting, the proposed project will develop an\r\nimplementation of Maude called Distributed and\r\n\r\nConcurrent Maude (DCMaude) that will exploit the concurrency available in multicore/multiprocessor machines, and support distributed computing\r\nand systems programming. The rewriting semantics of Maude supports\r\nseamless transition between concurrent and distributed execution of a\r\nsystem: execution in one process, multiple processes/cores, or multiple\r\nmachines. In addition to built in strategies for concurrency, the design\r\nof DCMaude will include a means for the programmer to control\r\nconcurrency at a high level of abstraction in a declarative way.\r\n\r\nDC Maude will provide new methods and tools that can significantly improve both the design and the implementation of open distributed\r\nsystems, including web-based systems and next-generation networks.\r\nFurthermore, by being directly based on rewriting logic, DCMaude\r\nwill close the gap between formal specifications and actual\r\nimplementations, making it possible to gain substantially higher\r\nassurance about the formal requirements, including the security\r\nproperties, of such systems.\r\n\r\nThe project will be carried our jointly by Drs. Jose Meseguer (UIUC)\r\nand Dr. Carolyn Talcott (SRI International).  Both UIUC and SRI will\r\ntake joint responsibility for the DCMaude design.  The DC Maude\r\nimplementation will be the primary responsibility of SRI International,\r\nwhile the testing, benchmarking and development of DCMaude applications\r\nwill be the primary responsibility of UIUC.\r\n\r\n",
