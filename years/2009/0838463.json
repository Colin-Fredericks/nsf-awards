 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nUniversity of Nebraska - Lincoln\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska Mentoring through Critical Transition Points (MCTP) project, hosted by the University of Nebraska ? Lincoln Department of Mathematics, targets three critical transition periods in preparation of mathematicians:\r\n?\tThe transition from freshman level mathematics classes to undergraduate research,\r\n?\tThe transition from undergraduate to graduate level mathematics, and\r\n?\tThe transition from advanced graduate work to the early years of an academic position.\r\nThis proposal strives to identify key transition points and to exploit previous successes in providing mentoring at these key points. The results of these efforts have been widely advertised and disseminated in the past, and the plan for future dissemination is sound. In particular, several of these programs seem like they could be adapted at other institutions; the idea of forging partnerships between four-year colleges and research universities is an obvious one, but one that has not been sufficiently explored elsewhere. The programs outlined in this proposal offer clear guidance to institutions considering such partnerships. Combine this role as a resource with the inclusion of pre-grads from institutions other than UNL, the nationwide recruitment in UNL?s Intensive Mathematics: A Mentoring, Education, and Research Experience, and the broad participation of undergraduate women in the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics, and the breadth of the impact of this proposal is clear.\r\n\r\nThis project is being co-funded by DMS and EPSCoR.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
