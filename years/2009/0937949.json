 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging high-end computing platforms, such as leadership-class machines  at the petascale, provide new horizons for complex modeling and  large-scale simulations.  These machines are used to execute data intensive applications of national interest such as climate modeling, cosmic microwave background radiation, and astrophysical thermonuclear flashes. While these systems have unprecedented levels of peak computational power and storage capacity, a critical challenge concerns the design and implementation of scalable I/O (input-output) system software (also called I/O stack) that makes it possible to harness the power of these systems for scientific discovery and engineering design. Unfortunately, currently, there are no available mechanisms that accommodate I/O stack-wide, application-level QoS (quality-of-service)specification, monitoring, and management.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates a revolutionary approach to the QoS-aware  management of the I/O stack using feedback control theory, machine  learning, and optimization. The goal is to maximize I/O performance and  thus improve overall performance of large scale applications of national  interest. The project uses (1) machine learning and optimization to  determine the best decomposition of application-level QoS to sub-QoSs targeting individual resources, and (2) feedback control theory to  allocate shared resources managed by the I/O stack such that the  specified QoSs are satisfied throughout the execution. The project tests  the developed I/O stack enhancements using the workloads at NCAR, LBNL  and ANL systems. It also involves two efforts in broadening  participation: CISE Visit in Engineering Weekends (VIEW) and  NASA-Aerospace Education Services Project (NASA-AESP) at the Center for  Science and the Schools (CSATS).\r\n",
