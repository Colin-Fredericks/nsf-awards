 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will put into service a prototype/pilot facility to assess the technical and commercial feasibility of unambiguously sorting small chips of super-alloys at high speeds. Spectramet Technology is a platform optoelectronic manufacturing technology for analyzing metals and alloys at previously unachievable accuracy and high speeds into known alloys to meet smelter specifications. The technology platform is not only aimed at sorting alloys into base metal groups, but can also sort the alloys by alloy type. One part of the Spectramet Technology focuses on sorting valuable super-alloys such as nickel-, cobalt-, and titanium based metals. This proposal is aims at extending the existing technology with an entirely new innovative sensor approach to process particles one-thousandth the size of prior applications and to identifying and sorting those particles at speeds thousands of times faster than has ever been done before. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will be reducing the amount of strategic super-alloy metal that is downgraded to inferior product uses and applications in the U.S. so that this very valuable scrap metal can be recycled into its highest value application, so it can be used again as super-alloy feedstock for making new super-alloy parts. The result of recycling this material rather than downgrading it to lower value applications will be reduced U.S. dependence on supplies of strategic virgin metals recovered at primary refineries from ore (most of which are purchased abroad), substantial energy savings from use of scrap rather than ore and virgin materials, and greatly reduced emissions because secondary smelting consumes much less energy than primary production.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nWherever one might look at technologies focused on the recycling of end-of-life materials, one will find any number of methods meant to affect to sortation or segregation of mixed materials.  An example is the sortation of consumer waste collected in the ubiqutous curb-side containers.  Upon collection, those materials are brought to a facility wherein numerous systems separate the materials based on density, color, or intrinsic material type, to name a few.  Many of these technologies are \"sensor-based\"; that is, an (often) high-speed measurement device is gathering data on the materials passing at any given moment, and affecting some sort of physical separation.  This Phase II SBIR program was focused on the development of a sensor-based sorting technology to be used for the separation of aerospace \"turnings\" generated during the manufacturing processes associated with the production of air frame components, jet engine parts, medical implants, and similar metallic components.  During the manufacturing process, less than 20% of the original mass of manufactured part actually enters service; 80% of the mass is removed in machining, grinding, and other cutting operations.  These materials are often suffer from cross-contamination, whether unintentional or incidental.  That the materials is generated during machining, grinding, or cutting, the resulting particles are very small in size.  \n\nThe innovation created under this SBIR award is a multi-channel, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) line-scan camera targeted at the identification and extraction of incompatible alloy contaminants in nickel- and titantium-base machining turnings or \"chips\".  Heretofore, the \"state-of-the-art\" was either reduction of contamination via blending with large amounts of otherwise \"clean\" materials, or highly-specific contamination detection useful for only very dense contaminants (e.g., tungsten carbide tool bits in titanium turnings).  The product developed with SBIR funding is a highly-configurable and versatile sensor based on the principles of XRF that is capable of detecting alloy contamaninants as small as 1mm x 1mm comprised of elements on the periodic table ranging from Ti (Z=22) through Pb (Z=82).  This is accomplished at high speeds on a conveyor belt moving at speeds up to 2 m/s depending on the specifications of the application. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe XRF line-scan camera developed with SBIR funding is scalable and highly configurable.  It is possible to deploy the technology on the sortation of a wide variety of materials beyond the narrow scope of aerospace machining \"chips\".  The technology can be used whereever the detection of minute amounts of elementally-unique contamination is present on the surface of a material.  Indeed, upon the conclusion of SBIR-funded research, more than a half-dozen unique applications are being investigated to improve the recyclability of materials contaminated by small inclusions or foreign elements.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey J Webster"
