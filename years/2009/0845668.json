 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nMembrane proteins are the gatekeepers of the cell and selectively mediate the flow of information and nutrients across the membrane (walls) of the cell. Membrane proteins are abundant (~25% of a typical genome). However, investigations of membrane proteins are considered \"high-risk\", predominantly because preparing protein samples is difficult due to their hydrophobic nature. Typically for structural and functional investigations, membrane proteins are extracted from the native cell membrane with detergent micelles. Detergents are empirically screened to solubilize and stabilize the membrane proteins because of a lack in the understanding of how detergents mimic the cell membrane and stabilize a membrane protein fold. The screening process is expensive and time-consuming, and limits the progress of membrane protein investigations. This research aims to overcome these hindrances by (1) establishing a fundamental understanding of protein-detergent interactions and (2) assessing the impact these interactions have on membrane protein structure and stability. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nEfforts to impact the broader community are focused primarily on the encouragement and confidence building of middle school and college age female and underrepresented groups in the area of chemistry. At the undergraduate level, a new biochemistry curriculum was introduced that stepped away from textbook learning and moved towards inquiry and research based learning. Also, one-on-one and group mentorship programs such as a lunch series have been implemented.  For middle school girls, two avenues have been pursued (1) interactive one hour programs were created that introduce chemistry to middle school girls through outreach programs such as the University of Virginia Young Woman Leadership Program and (2) three hour interactive demos and tours of chemistry laboratories at the University of Virginia hosted by female faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows were designed for local schools such as The Village School (an all girls middle school).",
