 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how diversity of life on earth grows is a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. To address this essential question, this research will: (1) build an evolutionary tree (phylogeny) for muroid rodents (the most diverse and successful group of mammals) using DNA sequence data from 550 muroid species, (2) conduct anatomical studies of the skulls of those species using 3D imaging tools, and (3) combine the anatomical results with the phylogenetic results to determine when and where different lineages diversify, in terms of numbers of species and modifications of the skull and dentition. The results will determine which mechanisms - adaptation, colonization of new areas, or changes in inherent \"evolvability\" - cause diversity to increase.\r\n\r\nThis research will also have broad utility to the biomedical sciences because the muroid rodents include most of the species used in biomedical research (e.g., mouse, rat, hamster). Understanding their evolutionary history can profoundly change how we interpret those studies. The phylogeny will also serve as a road map for choosing new species for biomedical studies. In addition, the research team will train several post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students in DNA sequencing, morphological analysis, and phylogenetics.",

Some changes to the classification of muroid rodents were made. We discovered that muroid rodents colonized continents at least 28 times. Contrary to conventional expectations that such colonizations often lead to adaptive radiations, only one (the first colonization of South America) actually showed such evidence, where there is an initial burst of speciation and morphological divergence, followed by a slow-down in both those rates as the newly available ecological niches became filled up. Focusing on South America, we also found that after muroid rodents first colonized approximately 7-9 million years ago, that they then dispersed rapidly into and among different regions, and that as the group radiated into 300 species over time, the rate of dispersal between regions slowed down, resulting in many localized radiations.
