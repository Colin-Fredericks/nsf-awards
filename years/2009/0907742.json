 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed Forum is sixth in a series of meetings begun in 2003 under a US-Korea bilateral agreement on science and technology.  This forum will focus on fundamentals in nano-electronics, its fusion with bio- and energy- technology as well as novel applications.  \r\n\r\nThe PI will be the organizer for the U.S. participation, which will include eleven presenters and six additional early-career participants (underrepresented minorities will be strongly encouraged). A roughly equal number of Korean presenters will also be selected. The Forum will provide a common platform for scientists and engineers from both countries to establish partnerships in nano-electronics development and to further strengthen the achievements and to assess the progress on recommendations made during the previous five Forums, specifically, the mechanisms for cooperation and plans for exchanging young scientists. The Forum proceedings and findings will be published both on a CD and on Carnegie Mellon?s website and will be available to a broad audience.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\nThis proposed Forum will promote the exchange of research, education, and policy between the two countries in the emerging area of nano-electronics. The novel contribution, in contrast to previous Forums, is the focus on grand challenges of fundamentals in nano/molecular electronics as well as feasibility studies on high risk application in nanodevices.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis Forum will result in the sharing of information and experiences in nano-electronics research and will promote many collaborative research initiatives between industry, government, and academia in the two countries. The aim of this Forum is to promote not only research on fundamental and applied nano-electronics, but also to have a high impact on society and global education.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by ECCS and ENG.",
