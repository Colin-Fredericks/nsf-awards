 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Workforce Training for STEM Cell Research endeavor is a Stanford University effort to develop a suite of instructive and lab-based materials focusing on stem cell biology and research for use in undergraduate courses in community colleges and four-year schools. This work is responsive to the identified need for:  1) an undergraduate curriculum that integrates science, laboratory training, and the humanities; 2) innovations in pedagogy not commonly seen in traditional approaches to teaching biology; 3) independent and flexible modules to accommodate \"just-in-time\" changes to a frontier area of biology; and 4) a scalable approach to address the nation's dearth of a technically-trained post-baccalaureate workforce for stem cell research.   This project draws from prior successes in creating multidisciplinary, team-taught courses in the most active stem cell research centers in the world.  In addition, community college faculty serve as collaborators in this work, drawing upon their biotechnology expertise and ensuring the materials meet the needs of their students.\r\n\r\nA well-trained workforce in stem cell research has the potential to fuel discovery and the eventual translation of technologies for human use.   This stem cell curriculum--purpose-built for the workforce--is being designed to accomplish this end. This integrated series of instructional modules spans scientific, technical, and social dimensions of stem cell research. Importantly, the materials to be developed include laboratory-based training.  The curriculum will provide educators with clearly written, rapidly revised core material and instructional modules.  For each module, what students need to know for careers involving stem cell research is first determined, then development of a curriculum and pedagogy that can deliver appropriate knowledge and technical competency occurs. The products of this project include a suite of classroom and laboratory-based teaching and learning resources and evaluative materials that can stand-alone or be joined to create new courses.  The curriculum has the potential for broad and immediate impact on teachers and students working to launch technical careers in stem cell research. These materials are also of benefit to undergraduate biology curricula and certificate programs with technical foci, as the modular approach allows four-year schools to pick topics and materials that best suit their teaching needs.  Materials will be distributed through the web and well-known national and international media channels. In addition, the modular approach can be adapted for distance learning and subject-based seminars. \r\n\r\nThe demand for life science STEM professionals, some of whom will supervise dozens of technicians, is increasing.   In sum, this project is designed to address a major educational gap in the biotechnology, commercialization and development chain.",
