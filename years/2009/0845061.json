 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of the proposed research is to\r\nprovide simplified dynamics and design efficient numerical methods for\r\ncomplex intracellular stochastic chemical reacting networks. Numerical\r\nschemes will be developed to simulate systems exhibiting multiple time\r\nand concentration scales, and to solve transition paths and transition\r\nrates for systems with metastability. Error analysis of the schemes as\r\nwell as sharper estimates on the transition rates will be\r\nprovided. Applications will be focused on developing and analyzing a\r\nquantitative model for the Insulin response network, through\r\ncollaboration with biologists at Michigan State University (MSU). The\r\neducation plan includes training of graduate students that will lead\r\nto Ph.D. theses, developing a graduate level course for students in\r\napplied and computational mathematics, introducing the related topics\r\nto undergraduate curriculum, and organizing a workshop on the same topic.\r\nThe proposed research will be crucial to the understanding of\r\nfunctional issues of intracellular reacting networks at the system\r\nlevel, which is becoming the new focus of genomic research. \r\nNumerical studies of the multi-scale systems will lead to new insights into the simulation\r\nschemes for stochastic systems. The development of accurate and\r\nefficient numerical methods for multi-scale chemical reaction systems\r\ninvolves novel analytical approaches from stochastic analysis. The study\r\nof the fluctuation driven transitions in metastable chemical reaction\r\nsystems will find new applications for advanced probability theory and\r\noptimization techniques. The multi-scale and stochastic methods\r\ndeveloped by the proposed research will find a wide range of\r\napplications in biological sciences and nano-technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI is going to build mathematical models and design efficient\r\ncomputer based simulation algorithms for chemical reactions inside\r\nliving cells, which ususally involve many types of reacting channels\r\nand reacting species, as well as random fluctuations. The proposed\r\nresearch is to simplify and reduce complex models, which will lead to\r\ninsightful conceptualization of the system. The research will be\r\nconducted in collaboration with biologists and the theoretical results\r\nwith be calibrated with real data generated by experiments in\r\nlabs. The targeted application, namely the modeling of Insulin\r\nresponse network, has a significant potential for the promotion of\r\npublic health. Type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are top\r\ncauses of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In the case of\r\ninsulin resistance, tissues such as muscle, fat and liver become less\r\nresponsive or resistant to insulin. The disorder is also linked to\r\nother common health problems, such as obesity, hyperlipidaemia,\r\nhypertension etc. The models and algorithms developed by the PI will\r\nhelp to dandify the major reactions and reactants that are maintaining\r\nthe normal range of plasma glaucous in individuals throughout periods\r\nof feeding and fasting. The research output will help to understand\r\nthe mechanism of the Insulin disorders and the cause of type2 diabetes.",
