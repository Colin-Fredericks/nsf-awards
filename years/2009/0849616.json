 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funded by NSF's Science, Technology, and Society Program is a study of physics-based entrepreneurship, meaning the development of research-based startup companies by groups including PhD physicists. The proposed study builds on previous work by the PI, the successful History of Physicists in Industry project, which was completed in 2007 with support from NSF. In the earlier study identification was made of the increased use of corporate laboratories to assess technologies brought to the market by small startups, rather than to develop new technologies internally. The role of large corporations is now relatively well understood; this study seeks to further develop an understanding of entrepreneurial physics-based startups. It represents an effort to explore and develop documentation strategies that allow companies to identify and preserve historically valuable records and make them accessible to researchers in the future.\r\n\r\nPhysics entrepreneurship includes not just an organization founded by a PhD physicist, but also knowledge or intellectual property about the physical world and skills in working with manipulating the physical world that creates commercial value in the marketplace. The project seeks to uncover historical trends as well as current developments by interviewing physicists who founded or shared in the founding of some thirty-plus startups and other staff involved in the founding and/or research of these companies. Our interviews will include five startups prior to the 1990s that have since become established companies, five startups that failed during the dot-com boom, five startups subsequently acquired by larger corporations, and about fifteen currently developing startups founded since about 1990.\r\n \r\nSome physicists have brought their understanding of the physical nature of the world to the creation and manufacture of new technologies. Others have focused on the creation and evaluation of intellectual property and its application across a broad spectrum of businesses, serving as consultants and licensors of intellectual property. And some physicist entrepreneurs develop high tech companies where the company itself is the product to be acquired by larger companies needing its intellectual property and skill sets. Interviews with PhD physicists who have founded or partnered in the founding of small hi-tech startups, as well as other research will facilitate understanding the changing dynamics of these operations from the perspective of the founders and their dynamic role in the intellectual property marketplace. At the completion of this project, eighty to ninety question set interviews including interviews with at least thirty founders of physics-based startups will have been acquired. The findings will eventually be published in professional journals and on the Web.\r\n\r\nThis study is important for understanding the role of startups in knowledge creation within industry and further investigating the changing patterns of research and development organizations and funding within the industrial community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "PHYSICS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION\n\"You Can\u00c6t Depend on Large Companies Anymore\"\nOrville R. Butler &amp; Joseph Anderson\n\nThis Project, which follows our earlier study of physicists in industry, is the first systematic study of physics-based entrepreneurship.  Interviewees included about 140 physicists and their co-founders of 91 startups. Nine startups began prior to 1990; 19 began between 1991 and 2000; and the remaining 63 began between 2001 and 2010.  With the exception of one startup in New York, the startups involved in the study were distributed in clusters across 12 regions.\n\nAs early as 1841 German-American economist Friedrich List argued that physics and chemistry are the sciences whose innovations transform all industrial sectors. \"There is no progress, no discovery\" in these fields, he asserted, \"which does not improve and transform a hundred branches of Industry.\" Because innovations in physics affect entrepreneurship across nearly all industrial sectors still today, we believe that this study avoids some of the peculiarities of biomedical and pharmaceutical startups that have dominated recent studies.\n\nWe found no national culture of entrepreneurship and innovation. Rather we found relatively unique ecosystems of innovation and entrepreneurship shaped by a wide variety of local and regional factors.  We believe that this may be the study\u00c6s most important finding. This finding suggests that attempts to model regional clusters of innovation after Silicon Valley or Route 128 in Massachusetts may be misplaced.  Rather, we found successful entrepreneurs in each cluster relied upon their regional communities and culture to develop successful entrepreneurial practices and develop methods of funding and marketing their technologies.  Further studies would do well to focus on the existing characteristics of regional entrepreneurial clusters rather than to attempt to find ways for them to replicate the purported Silicon Valley and Route 128 models for entrepreneurial activity.\n\nThe startups we visited could be broadly divided into what we called \"market-pull\" and \"technology-push\" companies. Market-pull startups tend to improve upon existing technologies, to resolve bottle necks or cost barriers in existing markets. The focus is on product development, with little research. Technology-push companies typically spin new, game-changing technologies out of university research to as yet undeveloped markets.  The focus is on product creation based on fairly fundamental scientific research and a search for markets that will maximize the ultimate value of their technology.\n\nVenture capital/angel and government funding through the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs both played critical roles in funding startups but their roles have evolved over time.  Venture capital requirements have tightened, and entrepreneurs noted the growing difficulty in getting venture capital for early stages of company research and development.  Entrepreneurs, depending on their business model, found problems both with government funding and venture capital funding even though they typically found both played important roles.  They found that SBIR/STTR funding tended to push for more research and slow movement of their technology to the marketplace, while venture capital requirements on the other hand  forced them to take risks\nwhich they felt limited their ability to maximize the ultimate value of their technologies.\n\nThe roles of venture capital/angels and federal SBIR/STTR grants evolved\nsignificantly since 1990.  Figure 2 shows the regional distribution of quarterly venture capital investments since 1995-2011 while figure 3 shows the regional distribution of total VC funds 1995-2011. Initially many VCs were committed to building companies.  By the mid-1990s the VC industry had become more competitive.  A VC firm would invest in a series of companies that would then compete against another ..."
