Patricia Stock, University of Arizona\r\nCoPIs: David Bird, North Carolina State University\r\n Elodie Ghedin, Pittsburgh School of Medicine\r\n Heidi Goodrich-Blair, University of Wisconsin Madison \r\n\r\nIntimate associations between microbes and 'higher' organisms are widespread in nature, occurring in every type of ecological niche. The interactions in these associations range from highly integrated obligatory symbioses to 'loose' assemblages. Given the importance of microbial symbioses to the functioning  of virtually all earth ecosystems, and to gain insights into fundamental processes underlying symbiosis, researchers in this project will focus on one of the most common microbe-animal interactions: that between nematode worms and bacteria.  Associations between nematodes and bacteria range from fortuitous to obligate and from beneficial to pathogenic. The ubiquity and diversity of nematode-bacterium symbioses make them an excellent model to understand the key questions in symbiosis. However, while scientists worldwide from disciplines as diverse as medicine, agriculture, ecology, and genetics are currently studying associations between these two groups of organisms, they do not interact. To address this critical need for crossing disciplinary lines, the four PIs involved in this project will promote the intellectual discourse among scientists studying bacteria-nematode associations by organizing a Research Coordination Network on 'Nematode-Bacteria Symbioses'.  Specific goals are:\r\n\r\n1) Foster interdisciplinary collaborations between scientists;\r\n2) Encourage scientists engaged in basic and applied research to explore how cross-talk and networking can enhance and advance science in this field,\r\n3) Develop and distribute educational materials to scientists and educators to promote the study of nematode-bacteria symbioses as model systems in science and education.  \r\n\r\nThere is no other group in the United States or elsewhere that is similar to the proposed research work group in its broad scope of nematode-bacteria interactions. Investigators leading this network will interact with other societies to disseminate knowledge and dovetail with established meetings. Efforts will be made to include postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduates into this enterprise, along with international colleagues.",
