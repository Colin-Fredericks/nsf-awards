 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental difficulty faced by geologists studying the evolution of large mountain ranges is the inability to directly observe the types of rock and deformation patterns that are found at deep crustal levels beneath active mountains. One way to overcome this difficulty is to study ancient mountain ranges that have since been inverted or eroded, and currently expose the deepest structural levels of a mountain range at the surface. The rocks of Liverpool Land (LL), East Greenland, expose the roots to the Caledonides, a mountain range that spanned the length of Greenland, and formed as Scandinavia collided with North America in the time span from about 440 to 360 million years ago. This collaborative effort between faculty and graduate and undergraduate students at Queens College and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, with assistance from Norwegian geologists, will determine the origin and subsequent deformation history of rocks from the roots of the Caledonides, to better understand the processes of mountain building during continental collision. The results of this project will be of particular interest to researchers studying deformation in actively deforming mountain belts like the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nField and laboratory analysis of high pressure and ultra-high-pressure (UHP) gneisses from Liverpool Land will be used to test models for the subduction and exhumation of UHP terranes in the overriding plates of collisional orogens.  Liverpool Land has been correlated with Laurentia, implying it was situated in the upper plate during the Caledonian Orogeny as Baltica subducted beneath. Previous work by these investigators in LL has identified eclogites and mantle-derived garnet peridotites possibly correlated with Baltica in addition to a tectonostratigraphic suture between a younger UHP terrane and an older mid-crustal gneiss terrane. These discoveries challenge generally accepted models for the formation of UHP terranes where continental lithosphere is pulled to mantle depths by negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere, as well as models for their exhumation in the footwalls of lithospheric-scale normal faults. We propose a structural, geochemical, and geo-thermo-chronologic study of the LL gneiss complexes to 1) define the tectonic setting and metasomatic history of the mantle wedge incorporated into the LL terrane, 2) determine Laurentian versus Baltic provenance of the LL gneiss complexes, and 3) characterize the kinematics and timing of tectonostratigraphic sutures responsible for exhumation in LL. The proposed work promises to shed light on geodynamic processes including the possibility of multiple UHP events during the closure of ocean basins, crust-mantle interaction and exchange during orogeny, and lower to midcrustal melting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n The general purpose of our research is to refine our understanding of continental subduction and exhumation.  Continental subduction is not generally known to the scientific community and in fact many geology textbooks still adhere to the classic plate tectonic notion that oceanic crust can be subducted because it is dense whereas continental crust cannot because it is too buoyant.  It turns out evidence for continental subduction occurs within most mountain systems in the form of high pressure/ultrahigh pressure (HP/UHP) metamorphic terranes comprised of typical continental rocks (gneisses, schists, metasediments, etc.) and containing rocks (eclogites, garnet peridotites) and minerals (coesite, diamonds) that could only have formed by metamorphic recrystallization while at great depths in the mantle.  Subduction of these crustal terranes probably occurs when two continents or a continent and an island arc collide as the ocean between them narrows and closes and one continent slides beneath the other deeply (60-150 km) into the mantle (I.e. \"subducts\"). \n\n Thus the study of these terranes is also in effect a study on mountan buiilding.  The Liverpool Land Eclogite Terrane (LLET) occurs in mountains known as the Eastern Greenland Caledonides and is one such metamorphic terrane.  We conducted field analyses and sample collecting for two weeks during the summer of 2009 and have continued our work in the laboratory to determine the chemistry, isotopic patterns, and radiometric ages of LLET rocks.  We use this information to determine the origin and evolution of the LLET in particular, and HP/UHP terranes in general.\n\n The LLET terrane appeared to pose a major objection to the model outlined above in that HP/UHP terranes form when one craton is subducted beneath another into the mantle during continental collision.  The subducted terrane undergoes HP/UHP metamorphism to form eclogites and other high grade rocks and also acquires mantle rocks (peridotites) from the overlying mantle wedge.  In the case of the Caledonides (see accompanying figure), the subducted terrane was supposed to be Baltica (Scandinavia), which subducted beneath Laurentia (Greenland).  But the LL HP/UHP terrane is presently in Greenland, and therefore seems to be  part of Laurentia, which, according to the model, was the upper plate during collision.  This apparent problem was resolved by our field and analytical results that show the LL HP/UHP terrane was part of Baltica, not Laurentia, despite its present location in Laurentia.  Laurentian rocks include ones that are Archean in age (i.e. older than 2.5 billion years) whereas rocks from Baltica are 1.6 billion years old or younger.  The LL HP/UHP terrane lacks any rocks older than 1.6 billion years old and thus represent a fragment of Baltica that somehow was left behind (stranded) in Greenland after the Caledonides were constructed, probably during the later opening of the Atlantic Ocean roughly 60 million years ago.   Other field results show that LL is probably comprised of two crystalline complexes that were juxtaposed during or just after subduction and that there are at least two major faults that were responsible for bringing the rocks to the surface (exhumation).

Our work also focused on the spectacular eclogites (classic HP/UHP rocks composed of red garnets and green pyroxene) and the peridotite bodies (mantle rocks very rich in olivine, but also containing pyroxene and garnet) that occur within the LL gneisses.  We dated the eclogites by the Sm-Nd mineral isochron method at roughly 400 million years, identical in age to the surrounding gneisses and also identical in ..."
