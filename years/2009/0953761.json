 "awd_abstract_narration": "In multi-core computing, programmers must write concurrent code to obtain\r\nperformance, much harder than sequential code. Transactions are part of the\r\nsolution: they reduce concurrent reasoning to sequential reasoning.  But\r\nhigh-performance data structures require relaxed transactional memory\r\ntechniques like open nesting.  This places a tricky correctness burden on the\r\nprogrammer: identifying which operations on the data structure conflict\r\n(cannot run in simultaneous transactions), and how to undo operations to back\r\nout incomplete transactions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to specify what a data structure ought to do, and to\r\nprove that the programmer's conflict and undo specifications are correct. The\r\nproject will complete a proof-of-concept tool to demonstrate the feasibility\r\nof the approach.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit includes: a language for specifying data abstractions\r\nas abstract models amenable to the proofs required; a way to describe\r\nconflicts between operations on the data type, and undos; a tool to process\r\nthe descriptions and build proofs as satisfiability problems; and algorithms\r\nto prove correctness of abstract locking procotols. The project will be more\r\nsuccessful than general program proving since it works with abstractions, not\r\nimplementations, and it deals with specific properties of interest. Future\r\nwork can address correctness of implementation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact consists in assisting programmers in building safe\r\nhigh-performance concurrent data structures for multi-core platforms. The\r\ntools and libraries produced will be widely available. Helping solve the\r\nmulti-core software problem has huge implications for our economy and society.",
