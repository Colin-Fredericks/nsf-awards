In this research, an experimental technique will be developed to measure important thermal properties of ceramic nanowires. Relationships between the processing parameters used to synthesize the wires, and the nanowire properties will be developed. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. Ceramic nanowires will be fabricated using a sol-gel-electrospinning technique. A laser-assisted, non-contact approach will be developed to measure the porosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat of single ceramic nanowires. Specifically, the nanowires will be irradiated using a modulated laser source, and the time-varying electrical resistivity of a very thin metallic coating applied to the nanowire will be measured. The thermal response of the nanowire will be inferred from the electrical resistivity information. Using a thermal analysis, the porosity, specific heat, and thermal conductivity of the nanowire will be determined. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. The results of the research will be integrated into existing and new courses at Iowa State University. Undergraduate participation in summer research will be facilitated through the PERUSE program at ISU. Outreach to K12 students is included, and will involve supervision of independent study projects by top students from local high schools.",
