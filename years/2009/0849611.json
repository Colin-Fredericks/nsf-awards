 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scholarships and support for students in 26 STEM majors within associate degree programs in order to increase the number of academically talented students earning degrees and pursuing careers in areas that are designated as national and state priorities for education. In meeting the need for an increased STEM workforce, the project functions to 1) provide up to 33 scholarships each year for financially disadvantaged students, including those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups; 2) provide the support needed for successful associate degree completion; 3) provide transfer assistance to a STEM degree program in a four-year institution; and to 4) provide job placement assistance. Scholarship recipients receive ongoing academic assistance through regular meetings with faculty advisors, and peer mentoring and tutoring through an academic support center. Students explore careers through internships, meetings with industry representatives, touring of local businesses, and attending career fairs and academic and industry conferences. The program also features a mandatory one-credit course, taught by the S-STEM project team, which emphasizes real-world applications and fosters understanding of the importance of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary work in STEM fields.",
