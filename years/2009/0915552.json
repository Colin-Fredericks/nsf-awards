 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operators of large-scale enterprises and ISPs need to understand the type of traffic that their networks handle, and emergent applications and traffic behavior, in order to better service them and detect anomalies. Also, better assessment of the carried traffic will inform network planning and security. Particularly for private enterprise networks, monitoring methods can be used to detect inappropriate traffic classes indicating unprofessional (or at least unauthorized) activity. This work will adapt and innovate methods of unsupervised machine learning to classify traffic flows to ascertain the types of end-user applications which are active in an enterprise network. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the project will include explaining networking concepts to a wider audience of machine learning researchers, and vice versa so that the newly developed techniques will have wide dissemination to the networking community, as well as to other domains in science and engineering. Also, cross-disciplinary graduate-level courseware on applications of machine learning to network flow data and related concepts will be developed and disseminated. More practical developments will be achieved through collaboration with industrial partners. Finally, the project will aim to support graduate students from under-represented groups in computer science and engineering, particularly women.\r\n\r\nThe primary technical merit of the research to be conducted will pertain to the high-volume and considerably complex network data under consideration, including prevalent short flows, given limited computing and communication resources to do so.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project were to investigate the problems of (supervised) statistical classification, unsupervised classification (clustering), and anomaly detection, as applied to data traces consisting of Internet packet flows.  Each such flow represents the communication in a single session between a source IP address and a destination IP address.  A flow may correspond to Web application activity, email, on-line gaming, etc.  Identification of the distribution of application types present in a given captured trace (obtained by an Internet monitor (sensor)) may be useful for policing appropriate use of network resources by an administrator.  In particular, it may be useful for identifying known attack traffic/exploits, as well as unknown exploits (unknown unknowns).  In this project, we first studied the classification accuracy of flow classifiers in the presence of feature obfuscations, such as port-number spoofing, as well as under new domains for which the traffic characteristics may be different than under the training conditions.  We also devised a sound methodology for conducting network classification/anomaly detection experiments that involve \"salting\" a captured trace, measured at one monitoring point, with anomalies/attack traffic.  We developed novel flow classification techniques: i) involving judicious choice of the features on which to base the classifier's decisions, in order e.g. to successfully discriminate normal (Web) traffic from bot attack traffic that masquerades as Web; ii) so that the classifier can be adapted to operate accurately on a new domain, without costly full classifier retraining based on a large ground-truthed database for the new domain.  Finally, we investigated semi-supervised learning problems, wherein there is plentiful data \"training\" examples, albeit much of it unlabeled (without ground truth).  We developed novel, improved semi-supervised learning algorithms, considering both: i) that some clusters of flows may be class-heterogeneous (hence, requiring more fine-grained class-partitioning of the flows that belong to a given cluster); and ii) that it may only be known whether two flows belong to a common class, or to different classes, rather than which application class to which the two flows belong, i.e. the ground-truth supervision may be in the form of \"instance-level constraints\", rather than class labels. \n\nSome of the research outcomes of this project are as follows:\n\n\nWe have demonstrated that fragile, easily obfuscated features such as port numbers should not be used by flow classifiers;\n\n\nWe have demonstrated realistic \"salting\" practice for network flow classification experiments, in order to ensure that false data artifacts (which may artificially discriminate normal applications from attacks) are not introduced;\n\n\nWe developed a promising method for classifier domain adaptation, with a patent pending, which does not require substantial ground truth from the new (target) domain.\n\n\nWe have discovered that quite judicious feature representation is needed for accurate discrimination between Web traffic and the http Zeus bot (which uses Web's port 80).\n\n\nSome research milestones include multiple published journal papers, conference papers, a patent application, conference presentations, invited talks to academia and industry, as well as one Ph.D. graduate, two M.S. graduates, and one Ph.D. in the final year of degree.\n\n\nIn addition to our publications, our work on this project has also led us to what we believe is a highly focused set of scientifically sensible benchmark experiments for anomaly detection based on network packet-flow traces.\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George Kesidis"
