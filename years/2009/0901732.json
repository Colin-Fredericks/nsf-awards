 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSRACT:\r\n\r\nThe Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) is a series of three number theory  meetings per year held at colleges and universities in South Carolina, the Palmetto state.  The meetings take place on a rotating basis at Clemson University, College of Charleston, and University of South Carolina.  PANTS has successfully completed its first two years in 2006-2008. The three yearly meetings are to be held in October, December, and February.  The October and February meetings will feature two plenary talks, while the December meeting will  feature four plenary talks.  The hour-long plenary  talks will be given by leading number theorists from outside the Southeast.  Each meeting will have 20-30 minute contributed talks from Southeastern participants.  One graduate or undergraduate student from outside of the Southeast will also be invited to give a 45 minute talk at each meeting.\r\n\r\nA primary goal of these meetings is to provide the number theory community in the Southeast an opportunity to hear about recent research in number theory, pure and applied. PANTS meetings attract prominent number theorists.  They also provide regional mathematicians, particularly graduate students and junior faculty, an opportunity to speak.  The frequency and regularity of the meetings promotes collaboration and strengthens working relationships between participants.  Another objective of PANTS meetings is to involve  number theorists at all career stages and types of institutions at minimal cost.  PANTS speakers include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty.  PANTS also encourages and helps the involvement of talented undergraduate students.  PANTS participants come not only from South Carolina, but from schools in neighboring states.  They come from Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose highest degree awarded is a master's degree, and from institutions granting only baccalaureate degrees.  The organizers also attempt to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and other underrepresented groups.\r\n",
