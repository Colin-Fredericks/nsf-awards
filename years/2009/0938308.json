The symposium will be held at the 28th AAAR Annual Conference, October 26-30, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. The objective of this project is to support graduate and undergraduate students, who are choosing their future research field and would otherwise not be able to make the AAAR conference and this symposium.  This symposium provides a unique venue for communications among aerosol researchers who would otherwise attend conferences more generally focusing on the materials and/or applications and therefore would not otherwise come into close contact. In the aerosol community, traditionally there are more researchers working in the field of controlling aerosol particles as a pollution source.  However, aerosol technology is also an enabling technology to produce interesting materials.  Selected aerosol and other researchers who are currently leading the field will be invited to speak at the symposium. The symposium thus also serves as a catalyst to attract more aerosol researchers to direct their studies toward energy and particularly renewable energy applications.\r\n\r\nNSF funding will be used to support the participation of graduate students and undergraduate students.  Participation of graduate students and undergraduate students in the symposium will not only benefit the students in their career development but also benefit our society by training competent future workforce in the energy area.  Particular efforts will be made to attract and support female researchers and members of minority groups underrepresented in science and engineering.",
