Two year scholarships for the fourth and fifth years are being awarded for the cost of attendance with a maximum annual award of $20,000. A minimum of eighteen scholars are receiving two-year scholarships over the five year project period.  The IDEA (Instructional Development and Educational Assessment) Institute offers several programs aimed at early identification of potential teachers among STEM majors in the freshmen and sophomore years.  These include 35 three-week internships for undergraduates to teach in summer science camps, opportunities to collaborate with teachers in public schools on small scale instructional projects in high needs schools, and opportunities to serve as peer instructors and group  leaders.\r\n\r\nDuring the junior year, students are admitted via early admission into the MAT program and are dual enrolled as undergraduates and graduate students.  Monthly meetings and planning sessions are held to assist with preparation for the Noyce program and additional teaching experience is gained.  In the fourth year the students complete the STEM degree requirements, enroll in initial education courses and undertake a teaching practicum with a master teacher.  Student teaching, primarily in Detroit Public Schools, along with additional coursework, occurs in the final year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSeveral years ago a group of leaders in science, engineering, and medicine wrote about a problem they saw brewing on the horizon of problem-solving and innovation in the United States.  Titled, \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm,\" and published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2007, this document outlined the desperate need for  our society to ramp up attention to education in fields such as the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). These leaders argued that we must create a strong pipeline into STEM fields to maintain our global leadership in technological discovery and to regain a powerful positions in fields as diverse as medicine, engineering, and manufacturing.  \n\nAs a result, STEM education leaders at the National Academies, National Science Foundation, and in universities and K-12 school districts around the United States have worked to set and attain new standards for STEM education.  These efforts, however, have been hampered by the decline in enrollments of new candidates into the teaching profession.  The decline is especially notable in STEM teaching fields, creating an impending crisis in STEM education at a time when our nation most needs to elevate the preparation of children and youth to participate as community members in scientific and technological innovation and decision making.  \n\nThe University of Michigan School of Education (SOE) project described here, titled, \"A Collaborative Model for STEM Secondary Teacher Education,\" was designed to counter that trend.  Despite the fact that the University of Michigan?s elementary and secondary Educator Preparation programs are ranked second in the nation, the U-M SOE&mdash;like most university-based teacher preparation programs around the country&mdash;has witnessed a decline in enrollment.\n\nTo address this issue, the School of Education, with the generous support of the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, has collaborated closely with the STEM faculties in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) and with the Detroit Public Schools Community District to increase the number of highly-educated teachers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  \n\nWith the Noyce Scholar support, the SOE was able to provide a tuition scholarship, a technology package, and local travel costs to urban school settings for each scholar.  We also hosted mentoring and professional development events for Noyce Scholars and supported them in traveling to national STEM education conferences.  Some Noyce Scholars were also able to work as interns in STEM labs during the summer, thereby increasing their understanding of STEM research. \n\nPrior to receiving Noyce scholarship monies, highly qualified candidates to the University of Michigan?s Educator Education program cited funding as the number one reason they declined an offer to U-M.  The Noyce scholarships made it possible for these highly skilled and dedicated young people to pursue the teaching profession when it might not have been financially feasible for them due to high student loan burdens and low prospective salary.  In exchange for the funding support, each Noyce Scholar pledged to teach in high-needs settings for at least two years following certification.\n\nWe are pleased to report that these collaborations and concerted efforts have consistently increased enrollments in STEM teaching majors and the production of highly qualified STEM teachers for high-needs settings over the last five years, in some years by as much as 50%.  \n\nIn addition, the Noyce program has strengthened strategic partnerships with LSA and increased the visibility of the STEM certification program for U-M graduates.  As a result of involvement and participation in recruiting events, LSA  STEM faculties are now more knowledgeable about the SOE?s teacher preparation program and about the qualities of desired recruits.  One physics scholar even took on a dry appointment in the School of Education. Finally, the SOE was able to strengthen the engagement STEM teacher education candidates in strong clinical experiences that involved school-based partnerships in Detroit, Michigan, and in virtual mentoring and professional development after program completion.\n\nOur Noyce Scholars have reported strong satisfaction with the program, have demonstrated clear gains in teaching skill and in content knowledge for teaching, and have successfully taken positions in high-needs schools.  Many scholars also are participating side by side with veteran teachers in our virtual teacher residency/induction program and in the School of Education?s increasing number of STEM-focused professional development offerings.  \n\nOverall, the program has been a clear success, and we look forward to building on and strengthening the collaborative relationships we have built in the service of improving STEM teacher preparation.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/22/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth B Moje"
