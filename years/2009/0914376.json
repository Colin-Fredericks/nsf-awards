 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S., with most cases acquired from blacklegged ticks. These ticks are found throughout the eastern U.S., yet 93% of LD cases occur in ten states found in the Northeast and Upper Midwest.  Various explanations have been proposed for the puzzling absence of LD in some areas where blacklegged ticks occur, but no agreement has been reached. The absence of an explanation contributes to uncertainty and confusion felt by citizens and healthcare providers faced with expanding tick populations in many parts of the U.S.  \r\n\r\nThe research team represents five universities as well as national and international governmental agencies. They have a strong commitment to disseminating research findings to scientists, public health agencies, land managers, and the public.  They will test three key hypotheses concerning LD distribution using field, laboratory, and computer modeling studies.  Data on tick-host relationships, tick seasonal biology, and tick genetics will be collected from field sites in four widely-separated regions of the eastern U.S.  Application of modeling and molecular tools will reveal the ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for the variation in LD risk in different regions of the U.S., as well as help predict how climate change could alter this risk.  Furthermore, this improved understanding of factors determining the distribution and abundance of infected ticks will assist in human disease diagnosis and treatment, tick control measures, and public education on regional differences in the risk of LD and other tick-borne disease.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLyme disease is common in the northeastern and north central United States, but relatively rare in the south, even though the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis, is present in all of these regions.  This project examined the ecological reasons for this apparent geographical gradient in Lyme disease, by studying tick populations, tick genetics, vertebrate host associations, vegetation patterns, and responses to climatic factors at numerous sites in the eastern and central U.S.  One major finding is that nymphal ticks in northern regions tend to seek hosts on the tops of leaves and twigs above the leaf litter surface, while southern ticks stay beneath the surface of the leaf litter.  The nymphal stage is the primary vector stage that transmits Lyme spirochetes to people.  This difference in host seeking behavior appears to result from genetic differences between northern and southern populations of the vector tick.  Therefore, people walking through woods in the north frequently encounter host seeking nymphal ticks, while people in the south rarely encounter the nymphs, which remain down below the leaf litter surface.  Lab experiments suggest that the warmer southern conditions place desiccation stress on the ticks, so they have evolved to stay below the leaf litter surface to avoid the desiccating conditions in the open air on the surface.  The longer growing season in the south and host associations with species that are common in the south but not in the north, also apparently contribute to the geographic gradient in Lyme disease.  Skinks, in particular, appear to be important tick hosts in the south, but not in the north, where rodents are major hosts.  Studies on these factors are ongoing.\n\nThese results  will help us understand why tick borne borne diseases occur where they do.  They will also help us understand the factors that foster spread of these diseases resulting from environmental shifts such as climate change and habitat modification.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roger Lebrun"
