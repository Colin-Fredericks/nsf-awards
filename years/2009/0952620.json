 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides travel grants to U.S. based graduate students to attend IEEE GLOBECOM 2009 to be held in Honolulu on 30 Nov - 4 Dec 2009.  It encourages participation by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Other criteria include evidence of research in the conference topics, and/or a serious interest in these topics as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Women and minorities are given preference when other qualifications are similar.  NSF support is used exclusively to fund a group travel grant to subsidize junior researchers. No NSF funds are used to conduct the conference.\r\n \r\nIEEE GLOBECOM 2009 is a premier international conference for the dissemination of state-of-the-art communications and networking technologies and identifying future directions in the research and development areas. This conference offers not only technical paper presentations but also a wide range of other educational formats, including panels, tutorials, industry presentations, posters and keynote speeches by academic and industry leaders. \r\n \r\nAttendance at this type of technical conference provides students with a broader understanding of the research field and also allows for ample opportunities to interact with peer graduate students from other institutions, to meet with leading researchers and to grasp the state-of-the-art of the industry.\r\n",
