 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for junior researchers including undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students working in the area of molecular materials at US institutions to attend the 3rd International Advanced School: Molecular Switching and Functional Materials and the 5th Japan-France Symposium on Molecular Materials: Electronics, Photonics and Spintronics at the University of Rennes, France, Oct. 26-30, 2009.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this proposal is to expose young US researchers to four priority areas in molecular materials that are an integral part of the training program of the young researchers:\r\n(1) Multifunctional materials: to work in emerging areas of materials design, synthesis, and measurement.\r\n(2) Measurement in extreme environments: materials research involving high magnetic fields, high pressure, and high intensity neutron and light sources.\r\n(3) Time resolved dynamics: optical and femtosecond methods to explore the dynamics of optical, spin, charge, and lattice mechanisms in molecular structures.\r\n(4) Device applications: to adapt molecular materials to electronic (field effect) and optical (light harvesting, emitting, and switching) devices for technology.",
