 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 18th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN?09) will be held in San Francisco, CA, USA from August 2 to August 6, 2009. This technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer networking and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Attendance to ICCCN is highly valuable for graduate students? research and career development. Student participants will have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, and interact with peers engaged in state-of-the-art research in the field.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funding to support approximately 10-15 US-based graduate students to attend ICCCN?09. The travel awards will target graduate students, in particular female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited travel funds to attend conferences, which is an important part of their educational experience.",
