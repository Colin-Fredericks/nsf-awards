 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems related to requirements definitions account for numerous project failures and translate into significant amounts of wasted funds. In many cases, these problems originate from inadequacies in the human-intensive task of eliciting stakeholders' needs, and the subsequent problems of transforming them into a set of clearly articulated and prioritized requirements. These problems are particularly evident in very large projects such as the FBI Virtual Case File or NASA's Space Station, in which knowledge is dispersed across thousands of different stakeholders. On one hand, it is desirable to include as many people as possible in the elicitation and prioritization process, but on the other hand this can quickly lead to a rather chaotic overload of information and opinions. The work proposed under this grant will develop a new framework that utilizes data mining and recommender systems techniques to process and analyze high volumes of unstructured data in order to facilitate large-scale and broadly inclusive requirements processes. The proposal is based on the observation that the requirements elicitation process of many large-scaled industrial and governmental projects is inherently data-driven, and could therefore benefit from computer-supported tools based on data mining and user modeling techniques. \r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT \r\nThe proposed research will lead to a robust requirements elicitation framework and an associated library of tools which can be used to augment the functionality of wikis, forums, and specialized management tools used in the requirements domain. Specifically, this research will enhance requirements clustering techniques by incorporating prior knowledge and user-derived constraints. A contextualized recommender system will be designed to facilitate appropriate placement of stakeholders into requirements discussion forums generated in the clustering phase. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT \r\nThe proposed work has potential for broad impact across organizations that develop stakeholder-intensive systems. Technology transfer can be expected due to collaborations with  organizations such as Siemens and Google planned as an integral part of this research. Educational materials will be developed specifically for requirements engineering and recommender systems courses, and will be broadly disseminated. \r\n\r\nKey Words: Recommender systems; Data mining; Clustering; Requirements engineering; Requirements elicitation.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProblem Statement\n\nWhen dramatic failures occur in software intensive projects, the root cause can often be traced back to inadequacies in the human-intensive task of eliciting stakeholders\u00c6 needs and transforming them into a set of clearly articulated and prioritized requirements. Current technologies, such as online forums, enable a larger and representative set of stakeholders to contribute their ideas and knowledge to the requirements process, but also introduce a mass of redundant and unstructured data.  This hinders the process of exploring, analyzing, and extracting requirements.\n\nManaging Online Forums\n\nThe first deliverable of the work directly addressed this problem by delivering two recommender systems designed to help individual stakeholders find appropriate discussion threads, and to help project managers identify expert stakeholders.  Working in tandem, these two recommender systems help to reduce the problem of single-topics being dispersed across multiple discussions, ensure that stakeholders with similar interests engage in conversation, and keep discussions moving forward by drawing additional experts into stagnant areas of the forum.  Several different recommender system algorithms were explored and ultimately a hybrid, collaborative filtering solution that integrated the known interests of each stakeholder with their formal roles in the project proved most effective.\n\nThe second deliverable of the work produced customized clustering solutions that were designed to help organize the discussion threads and to keep each one cohesive.  A novel algorithm, referred to as Incremental Diffusive Clustering (IDC) was shown to produce high quality clusters of feature requests in forums.  Additional algorithms were delivered that improved the stability of the clustering process so that individual user posts were not constantly moved across threads.  User inputs in the form of clustering directives and tags were used to help stabilize the process.\n\nRecommending Features for New Products\n\nThe third major deliverable focused on recommending features for new products.  Algorithms were developed to mine thousands of partial product descriptions from websites such as SoftPedia and to use this information to infer associations between features.  A system was developed that recommended features to be added to a partially specified product.  In addition, inferencing algorithms were used to generate a feature model, depicting common features and their dependencies for a wide variety of mined products.  A case study was performed to demonstrate how feature recommendations could be used to build a novel product.\n\nExtracting Requirements Perspectives\n\nThe final deliverable used data mining techniques to reverse engineer a goal hierarchy of quality-related concerns, such as security, performance, and usability from a set of feature requests.  The approach used a pre-trained classifier to detect quality concerns,  a topic-modeling algorithm to identify functional components, and a hierarchical clustering algorithm to create structure.  Together these approaches were woven into a process that generated a goal model &ndash; providing a birds-eye view of the major quality concerns expressed by the stakeholders during the requirements elicitation process.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nIn addition to technical and pedagogical deliverables, the funded project provided opportunities for training a diverse set of graduate and undergraduate students in research.   Several of the solutions developed through this project were integrated into coursework at DePaul University for teaching \"Analytics for Software Engineers\" and an introductory course on \"Web Mining\". Both investigators have engaged in outreach activities including giving tutorials, keynotes, and talks at academic conferences and workshops, and also by giving presentations at various industries.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, the project has addressed several key issues related to the large-scale elici..."
