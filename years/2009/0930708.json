The project incorporates biochemistry and genetic engineering to grow bacteria expressing nanostructures, which are templated to produce inorganic nanotubes with uniform diameters, pore sizes and morphology. Uniform control over nanotube dimensions and morphology has previously been a major challenge in the industry, however, specific control allows enhancement of positive attributes and minimizes the negative.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research are that the project lays the groundwork for a platform technology with applications in diverse industries. For example, among the various types and compositions of nanotubes possible; silica nanotubes are especially suited for nano-biotechnology applications due to their intrinsic biocompatibility and the availability of established processes for chemical modifications. These tubular structures are exceptional candidates for exploration in fields such as drug and gene delivery, single molecule sensors and bioseparations. The scaleable biological process provides a competitive synthesis technology to the variety of chemical and physical processes utilized for the manufacture of nanotube structures. Nanotechnology advances are dependent on a library of technologies available for design, fabrication and application of nanostructures and nanomaterials. For example, nanorods or nanowires have been synthesized utilizing template based electroplating, solutionliquid-solid growth and spontaneous anisotropic growth. The proposed technology provides a valuable addition to the library of technologies available for the synthesis of nanostructured materials.\r\n\r\n",
