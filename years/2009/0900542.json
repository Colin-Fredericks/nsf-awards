 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current window technologies suffer from various limitations, including: inability to efficiently reject or accept solar heat when desired, blocking daylight when only heat blocking is desired, high cost, and nonprogrammability.  This proposal describes a smart window technology that overcomes these limitations.  The new technology is a programmable, pixelated optoelectronic window system based on polymer blazed diffraction gratings fabricated by microelectronic processes, providing cost-effective, dynamic windows with high energy efficiency and recycling capability.  In the proposed plan, key technological elements of the new concept will be developed, a fully functioning smart window prototype will be demonstrated, and a commercialization plan will be developed to implement the technology in major applications.\r\n\r\nThe energy costs for lighting, heating and cooling in commercial and residential buildings are estimated by the Department of Energy for 2005 at $416 billion, a figure that is certainly much higher now.  Further, annual energy costs attributable to inefficient windows exceed $50 billion, and those to interior lighting, $70 billion.  Therefore, a smart window technology that can reduce losses, increase efficiency, and enable recycling of energy resources will make a major contribution in an enormous commercial market of national importance.  This program will also benefit the educational objectives in science and engineering at the university level.  With its multidisciplinary breadth, the program will expand opportunities for faculty to collaborate across departments and with other universities and government laboratories.  It will also provide opportunities for high school students and teachers, such as summer research jobs, class projects, and short-term research modules.\r\n",
