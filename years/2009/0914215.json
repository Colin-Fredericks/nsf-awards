 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimization problems arise in signal/image denoising,\r\ncompressed sensing, sensor network localization, multi-task learning, data\r\nmining/classification, are large-scale, nonlinear, but highly structured.\r\nAn effective solution approach is to approximate the problems by\r\nconvex relaxations that are computationally tractable and inherit the\r\nstructures of the original problems.  Specialized computer algorithms\r\nare then developed to exploit the structures and\r\nefficiently solve the convex relaxations in real time.\r\nThe investigator and his colleagues/students study the accuracy of\r\ndifferent convex relaxations (i.e., how well they approximate the\r\noriginal problems) when data may be noisy, and develop new computer\r\nalgorithms that are more efficient in theory and in practice.\r\nThis includes coordinatewise and incremental gradient algorithms,\r\npossibly accelerated through extrapolation.\r\nComplexity and convergence rate are studied, as well as\r\ncomputer implementation and testing.\r\nThus the twin topics of approximation by convex relaxations and\r\nalgorithms for convex relaxations are integrated in their development.\r\n\r\nMeasured data, from satellite images to biological images to stock indices\r\nto internet queries/usage, are inherently noisy and large size.\r\nHow to process such large noisy data and extract key\r\nfeatures/patterns is a major challenge, with important applications to\r\nimage restoration/denoising, economic forecasting, pattern recognition,\r\ndata classification, etc.  In the proposed research, parametrized\r\nmathematical models of the underlying data generating process are\r\nformulated and the parameters are tuned by specialized computer algorithms\r\nto optimize the model's predictive power.  The latter is achieved\r\nby optimizing a combination of the model's goodness-of-fit to data and a\r\nmeasure of model's simplicity.   This is motivated by Occam's Razor\r\nprinciple that the simplest is the best (in particular, for identifying\r\nunderlying patterns and trends).  For example, a 1 Mega-pixel\r\nnoisy image might be modeled by a weighted sum of 1000 \"elementary\"\r\nimages from a dictionary.  The computer algorithm then finds weights\r\nthat are sparse (i.e., few nonzeros) and\r\n  fit the model closely to the noisy image (say, in a least squares\r\nsense of the pixel values).  Predicting\r\npeople's behavior based on past data is another\r\nexample, such as the Netflix prize for predicting movie rating which\r\nhas a training data set of over 100 million ratings from over 480 thousand\r\npeople.  Owing to the large data size (and, in some cases, a need to\r\nprocess the data fast and in real time) and possibly high-dimensional\r\nparameter space, specialized algorithms based on new techniques (e.g.,\r\nwork with small chunks of data or small number of parameters at each time)\r\nneed to be developed.  This is the aim of the proposed research.",
