Osteoporosis is a silent bone disease which is characterized by low bone density and deterioration of bone structure resulting in bone fragility and an increased risk of fractures. The combined experimental and modeling approaches will link the image-based characterization techniques (measuring structure, composition, and properties) and computational methods (using mechanics, physics and mathematics tools) to yield a more complete information on properties of bone; methods are applicable to the analysis of other biological and synthetic materials.\r\n\r\nThis research will advance understanding of structure-property relations in bone and will lead to the development of tools for an early diagnosis of osteoporosis. It will also will benefit the field of orthopedics and will lead to a better understanding of bone fractures, stresses around implants, and the effects of bone diseases on mechanical properties of bone. In addition, the results of this research will give guidance on the design of bioinspired structural materials. This project will also serve as a training ground for students and will lead to a course on modeling of biological materials. To extend the reach of this research beyond academia, the images obtained as a result of this research will be integrated into the two established educational outreach programs at the University of Illinois, the Bugscope and the Virtual Microscope projects which provide real-time web-based control of a scanning electron microscope to K-16 school children natiowide.",
