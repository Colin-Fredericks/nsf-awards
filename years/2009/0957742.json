 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have demonstrated the powerful abilities of deep \r\narchitectures for statistical pattern recognition.  Deep \r\narchitectures transform their inputs through multiple layers of \r\nnonlinear processing.  Inspired by the connectivity of biological \r\nneural networks, the hidden layers of deep architectures encode \r\nhierarchical, distributed representations of complex sensory input.  \r\nTheoretical results suggest that such representations are needed to \r\nsolve the most difficult problems of artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nPrevious applications of deep architectures include visual object \r\nrecognition, statistical language modeling, and nonlinear \r\ndimensionality reduction.  Building on these successes, this project \r\ndevelops new applications of deep architectures for problems in \r\nspeech and audio processing.  Current front ends for these problems \r\nare dominated by traditional methods in statistical modeling and \r\nsignal processing.  Deep architectures have the potential to \r\novercome many limitations of current approaches.\r\n\r\nThis project has two research components with interrelated and \r\noverlapping goals.  The project's first component explores \r\nunsupervised learning in convolutional neural networks.  \r\nThe goal of learning in these networks is to discover new \r\nfeatures for audio event detection and automatic speech \r\nrecognition.  The project's second component investigates \r\nthe possibility of deep learning in kernel machines.  \r\nThis possibility is suggested by a recently discovered family \r\nof kernel functions that mimic the computation in large, \r\nmultilayer networks.\r\n\r\nThe project's research components are tightly integrated with \r\nits educational activities.   The project supports two graduate \r\nstudents, including one female student.  An important goal \r\nis to develop publicly available software for use by other \r\nresearchers.",
