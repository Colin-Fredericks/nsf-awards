 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER:  Tags:  A Unifying Primitive to Build Storage Data Paths for\r\nSwiftly Evolving Workloads and Storage Media\r\nDigital storage is now a part of our lives.  However, storage management in legacy operating systems becomes quickly outmode due to swift advances in storage media (e.g., memory cards and thumb drives) and new user requirements (e.g., energy efficiency, security, etc.).  In particular, legacy storage management presumes the use of disks rather than memory-based storage and is structured in layers with poor cross-layer coordination and little support for data-intensive applications.\r\nThis project introduces tags?a unifying primitive that can be used to build storage layers.  The idea is to tag each piece of data with how they relate to each other and how they are handled by each layer.  Tags will ease storage service composition and data sharing.   For example, file searches can be based on its association with e-mails and calendar events.  Tags will ease the isolation of system changes required to adapt to new storage media.  Tags describe the nature of data pieces (e.g., confidential, streaming media, etc.) so that storage layers can coordinate to improve performance, energy efficiency, etc.  Tags will track data dependencies so that confidential data and derivatives (e.g., temporary files) can be handled securely.\r\nIntellectual merits:  The challenges for this research include: (1) exploring the representation and interface of tags; (2) examining the management of tags under constraints of scaling, security, and assumptions of usage models and storage media; (3) developing ways to track data dependencies via tags; and (4) demonstrating the benefits of tags across diverse usage patterns and storage media. \r\nBroader impacts:  Tags support data-intensive applications such as databases and search engines. The design of tags is similar to machine instructions and allows the application of hardware optimization techniques. The data-tracking service offered by tags will support secure storage services.  The tag framework will become a valuable instructional tool, a platform to explore new ideas, and a gateway to explore ideas from other fields.  The research will lead to the development of a seminar course on storage that emphasizes on infusing ideas from various fields to advance storage frontiers.  \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe requirements for storage systems are diversifying, ranging from performance and security, to energy efficiency and scaling.  However, the legacy storage infrastructure is developed in layers with poor cross-layer coordination and little support for diversifying requirements.  This project introduces tags&mdash;a unifying primitive for building storage layers.  The use of tags eases data sharing and cross-layer coordination and supports a broad range of application domains.\n\n \n\nWhile developing our tags framework, we have examined the legacy storage infrastructure and identified its limits in deleting data securely.  This problem is important due to weekly headlines on how data is retrieved from decommissioned and thought-to-be-erased hard drives, cellular phones, etc.  Proper data deletion is hard because each storage layer lacks either the control to the storage medium or the information to decide whether in-transit data is subject to deletion.  Also, solutions within isolated layers can violate assumptions made by other layers, leading to poor guarantees.  These observations have been accepted for publication in ACM Computing Surveys. \n\n \n\nIn addition, we have designed and implemented TrueErase, a secure-deletion framework that encompasses all storage layers.  Our approach involves a centralized information repository represented in tags on whether in-transit data is subject to deletion, made available to storage components that can ensure the data is securely removed.   This approach interacts well with versions of in-transit data and requires no changes to their representations.  This work has been represented at the work-in-progress session of the 18th USENIX Security Symposium.  This work has been published at the 2012 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference.  We have also submitted a journal paper to the ACM Transactions on Storage.\n\n \n\nTrueErase offers a transformative capability not currently possible due to the lack of coordination across storage layers.  Its availability will significantly enhance personal privacy.  TrueErase also illustrates that cross-layer coordination can be achieved with a simple design.\n\n \n\nTrueErase has attracted media attention and collaboration opportunities.   Invited talks have been given at the University of Iowa, to the FSU Board of Trustees, to the FSU Criminology Department, and to the 8th International Workshop on Operating System Support for Next Generation Large Scale NVRAM.  TrueErase has been featured on the front page of Tallahassee Democrat, FSU Research in Review Magazine, and FSU Headlines.  The Florida Cybersecurity Institute is interested in how the tags framework can help track abnormal behaviors in the system.  \n\n \n\nIntellectual merit:  \n\n \n\nCurrent storage infrastructure is structured in layers to ease extensions and independent developments; however, cross-layer coordination becomes more difficult as assumptions made by individual layers cannot be easily propagated due to issues such as timing, ordering, and mapping of storage requests. \n\n \n\nVia the use of the tags primitives, we demonstrated through TrueErase that cross-layer coordination is possible, and can enable new important capabilities.  We also have demonstrated that coordinating across layers mainly involves handling versions of in-transit data, preserving their representations in implementation-portable manners, and recovering from crashes correctly.  \n\n \n\nBroader impacts:\n\n \n\nThrough applying tags in TrueErase, we have gained a deeper understanding of the interactions across storage layers.  Our findings have stirred interest from the digital forensic community in terms of how to retrieve information left behind.  TrueErase will significantly improve personal privacy in digital storage.\n\n \n\nThe tags project involves the training of six doctoral research assistants, thirteen graduate research volunteers, one undergraduate honors thesis student, and two undergraduate research assistants.
