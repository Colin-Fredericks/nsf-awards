 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PI will develop theoretical models that explain existing experimental observations and generate falsifiable quantitative hypotheses that could guide new experiments with the long term goal of defining the mechanisms of size and shape determination in specific model systems. Although the ideas and methods will be general, the project will focus on the development of Drosophila imaginal discs - the larval precursors of adult limbs and organs - where extensive experimentally acquired knowledge is available. Specifically, the proposed project will: 1) Develop a model of mechanical interactions between cells in growing tissue and explore quantitative consequences of non-uniformity and anisotropy in cell growth and of variation in cell properties. 2) Define and solve the inverse problem for mechanical parameter determination for a disordered two-dimensional array of cells. 3) Develop a model of cell contact signaling mediated by proto-cadherins (cell-adhesion molecules) which have been implicated in cell polarity and regulation of growth in Drosophila imaginal discs. The project will involve collaborations with several experimental groups. The PI will use the infrastructure of the existing KITP sponsored local K-12 outreach program to organize science presentations by the graduate research assistants supported by the present application. These presentations for High School student audiences will focus on the exciting opportunities of interdisciplinary research, extending the existing physics-based program. The PI will also establish a cooperative internship that will bring students (working towards their MS-degree equivalent) from Latin America to KITP for six months of research on interdisciplinary problems under his mentorship.",
