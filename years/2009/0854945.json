The workshops will take place in Zakopane, Poland and in Hejnice, Czech Repulic.  They will take place in 2009 and 2010 and will be organized by Dr. Andrei Staniskevsky (University of Alabama), Dr. Yogesh Vohra (University of Alabama), Prof. Stanislaw Mitura (Technical University of Lodz, Poland), and Prof. Petr Louda (Technical University of Liberec, Czech Republic).  The purpose of the workshops is to provide a forum to discuss five major challenge areas in nanoscale diamond thin-film and particles materials.  They include: (i) microscopic understanding of the mechanisms of the nanocrystalline (NCD) films nucleation and growth; (ii) intrinsic stresses in NCD films; (iii) modification of the surface chemistry of both nanoscale diamond films and particles; (iv) control of aggregation phenomena and preparation of non-aggregated diamond nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution; and (v) control of diamond nanoparticle fluorescence.  Each workshop will bring together researchers from the U.S and Europe to evaluate current fundamental research and development challenges, knowledge gaps, and research needs.  Particular emphasis will be placed on educating students and junior researchers on the science of nanoscale materials and structures.  The participants will include 14 U.S. students and junior researchers from the University of Alabama and Alabama State University.   \r\n\r\nThe workshops will address key challenge areas in nanoscale diamond materials.  They will strengthen collaboration in nanoscale diamond materials between researchers in the U.S. and Europe by providing a forum for the researchers to coordinate and plan joint research and student training activities.  The workshops will enable U.S. undergraduate students, graduate students, and junior researchers to develop an international research network early in their careers.\r\n \r\n",
