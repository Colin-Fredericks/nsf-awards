 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will be used to support the participating scientists from the United States in a Synthetic Biology \"Sandpit\", which will be held at Airlie Conference Center in Warrenton, Virginia from March 29 through April 3, 2009. The field of Synthetic Biology is at a stage where many of its biological tools, analytical methods engineering technologies are being developed; however, much of its broad conceptual framework as well as its overarching goals, challenges and projects remain undefined. The purpose of this workshop is to assemble a group of life, physical and social scientists from the United States and Great Britain (selected from applications submitted to an open call for participants) whose interests and current work encompass the broad field of Synthetic Biology. By combining the diverse outlooks and expertise of these participants, the ultimate goal of the 5-day \"sandpit\" is to collectively identify the key challenges and questions facing researchers in Synthetic Biology, and to chart the major directions and potential funding areas of the field for the coming years. \r\nBroader impact \r\nThe sandpit activity is expected to foster international and interdisciplinary collaborations within this emerging area of scientific endeavor. The creation of opportunities for interfacing the social sciences with core areas of biology, engineering and the math and physical sciences will be an especially important aspect of this activity.",
