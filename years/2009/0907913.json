The project focuses\r\non two well-known partial differential equations modeling\r\ngeophysical fluids: the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation\r\nand the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations.  The major\r\nobjective is to develop strategies and effective approaches for\r\nsolving the global regularity problem on the classical solutions\r\nof these equations.  The global regularity issue concerning these\r\nequations has recently attracted substantial attention and much\r\nimportant progress has been made.  However, it remains open in\r\nthe cases of the inviscid SQG equation, the SQG equation with\r\nsupercritical dissipation, and the inviscid Boussinesq equations. \r\nTo deal with the inviscid or supercritical SQG equation, the\r\ninvestigator combines extensive numerical computations with\r\nanalytic and geometric approaches.  The immediate plan is to\r\nstudy the curvature of the level curves in the spatial regions\r\nwhere the gradients are comparable to the maximal gradient.  The\r\nboundedness of the curvature in these regions would rule out any\r\nfinite-time singularities.  The strategy on the global regularity\r\nissue for the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations is to\r\ngradually reduce the dissipation and thermal diffusion.  The\r\nfirst aim is at the case when there is only vertical dissipation\r\nor thermal diffusion.  In contrast to the recently resolved case\r\nwith horizontal dissipation or thermal diffusion, the situation\r\nnow is more sophisticated due to the \"mismatch\" of derivatives. \r\nTo handle this case, new tools such as logarithmic type\r\ninequalities involving Sobolev norms of derivatives in different\r\ndirections are developed. \r\n\r\n     The three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic equations derived by\r\nJ. G. Charney in the 1940s have been very successful in modeling\r\nlarge-scale motions of atmosphere and oceans.  The dynamics of\r\nthese three-dimensional equations with uniform potential\r\nvorticity reduces to the SQG equation.  The SQG equation has been\r\nvery useful in studying many weather phenomena such as\r\nfrontogenesis, the formation of sharp fronts between hot and cold\r\nair.  Mathematically, frontogenesis corresponds to the\r\nfundamental issue of whether classical solutions of this equation\r\ncan develop finite-time singularities.  This project helps\r\nimprove the understanding of many weather phenomena governed by\r\nthis equation.  Boussinesq equations model many flows in nature\r\nsuch as oceanic circulation, central heating and natural\r\nventilation.  The study here of the potentially singular behavior\r\nof solutions to the Boussinesq equations not only yields a\r\nsignificant contribution to the mathematical issue of global\r\nregularity but also has potential environmental applications.  As\r\npart of this project, several Ph.D. students of the investigator\r\nare actively involved in the proposed research and develop\r\nanalytic and computational skills that enable them to become\r\ncapable scholars and highly skilled workforce. \r\n",
