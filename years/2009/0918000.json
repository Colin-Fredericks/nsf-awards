 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid offspring are often sterile, and the genetic causes of this reproductive isolation provide clues about how new species originate.  This project will use the house mouse to study the genetics and evolution of hybrid sterility.  House mouse species are relatively young, making it possible to understand the genetics of an important reproductive barrier at an early stage in the speciation process.  Genetic mapping will be used to identify regions of the genome that cause hybrid male sterility between species of house mice.  The rate at which DNA is exchanged across natural hybrid zones will be measured to test the prediction that the hybrid sterility regions cause species to remain distinct. The evolutionary relationships of house mouse species will be reconstructed using new genome sequences and statistical tools.\r\n\r\nThis research will advance understanding of the genetic basis of speciation and fertility.  This work will set the stage for identifying specific genes involved in speciation using the powerful resources that are available for house mice.  Many of the same genes affect fertility in mice and humans, so results from this project could point to genes that contribute to male infertility in humans. Two post-doctoral researchers will be trained through participation in this project. Additionally, information from the project will be incorporated to develop an internet tutorial on the process of speciation that will be distributed for use by high school biology teachers.  \r\n",
