 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this CAREER program are to understand and engineer opto-mechanical interaction at the nano-scale, to realize devices and systems that are capable of directly converting optical energy into mechanical motion, and to develop reconfigurable optical devices that combine nanophotonics with NEMS.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits include development of novel reconfigurable nanoscale opto-mechanical systems whose optical properties can be controlled by changing their mechanical configuration, using electrical or optical control signals. The latter will be achieved using the optical binding/anti-binding and/or radiation pressure. The discoveries made within the scope of this CAREER program will have an impact on different disciplines and find applications in telecom, life sciences and quantum information/communication. Examples include reconfigurable interconnects, tunable lasers, frequency up- and down- converters, novel sensors that combine mass sensing and optical spectroscopy, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the work lie in education and outreach. The interdisciplinary nature of this CAREER program will provide powerful and unique educational opportunities for students at all levels. Undergraduates, and under-represented minorities in particular, will be involved through PI's participation in Research Experience for Undergrads program. PI will prepare lectures designed to reach a large public audience through presentations at the Museum of Science at Boston. Much larger audience will be engaged via youtube.com where podcasts of public lectures and various laboratory experiments will be available. The PI will also bring his expertise to ongoing Harvard outreach programs and engage the business-oriented public such as the Harvard Industrial Outreach Program",
