 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop stable and optimal compressible magneto-rheological fluids (CMRFs) and to perform device tests on such fluids to demonstrate their durability. The production of stable and durable CMRFs will be achieved by using an inexpensive chemical process. The primary goal of the project is to develop and examine a feasible fluid combining characteristics of both field controllable fluids and compressible fluids for automatically adjustable strut/damper applications. The project will develop a novel fluid by incorporating different base materials, which can produce higher compressibility while retaining a controllable damping effect. These fluids, when used in a damper (or a shock absorber) for the suspension system of land vehicles, will be able to simultaneously provide controllable damping and spring effects.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of successfully developing compressible fluids for the use in vehicle suspension systems, especially for medium/heavy vehicles to reduce weight, increase mobility, enhance controllability of the vehicle's motion to prevent roll over in rough terrains and during emergency maneuvers. This project will have wide applications from commercial and private sector to military, for medium/heavy commercial vehicles such as, buses, coaches, trailers, off-highway, and tracked vehicles.\r\n\r\n",
