Topics include Biophysics of Viruses, Directed Assembly of Biopolymers, Biologically Inspired Materials Science, Collective Effects in Soft Matter, Cooperative Effects in Bacteria, Genetic Regulation and Evolution, Biophysics of Lipids and Polymers, Motors and Forces in Biology, and Self-Organization and Self-Assembly.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The Conference will bring together scientists from the soft matter and materials communities to encourage interdisciplinary discussion of issues of mutual interest.  The organizers have given appropriate attention to the application of NSF funding to broadening participation, with a significant number of females included among the speakers and session chairs.  More than 25% of the total proposed budget for the Conference is devoted to supporting participation by students, postdoctorals, and early career faculty.  Female applicants and applicants from underrepresented groups will be targeted for use of these earmarked funds.\r\n",
