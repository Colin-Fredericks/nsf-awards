 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will encourage the participation of U.S. researchers in the 59th General Assembly of the CIRP, the International Academy for Production Engineering, in Boston in August of 2009.  The CIRP is the premier global organization for promoting international research discussion and collaboration for production, or manufacturing engineering.   Founded in 1951, the CIRP covers a broad spectrum of essential production engineering disciplines, including details of manufacturing processes, and the dynamics of production organizations.  At the General Assembly in Boston about 500 leaders from about 35 countries will participate in the presentation of papers on current research, in-depth discussion of current research issues, sharing recent developments in their laboratories, and planning for joint research.  The award provides support for at least fifteen women and underrepresented minorities participation and young scholars and graduate students from U.S. institutions to attend and participate in the General Assembly in Boston.   These minorities, women and young researchers will interact with many of the best manufacturing researchers in the world, giving them direct exposure to some of the most interesting and important production engineering research projects and laboratories internationally.  This will promote the understanding of and participation in research in production engineering among a broader group of minorities, women and young researchers than would otherwise be possible.",
