 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nCentroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) are special Voronoi tessellations having the property\r\nthat the generators of the Voronoi tessellations are also the centroids, with respect to a \r\ngiven density function, of the corresponding Voronoi cells. In this project, we will continue \r\nto investigate algorithms for computing CVTs and CVT-based applications for scientific \r\nand engineering problems. Topics of the proposed project include: study of single limit-point \r\nconvergence analysis for the Lloyd's algorithm; development and analysis of nonlinear \r\nconjugate gradient methods for computing CVTs; study and implementation of parallel CVT/CVDT \r\nmesh generation on the distributed systems; improving existing CCVT-based techniques for \r\nsurface meshing; incorporating these meshing schemes in adaptive solutions of partial \r\ndifferential equations, especially for the convection-dominated problems; and further \r\ninvestigation and improvement of the edge-weighted CVT model and corresponding algorithms for \r\nimage segmentation that combines the intensity information in the color space of the image \r\nand the local edge information in the physical space.\r\n \r\nCVT-based methodologies have been proven to be very useful in diverse applications in the past \r\ndecade, including but not limited to, image processing, vector quantization and data \r\nanalysis, resource optimization, optimal placement of sensors and actuators for control, cell \r\nbiology and territorial behavior of animals, high-quality point sampling, mesh generation and \r\noptimization, numerical partial differential equations, climate and atmospheric science, \r\nmodel reduction, computer graphics and vision, mobile sensing networks, logistics system \r\ndesign, and etc. The application list is still growing. The proposed project has a \r\ncomprehensive coverage of algorithm design and analysis, implementation and applications of \r\nCVTs to diverse problems in science and engineering. Mathematical tools are used to analyze \r\nthese techniques to give guidelines for their applicability; practical considerations \r\nincluding parallel implementation issues are addressed to make the algorithms competitive in \r\nreal applications and large scale computations. The proposed investigation will offer new \r\ninsight into the  understanding of the elegant Lloyd's algorithm and it will also lead to \r\nexploration of transformative concepts and renovation of computational algorithms for many \r\nimportant applications involving mesh optimization, adaptive algorithms, energy minimization\r\nand image processing based on the CVT methodologies. In addition, this project will also offer \r\na unique educational opportunity for graduate students with interests in computational and \r\napplied mathematics, engineering and information technology by having them participate in an \r\ninterdisciplinary research program.",
