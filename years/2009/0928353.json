 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop a new lithographic technique called dynamic maskless holographic lithography (DMHL) that achieves maskless lithography by combining holograms and spatial light modulators with photolithography to produce patterns in two and three dimensions.  This is a new paradigm in photolithography.   Significantly, this process does not require a mask, eliminating a manufacturing step.  It provides an approach to micro (and eventually nano) lithography that, if successful, will have low operating costs, low capital investment, and would be flexible in process.     The application of holograms to photolithography gives the opportunity to produce patterns in three dimensions, and controlling this using a computer provides flexibility and the ability to manipulate light in real-time, something that cannot be done with fixed masks.  \r\n\r\nThe high cost of mask-sets puts conventional lithography out of range for many users; as such, a maskless approach to lithography that is flexible is desirable.  An ideal lithography technique would include low operating and capital cost, high fidelity, flexibility in process and materials, ability to pattern on near- or non-planar surfaces, and the ability to manufacture in three dimensions.  The DMHL process developed in this research meets many of these criteria.  DMHL provides new opportunities for education in optics, microscopy, nanosystems, and lithography.  There is a potential future  tie-in with an RET program at the University of Pittsburgh,  which will bring MEMS engineering and microfabrication to high school teachers, benefiting students in the science and math classroom.\r\n",
