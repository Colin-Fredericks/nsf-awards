Assaad\r\nDeborah Levison\r\nRobert E McCaa\r\nMatthew J Sobek\r\nUniversity of Minnesota\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project continues to build, enrich, and freely disseminate a global microdata resource of unprecedented scale and scope. The International Integrated Microdata Series (IPUMS-International) is creating fundamental infrastructure for scientific research, education, and policy-making. The project has produced the world's largest population database, with information describing 263 million persons drawn from 111 censuses of 35 countries between 1960 and 2005. The next project phase will dramatically expand the geographic and chronological coverage of the database, continue to preserve data, and disseminate the data to users around the world. There are four major activities: \r\n\r\n\t(1) Data acquisition and long-run preservation. The project will obtain and preserve the newest data from the 2010 round of censuses and the oldest data from the 1960s through the 1980s, most of which exist only on deteriorating magnetic tapes. \r\n\t(2) Data cleaning and processing. Before data can be released, it is necessary to draw samples, correct errors, apply confidentiality edits as needed, and make the data interoperable. \r\n\t(3) Documentation. Comprehensive documentation is essential to provide guidance to users on the meaning of census responses and their comparability across time and space. \r\n\t(4) Dissemination. The project will improve the web-based dissemination system, implement online data analysis and collaboration software, and conduct a program of education and dissemination activities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. Richly detailed population data spanning the globe over multiple decades are indispensable for creating the next generation of demographic, economic, and environmental models. IPUMS-International data have already stimulated new research that transcends national boundaries and static interpretation. To keep the database a cutting-edge source of information, the project will add the latest material from the 2010 census rounds, process data from additional countries, and recover data at risk of destruction. By doubling the scope of the database to 250 censuses the next project phase will leverage the NSF's previous investment and make IPUMS-International an even more powerful resource for understanding the causes and consequences of the sweeping transformations of the human population that are reshaping the planet. \r\n\r\nThis project will create a transnational resource of unprecedented power for understanding human society on a global scale. This infrastructure will multiply the quality, quantity, accessibility, and interoperability of information about the changing human population. By freely disseminating the data, the project will enhance scientific understanding of critical policy-related issues, such as population aging, international migration, climate change, and the effects of government programs on economic development and well-being. The project promotes teaching, training, and learning through three mechanisms. First, the project develops new tools for online data analysis for sharing curricular materials for teaching at all levels, bringing the excitement of discovery into the classroom. Second, it will conduct training workshops and develop online training modules to provide direct instruction in use of the data. Third, the project will employ a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate research assistants' including members of underrepresented groups'who will develop valuable new skills in a stimulating interdisciplinary environment",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIPUMS-International is the world's largest census database.  Censuses are the foundation of national statistical systems.  They are the only source that covers everyone in a country, and they are collected at great expense around the world because of the invaluable information they contain.  Despite the cost and effort involved in taking censuses, only a fraction of their potential is typically realized through the formal publication of selected results.  Once those tables are released to the public, the underlying data often go unused and are often eventually lost as manuscripts are disposed of and electronic files are deleted or become corrupted over time.  Even when the data are preserved, most countries have no plan for making them available for research.  Thus, much of the population history of the world is inaccessible and will eventually disappear, with only a handful of published tables to record the passage of millions of people through the societies in which they lived.\n\n \n\nThe IPUMS project aims to rectify this unnecessary and wasteful situation.  The project's goals are to preserve census data from around the world and make them accessible to researchers everywhere at no cost.  IPUMS has reached agreements with over 100 countries that entrust their national census data to the project and allow them to be disseminated publicly over the web.  Importantly, the data are not summary tables but are the records of individual people, recording all their separate responses to each census question.  Over 600 million people from 277 censuses are in the collection.  Using these individual records researchers are able to tabulate the data in whatever ways they wish, exploring questions that were never envisioned when the censuses were taken.  And they can develop sophisticated models of human behavior that take into account all of a person's characteristics and those of the people with whom they lived. \n\n \n\nTo make these detailed data suitable for public dissemination, steps must be taken to prevent the identification of any individuals.  The strongest protections include the absence of names and addresses, removing variables that identify small geographic places, and drawing only a sample of the full population for distribution.  Researchers must also register and agree to abide by a number of conditions of use.  What is remarkable has been the agreement of over 100 countries on a single user license that grants full access to the entire global database.  There is no charge to access the data.\n\n \n\nIPUMS not only preserves the data but it makes them more usable.  Variables are coded consistently across all countries and time periods, enabling comparisons across time and space.  The documentation is also harmonized for each variable, with the original languages translated into English.  The documentation browsing system allows researchers to see at a glance how a particular census question was worded across all countries.  Even subtle differences can be important for particular analyses, and the goal is to make it easy for users to determine for themselves whether that is the case for their own research problem.  Because no one needs or can handle the full database, the web system allows users to select only the variables they need from the specific censuses of interest to them.  The system builds this dataset for the user who downloads it onto their desktop to analyze using the tools most familiar to them.\n\n \n\nCensus data contain a wealth of information and have myriad uses in fields such as sociology, economics, and demography, and they have many applications for informing public policy.  Censuses always contain basic demographic data on each person, such as age, sex, and marital status.  They also regularly include questions on work, education, migration, ethnicity, and fertility.  They are the best source of data we have to study the likely impact of an aging world population in the decades ahead.  Censuses are also ideal f..."
