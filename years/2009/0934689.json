 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-resolution scanning magnetic microscopy maps of natural remanent magnetic fields have the potential to extend standard paleomagnetic techniques like fold and conglomerate tests, paleointensity analyses, and magnetic mineralogy studies to submillimeter scales. However, unlike bulk moment magnetometry, there is no suitable method for directly measuring magnetization at such scales.  Rather, inversion techniques must be developed to retrieve magnetization from the magnetic field data.  In this research project, we will develop mathematical techniques and algorithms to constrain the magnetization distribution within the sample from magnetic field maps of geological thin sections. We will also establish the limitations of magnetic data under these experimental conditions.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRocks record invaluable information about past magnetic fields present at the time they formed. Analysis of these data has revealed important information regarding the evolution of the Earth and solar system. Scanning magnetic microscopy is a new technique that maps remanent magnetic fields of rocks with high spatial resolution and high sensitivity.  However, the field maps obtained are only indirectly related to the recorded ancient field, and a set of techniques and algorithms is necessary to extract the pertinent information from the measurements. In this research project, we will develop mathematical methods to analyze high-resolution magnetic data from geological samples.  These techniques will be ultimately be used to understand the history of Earth's magnetic field, the past positions of continents, and the evolution of the Earth's core and interior",
