 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Daniel A. Scherson of Case Western Reserve University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the mechanism of heterogeneous redox reactions associated with the reduction and oxidation of nitrogen and sulfur oxides and their oxyanions in aqueous electrolytes, as well as other redox active species of relevance to energy conversion and electrosynthesis. Special focus is on the in situ static and dynamic characterization of irreversibly adsorbed electrocatalysts for these reactions, as well as the effect of the microtopography of selected bare and atom-modified single crystal metal surfaces on the nature of adsorbed intermediates and other interfacial properties. Insight into these issues will be gained from coupling of microelectrodes, charge injection, and an array of complementary microscope-based spectroscopic techniques, including UV visible reflection spectroscopy, resonance and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopies and second harmonic generation. The success of this work would provide a means for extending in situ spectroelectrochemical techniques into the nanosecond range, allowing the study of the dynamic aspects of electron transfer events of relevance to a variety of other fields, including electrocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion, sensors, and environmental science. Students involved in this research will be trained in a broad range of fundamental and applied disciplines, and will be exposed to an international research experience at the Central Electrochemical Research Institute in India.",
