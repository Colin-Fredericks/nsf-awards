 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Missouri at Kansas City received a grant to build an imaging database management and analysis system that can integrate multiscale and multimodality structural genomic information with microarray gene expression for comprehensive and integrative analysis of a biological system. It is widely recognized that microarray imaging is limited by its poor reproducibility and accuracy. Recent progress in high resolution genomic probe development along with advanced image analysis techniques provides complimentary information to microarray gene expression. The project team will develop image processing and signal analysis algorithms to extract visual quantitative traits and structural genomic signatures from the results of high resolution genomic imaging techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging and microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). These quantitative structural signatures will then correlate with microarray gene expression patterns. Finally, this multiscale structural/functional information will be integrated for an improved characterization of biological systems. The anticipated results will include a publicly accessible genomic imaging database analysis system in the life sciences community that will allow a biologist to answer the following ambitious and significant questions: \"How chromosomal rearrangements (molecular karyotype) cause visual differences (phenotype); how they are correlated with gene expression patterns (genotype); and furthermore, how the integrated approach can lead to an improved characterization of a biological system?\" The impact of this project will be further expanded by partnering with industries, outreach to minority and high school students, and by developing innovative bioimaging curricula.
