 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Kenneth J. Caulton for the synthesis, characterization and reactivity testing of strong chemical bonds (multiple bonds and unreactive bonds).  The strategy is to build high kinetic and thermodynamic reactivity into transition metal complexes while leaving metal orbitals unused and suited to attach and modify small substrate molecules.  The target molecules violate textbook principles by having radical character, and thus fall outside the predictive capacity of current thinking.  The far reaching implications of the research include: 1) the possible increase in control of normally unselective radical reactions, 2) the ability to make molecules capable of reacting with even the most inert of substrates: alkanes, N2O, CO2 and fluorocarbons, and 3) the pioneering access to unusual metal oxidation states and unusual electron transfer reactions.  In general, the studies impact chemical catalysis with regard to fewer by-products, greater synthetic control and decreased energy consumption.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nChemical catalysis today involves making reactions go faster and with fewer undesirables byproducts, and all at lowest energy cost of production.  Our approach is to study catalysis in solution, not on a bed of solid particles, with eye towards discovery of new principles of chemical reactivity that we can apply to catalyst discovery:  making or breaking of a chemical bond which involves minimal energy cost is one that is efficient, and that is the one-word benefit that catalysis offers. Our choice of solution phase studies enables exceptionally detailed study of the underlying chemical reactions, hence best chance for human control and improvement. \n\nWe explore new concepts in chemical reactivity that can lead to discovery of new bond breaking reactions.  One concept is the facile production of catalysts which readily bind to themselves a molecular substrate that we need to transform.  Our special target is to do this with metals that are abundantly available within the US or North America, with the result of giving the US strategic independence of imported metals, and also low cost.  This results in our conversion of catalysis from expensive, imported rhodium or iridium or osmium to \"earth-abundant\" iron, or cobalt or nickel.  The next needed step is to promote electron flow within the catalyst/substrate composite, and we do this be thoughtful design of catalyst component, or ancillary, to serve as a temporary storage site for electrons.  Our design approach incorporates cyclic chemical components which readily accept electrons (useful for reductive transformations) or are themselves electron rich, hence most appropriate for oxidative catalysis.   The design of these allows for rational and systematic change of performance, which is the key to optimization of catalyst performance.  Finally, our catalysts must be robust to the extent that they can perform millions of cycles of activity before failure, due to degradative competitive side reactions.  Thus, catalyst design is a central feature of our planning and also systematic performance improvement.  Our work uses a variety of experimental spectroscopic techniques to establish details of catalyst performance, but also high performance computational studies of catalytic reaction mechanism, which we use to identify imperfections in current experimental execution, and design improvements, which we then test; this computational guidance of experimental work is a holy grail of our science, and has potential for high impact on how our entire field progresses.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth G Caulton"
