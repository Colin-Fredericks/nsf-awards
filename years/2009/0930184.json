 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society for Neuroscience (SfN) will implement an ADVANCE PAID project that focuses on enhancing opportunities for women in the neuroscience disciplines by targeting department chairs.  The overall and long-term goal of this project is to increase the number of women, including underrepresented minority (URM) women, among faculty in neuroscience. This will be accomplished by effecting change in behavior and practice related to recruitment, promotion and work climate for women within academic neuroscience and neuroscience-related departments. The detailed project strategy will allow SfN to reach up to 300 department chairs and to influence over 50 institutions. Specifically, the SfN PAID project will involve: a training intervention in the form of eight regional interactive workshops; development of institution-level implementation plans; ongoing support to participants through peer-to-peer interaction and online resources; and dissemination of lessons learned and best practices. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The SfN ADVANCE PAID project will utilize workshop materials from the University of Michigan, University of Arizona, and University of Washington. Each of these institutions developed ADVANCE resources that have been proven to improve recruitment, promotion and work climate for women faculty. At the macro level, by effecting change, the current project will allow women to arrive and thrive in the highest levels of neuroscience where their contributions can be realized to the fullest. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. This project is expected to have broader impact beyond the immediate project participants as a result of: 1) the project's design (multi-level training and support activities); 2) the interdisciplinary nature of the field of neuroscience which reaches across multiple STEM academic departments and programs; and 3) the role of SfN as the premier association for the profession. The project's support for workshops will help disseminate information broadly at the institutional level. The best practices and lessons learned identified through the project will be directly applicable to neuroscience and other neuroscience-related departments, and SfN is ideally suited to disseminate this information through its multiple communication resources (journal, member newsletters, annual meeting, Web site, etc.) and partners. This transferability is unique to the field of neuroscience and will ultimately make the lessons learned and best practices sustainable beyond NSF funding.\r\n\r\nSfN will monitor and evaluate progress toward project objectives using formative and summative evaluations. The lessons learned from this project will be compiled and disseminated at a best practices meeting to be held as a wrap-up activity in the final project year. This activity will ensure that best practices are shared across academia in neuroscience and related fields and are applied to SfN's continuation of the project beyond the grant period.",
