 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to improve residential photovoltaic installations with switched-capacitor power converters.  The approach considers a system topology in which each panel is connected to a high-voltage-gain switched-capacitor converter, whose outputs are paralleled.  This approach will increase the total array output power and improve system reliability.  Conventional photovoltaic installations use several panels in series to achieve high voltage, whereas this project uses parallel connections.  Also, new analysis tools for switched-capacitor converters and parallel arrays will be derived.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project pertains to the comparative study of parallel- and series-connected photovoltaic arrays, detailed performance modeling and improvement of switched-capacitor converters, and the combination of switched-capacitor converters with photovoltaic arrays for improved performance and reliability.  Parallel-connected photovoltaic arrays have a greater performance potential than series-connected arrays and switched-capacitor converters are capable of high-efficiency power conversion with high voltage gain.  This project will combine the two concepts to increase array power output by 39% or more in partially shaded conditions.\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe broader impacts of this project are the potential for greatly increased solar energy generation, a significant undergraduate research program, and broad dissemination in both non-technical and interdisciplinary venues.  Undergraduate researchers will be involved in every step of the project.  The recruitment strategy will emphasize attracting women and minorities to the research program.  The results will be published in interdisciplinary journals that address all aspects of solar energy.  The research results will be synthesized and published in a form and forum suitable for non-specialists and non-engineers.\r\n",
