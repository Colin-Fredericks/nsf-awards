Astronomy is a fully international endeavor, and the attendance of U.S. astronomers at scientific meetings worldwide is critical to their continued activity in the field.  The AAS will receive applications for travel support, appoint a committee to review applications and make award decisions, and distribute travel funds.  The program makes particular effort to provide travel funds for early career astronomers and those from smaller or less-endowed institutions.   During 2009, the year of the 27th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the program will accommodate a larger number of grants, considered separately from normal scientific meetings, to enable a strong U.S. presence.  \r\n",
