 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ACL2 theorem prover has an established user community in industry,\r\ngovernment, and academia.  ACL2 supports industrial-scale verification\r\nprojects by combining automation and controllability, but its\r\nextensibility is limited: its large (10 MB), complex code base\r\nrequires, for soundness, that it be entrusted solely to its two\r\nauthors.  The PIs propose to modify ACL2 radically, opening up the\r\nsystem by making it more modular, thus enabling trusted development by\r\nuntrusted users while maintaining proof security.  Key challenges are\r\nto expose the functionality of system components, and to separate out\r\na trusted core from code that need not be trusted for correct\r\nfunctionality, such as code implementing heuristics, I/O, theory\r\nmanagement, and interactive proof development and debugging.  Code\r\nrefactoring is already a hard problem, especially for a system with\r\nthe complexity of ACL2, but in this project there is also the\r\nchallenge of making the resulting system modifiable in a way that does\r\nnot compromise logical soundness.\r\n\r\nExpected results include an ACL2 system that can be modified soundly\r\nby users according to specific needs.  In particular, research on\r\nteasing apart inherently sequential output from reasoning code should\r\nsupport research on parallel reasoning algorithms taking advantage of\r\nmodern multi-core machines, leading to formally verified parallel\r\nimplementations.  More generally, the system will provide a platform\r\nthat promotes research in heuristics for automating reasoning.  It\r\nwill also facilitate the customization of ACL2 for use in the\r\nundergraduate classroom.  The resulting system will be freely\r\ndistributed on the Internet.",
