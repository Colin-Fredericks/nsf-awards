This ultracold-atomic physics project focuses on the implementation of quantum spin-1/2 systems using arrays of coupled two-state atoms in an optical lattice with tunable parameters.  The main goal of the project is an investigation of equilibrium phases and spin dynamics in this atomic system, based on the development of a tool for the preparation of arbitrary initial spin configurations. The project will be carried out with a Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium-87 atoms.\r\n \r\nThe realization of quantum spin systems with precisely controllable parameters can be expected to have broad scientific and technological impact. The project will advance the state of the art in the manipulation of strongly correlated quantum gases, and it will also provide scientific and technical training to both graduate and undergraduate students who will gain proficiency in the enabling technologies of lasers and optics, ultrahigh vacuum, and electronics. In conjunction with the project, the PI is developing a graduate-level course on ultracold quantum gases which will include laboratory visits and demonstrations.\r\n",
