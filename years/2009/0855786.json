The lead of the proposed Center will be Temple University (TU) with site locations at the University of Arizona (UA) and Arizona State University (ASU). The objective of the proposed Center is to advance the knowledge and understand the effects of emerging contaminants on water quality. Emerging contaminants generally refer to pharmaceuticals, personal care products, as well as pathogens detected in the source water environment; thereby posing a potential or real threat to human health or the environment. The proposed research aims at developing technologies to detect, understand, mitigate and/or control emerging contaminants in the environment as well as other traditional contaminants that can adversely impact water quality. Center engineers and environmental scientists using microbial, chemical, hydrologic and mathematical approaches will work collaboratively to conduct this research. \r\n\r\nThe Center and its research activities will involve faculty, undergraduate and graduate students and industrial representatives; and the industrial-focused research program will enhance the scientific understanding and help address a potentially significant health and environmental problem. Many of the companies of the proposed Center have overseas installations; thus, students will be exposed to regulatory, social and cultural aspects of different countries, enhancing their global experiences. All three institutions plan to engage K-12 students and teachers, and will enhance the ongoing efforts of integrating research in classroom teaching. WET has a strong diversity plan that ensures the participation of underrepresented groups in all levels of the Center. The Center plans to publish results in various publications as well as present at Conferences. \r\n \r\n",

This Center has focused on water quality and technology research utilizing state-of-the-art methods.   The participating Universities are: Temple University (lead), University of Arizona and Arizona State University.  There are also 33 supporting member organizations from industry and the private and public sectors. The mission of the WET Center is to develop technologies to detect, understand, mitigate and/or control contaminants, including emerging contaminants (ECs), in the environment that can adversely impact potable and reclaimed water quality.   The vision of the WET Center is to minimize any adverse effects of these contaminants on human health and/or environmental health.  Funding for the WET Center has exceeded $9M, and has come from: the NSF, industry membership fees, state funds, and other industrial and federal funds.\n\n The WET Center focuses on industry relevant research.  Member organizations assist in developing a technology roadmap, which documents the key research needs on which the WET Center will focus.  All potential research projects are evaluated against this technology roadmap, which groups research into three main categories:  analytical technology; risk  assessment and life cycle analysis; and water purification technology.  The WET Center researchers have given over 120 scientific presentations and published over 60 peer review journal articles.  The WET Center has also helped to train and develop the next generation of environmental engineers and scientists including: 40+ graduate students and 30+ undergraduate students.\n\n\nAnalytical:\n\nDifferent analytical procedures can produce variable environmental data for ECs.  For example, use of solid phase verses liquid &ndash;liquid extraction, sample handling procedures, and the type of analytical instrument used can cause variable results.  The Center has developed robust analytical methods for ECs that are accurate, reliable and reproducible, and which can be followed by commercial, research, and utility laboratories.  The technology roadmap calls out for the need for new analytical procedures that will detect and quantify: i) nanomaterials, which are seeing exponential growth in commercial products; ii) emerging chemical contaminants; and iii) emerging microbial pathogens such as Ebola.\n\nPublished literature is replete with conflicting reports on the disinfection capability of various types of nanomaterial. The Center performed a thorough comparison of documented procedures to study the microbial disinfection efficacies of nanomaterials.  It was established that the most representative and reproducible results are obtained by constantly mixing nanomaterial with test microorganism under axial rotating mixing conditions  of 40 RPM. The method has been evaluated for broad range of microorganisms including indicators and pathogens.\n\nRisk Assessment and Life Cycle Analysis:\n\nThere are several hundred ECs of interest and more will be identified in the future.  To efficiently allocate resources, it is necessary to prioritize research.  The Center is prioritizing ECs to be studied based on:  exposure; potential risk to human health; and an environment and life cycle analysis. A database has been compiled from published literature and Center studies on exposure, risk, and treatability.  A subset of this category reflected in the technology roadmap is molecular detection of pathogens and quantitative risk assessment where the Center is studying human pathogens in a variety of environments including water, soil and municipal waste.  New analytical procedures are being developed to identify and quantify these pathogens and organics, allowing for better prioritization.   The technology roadmap also highlights EC degradation data and treatment technologies.  Rather than develo..."
