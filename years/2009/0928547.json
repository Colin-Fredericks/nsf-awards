 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental understanding of structural systems behavior under extreme earthquakes (EQs) is important for designing robust and resilient systems. Such extreme EQs can impose severe demands on structural systems and may result in components failure or complete building collapse. The research objective of this award is to mitigate socio-economic losses due to collapse of steel building systems when subjected to extreme earthquake events. This goal will be achieved through development of multi-scale computational simulation models that will provide a virtual platform for realistic simulation of collapse response of steel building systems. These models will incorporate micro-scale to structural scale physics including fracture, inelasticity, global and local buckling of structural members, and contact and impact between failed members. These novel physics-based multi-scale models will be used to characterize collapse behavior of building systems subjected to extreme seismic events including understanding of the characteristics of the seismic excitation that contribute to collapse vulnerability.\r\nThe research results will be utilized to mitigate risk of collapse by developing fundamental knowledge of collapse behavior leading to development of robust and resilient building systems. Research results will also assist in determining key system features that are critical to the stability and functioning of the entire system, and in development of next generation of performance based design guidelines. Collaborations between researchers and end users will be fostered to provide guidance to the project and to spearhead technology transfer of the results, advancing the state-of-the-practice. A community education program will also be developed as a part of this project to increase the understanding of impacts and consequences of building systems collapse and to enable movement from short term community awareness to long term community resiliency. Educational component of this project aims to produce future generations of leaders in multidisciplinary sciences and engineering through involvement of undergraduates in research and through K-12 classroom activities. \r\n",
