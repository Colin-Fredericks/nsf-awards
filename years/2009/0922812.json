 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to acquire, install, and maintain a near-field antenna test system at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) - Southern Methodist University (SMU) Antenna Characterization Lab for use by the UTD-SMU faculty and students for research, development, and class instruction in the area of antennas and wave propagation as well as by local industries in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The proposed 3-D scanner measurement system will facilitate the development of antennas for wireless communications, particularly cellular phone antennas, window-unit antennas for satellite-ground communication, and antennas for spatial and polarization diversities.  The antennas of cellular phones will have improved efficiency and produce substantially reduced harmful radiation to the user's head, while the window-unit antenna will be conveniently mounted flat over a window pane for satellite reception such as cable viewing.  The spatial and polarization diversity will increase the reliability of currently available wireless devices.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The UTD-SMU Antenna Characterization Lab expects three broad impacts from the acquisition of the facility on the academia and industry in wireless communications in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex: Research and development of antennas by the university faculty and students in terms of diagnosis and characterization; classroom instruction at both SMU and UTD for demonstration as well as training antenna engineers; and accessibility of the facility by the local industry.",
