 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nA user-friendly, electronic database will be developed to provide teachers, regulatory agencies, and researchers with easy access to a unique collection of fungi that cause plant diseases and wood decay The database will become available on the following website  <http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/plantpath/activities/labs-projects/myherb/>. The collection at North Carolina State University was established in 1970 and represents the most comprehensive assemblage of wood decay fungi in the southeastern United States. Fungi were collected from diverse, often unique habitats, identified with geographic locations recorded, and preserved for use by educators and scientists.\r\n\r\nInternet access to this valuable collection and the baseline of data it establishes will benefit state and federal regulatory agencies concerned with the introduction of invasive species of fungi that harm humans and plants. The collection may also lead to the identification of fungi that can be used to convert wood into bio-fuels, improve soil health, and serve as indicators of climate change. In addition to its use by the scientific and regulatory community, the database will also be an important resource for educating and training high school biology teachers, students, and the general public about the importance of fungi to society and for understanding their distribution and biodiversity in unique ecosystems.",
