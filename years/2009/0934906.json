 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\r\n\r\nThe UKanTeach Noyce Phase II Scholarship and Stipend Program is addressing the critical shortage of mathematics and science teachers in the region by developing a collaboration involving the University and high needs school districts. Ten scholarships are being awarded each year, for four years, with 32 different students supported by the UKanTeach Noyce Project.  Excellent program enrichment activities that include mentor-teacher support, Saturday and summer workshops, and a careful selection process is increasing the likelihood of a successful Noyce program.  The project's goal is a doubling of the number of talented secondary mathematics and science teachers prepared by the UKanTeach Program. The broader impact stems from the ability to recruit a formerly untapped pool of talent: students earning a degree in science and mathematics and a teaching license in four years.  The intellectual merit of the program lies in the highly qualified and experienced project personnel and in a robust and supportive induction program for Noyce Scholars. This project is advancing knowledge and understanding by exploring the success of creative recruitment, preparation and retention strategies for mathematics and science teachers. The Scholars are being prepared, through coursework and by early field experience teaching in high needs schools, to take positions in districts that have high numbers of economically disadvantaged students.",
