 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just as in human populations, individuals of a single species differ in traits that influence their survival in different environments. The genetic variation that underlies these trait differences may be especially important for exotic species that invade new areas, as populations without individuals that can tolerate the novel environment may not be able to establish and successfully reproduce. Similarly, individuals of native plants may differ in their ability to resist invasion or coexist with invaders because of genetic differences. The proposed research examines how the genetics of two plant species in California grasslands, one native and one exotic, affect the invasion success of the exotic species. Interactions between different genetic individuals of the two species will be examined in the presence and absence of insects that eat the plants to determine how environmental differences may also affect invasions by exotic plants. This project thus incorporates the relatively new field of community genetics (simultaneously examining genetic variation in multiple, co-occurring species) with invasion biology, and will provide important insights for related studies. \r\n\r\nA postdoctoral researcher, graduate student, and undergraduate students will be trained and mentored in this research. Curriculum focused on invasive species biology will be developed for a K-12 program based at the Kellogg Biological Station in Michigan. A more complete understanding of the invasion process may help prevent future invasions that may be both ecologically and economically costly and also may aid in ensuring the success of intentional introductions (e.g., for biological control or cultivation).",
