 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recursive Reconstruction of Sparse Signal Sequences\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on recursive algorithms for causally reconstructing a time sequence of (approximately) sparse signals from a small number of ``incoherent\" linear projections. The algorithms will be useful for real-time dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in interventional radiology applications such as image-guided surgery or in functional-MRI. \r\nMRI is currently not usable for such real-time applications due to its \"relatively slow image acquisition\" (large data acquisition times and/or slow image reconstruction algorithms). Other potential applications include dynamic tomography for solar imaging or real-time single-pixel video imaging.\r\n\r\nSince the recent introduction of compressive sensing (CS), the static version of the above problem has been thoroughly studied. But most existing algorithms for the dynamic problem just use CS to jointly reconstruct the entire time sequence in one go. This is a batch solution and has very high complexity. The alternative - CS at each time (simple\r\nCS) - requires many more measurements. This research is the first to develop and analyze recursive algorithms for signal sequence reconstruction, which have the same complexity as simple CS, but which (a) achieve exact reconstruction using much fewer noise-free measurements than those needed by simple CS; (b) achieve provably smaller reconstruction error than simple CS, when using noisy measurements, especially when the number of measurements is small; and (c) are provably stable over time (reconstruction error remains bounded). Fewer measurements means reduced scan times for MRI, while recursive reconstruction means real-time imaging is possible. By exploiting the fact that sparsity patterns change slowly over time, the problem is formulated as one of compressive sensing with partially known support.\r\n\r\nCS and sequential CS are incorporated into the graduate/undergraduate curriculum and into senior-design at appropriate levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
