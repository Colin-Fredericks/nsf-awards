 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Prof. Frank Bright of the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, and his group are studying the development of reagentless nanoscopic optical sensors for detecting and quantifying a wide variety of analytes.  The work addresses three main aims: (i) creation of molecularly imprinted sensors with silicon quantum dots in porous silicon material surfaces; (ii) elucidating the effects of imprinting/surface chemistry and nanoscopic feature size on analytical figures of merit; and (iii) assessing device applicability to a variety of small molecule and protein analytes.  The specific chemistry, techniques, methods and theoretical underpinnings developed in this research will provide a powerful platform for detecting small molecular targets and proteins in complex milieu.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the broader scientific impact of the research, the research will result in the training of female and underrepresented minority students and postdoctoral researchers in Prof. Bright's laboratories.  Prof. Bright and his postdoctoral and graduate student colleagues will also be participating in educational and outreach efforts at Buffalo's Native American Magnet School to provide meaningful educational opportunities for young American Indian students.",
