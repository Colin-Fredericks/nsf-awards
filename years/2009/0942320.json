 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 8th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC), held October 25-29, 2009 in Northern Virginia is the major international forum where the latest research results and technical innovations on all aspects of the Semantic Web are presented. This student travel support enables students who want to become part of the Semantic Web research community to participate in ISWC 2009. In particular, the ISWC Doctoral Consortium creates an opportunity for doctoral students to test their research ideas, present their current progress and future plans, and to receive constructive criticism and insights related to their future work and career perspectives. This is expected to be a significant event in the graduate students' careers.\r\n\r\nIn selecting applications for the ISWC 2009 Travel Support, preference is given to students selected to participate in the Doctoral Consortium, followed by students who are first author on a paper accepted at the conference, followed by students who have other authorship on a conference or related workshop paper, with an additional aim to broaden participation in computer science among the underrepresented students. ISWC details, including the Doctoral Symposium and Travel Support, can be found at the conference website (http://iswc2009.semanticweb.org).",
