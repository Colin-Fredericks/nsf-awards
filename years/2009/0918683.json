 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop new instructional materials for middle school science teachers that help create a compelling classroom culture of scientific discovery, engage students in the creative opportunities that abound in science, and inspire them to pursue the high school science coursework needed for future careers in science.  The materials will incorporate emerging and widely available technologies such as Google Earth to engage middle school students in exploring an essential science question, \"Does the Earth's structure affect you?\" The use of computer technologies has been shown to successfully motivate middle school students, and the use of an integrated Earth System Science approach provides the knowledge base, methodologies, and global context to make science accessible, relevant and meaningful for middle school students.  A complete learning unit and teacher's guide will be developed by a team of experts in K-12 curriculum design, geology, and geography, using a Learning-for-Use curriculum design framework. The materials will be tested for ease-of-use and effectiveness in approximately ten classrooms across Montana, which include both large and small class sizes, urban and rural communities, and white and Native American students. Participating teachers will provide feedback to help guide revision of the materials, which will subsequently be disseminated to the national K-12 community.",
