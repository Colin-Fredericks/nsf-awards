 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyber-violence is increasing exponentially as social networking applications such as Instant Messaging, Facebook, and MySpace are developed, deployed, and reach increasingly younger users. These young users frequently fall victim to cyber-predators and cyber-bullies.  To address this ongoing concern, this research project will study of the communicative strategies employed by both aggressors and victims in cases of online predation and cyber-bullying.  The primary outcome of this project is the development of theoretical communicative models and technology for the detection of online predation and cyber-bullying.  In addition to flagging aggressive communication and notifying parents, the open-source software developed with these funds will suggest appropriate responses so a teen or tween can immediately defend him or herself against an aggressor.  The response software will also subtly teach effective defense communication strategies that children can take into other situations (in the real or online world).   Existing data resources for research in this area are scant and problematic.  The data to be collected and disseminated as part of this project can be used to for future research in the development of theoretical communicative models of online predation and response, and of cyber-bullying communication and response.  A data set for research in resolving multiple Internet identities will also be created and distributed.     \r\n\t\r\nThis research project will bring together two fields, Computer Science and Media and Communication Studies, which have been dramatically impacted by the explosive growth of Internet social networking sites.  The study will build upon existing web-centered technologies and tools, as well as theories of communication that were developed by close analysis of other media forms, such as television and print media.  Existing machine learning algorithms will be enhanced by the development and integration of communicative theories that have been updated for online interactions.  The focus on cyber-violence, especially cyber-violence directed at children, supplies a socially relevant test-bed that has suffered from neglect by researchers in Computer Science, primarily due to the lack of standard data sets.  This project will provide collections of annotated data that will be used by other researchers in both fields.\r\n\r\n",
