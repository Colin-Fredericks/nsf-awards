 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pikes Peak Community College (PPCC) in partnership with industry and a high school district is creating and implementing a tiered internship program in geospatial technology (TIMSGeoTech). The project is aligning the educational practices with industry expectations in an effort to increase the enrollment of students and better define career pathways. The project is being informed by the SC ATE Center of Excellence and the National Geospatial Technology Center. SC ATE Center's successful internship, student recruitment, and industry consortium models are being adapted and implemented for this project. The TIMSGeoTech is advancing knowledge and understanding in many fields involving geospatial technology, geographic information systems and science aligning graduates and their skills with industry needs through tiered internship experiences. It is also facilitating communication among sectors (academic, industry, and government) to improve the relevance of coursework to today's geospatial applications. This is allowing resources of various organizations to be combined to provide valuable experiences for participants. Establishing paid internships and scholarships should develop this project into a self-sustaining program.  The Tiered Internship Model can be adapted by two- and four-year colleges preparing geospatial technicians as it creates a system for partnering with industry so that they can 'grow their own' future workforce by tapping students early in the educational process and grooming them for possible future employment with the company after graduation. TIMSGeoTech is bringing together a diverse group of industry stakeholders to create opportunities for partnerships and networking for students, educators, and professionals. TIMSGeoTech is enhancing the involvement of under-represented groups through outreach to workforce development offices by providing links to unemployed and underemployed individuals.",
