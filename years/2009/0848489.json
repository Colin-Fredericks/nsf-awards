 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of novel photolabile protecting groups (PPGs).  PPGs are indispensable tools in both basic and applied sciences.  However, simple and practically useful PPGs for some important functional groups are not yet available.  The goal of this project is to enrich the PPG toolbox with a series of structurally simple and mechanistically novel PPGs for carbonyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups, and to explore their synthetic applications.  Highly efficient green chemistry methods for PPG installation will also be pursued, along with mechanistic studies of relevant and interesting reactions.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Pengfei Wang of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  Professor Wang's research efforts are focused on the development of novel photolabile protecting groups and their applications.  Successful development of the new methodologies will have a positive impact on organic synthesis, drug delivery, photolithography, and biochemistry.\r\n",
