 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how animals navigate under water is not only fascinating in its own right, it also contributes to instrumentation designs of underwater vehicles, robots and surface vessels, impacts management of fisheries, and helps protect the marine environment.  Sharks have been chosen to demonstrate how they navigate.  While they can not detect a drop of blood a mile away, as often stated, sharks do have impressive prey tracking capabilities.  Sharks are important in fisheries worldwide and have been severely depleted in recent decades, often taken as unwanted by-catch in other fisheries.  Yet, they are essential top predators needed to maintaining a healthy ecosystem.  This research project will show how sharks use all their senses in hunting behavior, starting with initial prey detection, through tracking and locating, and ending with striking their prey.  For more complete understanding, we compare a few shark species that appear to use their senses differently mostly because they specialize in different prey in different habitats.  A team of experts in sensory and shark biology, using unique testing facilities in Massachusetts and Florida, has been assembled including graduate students being trained in the many technical approaches needed for work on live sharks.  The research directly involves undergraduate and high school students and provides extensive outreach to other students of all ages and to the public in general.  The accumulated knowledge should lead to a model of shark navigation and predation that can be used for the conservation of sharks, protection of humans, and the engineering design of underwater steering algorithms.  The inevitable presentation of this research in future television programs and video documentaries will disseminate new knowledge to the public at large, both of sharks and of rigorous science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow animals sense and locate their prey -- and  particularly how they use multiple senses like vision and smell to  integrate sensory information -- has long been a topic of interest to  the public as well as research scientists.  Although we have known  something about this for animals that live on land or in the air, our  knowledge of animals that live in the sea has been limited on this  subject.  To address this, we conducted research on one of the sea's  most well-adapted predators -- the shark.  Through a series of  experiments on live sharks in the laboratory, we challenged these  animals to show us how they detect, localize, get to, and feed on their  prey, and how they use their multiple senses together to accomplish  these tasks.\n \n We didn't just work on one type of shark but examined this question in  four different species:  the smooth dogfish, the nurse shark, the  blacktip shark and the bonnethead.  These four species have differing  behaviors and ecologies in that some are more bottom-dwelling while  others are more active swimmers in the water column.  The senses we  tested were vision and smell and two other senses that humans don't  have.  These other two are a sort of underwater sense of distant touch  mediated by a system called the lateral line, and also electroreception,  a sense that sharks have to detect weak electric fields surrounding  their prey.  By selectively blocking each sense one at a time, we were  able to see how sharks use their various senses for orienting to,  striking at, and capturing their prey.\n \n The results were fascinating.  Each species showed a different  preference for sensory information depending on their behavior and  ecology.  For example, in the blacktip shark vision was dominant, in the  nurse shark it was smell, and in the bonnethead it was  electroreception.  But they all took advantage of all their available  senses.  By blocking senses in different combinations, we found that  when some of the sharks' normal sensory cues were unavailable, they were  still capable of successfully detecting, tracking and capturing their  prey by switching to alternate sensory information.  This means that  sharks are adaptable in using whatever sensory information is available  to find their prey -- a good thing in a successful predator.\n \n Our research showed how sharks do this, and these findings can now be  studied and applied to the design of underwater robotic vehicles that  must navigate to some type of target.  So in the end, this research  taught us a lot about how sharks work, how the senses of animals are  integrated in performing complex tasks, and how we can apply this information to  engineer better tools for society's use.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert E Hueter"
