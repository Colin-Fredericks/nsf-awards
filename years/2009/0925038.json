 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomists study negotiation as a series of events, including partner choice, information gathering, and haggling. The context in which these negotiations occur--the market--is critical because individuals can adjust their demands in response to those of other players.  Animals are faced with similar decisions during reproduction: who to court, how to approach a potential partner, at what level to display compared to competitors and when to give up unsuccessful interactions.  Thus, economic models of negotiation in a market provide a framework in which courtship can be viewed as a process in which males and females use a series of tactics to improve their success. This project uses greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) as a model species to examine the importance of tactics used by males during courtship. A combination of experiments and detailed observations will be used, including robotic females to serve as experimental stimuli, multiple microphones and video cameras to record male signals and breeding behaviors. This approach will allow for the experimental study of courtship interactions in a wild population.  Using this framework, the investigators expect to show that success in courtship, as in business, requires an attractive offer as well as skilled negotiation. Sage-grouse are currently being considered for federal listing as an endangered species. This project involves collaboration with an environmental education specialist to conduct extensive outreach addressing the role of basic and applied science in management decisions. This work will also compliment the ongoing applied research by the investigator to address how noise pollution may disrupt sage-grouse courtship negotiations and contribute to their population declines. This project involves mentorship and salary for a postdoctoral scholar and graduate students, and mentorship for dozens of undergraduates, many from underrepresented minorities.",
