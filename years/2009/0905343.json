 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThough perhaps unfortunate, as a practical matter software is often\r\nbuilt with functionality as a primary goal, and security features are\r\nonly added later, often after vulnerabilities have been identified.\r\nTo reduce the cost and increase assurance in the process of security\r\nretrofitting, the aim to develop a methodology involving automated and\r\nsemi-automated tools and techniques to add authorization policy\r\nenforcement functionality to legacy software systems.\r\n\r\nThe main insight is that major portions of the tasks involved in\r\nretrofitting code can be or already have been automated, so the design\r\nprocess focuses on enabling further automation and aggregating these\r\ntasks into a single, coherent approach.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, techniques and tools are being developed to: (1)\r\nidentify and label security-relevant objects and I/O channels by\r\nanalyzing and instrumenting annotated application source code; (2)\r\ninsert code to mediate access to labeled entities; (3) abstract the\r\ninserted checks into policy-relevant, security-sensitive operations\r\nthat are authorized (or denied) by the application's security policy;\r\n(4) integrate the retrofitted legacy code with the site's specific\r\npolicy at deployment time to ensure, through advanced policy analysis,\r\nthat the application enforces that site's policy correctly, and (5)\r\nverify correct enforcement of OS policy delegation by the retrofitted\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nThe techniques and tools being developed are useful not only\r\nfor retrofitting, but also for augmenting and verifying existing code\r\nalready outfitted with security functionality; hence improving the\r\nstate-of-the-art in creating more secure software.",
