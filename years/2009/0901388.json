 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The PI proposes using palladium and metal oxide nanoclusters as catalytic coatings for fast, high sensitivity/specificity, chemical to optical transduction. Coated, optically pumped, nanoscale VCSELs amplify and encode gas induced changes into an output power and/or wavelength shift for remote readout. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This effort merges new research in nanoscale materials and device architectures to transform current scientific understanding of nanophotonic sensors. Gas induced lattice expansion of palladium nanoclusters is a hot research topic for electrical hydrogen sensors, but due to potential sparking, optical sensors are advantageous. The PI proposes expanding current research by characterizing the complex refractive index change caused by lattice expansion and testing sensors based on this effect.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Hydrogen is an attractive alternative fuel, but there is widespread public concern about its safe production and usage due to hydrogen's low flammability point of 4% in air. Poor response speed, sensitivity, and reliability of current hydrogen sensors could derail the future hydrogen fuel economy. Thus, this project can produce broad societal impact by demonstrating high performance sensors. Additionally, the research offers rich opportunities for teaching and training of graduate and undergraduate researchers in several disciplines. Participation of underrepresented groups will be broadened through on campus recruitment, REU internships, and K-12 outreach activities.",
