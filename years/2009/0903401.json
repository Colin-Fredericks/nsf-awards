 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0603976\r\nJonathan Hanke\r\n\r\nThe relationship between quadratic forms and modular forms has been a\r\nrich source of mathematical questions and answers for a long time,\r\nthrough the theory of theta functions. This connection has been used\r\nrecently by the PI to understand the failure of a local-global\r\nprinciple for integral ternary quadratic forms, to give a complete\r\nanswer of what numbers are represented by any given positive definite\r\nintegral quadratic form in four variables, and (jointly with\r\nM. Bhargava) to prove Conway's 290-Conjecture which characterizes all\r\npositive definite integer-valued quadratic forms representing all\r\npositive integers as those representing 29 critical numbers (the\r\nlargest of which is 290).  The PI proposes to continue this work by\r\nunderstanding the local-global principle for a totally definite\r\nternary quadratic form over a number field in terms of the structure\r\nof its theta function, and investigating (jointly with M. Bhargava)\r\nfiniteness theorems (like the 290-Conjecture) for quadratic forms\r\nrepresenting all odd numbers and also all prime numbers.  He is also\r\ninterested in enumerating all totally definite quadratic forms of\r\nclass number one, since such forms are the basis of many arithmetic\r\nresults about quadratic forms.\r\n\r\nThe question of how many ways a number can be expressed as a sum of\r\ntwo, three, or four square numbers is one of the oldest and most\r\ninteresting problems in number theory -- and the discovery of some of\r\nthe most fundamental symmetries of the arithmetic of whole numbers.\r\nUnderstanding these symmetries has allowed for some of the most\r\ncelebrated results in number theory, for example Wiles's proof of\r\nFermat's last theorem, and Lagrange's proof that every positive number\r\nis a sum of (at most) four square numbers.  The PI hopes to use these\r\nsymmetries to continue to answer simple questions about whole numbers\r\n-- in particular sums of square numbers -- and to provide\r\ncomputational tools to allow others to do the same.  These results\r\ncould be used to create better encryption systems, but more\r\nimportantly, could allow for a deeper understanding of the nature of\r\narithmetic and its underlying structure.\r\n",
