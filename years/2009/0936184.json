 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Twenty-Second ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles will be held in Big Sky, Montana on October 11-14, 2009. For over 30 years SOSP has been the leading forum for innovative research in operating systems. Like its predecessors, SOSP 2009 will bring together researchers from around the world to present and discuss the latest results. In addition to such traditional topics as the performance, functionality, and security of kernels, file systems, and networks, this year's conference will place increasing attention on such emerging topics as ubiquitous and mobile computing, sensor networks, overlay and peer-to-peer communications, and power management. Particularly noteworthy papers will be forwarded to ACM Transactions on Computer Systems for possible journal publication. There will also be poster and work-in-progress sessions for the presentation of promising preliminary work.\r\nThis proposal requests funding to support the attendance of 20 US-based graduate students. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. The support requested in this proposal will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention will be paid to directing support towards underrepresented minorities including women, African-Americans, and Native Americans.",
