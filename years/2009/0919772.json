 "awd_abstract_narration": "The creation of new firms is recognized as a major source of new jobs, productivity gains, product innovations, integration of immigrants into the economy, and a major career option for many people. The Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics compiles information that is useful to the researchers who study new firm creation in the U.S. The data set is based on a nationally representative sample of 1,214 nascent entrepreneurs identified in late 2005. It provides a unique description of their actions, from initial hopes and intentions through the establishment of an ongoing businesses. \r\n\r\nFour waves of data gathering by means of annual interviews have been completed to date. These provide information on the nature of the business, start-up activities implemented, the characteristics of the founding team and helping networks, sources and amounts of financial support, evaluations of the economic context, competitive strategy and growth expectations, along with details of the motivations, perspectives, and personal background of the nascent entrepreneur. This award will enable a fifth and six round of interviews, will enable a comprehensive assessment of which of these factors played a critical role in the successful establishment of a new business or prompted the abandonment of business start-up efforts. Importantly, the timing of these additional interviews will enable a robust examination of the impact of the recent financial crisis on the amounts and kinds of financial support received by fledgling enterprises as well as the effects of the downturn on entrepreneurial intentions.",
