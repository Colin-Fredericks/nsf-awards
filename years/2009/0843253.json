 "awd_abstract_narration": "The choroid plexus is a tissue located in spaces (ventricles) in the brain and forms about 70% of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF both mechanically cushions and, in large part, determines the stability of the chemical environment of the neurons. The CSF is similar to plasma but has very little protein, higher chloride, and substantially less inorganic phosphate. The mechanisms responsible for maintaining the CSF phosphate concentration at a lower level is unknown, but it is hypothesized that control of CSF phosphate is due, in part, to active removal of phosphate by the choroid plexus. The overall objective of this project is to determine the mechanism and control of active phosphate transport by the choroid plexus. Two model systems for these studies are the sheet-like choroid plexus of a shark and a mammalian immortalized choroid plexus cell line that can be maintained in a functional state outside the body. Unlike mammalian choroid plexus in its natural state inside the brain, which is highly enfolded, frond-like and deep within brain tissue, the choroid plexus of the shark normally forms a large slightly enfolded sheet on the surface of the brain. The latter allows the use of special chambers for the determination of the mechanisms of transfer of phosphate out of the CSF back into the blood. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the phosphate transfer process will be identified by knocking down the expression of specific transport proteins and monitoring the effect on phosphate transport. Once identified in the shark, similar transport systems will be sought in the mammalian system reorganized in culture into a sheet-like tissue. Another objective of the project is to determine how this phosphate transfer system is controlled by focusing on parathyroid hormone-related peptides. These peptides are involved in regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism and it is hypothesized that they regulate CSF phosphate concentration through actions on the choroid plexus phosphate transport processes. Because small changes in CSF can have very large effects on brain function as well as alter other processes such as breathing rate, factors which modulate its composition will have important effects on normal body functions. This project will involve the training of undergraduate and graduate students and participation in NSF Research Experience for Undergraduate programs at the University of Connecticut and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe choroid plexus, also known as the \"kidney\" of the brain, forms most (80%) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which buoys and cushions the brain and is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in maintenance of brain interstitial fluid composition, the fluid which nourishes the neurons.  The blood-brain barrier (capillaries of the brain) and the CSF-brain barrier (choroid plexus epithelium) maintain stability of the neuronal environment through active control of volume and composition of the brain extracellular fluids and through removal of toxic organic wastes.  An especially critical component of this fluid is inorganic phosphate (Pi).   The Pi concentration of mammalian CSF is about one-half that of plasma, a phenomenon highly conserved in the vertebrates and which we have now also shown in the spiny dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias.  Pi is a highly regulated vital nutrient contributing to control of intracellular energy status, acid-base balance, calcium activity, membrane structure, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulatory processes, etc. \n\nIntellectual merit:  Our work funded by this award revealed that Pi is actively transported from CSF to blood by the choroid plexus (CP) epithelium.  The advantageous anatomical arrangement of the IVth ventricle CP of the shark makes possible precise measure of transepithelial transport, measurements not possible in mammals.   To determine if the findings in shark are conserved in the mammals we examined Pi transport properties in Z310 cells, an immortalized rat CP epithelial cell line.  The time course and saturation kinetics of 33Pi uptake revealed a Km consistent with those measured for PiT1 and PiT2 in other epithelial systems.  The transport properties matched those of the shark indicating a PiT-like transporter.  The transepithelial transport properties are consistent with the PiT2 (Slc20A2) type III Na+-Pi cotransporter.  Gene and protein expression of PiT2 were present in both shark CP and Z310 cells.  In intact shark and rat CP, PiT-1 was found predominately in the vascular endothelium, and PiT-2 was in the CP microvilli.  No membrane associated type II (Slc34 family) Pi transporters were present in shark or rat CP epithelial cells.  The approach of comparing shark and rat has proven very effective for exploration of this unique and conserved transport function of the CP discovered by our lab.  Because this process is critical for stabilization of the CSF Pi concentrations and apparently highly phylogenetically conserved, it may have significance in studies as divergent as growth rates in fishes to neurodegenerative diseases in humans. \n\nBroader Impact:  Five peer-reviewed publications; two Ph.D. students and one M.S. student were trained with these funds in addition to two NSF REU students, four undergraduate Honors scholars, and two University Scholars (four senior theses).  Pi is a vital nutrient, and because PiT2 may be a centrally located Pi sensor and a regulator of CSF Pi concentration, these new findings potentially transform our understanding of Pi homeostasis in the vertebrates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
