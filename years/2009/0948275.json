 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports travel for U.S. students to the Fourth ACM International Workshop on Underwater Networks (ACM WUWNet 2009).  The travel support is for students who might not otherwise be able to attend the workshop.\r\n\r\nWith respect to intellectual merit, this workshop has established itself as an important workshop on underwater communication and networking.  This topic area is of great significance due to the inherent technical challenges for communications and system design in the harsh underwater environment and due to its potential to enable transformative new capabilities for environmental and maritime security applications.  The workshop seeks to encourage the participation of graduate students from electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, and other related disciplines.  Students present their work in technical presentations, posters, and demonstrations and also participate in workshop organization and logistics.\r\n\r\nWith respect to broader impacts, the travel support can improve the education of graduate students through participation in the workshop and associated interaction with leading researchers and other students.  The selection process emphasizes support for those students who might not otherwise be able to attend the workshop.  The selection process also considers the student's research activity in underwater communication and networking.  Preference will be given to women and other students from underrepresented groups, thus addressing the need for increased diversity in research.",
