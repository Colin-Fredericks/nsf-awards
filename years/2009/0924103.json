 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\"\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop the fundamental scientific and engineering principles that will form and drive the development of k-space multifunctional acoustic wave devices as potential components in telecommunication technology with high level functionalities. The approach is based on the use of phononic crystals as parts of acoustic wave devices that can produce transformative k-space (real space) functionalities in addition to the more common spectral (temporal) functions.  These novel functions arise from properties of phononic crystals such as zero or negative angle refraction as well as generation of phase locked multiple beams. This research will combine theoretical-computational methodologies and experimental techniques. The research objectives will be met by demonstrating experimentally prototype functional structures and devices. \r\n\r\n This research?s intellectual merit resides in the k-space functionality of the devices. In contrast to traditional spectral functions these new functions will transform the field of acoustic wave devices by enabling spatial filtering, beam multiplexing and logic operations in compact structures and devices as practical miniaturized and integrated components in acoustic wave systems. \r\n    \r\nThe investigators will conduct the research in a global context and will expose graduate and undergraduate students to international collaborations through exchange as part of a Centre National de La Recherche Scientifique (France)-University of Arizona International Associated Laboratory.   The investigators will build on experience in the development of Do-It-Yourself technology kits on audible phononics to support outreach activities at high schools and science fairs with the aim of promoting science and engineering education and careers among the ethnically diverse Tucson community.",
