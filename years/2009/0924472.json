 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Shalini Shankar, of Northwestern University, will investigate how the many contemporary public meanings of race and ethnicity in the United States today may be affected by the mirco-level processes through which advertising is developed and produced. She will focus particularly on images of Asian Americans created by first and second generation Asian immigrants employed in these agencies, who must reformulate the numerous Asian and Pacific Island nationalities encompassed by the term \"Asian\" to reflect its ethnic, national, religious, and linguistic diversity, while also making \"Asian American\" a relevant marketing category for commercial circulation and consumption.\r\n\r\nThe researcher will employ a mix of social science methodologies, including participant observation, discourse analysis, and interviews, to collect data in three New York City agencies. She also will use archival resources to analyze historical and current campaigns featuring Asian Americans. \r\n\r\nThe project is significant because it will further understandings of the processes by which racial and ethnic meanings are actively negotiated from census and market research, produced for commercial purposes, and circulated in a variety of media. In this way, the research offers an ethnographic and sociolinguistic complement to more common textual analyses of racist advertisements. The project will chronicle the emergence and interworkings of the Asian American segment of the advertising industry, and use these findings to extend studies of globalization, diaspora, and new immigration to the United States.",

It investigates how the American advertising industry considers issues of diversity, and how it represents them through linguistic and visual signs. A total of 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork were supported by the grant, and these were used to conduct research in advertising agencies, at advertising industry events, and at select venues featuring advertising and marketing work. The majority of the research was conducted in advertising agencies that create targeted communications for Asian Americans, but several weeks were also dedicated to research in agencies that made mainstream ads. The majority of the research was conducted in New York City, along with several weeks of research in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Methodologies of ethnographic participant observation, interviews, and audio recordings of meetings allowed the project to focus on the day to day process of advertising development and production. Overall the PI (alone) visited fourteen agencies, conducted 75 interviews, and recorded over 100 hours of creative conversations, meetings, and production sessions. One aim of the project was to understand what the category of &ldquo;Asian American&rdquo; means in the context of advertising, and how it relates to other racial categories defined by the U.S. Census and other metrics. The findings revealed that advertising executives define this category to focus primarily on Asians of Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Asian Indian descent, although some agencies also included Japanese Americans, other South Asian ethnicities such as Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, and Pacific Islander populations. The PI observed these ethnicities to be grouped together to comprise the category of &ldquo;Asian American,&rdquo; a term that advertising executives used to promote their services to those wishing to advertise to Asian Americans specifically, as well as to participate in &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; advertising along with Latino and African American advertising agencies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A main finding of the research is that Asian American advertising executives use specialized cultural signs and elements of language to reach individual Asian ethnic groups.
