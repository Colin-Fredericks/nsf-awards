 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a new summer school focused on the nuclear and\r\nparticle astrophysics and cosmology - following themes expounded in the National\r\nResearch Council's report \"Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos.\" The school will be held over the two-week period June 29-July 10, 2009, on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. The proposed school will cover theory, experiment, and observation, and will welcome students from all of these areas: the goal is to provide the students with a broad overview of the forefront problems in the field. The program is being designed to strike good balances between theory and experiment, and among the fields interested in fundamental astrophysics. The target audience includes advanced graduate students and beginning postdoctoral researchers. The school's program has been organized around six subjects\r\n* Cosmology and the early universe\r\n* Formation and evolution of structure\r\n* High energy astrophysics\r\n* Supernovae and nucleosynthesis\r\n* Gravity and gravitational waves\r\n* Neutrino physics and astrophysics\r\n\r\nThe PI's are seeking special University of Washington support to help in the recruitment of participants from under-represented groups.",
