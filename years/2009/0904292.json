 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this project is to reduce uncertainties related to the formation, oxidative aging, and cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) activity of organic aerosol particles, thereby providing a more reliable base for modeling and predicting climate change.  A unique laboratory setup to characterize the composition, size, morphology, and density of aerosol particles and to measure CCN activity of these particles will be used to characterize and understand secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation/evolution mechanisms and yields from atmospherically relevant precursor gases oxidized by hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals and ozone.  Multi-step heterogeneous oxidation of atmospherically relevant organic compounds will also be studied.  The results will provide information necessary to characterize chemical composition of SOA from given precursors and to accurately represent their CCN proclivity.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigators (PIs) will actively participate in an initiative funded by the Gelfand Family Charitable Trust to mentor science students in four Boston inner city high schools, a program guided by the TSIP concept (Teaching Science through the Inquiry Process).  Students will be mentored in small groups and in one-on-one settings with the aim of helping them prepare science fair projects.  Two of the schools have science fairs already (Monument High School and The Engineering School).  In the other two, working with the teachers and students, the PIs will help organize such fairs.  The vehicle for potential science discussions will be current environmental issues with a specific focus on the atmosphere.",

This project consisted of laboratory and field studies focused on characterizing the chemical, physical, and optical properties of two important types of atmospheric particles:  black carbon (soot) particles and secondary organic aerosol particles. \n\nThe first component of this project involved laboratory and field studies of black carbon (soot) particles, which are a by-product of incomplete combustion.  Soot particles are the only particle types to strongly absorb all colors of sunlight and thus are an important element in global climate change.   We conducted laboratory studies characterizing and comparing the performance of state-of-the-art instruments designed to measure the optical, physical and chemical properties of black carbon particles. In addition, we participated in a field study using these instruments to directly correlate the chemical and optical properties of black carbon-containing particles.  The results from the field study suggest that the currently modeled climate forcing effect of black carbon particles may be significantly overestimated. This work provides direction for future studies geared towards more accurate modeling of the global climate forcing effects of black carbon particles.\n\nThe second component of this project focused on the use of laboratory techniques to generate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles, which are complex mixtures of hundreds/thousands of individual organic compounds formed from gas-to-particle conversion processes in the atmosphere.

We found that as SOA particles became more heavily oxidized, they take up water vapor more efficiently and can more readily form cloud droplets. This result suggests an important link between the chemical properties and the indirect climate forcing potential of SOA.\n\n(2) We performed laboratory measurements to understand ambient observations of organic aerosol particles measured downwind of the June 2010 Gulf oil spill.

Under most conditions, SOA particles were characterized by a solid phase at low relative humidity. As the SOA was exposed to higher relative humidity, a solid-to-liquid phase transition was observed. The phase state of SOA particles influences the ability to take up wate..."
