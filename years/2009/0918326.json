To test this hypothesis, this project is addressing two core research questions:\r\n\r\n1. To what extent does a coach's depth of knowledge in two primary domains (coaching knowledge and mathematics content knowledge) influence coaching effectiveness?\r\n\r\n2. To what extent does professional development targeting those two knowledge domains improve coaching effectiveness?\r\n\r\nThe first research question is being addressed by a non-experimental correlational study of knowledge for coaching and change in teacher practice as a result of coaching. The second question is being studied by an experimental causal cross-over design measuring the effects of professional development provided to increase the knowledge of coaches.  The designs address effects of coaching on teachers' classroom instruction, an critical link in the connection between coaching and improved student learning.  \r\n\r\nThe correlational data is analyzed by structural equation modeling.  The experimental data is analyzed by hierarchical linear modeling, nesting teachers within coaches.  Approximately 60 coaches are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, and each coach works with 3 teachers.  The various facets of coach and teacher knowledge and practice are measured by a variety of existing and previously validated instruments.\r\n\r\nResults of the study will provide valuable evidence to schools considering use of mathematics coaches as a strategy for improving results of elementary mathematics instruction.",
