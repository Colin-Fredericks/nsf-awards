The bio-inspired, photon detector will be able to operate throughout the 3 to 14 micron infrared spectrum.  In addition the detector material will be optimized to have the highest performance in the 3 to 5 and 8 to 12 micron spectral atmospheric windows.  The overarching theme of the proposed research and development effort is to produce a marketable product that will be the preeminent solution for many infrared detection and imaging applications. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are will allow sensing of infrared electromagnetic radiation, which is very important for a wide variety of activities and applications.  Infrared (beyond the red visible light) detection provides a means of seeing-in-the-dark or un-illuminated objects.  The proposed spectrally adaptive high-performance sensor will be important for many medical, commercial, scientific, and defense applications.  In particular, the research and development activities will directly lead to a sensor product for agile multispectral imagery, without the use of cryogenic cooling.\r\n\r\n",
