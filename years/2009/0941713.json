 "awd_abstract_narration": "(Biological Sciences 61)\r\nThis highly interdisciplinary project involves design and pilot testing of complementary food-based interdisciplinary laboratory modules in both introductory biology and chemistry courses in order to: (1) engage students with common, real-world materials and situations relevant to key biological and chemical concepts; (2) demonstrate the interdependence of biology and chemistry disciplines; and (3) promote active learning in an investigative environment. The project includes professional development for faculty and teaching assistants. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. This project is giving undergraduate science majors a unique first year experience in two science courses and is helping develop a strong interdisciplinary team of biology, chemistry and science education faculty.  Project evaluation is investigating the effect of providing coordinated connections between biology and chemistry concepts and relating these concepts to the student's world on student understanding of the relevance of science in today's world. In addition the professional development feature of the project is helping instructors develop effective pedagogical strategies and abilities in lesson preparation, implementation, and reflection for continued improvement. The project team uses student feedback and evaluation to reform the laboratory content and to increase its relevance and appeal to undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The results of this project are serving as a model for other similar universities and are laying the foundation for further large-scale collaborative reformation of undergraduate STEM courses. \r\n",
