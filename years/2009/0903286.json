The Water and Wastewater Technician Training Institute (WTTI) builds on existing linkages with the employment sector (water & wastewater utilities statewide), state primacy agencies and technical assistance/trade associations. The project refines an industry needs-driven curriculum that utilizes on-line course delivery to provide options for both traditional and nontraditional students. The partnership revitalizes an existing Associates Degree program titled \"Water Utilities Management\" and integrates a 4-year pathway into WKU's Ogden College of Science and Engineering through a formal articulation agreement.",
