 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this program is to demonstrate InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot laser grown on dislocation filters on silicon substrates that will be used as a pump source for cladding-pumped Si Raman amplifiers integrated on the same chip. Planarization via etching the substrates and regrowth inside the formed trenches will make it possible to couple the laser pump directly into Si waveguides.  The upper cladding of Si waveguides will be formed using silicon-oxynitride. The core Si waveguide will be fabricated by shrinking the cross-section dimensions of patterned waveguides via thermal oxidation.  \r\nIntellectual merit: The intellectual merit is the first demonstration of high-performance hybrid III-V on Si lasers and their integration with Si Raman amplifiers. High-performance hybrid Si lasers have been elusive and their demonstration is transformative.  Demonstration of a high-gain silicon optical amplifier integrated with a pump source is also transformative and is considered a milestone in integrated photonics.  The proposed waveguide fabrication technique avoids the difficulties of electron-beam lithography for submicron waveguide fabrication.\r\nBroader impacts:  The broader impacts are the interdisciplinary nature of the program, its undergraduate and underrepresented minorities and K-12 outreach. The proposed program provides a broader impact to science and society beyond technical merits.  It combines optoelectronics with microelectronics, physics, and materials science and engineering, thereby extends optoelectronics to real applications.  The proposed program outlines interdisciplinary research for graduate and undergraduate students.  Outreach projects for women and underrepresented minorities are highlighted. The program proposes to expose middle- and high-school students to scientific and engineering disciplines.  \r\n",
