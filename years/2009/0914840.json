 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal contains a research program that systematically covers a novel  source discovery problems involving dynamic visibility, the Poisson equation, the heat  equation, and the wave equations posed in complicated, non-simply connected domains.  These problems are motivated by robotic path planning applications. Assuming sparse and sequential measurements of data, the PI and collaborators propose new robotic path algorithms along which new measurements can be added in order to efficiently determine plausible source locations and to reach particular vantage points such that the plausible source locations are under visual surveillance. The PI further studies situations in which obstacles in the domains are partially known through the visibility along the robotic path.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider the situation in which a robot, sent into an unknown environment, is supposed to discover the location of a signal source and place it under its line-of-sight in an  efficient manner. The unknown environment contains non-penetrable solid obstacles and  should be avoided along the robot's path. In this environment, the properties of the signal, such as the signal strength, are assumed to satisfy certain  mathematical equations.  The robot gathers measurements from two different sensors: a range sensor that  gives distance from the robot to the surrounding obstacles, and a sensor that measures  the signal strength that is being emitted from the yet-to-be-located source.  While measurements can be taken anywhere,  the PI and the collaborators are interested in having the robot take very few measurements with its sensors.  This consideration is particularly relevant to efficient surveillance and anti-terrorism applications. The goal is to design an robust algorithm that determines how the robot should navigate through the environment and where along its path it should take measurements so  that the ob jective of discovering signal sources and their surveillance can be achieved  efficiently.",
