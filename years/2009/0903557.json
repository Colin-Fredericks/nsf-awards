 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is the possibility of using gas targets as plasma based optical devices to manipulate laser pulses of ultra-high energy density. Some simulations and theory have offered tantalizing glimpses of the use of plasma as an optical device. If these effects could be controlled, then the propagation and applicability of the laser could be tailored by redirecting the laser energy, improving the focusing properties, compressing and guiding the pulse, broadening the pulse spectrum and eliminating pre- and post-pulses. In the course of this project, the PI and graduate students intend to perform experiments and numerical work to understand non-linear optical effects at the ultra-high intensities available on the Hercules laser system at the University of Michigan. Following demonstrations of optical control of the laser pulse, the modified, tailored pulses could then be used for laser-driven particle acceleration, both solid target proton acceleration by radiation pressure acceleration and laser wakefield acceleration of electrons in a gas jet.\r\n\r\nThis research may lead to new practical techniques for manipulating laser pulses for ultra-intense applications. By implementing the techniques learnt during the course of the research, improved stability for particle acceleration, and particle beams of higher quality should result\r\n\r\nThis proposal was submitted to the NSF-DoE Partnership in Plasma Science and Engineering joint solicitation 08-589. This award is being funded by the Plasma Physics Program in the Division of Physics.\r\n",
