 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide both analysis and functioning open-source\r\nsoftware to evaluate the utility and applicability of the Extended\r\nFinite Element Method (XFEM) to the problem of dynamic Earthquake\r\nrupture on complex non-planar faults.  While standard finite element\r\nmethods are applicable to many earthquake physics problems, the\r\nrequirement that the mesh be conformal to a complex, non-volume\r\nforming network of faults is a fundamental difficulty, particularly in\r\n3-dimensions.  The XFEM, provides a potentially powerful alternative\r\nby encoding discontinuous basis functions into the approximation space\r\nwithout requiring faults to coincide with mesh edges, an approach that\r\nnaturally fits the earthquake rupture problem.\r\n\r\nPreliminary work, however, demonstrates several complications that\r\narise in this application.  Standard techniques for frictional failure\r\ndo not work with the XFEM, so new weak formulations of failure must be\r\ndeveloped.  In addition, discrete singularities, which are effectively\r\nremoved in quasi-static engineering rupture problems, become crucial\r\nin dynamic repeated rupture.  These discrete problems can\r\nfundamentally affect event statistics, and must be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will address these complications via analysis,\r\ncomputation, and physical intuition.  Specifically, they propose two\r\npossibilities for weak failure criteria, and plan to test them with a\r\nseries of benchmark problems.  Additionally, they propose analysis of\r\nnumerical accuracy of the weak frictional criteria, with the goal of\r\nbetter understanding error in rupture propagation in these discrete\r\nsystems.  In a second component, they plan to derive bounds for the\r\nexistence of mesh-fault interaction artifacts.  Using these bounds, they\r\nwill either determine enrichment schemes that eliminate the artifacts\r\nor develop meshing schemes to avoid them.  Finally, the above work\r\nwill culminate in a proof of concept for the XFEM in repeated rupture\r\nproblems, and they will work to better understand event complexity in\r\ncomplex fault systems.  These problems provide an excellent\r\nopportunity for collaboration between computational and applied\r\nmathematicians and earthquake physicists.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Significance: \r\nUnderstanding the dynamics and probability of\r\nEarthquakes on realistically complex fault networks is a fundamental\r\nscience and engineering problem that has direct consequences for\r\nimproved estimates of Earthquake hazards.  Advanced computational\r\nmodels, combined with observations, provide an important tool for\r\nexploring and understanding these systems.  A critical component of\r\nsuch models, however is the geometric description and accurate\r\nmodeling of failure on non-planar faults which poses significant\r\nchallenges for traditional finite-element methods.  This project will\r\ninvestigate an alternative method that allows the description of the\r\nfault network to be only loosely coupled to the computational mesh.\r\nIf this method is successful, it promises to significantly increase\r\nthe ease of describing and composing these problems and is better\r\nsuited to exploring the dynamics of fault networks, particularly under\r\nthe uncertainty of fault location.  The proposed research will also\r\ncontribute to the computational infrastructure for modeling the\r\ndynamics of brittle systems and earthquake genesis. The resulting open\r\nsource software will be distributed through the Computational\r\nInfrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG: www.geodynamics.org), and be\r\naccessible to a broad community of researchers with impact beyond the\r\nimmediate realm of Earthquake physics.\r\n",
