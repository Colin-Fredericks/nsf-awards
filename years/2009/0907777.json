Because\r\nof the repulsion between the unlike monomers, the different type\r\nsub-chains tend to segregate, but as they are chemically bonded\r\nin chain molecules, segregation of sub-chains cannot lead to a\r\nmacroscopic phase separation.  Only a local micro-phase\r\nseparation occurs: micro-domains rich in A monomers and\r\nmicro-domains rich in B monomers emerge as a result.  A\r\nnano-sized pattern formed from micro-domains is known as a\r\nmorphology phase.  The investigator develops singular limit\r\nmethods to study morphology phases that concentrate on points,\r\ncurves, and surfaces in space, and that might not be found by\r\nexisting free energy methods.  These methods reduce complicated\r\nnonlinear, nonlocal, variational, and partial differential\r\nequation problems to simpler geometric problems.  They analyze\r\nthe saturation phenomenon: a process of elongation, deformation,\r\nand breaking off of a small number of large objects to form a\r\nlarge number of small objects.  They also explain defects in\r\nmorphological phases caused by local-nonlocal competition or\r\ntopological constraints.  In the case of block copolymer vesicles\r\nthe investigator studies the bending rigidity in the free energy. \r\nThe singular limit techniques are extended to problems without\r\nvariational structures, such as the Gierer-Meinhardt system for\r\nbiological morphogenesis in development. \r\n\r\n     Block copolymers are soft condensed materials that in\r\ncontrast to crystalline solids, are characterized by fluid-like\r\ndisorder on the molecular scale and a high degree of order on a\r\nlonger length scale.  An almost unlimited number of molecular\r\narchitectures can be designed by modern nano-technologies to\r\nproduce materials with particular mechanical, electric, barrier,\r\nionic and other physical properties.  Common box tapes use\r\ntriblock copolymers to achieve pressure-sensitive adhesion. \r\nBlock copolymers are blended with asphalt in road construction to\r\nreduce pavement cracking and rutting at low and high temperature\r\nextremes.  In this project the investigator studies pattern\r\nformations within block copolymers that are related to changes in\r\nthe morphology phase of the material, and hence to larger-scale\r\nmaterial properties.  The project includes graduate students, who\r\ndevelop skills and knowledge in both mathematics and materials\r\nscience. \r\n",
