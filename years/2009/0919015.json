 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the primary goals of biological research is to understand the forces that maintain biodiversity. One powerful mechanism that leads to the maintenance of diversity is \"nontransitive interactions.\"  Nontransitive interactions occur when the dominance relationships among three or more players are not hierarchical, such that A>B, B>C, and C>A.  Because no one competitor is superior to all others, diversity can be maintained in the absence of environmental variation.  These interactions are thought to be important in preserving both species diversity and genetic diversity within species.  Nevertheless, few studies have linked variation observed in nature with empirical tests of theory.  The proposed work examines natural isolates of the insect-parasitic bacterium, Xenorhabdus bovienii.  Assays of the bacteriocins (narrow-spectrum antibiotics) produced by these isolates suggest that nontransitive interactions may be important in maintaining diversity even at small spatial scales.  The researchers will further characterize these antibiotics, and will use these bacterial isolates to rigorously test theoretical models of ecological dynamics.  In addition, they will examine whether interactions among bacteria within an insect host have consequences for the insect and other species in the community.  Finally, they will experimentally test theory explaining why bacteria resistant to these antibiotics do not come to predominate in the environment.\r\n\r\nThis work will increase our knowledge of an agriculturally, and potentially pharmaceutically, important system.  Moreover, this work will test the assumptions and predictions of theory that can be applied generally to other systems.  It will also involve active participation of eight undergraduates in all aspects of research, as well as the mentorship of a graduate student.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThousands of bacterial species can be found in a patch of forest soil or associated with the human body.  We understand that this diversity can be maintained because different species are best suited to different habitats or niches, which can be defined on a micro-scale.  In any given niche; however, we expect one species or genotype to outcompete all others.  Thus, competition is often viewed as a force that lessens diversity within communities.  In contrast to this view, our work on this project has demonstrated that competition can be a mechanism that maintains diversity.  As a model of this process, we have examined natural isolates of two species of bacteria in the genus Xenorhabdus.  These bacteria are involved in a mutualistic symbiosis with roundworms (nematodes in the genus Steinernema).  Together, the nematodes and bacteria are virulent pathogens of a wide range of insects.  \n\nInside the insect host, distinct clones of Xenorhabdus bacteria can compete with each other.  This project has elucidated that which clone wins depends on who the competitors are.  Some clones produce bacteriocins, a class of antibiotics that can kill clones distinct from the producing clone, yet of the same species.  When a susceptible competitor is present within the host, bacteriocin-producing clones are competitively superior.  However, in the absence of a sensitive competitor, faster growth is at a premium, as clones that establish infections faster are competitively dominant.  Therefore, across the population, several distinct clones can persist, as there is no competitively superior clone.  This project has also demonstrated that these bacterial interactions can affect the speed at which the insect host dies as well as the outcome of competition between nematode species.  Thus, variation within one species, within one niche, can be self-sustaining, and can facilitate the coexistence of other interacting species.  These findings support the importance of non-transitive interactions for maintaining genetic and species diversity. \n\nOther scientific findings from this project include empirical support for evolutionary theory regarding (1) spiteful behavior and (2) pathogen virulence, as well as, a demonstration that (3) the evolution of resistance is affected by the competitive community and that (4) transmission among hosts can be affected by prior host and free-living conditions.  Further, (5) a phage-derived genomic region has been characterized as producing the bacteriocin responsible for growth inhibition and competitive success of one our isolates.  These findings, and the collection of natural isolates maintained by this project provide will serve as the foundation for future work on this system.\n\nThis project provided training for two postdoctoral researchers, 6 graduate students, two post-graduates, 18 undergraduates, and two high school students.  The two postdoctoral researchers have now established independent labs, as has the PI.  Graduate students were mainly involved in rotation or short-term collaborative projects, although, one student is currently developing her dissertation based on results from this project.  By far the greatest impact has been in including undergraduates in meaningful research experiences.  Many of these students participated on the project for over a year, and they presented their work in multiple university-wide, as well as, national conferences.  Findings from this project have also inspired course design in the Human Biology Program and the Biology Major at Indiana University.  Specifically, students are involved in performing scientific research, reading the primary literature, and incorporating ecological and evolutionary principles into their understanding of biodiversity and human health.  Finally, researchers supported by this project have also been involved in outreach to preschool and elementary age students on several occasions.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Farra..."
