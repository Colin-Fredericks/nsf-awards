The 2009 meeting follows previous successful meetings including one that took place with NSF support in 1997 (CBET-9613827).  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the conference is to provide a forum for U.S. chemical engineers to meet their counterparts in China about the latest advancements, exchange research ideas, and opportunities for collaboration. Its stated theme is Chemical Engineering for Sustainable Development, a core topic of interest for ENG/CBET research involving issues such as new and renewable energy sources, clean fuels, and environmental engineering.\r\n\r\nChemical engineering is a key discipline in energy, resources, and environment, and the USA and China are two countries that can lead worldwide efforts in these areas. By bringing together scientists and engineers from these two countries, as well as other countries, to discuss these challenges and possible solutions, the conference will be able to address the key roles to be played by chemical engineers in developing processes, products and services that are needed by humanity in a sustainable way. In a still broader sense, the conference will provide a focal point of contact for the chemical engineering researchers of the two countries, as well as from other countries and regions. It should provide an excellent opportunity for exchanging information and developing future collaboration.",
