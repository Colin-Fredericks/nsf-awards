 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2009 and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Erin M. Myers is \"Comparative genetics of wing shape across Drosophila.\" This research is being conducted at the University of Houston under the sponsorship of Dr. William A. Frankino.  \r\n\r\nThe genetics underlying the expression and evolution of most ecologically or medically important traits is largely unknown.  This research uses a variety of approaches in a model system to determine the genetic architecture of interspecific wing shape for several species pairs within the genus Drosophila, as well as the degree of conservation of this architecture. To elucidate this genetic framework, the research integrates geometric morphometrics, quantitative genetics, and comparative genomics to identify the number of genetic regions contributing to interspecific variation in wing shape and the type (e.g. major vs. minor effect, additive vs. non-additive) and magnitude of these effects. In so doing, the project necessitates the development of new software to assist in data acquisition and incorporates novel genotyping and analytical techniques. The research addresses significant questions in evolutionary biology and provides a research template for future studies in non-model systems.\r\n\r\nAs part of the fellowship, training goals include genetic mapping and using model systems. Broader impacts include broad dissemination to the biological community, including advancements in methodology and software to assist in the collection of morphological data as well as mentoring undergraduate students.",
