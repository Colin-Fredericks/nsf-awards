To provide effective analysis and search for scholars and the general public, and to handle the diversity and scale of these collections, this project focuses on improvements in seven interlocking technologies: improved OCR accuracy through word spotting, creating probabilistic models using joint distributions of features, and building topic-specific language models across documents; structural metadata extraction, to mine headers, chapters, tables of contents, and indices; linguistic analysis and information extraction, to perform syntactic analysis and entity extraction on noisy OCR output; inferred document relational structure, to mine citations, quotations, translations, and paraphrases; latent topic modeling  through time, to improve language modeling for OCR and retrieval, and to track the spread of ideas across periods and genres; query expansion for relevance models, to improve relevance in information retrieval by offline pre-processing of document comparisons; and interfaces for exploratory data analysis, to provide users of the document collection with efficient tools to update complex models of important entities, events, topics, and linguistic features. When applied across large corpora, these technologies reinforce each other: improved topic modeling enables more targeted language models for OCR; extracting structural metadata improves citation analysis; and entity extraction improves topic modeling and query expansion.The testbed for this project is the growing corpus of over one million open-access books from the Internet Archive.",

In years 1 and 2, we focused primarily upon working with raw OCR-generated text at scale. In years 3, 4 and 5, we focused on integrating the generation of crucial, but very expensive, linguistic data from large corpora with language learning.\n\n \nIn the first two years, we focused on discovering linguistic information in the million book collection of the Internet Archive.

On the other hand, the ability to analyze syntax correlates well with the ability to translate a language, suggesting that the practice of syntactic annotation can help students perfect their knowledge of the language while they contribute to the development of new linguistic resources.\n\n \nOne major goal was to compare errors made by students with the errors made by machines while dependency parsing ancient Greek. A dependency graph is a tree in which every word is represented as a node and the directed arcs between the nodes show syntactic modifiers of the words. Dependency parsing is the task of generating dependency graph of that sentence. Data-driven dependency parsing techniques use an annotated corpus and learn to generate dependency graphs automatically from it.\nTo compare errors made by students with errors made by automatic parsers, we first studied the errors made by students and different parsers and then finally compared those errors. Twenty-two students from an advanced Greek course at Tufts University participated in this research. Annotations were made according to the guidelines of the Perseus Project's Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank (AGDT). The texts chosen for the experiment were the Iliad and the Odyssey of Homer from the AGDT, which provides gold standard annotations for a number of Ancient Greek texts. For machine annotation, we used a group of three different state of the art dependency parsers.\n\n \nOur experiments shows that the human annotators and parsers made very similar errors. Both methods produced very similar frequencies of different error types. What is hard for the students is hard for the parsers as well.\n\n \nFuture Work\nThe Open Philology Project at Leipzig, led by PI Crane, is carrying forward both threads of the work begun in this project. The Open Greek and Latin subproject is building on the en..."
