This is motivated by the need to demonstrate a scheme for electronic logic processing alternative to the presently-used charge-based physical paradigm now reaching its scaling limits.  The approach is to use spin-polarized hot-electron techniques for spin detection in an ultra-high-vacuum wafer-bonded Silicon device structure.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the proposed activity flows from the use of hot-electron techniques to circumvent prohibitive limitations for spintronics devices made from Silicon. This allows experimental exploration of the fundamental spin transport and materials parameters to enable Si spintronics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the research component are derived from leveraging the existing technological and economic infrastructure of Si-based electronics to extend performance trends of our present technology with Si spintronics. The advantages afforded by spintronics devices enabling lower-power, instant-on electronics will allow increased device portability and are especially important in light of today?s increasing energy costs and its environmental impact. The Broader Impacts of the integrated educational and outreach component are achieved through training graduate students (including those underrepresented in engineering) in diverse aspects of science and engineering including semiconductor device design, processing, measurement, and spintronics ? all these are essential for an increasingly technology-based economy.\r\n",
