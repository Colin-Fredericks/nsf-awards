Research and tests conducted by NCAR have ultimately resulted in numerous operational modeling capabilities being implemented into the Air Force NWP infrastructure.  Research efforts have led to improved public forecasts through improved NWP and data assimilation systems, as well as appropriate testing and evaluation to provide feedback on model improvements.\n\nThe Air Force  requires skillful numerical guidance for a broad spectrum of weather and forecasting applications. A critical component of numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems is the Land Information System (LIS), which produces land surface states and fluxes that are used in forecast modeling. The research supported by this project influenced the way that science is conducted by encouraging the sharing of ideas and methods through community code development.  In addition, the project encouraged use of appropriate methods for evaluation of forecasts, to ensure that testing results were meaningful and identified useful improvements in forecasting technology. To assist the Air Force in making evidence-based decisions and to help inform decisions regarding future operational implementation, NCAR participated in evaluation of the performance of recent LIS upgrades.\n\nNew knowledge developed through this project has been shared with the community through presentations at various American Meteorological Society conferences, as well as the Weather Research Forecast workshops.  In addition,  community support included the offering of tutorials.  These tutorials provided members of the numerical weather prediction community with knowledge regarding implementation and use of models and important research tools.\n\nStaff gained experience in a number of new areas through this project.  Scientists became very familiar with how a numerical forecast can vary simply by running the model on a different computing platform.  Staff also developed more in-depth knowledge of gridded binary data files and how to quickly process large amounts of data under tight time constraints.  This new knowledge has led to improved modeling  and decision-making capabilities for NCAR, the Air Force, and society. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Everette D Joseph"
