 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, directed by PI Gary Holton, is the US portion of a larger international collaboration that was conceived under the European Science Foundation's EUROCORES Programme, EuroBABEL. The full EuroBABEL project is a collaboration of researchers from three countries, including the US, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. \r\n\r\nThis particular project focuses on the linguistic prehistory of the non-Austronesian languages the of Alor-Pantar archipelago of southeastern Indonesia. The Alor-Pantar languages represent one of only two groups of non-Austronesian languages in Indonesia outside of the island of New Guinea; the remaining languages of Indonesia belong to the Austronesian family. A comparison of pronouns suggests a genetic relationship between the Alor-Pantar languages and New Guinea languages located some 1000 km distant. Until very recently the 15-20 Alor-Pantar languages have remained among the least well-documented languages of Indonesia, but a surge in field work efforts over the past decade has resulted in a wealth of new language data. This project will bring new and recently-collected data to bear on the question of the linguistic origins and ultimate genetic relationships of the Alor-Pantar languages.\r\n\r\nA major component of the analysis will be the reconstruction of the ancestral Proto Alor-Pantar language using the comparative method. To accomplish this the project will work closely with ESF partners to assemble recently-collected lexical and grammatical documentation and will supplement these with surveys of still-undocumented Alor-Pantar languages. These data will be used to infer sound changes which have occurred in the history of the languages. Evidence from sound changes will in turn allow the researchers to establish genetic subgroups and to evaluate potential genetic relationships with the languages of New Guinea.\r\n\r\nAn additional component of the analysis is the study of placenames, which represent one of the most highly endangered and least documented domain of linguistic knowledge in the Alor-Pantar languages. The structure and distribution of placenames provide insight into prehistory, often reflecting pre-historic settlement patterns. Placenames also provide indirect evidence of non-linguistic history, including past climate changes, since naming practices reflect human interaction with the environment at a fixed point in time. The GIS (geographic information systems) database compiled by this project will facilitate future inter-disciplinary investigations of population migrations and environmental changes and their relationships to language change.",

The large island of New Guinea, lying just north of Australia, was settled some 60,000 years ago by humans migrating from the Southeast Asian mainland. Today New Guinea remains the most linguistically diverse place on earth, home to over 1000 languages comprising more than 20 different families. One of these families, Austronesian, spread far and wide to become the most geographically dispersed language family on Earth. The Austronesians migrated from Taiwan some 6000 years ago, eventually reaching past New Guinea and as far as Hawaii and Easter Island, as well as westward to Madagascar. With two notable exceptions, all of the languages of modern day Indonesia west of New Guinea belong to this large Austronesian family. The language of the Alor and Pantar archipelago in southern Indonesia are one such exception. All but one of the some two dozen languages spoken there do not belong to the Austronesian family. They are either remnants of an earlier population which predates the arrival of the Austronesians, or they are more recent migrants from the New Guinea mainland some 1000 km to the north. </span></p>\n<p>Until very recently almost nothing was known about the Alor-Pantar languages, so judgements about their linguistic relationships remained highly speculative. Through a concerted research effort the NSF project gathered information from 12 of the Alor-Pantar languages representing a distributed geographic sample of the archipelago. Working with fluent speakers of the languages project members recorded diagnostic vocabulary lists and other grammatical information which could be systematically compared to identify sound changes over time. Using the standard Comparative Method technique, the ancestral proto-Alor-Pantar language was reconstructed, providing the first scientific confirmation that the Alor-Pantar languages did indeed descend from a common ancestor. By employing advanced statistical techniques the project was also able to posit the first internal classification, showing how the individual languages are of the Alor-Pantar family are related to each other (see image).<br /> <br /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Given that the Alor-Pantar languages are clearly unrelated to any of the Austronesian languages which surround them, the project next tackled the problem of the wider relations of the Alor-Pantar languages. Prior to our work it was widely assumed that the Alor-Pantar languages must be related to the Trans-New Guinea family of languages, but this relationship had never been demonstrated. Armed with new data on the proto-Alor-Pantar language, we found no evidence for this relationship. Instead, the most likely relationship appears to be with the languages of the Bomberai Peninsula in New Guinea. However, those languages are poorly documented, so a thorough evaluation of that proposal will require additional data. The most likely remaining scenario is that Alor-Pantar is not related to mainland New Guinea languages but instead represents a remnant population of what once was a much larger family of related languages in Eastern Indonesia. Those ancestral related languages were replaced by Austronesian languages as speakers of those languages migrated through the region 3000-6000 years ago. The Alor-Pantar family today remains a unique and distinct family of languages in a region teeming with diversity.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This research was the US portion of a larger international collaboration that was conceived under the European Science Foundation, EUROCORES Programme, </span><a href=\"http://archives.esf.org/coordinating-research/eurocores/programmes/eurobabel.html\"><span>EuroBABEL</span></a><span> (Better Analyses Based on Endangered Languages).
