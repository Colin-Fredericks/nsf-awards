 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) \r\n\r\nThe project ASPIRE at the Polytechnic University of New York prepares a cadre of SFS scholars who can integrate technical, legal, financial, and behavioral aspects into practical, cost effective solutions that people can depend on; who can help develop laws and public policies relating to information security and privacy that properly reflect the capabilities, limitations, and implications of technology. A graduate from the ASPIRE program is able to translate the foundational principles of security and privacy into information technologies based on a deep understanding of societal, economic, behavioral and public policy implications and requirements. \r\n\r\nTo ensure success of this vision, ASPIRE includes: an inter-disciplinary education and research agenda; training to identify and solve security and privacy problems from technical, legal, ethical, policy, and business perspectives; a sense of community by means of a buddy system, quarterly boot camps and weekly meetings; and a community service to mentor middle school students and to help non-profit organizations with their IT security problems. The ASPIRE team consists of researchers from NYU-Poly, and other schools in NYU with diverse expertise in areas that include Computer Science; Electrical and Computer Engineering; Public Policy; Law, Ethics and Politics; Economics and Business; and Psychology.\r\n\r\nNYU has a large number (60%) of women students and ASPIRE partners with local and national minority institutions to recruit high quality fellows. The partners include the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, National Society for Black Engineers, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the Society for Women Engineers.",
