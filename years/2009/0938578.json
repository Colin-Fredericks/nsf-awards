 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe National Research Council?s (NRC) Water Science and Technology Board (WSTB) proposes to undertake a study of the current and emerging challenges and opportunities in the hydrologic sciences, including (1) a review of the current status of the hydrology and its subfields and of their coupling with related geosciences and biosciences, and (2) the identification of promising new opportunities to advance hydrologic sciences for better understanding of the water cycle that can be used to improve water resources and environmental engineering and management.\r\nThe study will be carried out by an ad hoc, interdisciplinary committee of approximately 12 volunteer experts, with support from NRC staff. It will be organized and overseen by the WSTB with assistance and guidance from the WSTB?s standing committee on Hydrologic Sciences. The committee will hold approximately five meetings to receive briefings, gather information, deliberate critical issues, and write its report. The report will contain conclusions and recommendations regarding future directions for the hydrologic sciences. The total estimated cost of this activity is $535,000 for the 24-month period, June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2011.\r\nIntellectual merit: Hydrologic science faces new challenges as the nation and world increasingly address complex issues presented by global climate change, ecosystem protection, groundwater resource sustainability, and new water demands. Society requires a deeper understanding of how human pressures are altering the water cycle and affecting the quality and quantity of water available to humans and the environment. Agencies need accurate information to make decisions on allowable water use and waste management in an evolving economy as climate, land use, and population patterns change. These topics cannot be addressed separately; connections require integrated studies. Such integration necessitates cutting-edge research modalities for sensing data, converting raw data into information, and synthesizing findings. An effective response to this new world requires revisiting the agenda for hydrologic science and revamping ways in which science is done.\r\nBroader impacts: The primary focus of this study will be the NSF program in hydrologic science but given the importance of water issues to the nation, the report should also serve the academic/educational community, other agencies with programs in hydrology and water resources, Congressional staff, the OSTP, professional societies, and other entities with missions related to Earth sciences and water resources. The report should be an important reference to those engaged in hydrologic research and advancement of the science, much the same as Opportunities in the Hydrologic Sciences (1991) has served the hydrologic science community for nearly two decades.",
