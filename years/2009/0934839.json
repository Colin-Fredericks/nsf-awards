 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe project's aim is to double the number of secondary science teachers graduating from Missouri University - Columbia's undergraduate science teacher education program. Contributing to the achievement of this goal are: 1) recruitment of highly qualified STEM undergraduates into science teaching careers; 2) preparation to teach science that is aligned with national standards; and 3) support for science teachers during the new teachers' induction years. The recruitment strategies include informal science internships for ten freshmen and sophomore students during the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012.  During the project's third through fifth years a total of fifty $11,000 annual scholarships will be awarded to thirty juniors and seniors enrolled in the dual science and education degree program.  Scholarship recipients are obligated to teach science for two years in a high need school district (preferably in Missouri) for each year they received a scholarship.  This obligation must be completed within eight years of graduation.  Partner school districts include Hannibal School District No. 60, Mexico Missouri Public Schools, Moberly School District, and the Saint Louis Public Schools. Noyce Scholars while serving as student teachers and as new teachers participate in the Noyce Scholar Support Network (NSSN), an on-line collaboration and learning environment where past, current, and future Noyce Scholars, along with Missouri University science educators and scientists, form a community of learners.  Instrumental to increasing teacher retention is a cadre of mentor teachers in the partner schools, and support for Noyce Scholars to participate in state and regional science teacher conferences.\r\n\r\n",
