 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been progress toward understanding dynamic behavior of complex, jointed structures.  Due to slip and impact between joint elements, structures are strongly nonlinear and time-varying; yet, they can be found across the full range of manufactured components and systems.  Significant understanding has been achieved principally through research programs in the US and Europe by combining analysis, computation and physical experiments over a range of scales.  Still, the notion of fully predictive methods of analysis for complex, jointed structures remains elusive.  A successful workshop addressing the issue of joints modeling, sponsored by the National Science Foundation and Sandia National Laboratories, was held in October, 2006, in Arlington, VA.  A second workshop is proposed, in the UK, during the period April 27-29, 2009, having two major thrusts: (1) guide the development of advanced modeling allowing reliable prediction of the dynamics of joints and interfaces used in engineering structures; and (2) explore and develop new concepts for joint design using new analysis methods to achieve reduced uncertainty and variability.\r\n\r\n\tThe benefit will be reliable structures with improved resistance to dynamic loads.  Economic aspects will be addressed reflecting the belief that improved design methods will result in both economic and technical improvements.  The workshop will be unique by virtue of the diversity of its participants.  A subset of younger researchers, particularly those from underrepresented groups, will be encouraged to attend and participate in the development of the research road map.  Broad dissemination of results will attract researchers to this challenging problem.",
