 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors David Anderson of the University of Wyoming and Robert Hinde of the University of Tennessee are supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Division for a collaborative investigation of the infrared (IR) spectroscopy and chemistry of cryogenic molecular hydrogen solids containing open-shell atoms as substitutional impurities. Through a combination of experiment (Anderson) and first principles simulations (Hinde) the project goal is to use the IR spectroscopy to quantify how the presence of the hydrogen ?solvent? perturbs the electronic structure of the open-shell atom. Most chemistry occurs in the presence of a solvent and these fundamental studies are aimed at understanding how solvent effects are manifested in simple atomic radical reactions with molecular hydrogen. This will be accomplished by first developing a theoretical framework for understanding the solvent-induced perturbation of the electronic structure of chlorine atoms (Cl) trapped in solid hydrogen. The knowledge gained in these halogen atom studies will then be applied to oxygen atom (O) doped solid hydrogen to study solvent perturbations of the prototypical combustion reaction of O-atoms with molecular hydrogen. The goal of this research is to develop the spectroscopic analysis such that solid hydrogen doped with atomic radicals can be used as a new reaction medium to study the details of low temperature chemistry in a condensed phase. \r\n\r\nFrozen molecular hydrogen is a unique crystalline solid that is distinguished as a quantum solid due to pronounced quantum mechanical effects of the hydrogen molecule at the low temperatures at which hydrogen freezes (T<13.8 K). These studies of chemical reactions in a quantum solid will have direct impact on our understanding of quantum mechanical effects in low temperature chemical reactions, the ability to use light to control chemical reaction pathways, and potentially provide transformative insight into both high gravimetric storage and clean production of molecular hydrogen. This research will also provide a rich vehicle for undergraduate and graduate research experience and training.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith support from the National Science Foundation, our group performs computer simulations of crystals of solid molecular hydrogen (SMH) that contain low concentrations of chemical impurities.  The impurities that we study typically contain one to three atoms.  Because they are small, they sit comfortably in the vacancy created by removing a single hydrogen molecule from the crystal.  Our simulations aim to improve our understanding of the attractive and repulsive forces that govern the interaction of the impurities with the hydrogen molecules that surround them.  These attractive and repulsive interactions lead to small changes in the energy levels of the impurities and of nearby hydrogen molecules.  These small changes can be measured very precisely using an experimental technique called infrared absorption spectroscopy.  In an infrared absorption experiment, the doped SMH crystal is exposed to a source of infrared radiation for which the wavelength of the radiation is tunable, and the wavelengths at which the crystal absorbs infrared radiation are recorded.  We have a long-standing collaboration with experimental chemists at the University of Wyoming who carry out these experiments.\n\n\nThis project has focused on understanding the Wyoming group's experimental findings for SMH crystals containing either chlorine or bromine atoms as impurities.  These atomic impurities have an anisotropic (non-spherical) distribution of electrons which creates a local electric field.  This electric field polarizes nearby hydrogen molecules in the SMH crystal.  We have shown that this effect amplifies the absorption of infrared radiation by the chlorine and bromine atoms:  when the atoms are trapped in the SMH crystal, they absorb infrared radiation much more readily than the atoms would otherwise.  This effect could possibly be used to deposit energy into the SMH crystal in a controlled fashion in order to trigger desirable chemical reactions of impurities trapped in the crystal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert J Hinde"
