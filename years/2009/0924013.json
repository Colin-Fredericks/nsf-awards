 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the development of a novel semiconductor growth technique to produce low dislocation density III-nitride AlInGaN substrate materials for high efficiency deep UVLEDs and electronic devices. This novel growth technique termed Metalorganic Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOHVPE) is a hybrid of Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), used for device growth where atomic layer accuracy is required, and Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), used for fast bulk growth. Their combination in a single growth reactor allows for the growth of very thick, low dislocation density films as substrates templates. Then the growth mode can be switched to the metalorganic sources to grow atomically controlled device active layers, such as quantum wells, without taking the wafer out of the growth chamber. \r\n\r\nThe MOHVPE AlGaN substrate technology will lead to higher efficiency Power Electronics and deep UV LEDs. Deep UV LEDs offer the potential to greatly increase our understanding of the interaction between UV light and biological/microbiological species. This is increasingly important as we confront the global trends of an aging population (healthcare), increased population density leading to greater pathogen exposure and water shortages, and greater cross-border travel. Researchers are just beginning to investigate applications for UV radiation including cancer treatment, increased plant/food yield, and genetic modification with an increasing interest based on the ability to more controllably deliver UV radiation to particular points of interest that has been enabled by UV LEDs.",
