 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports travel by graduate students, postdoctoral\r\nassociates, and young faculty members from US institutions to the\r\nInternational Symposium in Mathematical Programming (ISMP), to be held\r\non August 23-28, 2009, in Chicago, Illinois. This year's ISMP is the\r\ntwentieth conference in a series that began in 1949 and is held about\r\nevery three years. ISMP is the major conference for the optimization /\r\nmathematical programming community and is a must-attend event for\r\nresearchers in the area worldwide. The attendance has grown from about\r\n40 participants in 1949 to over 1400 at more recent gatherings. About\r\nevery second or third ISMP is held in the US. Further information on\r\nISMP 2009 can be found at http://www.ismp2009.org. ISMP provides the\r\nmain forum for the exchange of ideas in optimization, and in\r\nparticular for cross-fertilization between the discrete, continuous,\r\nand stochastic aspects of the discipline. The major professional\r\nprizes in optimization, which are decided by juries assembled by MPS\r\nand co-sponsoring societies AMS and SIAM, are awarded during the\r\nopening ceremony of ISMP. Particularly notable is the Tucker Prize,\r\nwhich is awarded to the best student thesis written during the three\r\nyears preceding ISMP. It has been a long-standing tradition to hold a\r\ntechnical session at ISMP during which the three student finalists\r\npresent their work; this session is always a highlight of the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project provides reimbursement of travel costs for at least 25\r\ngraduate students and young researchers from US institutions to attend\r\nISMP 2009, to a level of up to $800 per participant. ISMP is the\r\npremier conference in optimization, held triennially. Optimization is\r\na field of mathematical and computational research that concerns\r\nitself with finding the best way to operate a system subject to\r\nrestrictions on the choices that can be made. It has applications in a\r\ngreat many areas of science, engineering, and commerce, which are\r\nillustrated by the following three examples. First, optimization is a\r\nvital tool in designing radiation treatment plans for cancer patients,\r\nwhere the goal is to irradiate and thus destroy tumors while sparing\r\nhealthy tissue. Second, optimization is used in designing mechanical\r\nparts for vehicles and machines that have minimum weight and cost\r\nwhile meeting certain strength and robustness requirements. Third,\r\noptimization is used in budget planning for businesses, to allocate\r\nresources in a way that maximizes expected profit in an uncertain\r\neconomic environment. Support of attendance by young US researchers at\r\nISMP will be of great benefit to their careers and research\r\nprograms. It will eventually have important positive benefits for US\r\nindustry, science, and technology. Applications for support will be\r\nsolicited and reviewed by a committee of optimization\r\nresearchers. Awardees will be chosen to ensure breadth and diversity\r\nof individuals and institutions represented, and to ensure\r\nparticipation of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in\r\nISMP 2009.\r\n",
