 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research award to Purdue University will employ researchers to use current technology in 3-D virtual world environments and virtual organizations to improve the development of design skills for engineering students. The virtual design studios would provide the opportunity for team-based inquiry and collaboration and would help students learn both content and processes such as evaluating design alternatives and making design decisions. Students would participate in a virtual research and design firm and would analyze and design aircraft and compete for contracts. The methods and results of this research will advance general understanding of how virtual design environments and serious games using technology that is familiar and attractive to students can be used to improve engineering education, provide collaboration opportunities for geographically distributed teams, and help prepare students for engineering jobs.",
