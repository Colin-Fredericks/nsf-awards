 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some rocks as they form, act like magnetic tape, thus proving recordings of the Earth's\r\nmagnetic field through time. Data from such records play an important role in a variety\r\nof geophysical studies of the Earth, including plate tectonic reconstructions,\r\nmagnetostratigraphy, and studies of the behavior of the ancient geomagnetic field. Over\r\nthe past four decades the fundamental assumption made in many studies using the\r\nmagnetic vectors coaxed from rocks has been that the average direction of the Earth's\r\nmagnetic field corresponds to one that would have been produced by a bar magnetic\r\ncentered in the Earth that is aligned with the spin axis. This implies that the dip of the\r\nancient magnetic field directions vary from horizontal near the (paleo) equator to vertical\r\nnear the (paleo) poles. The assumption is that paleomagnetic data are of sufficient\r\naccuracy to enable their use in reconstructing the positions of lithospheric plates\r\nthrough time. Recently, researchers have begun to reexamine the fundamental data\r\nunderlying models of the ancient geomagnetic field and are finding that the most glaring\r\ndeficiency in the existing data base is a dearth of high quality data, including information\r\nabout the field strength, from high northerly latitudes. It is possible that the solid inner\r\ncore influences the generation of the Earth's magnetic field, which takes place in the\r\nfluid outer core. The convective regimes inside a cylinder parallel to the Earth's\r\nrotational axis that is tangent to the inner core (the tangent cylinder) are thought to be\r\ndifferent. Therefore, data from north (or south) of the tangent cylinder are of special\r\ninterest in the theory of geomagnetism and are key to testing the validity of one of the\r\nfundamental tenets of paleomagnetic study. Opportunities to sample such high latitude\r\nvolcanics are few and far between. Researchers from Scripps Institute of\r\nOceanography, in conjunction with their Norwegian collaborators, are conducting\r\npaleomagnetic sampling and analysis of suitable sites from Jan Mayen, a remote\r\nvolcanic island in the Arctic along the mid-Atlantic rift, northeast of Iceland. Samples\r\nfrom this study are producing high quality paleomagnetic, paleointensity, and\r\ngeochronological data from high northern latitudes that are essential to an enhanced\r\nunderstanding of paleosecular variation, the time averaged field and its long term\r\nvariations. Geochronologic work for this study, conducted by collaborators from Oregon\r\nState University, is providing an enhanced understanding of the age and duration of\r\nmafic magmatic activity at this isolated volcanic island. In addition to the scientific\r\nobjectives of this work, the project is contributing to the training and support of doctoral\r\nresearcher at Scripps who is a member of an underrepresented group in the earth\r\nsciences, and results are being used in outreach activities that benefit in the\r\ndevelopment of K-12 teaching materials and web seminars for the National Science\r\nTeacher Association.",
