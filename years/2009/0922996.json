The VESO-MESH architecture aims to\r\n-\tIntegrate distributed processes and storage devices into the network so as to provide effective data process and access inside the network,\r\n-\tConstruct high-throughput backbone in WMN emphasizing the transmission of a larger volume of data, and\r\n-\tDesign and implement a set of service-oriented protocols to efficiently provide services to users inside the network and effectively utilize the network resources in terms of energy, processing, storage, etc.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The work promises to enable high-throughput data applications in disaster relief and environmental monitoring scenarios. It also plays a critical role in improving recruitment and retention of minorities at a large minority-serving institution with a high focus in engineering and a large enrollment of women. Curriculum materials will be developed and disseminated. The project provides educational and training opportunities for students at all levels in an EPSCoR jurisdiction.",
