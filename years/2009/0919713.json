 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nOver the last several years, Greenblatt has been working on resolution of singularities, and \r\nhe recently has proved an n-dimensional local resolution of singularities algorithm for real-analytic\r\nfunctions. This method is explicit, elementary, and done in coordinates. In his subsequent research,\r\nhe will apply his methods, using additional ideas when appropriate, to prove theorems involving \r\noscillatory integrals, Radon transforms, and other subjects in which he has done research. In addition \r\nto these areas, he will branch out into several other of the diverse areas that relate to \r\nresolution of singularities. For example, he intends to work on multilinear generalizations of \r\noscillatory integral operators, problems related to the stability of integrals, and associated \r\nproblems in algebraic geometry such as those involving multiplier sheaves. In addition, intriguing \r\nalgorithmic and computational questions arose during the development of [G1], and he plans to \r\ninvestigate such issues in computational algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nOscillatory integral operators are a part of Fourier analysis, a field with wide application in\r\nscience and engineering, such as in signal processing, cryptography, and statistics. As a result,\r\nimproved understanding of oscillatory integral operators resulting from this research has the \r\npotential to help in the development of scientific applications that use Fourier analytic methods. In \r\naddition, Radon transforms are fundamental to MRI and other medical imaging applications, and also find \r\nuses in diverse fields ranging from oil exploration to homeland security. As a result, improved \r\ntheoretical knowledge of Radon transforms resulting from this research may lead to advances in such \r\nfields.",
