 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe Division of Chemistry supports Owen C. Compton of Northwestern University as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Compton will investigate the use of chemically-modified, graphene-based materials as electrodes in Lithium ion batteries.  Specifically, he will develop graphene-based polymer nanocomposites and tune their electrical potentials, storage capacities, and cyclabilities through chemical modification. Dr. Compton will collaborate with scientists at Northwestern University as well as at Argonne National Laboratory.  For his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Compton will work with partners on the Northwestern campus to develop hands-on activities for young people in the greater Chicago area to illustrate the impact that the chemical sciences can have on energy efficiency, public safety and the environment.\r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Compton is aimed at developing new materials for better (safer, lower-cost and more robust) Lithium ion batteries.  The ultimate goal of research like this is to develop improved technology for the  storage and use electrical energy -- an important piece of any viable strategy for energy independence.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Compton are aimed at increasing the participation of young people from underrepresented groups in the sciences.",
