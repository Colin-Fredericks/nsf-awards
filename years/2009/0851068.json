 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators will conduct two research cruises to measure carbon dioxide, dimethyl sulfide, and acetone using the eddy covariance technique over a broad range of oceanographic conditions.  \r\n\r\nA tropical cruise in the equatorial Pacific upwelling region will capture the moderate to low wind speed conditions characteristic of most of the world's oceans.  A main goal of the Pacific cruise will be to study the increase of the gas exchange coefficient with wind speed.  A high latitude North Atlantic Ocean cruise will focus on areas of high biological productivity and higher wind speeds.  On the high latitude cruise the impact of phytoplankton blooms on gas exchange and the role of bubbles as a factor in gas exchange rates will be studied.  These cruises will add to the current database of direct flux studies in the oceans, which is extremely small, and insufficient to rigorously characterize the variability in gas transfer coefficients as a function of wind speed, sea state, biological productivity or seasonality in the major ocean basins.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research include the participation of students from various levels of education from high school interns to undergraduate and graduate students.  Underrepresented students will be included through an external program.  There will also be an effort made to include an undergraduate student and a high school teacher from a minority school district on a research cruise.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGas exchange between the ocean and atmosphere is a major term in the global budgets of many compounds with biogeochemical and climatic importance.  Parameterization of air/sea gas transfer is one of the major uncertainties in global biogeochemical models.  A better understanding of the rates of gas transfer and the factors controlling it is needed in order to predict how air/sea gas fluxes will vary in the future in response to changing climate and anthropogenic emissions.  The air/sea flux of gas is proportional to the concentration difference across the interface and a gas transfer coefficient (k) which includes the combined effect of diffusive and turbulent processes on both sides of the interface that limit the transfer of gas between the bulk seawater and air phases.  The physical forcing for gas transfer is wind stress and buoyancy at the sea surface.  Whitecaps/bubble production, wind/wave interactions and surface films may all also play a significant role in determining the rate of gas transfer.\n\nThe goal of this work was to obtain simultaneous carbon dioxide (CO2), acetone (CH3COCH3), and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) gas transfer coefficients over a broad range of oceanographic conditions to improve our understanding of the biogeochemistry of these species and the overall physical process of air-sea gas exchange itself.  CO2, CH3COCH3, and DMS are all important in terms of their impact on atmospheric chemistry and climate.  CO2 is a greenhouse gas, CH3COCH3 is a precursor for tropospheric oxidants (HOX) and DMS is a precursor of atmospheric sulfate aerosols.  These species also cover a reasonably wide range of liquid solubilities which should help probe the physical processes that control air/sea exchange.  Gas transfer coefficients were determined from eddy correlation flux measurements of the three species.  An infrared gas analyzer was used to measure CO2 fluxes and an atmospheric pressure mass spectrometer was used to measure CH3COCH3, and DMS fluxes.  Two shipboard studies were carried out, both at high latitude in areas of high productivity and high wind speeds. The first cruise was in the North Atlantic from the 24th June to the 28th of July 2011 aboard the R/V Knorr.   The second cruise was in the Southern Ocean during February and March of 2012 aboard the R/V Tangaroa. \n\nDuring the Knorr springtime North Atlantic deployment flux measurements covered a wind speed range up to 20 ms-1.  Simultaneous measurements of whitecaps and wave height were also carried out.  Overall, the Knorr kDMS measurements exhibited a linear relationship with wind speed at low-intermediate wind speeds, consistent with earlier observations and the NOAA/COARE model.  High winds were encountered during a storm at the end of the cruise.  Under these conditions, the dependence of kDMS on wind speed weakened, with kDMS leveling-off or decreasing at the highest wind speeds.  These observations were associated with the presence of large wind-driven waves and point towards some form of wind/wave interaction, such as the \"flow separation/wave shielding\" hypothesis.  Analysis of the CO2 flux data suggests that the high wind speed rollover was not as pronounced.  This is presumably because for the less soluble CO2, bubble-mediated gas transfer should compensate for any leveling off of interfacial transfer under high wind conditions.  The data show kCO2 increasing at wind speeds above 11 ms-1, the onset of whitecaps, but not with the quadratic behavior predicted by dual tracer measurements.  Although there is considerable scatter in the kCO2 measurements, these data are the first direct observations showing the divergence in kDMS and kCO2 at high wind speeds.  Analysis of the southern ocean cruise dataset is ongoing. Preliminary analysis of the DMS data suggests that the data largely agrees with previous measurements and the NOAA COARE model up to the maximum observed wind speed of 15 ms-1.  In contrast to the Knorr 2011 cruise, k do not level off as w..."
