 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\r\n(Public Law 111-5).\"\r\nCollaborative Research: Synthesis and Integration of Magmagenetic Controls for\r\nSubduction Factory focus sites\r\nIntellectual Merit: The MARGINS program ends in 2009, and the organization,\r\nsynthesis, and integration of the most important results is a high priority for each of the\r\nfour experiments. This proposal outlines a 3-year collaborative effort (between 5 US and\r\n2 Japanese scientists) to do this for key aspects of the Subduction Factory experiment.\r\nIn co-operation with the LDEO database group, geochemical and isotopic data for fresh,\r\nyoung igneous rocks from the Izu-Bonin-Mariana and Central America Subduction\r\nFactory focus sites will be compiled and filtered to generate a Subduction Factory\r\nGeochemical Reference Library of high-quality data for each arc system. Forward\r\nmodels to explain the most important differences between the chemical and isotopic\r\ncompositions of lavas erupted from the volcanic front and rear-arc volcanoes at the two\r\nfocus sites will be generated and tested against compositions in this Library. Models will\r\nbe site-specific, using all available geophysical observations to generate thermal\r\nstructure and melt distribution models appropriate for each focus site. Best estimates for\r\nthe compositions of subducted sediments and oceanic crust at each focus site will be\r\nused as input to thermodynamic models simulating equilibrium metamorphic reactions,\r\ndehydration, and melting of subducted sediments and oceanic crust (slab) within the\r\nsubduction zone. Interaction of these slab fluids and melts with overlying mantle\r\nperidotite to yield primitive basalt will be modeled using the \"Arc Basalt Simulator\"\r\n(ABS), an Excel macro that explicitly separates key forcing functions and is designed to\r\nbe flexible and accessible. Several improvements to ABS will also be accomplished\r\nduring this project.\r\nBroader Impacts: This project is in response to calls for synthesis and integration efforts\r\nby the 2004 MARGINS Review Committee. Dissemination of results and training Earth\r\nscientists to use ABS will be accomplished at two free workshops at national scientific\r\nmeetings. A lesson plan that uses ABS and the Subduction Factory Geochemical\r\nLibrary to explore the most important controls on subduction-zone magma genesis will\r\nbe developed; this will be aimed at upper division Geoscience majors and beginning\r\ngraduate students. Broader dissemination of the most important results to the general\r\npublic will be accomplished via development of a Wikipedia entry for \"Subduction\r\nFactory\".\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0840794 PI Name:Stern, Robert\r\nPrinted",
