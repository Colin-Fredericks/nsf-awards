 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the third symposium on Emergent Phenomena in Quantum Hall Systems (EPQHS) to be held in Lucca, Italy June 25 - 28, 2009.  The symposium will consider recent exciting advances in the studies of intriguing quantum phases that occur in two-dimensional electron systems when exposed to high magnetic fields and/or are cooled to very low temperatures, close to absolute zero.  The main goals of EPQHS are to bring leading scientists together with young researchers, to evaluate recent developments.  Research in the area of emergent phenomena in quantum hall systems is still in its infancy and much has to be done to clarify and to be able to control the fundamental collective behavior of such many-body systems.  However the novel phenomena may lead to innovative architectures for quantum information processing, novel schemes for spin-dependent transport in solids, and non-dissipative circuit designs based on carbon nanostructures.  New visions that combine research at the frontiers of science with potential applications will be discussed.  An international committee of senior researchers has organized the workshop. NSF support will enable young US scientists with diverse backgrounds and goals to attend and participate in the workshop. The small workshop format will provide an opportunity for the young scientists to present their work and to interact with leading researchers in the field.  There is the potential for the development of future international collaborations to emerge from this workshop.",
