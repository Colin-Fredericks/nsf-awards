 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe Antarctic Meteorological Research Center (AMRC), located at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, serves several communities by maintaining and extending the stewardship of meteorological data pertinent to the Antarctic continent, its surrounding islands, ice sheets and ice margins and the adjacent Southern Ocean. This data will continue to be made freely available to interested researchers and the general public. Activities of particular interest for the current award include the development of an enhanced data portal to provide improved data and analysis tools to the research community, and to continue to add to the evolution of the Antarctic-Internet Data Distribution system, which is meant to overcome the costly and generally low bandwidth internet connectivity to and from the Antarctic continent. Operational forecasting for logistical activities in the Antarctic, as well as active Antarctic meteorological research programs, are clearly in need of a dependable, steady flow of meteorological observations, model output, and related data in what must be a collaborative environment in order to overcome the otherwise distributed nature of Antarctic meteorological and climatological observations.\r\n\r\nAMRC interaction with the public through answering e-mail questions, giving informal public lectures and presentations to K-12 education institutions through visits to schools will help to raise science literacy with regards to meteorology and of the Antarctic and polar regions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n",
