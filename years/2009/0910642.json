 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMaize is an important biological research system with a long and rich history. Over the past century, an active research community has grown up around the available extensive genetic tools and diverse germplasm. In this time, maize has become a leading system for addressing fundamental questions in genetics such as the impact of domestication on genome structure, the molecular basis of heterosis (hybrid vigor), and role of transposons in genome evolution. Research on maize has led to major advances in our understanding of fundamental life processes in plants such as reproduction, seed formation, germination, photosynthesis, and biosynthesis of primary metabolites including amino acids, carbohydrates and fatty acids. A genome sequence is a logical next step to enable the best use of maize as an experimental system and in order to translate research advances into improved crops.  A draft sequence of the maize genome was generated, funded as part of the Maize Genome Sequencing Project: An NSF/DOE/USDA Joint Program, and released in February 2008.  This project seeks to provide additional analysis and annotation information and provide the research community with a continuous, annotated reference genome sequence for maize.  The specific aims of the project are to: 1) sequence and finish 500 fosmid clones; 2) produce an eight-fold (8X) whole genome shotgun sequence using a 454 platform; and 2) increase the scope of the genome assembly, analysis and annotation.  \r\n\r\nThe early impact of the current version of the maize genome sequence has been considerable.  This project will provide the additional information and annotation to the reference sequence that will enable continued use of maize as an experimental system for advancing fundamental biology as well as the development of new and improved maize varieties in the public and private sector.  Project information and data will be available through a web site accessible through the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center (http://www.genome.wustl.edu). Maize sequence assemblies and maize genetic resources will be incorporated into Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) and MaizeGDB (http://www.maizegdb.org).\r\n",
