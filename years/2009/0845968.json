 "awd_abstract_narration": "The exponentially increasing demands for heterogenous services\r\nover Internet and wireless networks have imposed new urgency\r\nand great challenges for designing next-generation networks\r\nthat achieve higher throughput, better resiliency to adversary\r\nattacks, and stronger security for sensitive information.\r\nRecently, a new network coding paradigm has emerged, which\r\npotentially achieves the above goals simultaneously in an\r\noptimal fashion. Nonetheless, to realize fully its promised\r\nbenefits requires a clean-slate methodology of network code\r\ndesign that achieves optimal performance and maintains low\r\ncomplexity while reacting quickly to the ever changing network\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nTo that end, the investigators study coded feedback, which\r\ngeneralizes the conventional feedback mechanism that\r\nacknowledges non-coded traffic by incorporating the unique\r\nalgebraic structure of network-coding. This research first\r\nexplores the joint algebraic properties between coded forward\r\nand feedback packets, which are the basis for the subsequent\r\ndevelopment of new, efficient network protocols for next\r\ngeneration network codes. In particular, the investigators are\r\ninterested in the roles of coded feedback that transform the\r\nnon-coding network resource allocation algorithms to their\r\ncoding-oriented counterparts. The rich information carried by\r\ncoded feedback is then used to design protocols that offer\r\nenhanced global and local error protection and data security\r\nwhile self-adapting to network changes. The theoretic studies\r\nof this program follow closely practical considerations\r\nincluding the dynamic channel quality and the interference\r\nnature of wireless networks and the complexity of the resulting\r\nprotocols. System-level implementation is used to verify and\r\nfurther refine the theoretic findings of this program. The\r\ncoordinated approaches of coding theory, graph theory, and\r\nnetwork optimizations provide valuable interdisciplinary\r\ntraining for students with Purdue University.\r\n",
