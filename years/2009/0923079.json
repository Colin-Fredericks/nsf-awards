 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to acquire a semiconductor device analyzer and a probe station to improve the research capability on high-speed transistors, micro-electro-mechanical-systems switches, solar cells and high-dielectric constant metal oxides at Morehead State University. The device analyzer supports current-voltage measurements and quasi-state and multi-frequency capacitance-voltage measurements. The probe station is used to build an electrical link between the device analyzer and a device under testing. The instruments will be integrated to the existing related courses. The instrumentation will increase the ability and scope of research and research training, and improve the quality and efficiency of teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is fourfold. The research on high-speed transistors will be conducted to identify the role of dielectric passivation at device degradation and the effect of barrier metal on ohmic contacts. The research on micro-electro-mechanical-systems switches includes investigation of the possibility of using small mechanical springs to mitigate contact stiction and mechanical damages. Research on solar cells is conducted to gain understanding of the influence of fundamental physical factors on cell performance. The research on high-dielectric constant materials will gain insight into new gate oxide/substrate interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe project will have significant broader impacts. The instrumentation will 1) enable the faculty involved to conduct their active research projects and initiate new research programs; 2) offer long-term educational benefits to future students; 3) boost recruitment and retention of underprepared and underrepresented students into engineering, and 4) better serve community colleges and K-12 schools.",
