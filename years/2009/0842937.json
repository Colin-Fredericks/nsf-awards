 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robustness and plasticity are two fundamental properties of living organisms required to sustain their ability to adapt to the changing environment. The brain contains a complex neural network enabling individuals to make rapid as well as sustained adjustments to their behavior and physiological functions to cope with unexpected stresses such as overcrowding, temperature changes, and food shortages. This neural network is a set of anatomical structures interconnected by signaling molecules that is termed the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.  This network regulates responses to stress and plays a fundamental role in adaptation in all vertebrates. Within this network, the neurohormone vasotocin has a wide range of physiological and behavioral effects in all sub-mammalian vertebrate classes. The planned studies have three goals. First, the collaborative team will determine how various cellular and molecular components of the vasotocin system interact during stress. Second, they will characterize the changes in these interactions when an acute stress exposure instead becomes a chronic one. Third, the structural and molecular basis for concerted effects of vasotocin and another neurohormone, corticotrophin-releasing hormone, on an animal's adaptation to stress will be examined. The proposed activity is a joint effort of two very different educational institutions, a land grant university with a major agricultural focus and an academic health sciences center, both located in Arkansas where fewer training opportunities in neuroscience exist. The successful collaboration will demonstrate to students, who will be trained and introduced to a number of up-to-date techniques, the importance of networking between diverse academic cultures to advance knowledge and build unique scientific careers.",

It was not well known which neural structures in the avian brain were involved in the pathway responsible for stimulating the anterior pituitary to produce a stress hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). There exist at least six different cell types in the pituitary and only one type, corticotropes, produce the hormone ACTH.  Corticotropes require specific receptors to activate ACTH production. In birds, our goal was to identify those receptors on corticotropes.  Our group utilized a variety of techniques to identify neural groups activated by a stressor as well as determined the major receptors on corticotropes involved in the avian stress pathway.  The stress used was immobilization, a psychological stressor.  To identify the type of neuron stimulated by the stressor, we focused on corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasotocin (AVT) neurons, well-known key drivers of the stress pathway. We identified AVT and CRH neurons in the chick brain and determined which type neuron was activated utilizing Fos immunostaining.\n\nIn the pituitary, there were six possible receptor types responsible for mediating the stress pathway: two CRH receptors (CRH-R1 and CRH-R2) and four vasotocin receptors (VT1-VT4R).  Measuring gene expression using real time RT-PCR after an imposed stress showed, for the first time, that the VT2R and VT4R played key roles in psychological stress as well as both  CRH-R1 and CRH-R2. Specific antibodies to the avian VT2R and VT4R were developed.  Using immunocytochemistry, both receptors were shown located on corticotropes.\n\nRecent research efforts focused on the VT4R where we built a three dimensional (3D) model of the avian VT4R and utilized software programs to find the receptor binding pocket.  We tested several antagonists developed for the mammalian vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR), a receptor proposed equivalent to the avian VT4R.  Binding affinity values for each antagonist were determined.  A second, assay was developed where chicken pituitary cells were maintained in cell culture and mammalian antagonists were added to determine which ones were most effective in blocking the production of a pituitary molecule containing the mRNA sequence of avian ACTH.  Both the 3D modeling and cell culture procedures identified the same, top antagonist, SR49059, as most effective antagonist of the avian VT4R.  Administering SR49059 to chickens prior to an imposed stress resulted in significantly reducing the adrenal stress hormone, corticosterone.  Hence the identified receptor antagonist of the avian VT4R that performed well in cell culture also worked effectively in vivo. Importantly, our experiments produced functional evidence that the avian VT4R is equivalent to the established mammalian V1aR.\n\nWe also mapped the distribution of the VT4R throughout the avian brain.  Many groups of neurons contained the VT4R.  Unexpectedly immunostaining of glia also occurred.  Glia are non-neuronal cells that are at least three times more abundant than neurons in vertebrate brains.  Glia containing the VT4R were abundant in some regions lining the ventricles of the brain.\n\nOur research studies involved diverse training and professional development for post-doctoral research associates, graduate and undergraduate students. Both postdocs were active in training students, presenting at national scientific meetings, and establishing active research programs.  Experiments in our laboratories ranged from molecular modeling to physiological and behavioral studies with genetic lines of birds, surgical procedures, sampling of organs, and use of cell cultures and molecular techniques.  Post-docs and graduate students give oral presentations or presented posters at national meetings each year. This past academic year a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. published his first paper, while two other graduate students completed M.S. degrees. One of the..."
