A part of the project deals\r\nwith noncommutative differential calculus which is one of the\r\ncentral tools in the above. By noncommutative differential\r\ncalculus we mean the study of algebraic structures arising from\r\nthe standard differential calculus on manifolds, defined in terms\r\nin such a way that is valid of the algebra of functions on a\r\nmanifold and in such a way that is valid if this algebra is\r\nreplaced by any algebra, commutative or not. This leads to the\r\nstudy of algebraic structures on Hochschild chain and cochain\r\ncomplexes of an algebra; those complexes play the role of\r\ndifferential forms and multivector fields, a development of works\r\nof Dolgushev-Tamarkin-Tsygan, Kontsevich-Soibelman, Costello,\r\nLurie and other authors. The techniques of noncommutative\r\ncalculus will be applied to obtain new index theorems and\r\ntheorems about the determinant of the cohomology of elliptic\r\nsystems, generalizing recent results of Beilinson. Also, the\r\nproject will study a new object on a symplectic manifold that we\r\ncall an oscillatory module. These objects are modules over\r\ndeformed algebras of functions on a manifold, but with extra\r\nstructures that make their category much closer to the Fukaya\r\ncategory. This extra structure is largely motivated by microlocal\r\nmethods in partial differential equations, in particular the WKB\r\nmethod. This is a part of a series of works that try to\r\nunderstand mirror symmetry microlocally (Bressler-Soibelman,\r\nKapustin-Witten, Nadler-Zaslow, Gukov-Witten, Tamarkin).\r\n\r\nThere are three related parts in the project: noncommutative\r\ncalculus, index theory, and oscillatory modules. Noncommutative\r\ncalculus is a theory that describes parts of the standard\r\ndifferential calculus in such a way that it can be applied in\r\nsituations more general than that of an ordinary space, in\r\nparticular when, for coordinates on our imaginary \"space\", the\r\nequation xy=yx is no longer required. Index theory is a part of\r\nthe theory of differential equations that expresses the number of\r\nsolutions of an equation in terms of the topology of the\r\nunderlying space. Oscillatory modules are objects on geometric\r\nspaces that describe the motion of quantum particles on these\r\nspaces (in other words, they treat the space in question as the\r\nphase space of a quantum mechanical system). These objects are\r\nintended to be applied to study other invariants of these spaces,\r\nalso physically motivated and much more complicated; they are\r\ncalled A-branes and describe the motion of a quantum string on\r\nour space.  They are called A-branes and are subject of much\r\ncurrent research in mathematical physics and geometry. Let us\r\nfinish by explaining why noncommutative calculus is natural for\r\napplications both in differential equations and in quantum\r\nmechanics. Indeed,if x and y are basic operations with\r\nfunctions, for example multiplication by some function and\r\ndifferentiation, then xy differs from yx, in the sense that, if\r\nyou apply them in different orders, you get different\r\nresults. Similarly, in quantum mechanics, if x is the position of\r\na particle and y is its momentum, then xy differs from yx; this\r\nis a mathematical expression of the Heisenberg uncertainty\r\nprinciple.\r\n",
