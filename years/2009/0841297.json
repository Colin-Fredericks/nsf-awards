 "awd_abstract_narration": "Promoting Ocean Literacy Through CAMEOS:\r\nCoastal, Atmospheric, and Marine Environmental Observing Studies\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) CAMEOS program connects graduate student research and K-12 science curricula to ocean literacy principles, marine laboratory resources, and environmental technology. BML?s atmospheric, earth, ocean, and computer scientists partner with science education experts to give graduate students life-long skills in inquiry-based teaching, science content, environmental observing technology, and cyber-infrastructure. Graduate fellows then use their own investigations and training to develop motivational research projects that provide field experiences and access to start-of-the-art sensor networks for middle and high school students. Use of new environmental observing systems and cyber-infrastructure transforms STEM teaching at all academic levels by offering exploration and data-gathering tools for field studies, collaboration, and real and ?virtual? research experiences in classrooms and laboratories. K-12 teachers and students are presented with science role models and opportunities to practice all tasks performed by professional scientists, from creating research questions and collecting data to sharing results at scientific conferences.  \r\nOcean processes are at the heart of global climate predictions and failing fisheries, but are poorly understood by the general public. Broad ocean literacy is needed to build ocean stewardship, strengthen science literacy, and create a new generation of ocean leaders. CAMEOS builds on national ocean and science literacy initiatives, and broadens participation of under-represented graduate and K-12 students in inquiry-based STEM education. Program participants and users of CAMEOS curricula and resources gain a greater understanding of the importance of ocean processes, technological tools, and research to their daily lives, science education, resource management, and environmental stewardship.\r\n",

Fellows now occupy positions in academia, government, and the computer science industry. The fellows also contributed to public outreach through news media, briefing managers, policy makers and elected officials, and volunteerism in their communities including in public school enrichment and coastal clean-up programs.\n\nK-12 Science and Mathematics Education- The project served 12 schools with approximately 600 students (K6-12) in each of five years in northern California. On average, 34% of the students of these schools were Hispanic (range: 0-79%), 38% were economically disadvantaged (range: 7-93%), and 13% had limited English proficiency (range: 1-50%). Through participation, students expressed more positive views of science as a profession and importantly, gained great confidence in their abilities to do challenging independent work, and gained enhanced mathematics, analytical, and communication skills (including enhanced English).\n\nGlobal, cross-culturally competent scientific workforce- As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and US companies need to compete in such a world, it is a priority to build a global scientific workforce. The project helped build an international cross-cultural workforce through its collaboration with an Indonesian university, in which 17 US scientists participated, ranging from MS-level through faculty. These scientists gained a multicultural experience, put science communication skills to practice, received practical training in coral reef, seagrass, and marine biodiversity research, and helped build science capacity in a fast-growing, developing nation. The project reached over 200 islanders living traditionally and approximately 300 K-12 students through outreach on the marine environment and science and SCUBA diving physiology for island fishers who had no previous knowledge of diving-related illnesses. The project also collaborated with Mars, Inc. to provide private business experience for participants and to help develop alternative livelihoods to destructive and diminishing fisheries resources.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan L Williams"
