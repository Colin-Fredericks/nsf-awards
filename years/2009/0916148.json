 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed project will develop a framework for organizing images that allows the specific types of relationships between those images to be represented, manipulated, highlighted, enhanced, and studied. The technical challenges involve building new representational and algorithmic systems to capture the major \"longitudinal categories\" that relate heterogeneous images to each other within collections. The problem of relationship between images is normally posed through registration, which is most often highly contextualized.  This work will capture the steps necessary to specify registration as a metadata construction that enables a range of granularities in mapping images to each other, and heterogeneous relationship across organizational categories such as time (diachronic), multi-modal, and instances related by a semantic object. The work is highly interdisciplinary and results can be generalized to other problem sets.",
