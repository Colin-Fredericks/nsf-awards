The planned symposium overviews the very recent developments in science and engineering of responsive nanoparticles and colloidal systems with special emphasis on new biomimetic systems and applications for biosensors.\r\nResponsive polymer materials can adapt to surrounding environments, regulate transport of ions and molecules, change wettability and adhesion of different species upon external stimuli, or convert chemical and biochemical signals into optical, electrical, thermal, and mechanical signals and vice versa.  These materials have played an increasingly important role in a diverse range of applications, such as drug delivery, diagnostic, tissue engineering, and ?smart? optical systems, as well as biosensors, microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS), coatings, and textiles.\r\n\r\nThe present symposium will help to integrate various aspects of the responsive colloidal systems? study in the event open for a wide community of engineers, materials scientists and students and involve the brightest undergraduate and graduate students in modern areas of biosensors, colloidal and material science, and biotechnology.",
