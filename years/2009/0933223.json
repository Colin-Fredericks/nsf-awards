Thiol-based conjugation chemistry for attaching probes onto nanowire needle/electrode surfaces will be designed and later exploited for realizing near instantaneous and targeted release of the attached probes inside cells or sub-cellular structures.  We will further demonstrate the site specific delivery of magnetic nanoparticles and the intracellular mechanical studies with magnetic twisting cytometry to determine heterogeneity of stress propagation, important for understanding mechanotransduction pathways of cells.  The development represents thus a potentially transformational improvement over the existing methods, and can open up novel venues to conjure innovative strategies, which otherwise would be impractical or even impossible, for the advanced biological studies of living cells. New tools developed in this proposal will be made available for members in the research community to significantly benefit the expanded studies of diversified and fundamental problems in cell biology.  The method and technology developed in this project are also appealing subjects for the education of students and the public.",
