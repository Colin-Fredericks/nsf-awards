These form an ideal laboratory for studying one-dimensional behavior of electrons.  The response of the nanotube to light will be measured, to determine how the individual electrons act collectively, and in what ways this differs from the behavior of macroscopic, three-dimensional conductors.  This is important for understanding the possible use of nanotubes as interconnecting wires in future microcircuits.  The broad range of research skills to be learned in microfabrication, optics, materials science and cryogenics will prepare graduate and undergraduate students for diverse career paths.   Some of the advances in scientific understanding due to this research will be incorporated into an undergraduate seminar, Science of Modern Technology.  In addition, visits to local elementary schools will have demonstrations of some of the ideas of optics and cryogenics that are used in the research. \r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThis research program will develop understanding of novel one-dimensional electrical conductors; the metallic single-wall carbon nanotube, and the newly synthesized boron nanotubes.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to characterize the high-frequency dynamic electrical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes, and learn what properties are uniquely determined by the one-dimensional nature of the nanotube.  The first studies explored how the electrons in the nanotube lose their excess energy.  The nanotube was situated on a silicon-dioxide coated substrate.  This study confirmed the one-dimensional nature of the interactions that exchange energy. At low temperatures, below about 100 K, the energetic electrons emit phonons into the nanotube, and these lattice vibrations quickly pass into the substrate.  At higher temperatures the phonons are emitted directly into the substrate, because of the polar aspect of the silicon dioxide.  Many potential applications of such nanotubes require an understanding of this energy exchange, and benefit from these results.   The next study explored the dynamic electrical properties at radio frequencies (MHz frequencies).  This study demonstrated that these properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes are fully predicted, at higher temperature or current, from the electron energy loss studies done previously. This direct relation to the energy-loss mechanisms had not been established previously.  At low temperatures and low current, the effect of the weakly-rectifying contacts become important.   The most recent studies were conducted at yet higher (Terahertz) frequencies.  These studies proved that the electrical response of the nanotube to high frequency currents is determined by the effect of these currents on the weakly-rectifying electrical contacts.  This finding provides the key for future scientific studies and for possible technical applications of nanotubes in this high frequency range.  \n\n \n\n??\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel E Prober"
