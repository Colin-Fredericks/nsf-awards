 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this travel grant is to support 10-12 graduate students from the United States, particularly those from underrepresented groups and institutions that traditionally lack funding for such support, to attend the 10th IEEE International Symposium on World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networking (WoWMoM 2009) that will be held in Kos, Greece, from June 15 to June 18, 2009. Since its inception, WoWMoM has been a high quality conference and the premier technical forum dedicated to addressing both the theoretical and real-world challenges in wireless mobile multimedia networking. This grant provides an opportunity for the students to be exposed to the cutting research in the field of wireless multimedia networking, and to interact with peers and leading researchers from other institutions. The participation of deserving students in WoWMoM will not only help their future careers but also will positively affect the future of the research in wireless multimedia networks.\r\n\r\nThe student selection process will consider the following: 1) students from groups traditionally underrepresented; 2) students from universities that traditionally lack funding to support graduate student attendance at conferences; and 3) students who will present their papers during the conference. Priority will be given to the graduate students from underrepresented groups, such as women, African American, Hispanics, and Native American students, and from universities that lack financial resources.\r\n",
