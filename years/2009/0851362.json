Charles Liu (City University of New York (CUNY) - Staten Island) and James Webster (American Museum of Natural History) will continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the American Museum of Natural History. The Site will provide opportunities for undergraduates to conduct experimental, observational, theoretical, and computational research activity in earth science, planetary science, and astrophysics.  Aside from their primary research activities, students will also participate in Museum programs; attend field trips and scientific colloquia and, as appropriate, conferences to present research; and report on their work at the end of their summer experience, in both a written scientific paper and a 15-minute oral presentation in a multidisciplinary scientific symposium open to the general public.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigators will focus particular effort on the inclusion of CUNY students as participants in this REU site in an effort to attract students from populations which are currently underserved and underrepresented in the sciences.",
