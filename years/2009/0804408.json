Efforts will be directed towards gaining new understanding of organic superconductors and molecular nanomagnets. A unifying theme involves the use of magnetic resonance to obtain detailed structural information for these molecule-based materials, with a particular focus on the importance of molecular and/or crystal symmetries and their consequences in terms of the resulting material properties. The proposed research relies heavily on new experimental methods developed recently by the PI, permitting studies in magnetic fields of up to 45 tesla at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). Combining these capabilities with high pressures will also be explored. This is an interdisciplinary research field that is ideally suited to a university/national lab setting, and especially suitable for student research experiences. Work will be performed predominantly by graduate and undergraduate students at Florida State University and at the NHMFL. As in the past, the PI will also train young scientist through several local programs which support summer research experiences for local high school students and undergraduates from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\n\r\nThis project will explore the consequences of electronic interactions in anisotropic crystals, with particular focus on the role of symmetry in stabilizing electronic and magnetic order. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is perfectly suited to this problem: studies as a function of field orientation will probe the spatial symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian, and dipole selection rules will provide information about additional symmetries. Specific problems include: (i) the origin of ?missing? Drude weight in organic superconductors; (ii) the correspondence between electronic structure and superconducting symmetry in organics and oxides; (iii) the search for a spin-supersolid; and (iv) the relevance of antisymmetric exchange in molecular nanomagnets and ordered spin systems.
