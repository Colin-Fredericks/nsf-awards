Hunt, Jr. and Sandip Ray\r\n                 Department of Computer Sciences\r\n                  University of Texas at Austin\r\n\r\n                   {hunt,sandip}@cs.utexas.edu\r\n\r\nReactive concurrent systems, such as routers, consist of a number of\r\ninteracting processes that perform non-terminating computations\r\nwhile receiving and transmitting messages.  The design of such\r\nrouting systems is error-prone, and non-determinism inherent in\r\nconcurrent communications makes it hard to detect or diagnose such\r\nerrors.  Our effort will develop ACL2-based tools for ensuring\r\ntrustworthy execution of large-scale reactive routing systems.\r\n\r\nWe aim to develop a scalable, mechanized infrastructure for\r\ncertifying correct and secure execution of reactive routing system\r\nimplementations through:  a generic framework for modeling and\r\nspecifying systems at a number of abstraction layers; a\r\ncompositional methodology for mathematically analyzing such models;\r\nand developing a suite of tools and techniques to mechanize and\r\nautomate such analysis within a unified logical foundation.  Our\r\nresearch exploits ACL2's general-purpose reasoning engine while\r\naugmenting the tool suite with a streamlined modeling and\r\nspecification methodology.  We will develop a collection of targeted\r\ntools for verifying safety, liveness, and security properties of\r\nsuch systems while staying within a single logic and proof system.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate verification of correspondence between protocol\r\nlayers, we propose to enhance ACL2's reasoning engine with automated\r\nverification tools based on advances in BDD- and SAT-based\r\ntechniques.  The invention and proof of inductive invariants is one\r\nof the most time-consuming activities in reactive system\r\nverification, and we will integrate into ACL2 a general-purpose\r\nsymbolic simulation capability; this technique can symbolically\r\nsimulate system models over a large number of computation steps,\r\nthereby often obviating the construction of single-step inductive\r\ninvariants.  The expected results will help automate the mechanical\r\nverification of reactive systems such as routers and CPSs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
