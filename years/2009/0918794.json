The project is developing and testing the effectiveness of an extensive set of such learning tools, companion print materials as needed to assist learners in developing conceptual understanding, and short video clips documenting best practices by exemplary teachers using the developed materials with students.\r\n\r\nA pilot study in year 3 and a substantial randomized control trial in year 4 are testing the effects of using the Math Snacks software on student learning and retention of middle school mathematics, as measured by performance on disaggregated strands of New Mexico state mathematics assessments. Thus the project will produce software applets, teacher materials, and useful empirical evidence about the efficacy of their use.\r\n\r\nOne of the key features of the Math Snacks project is development of the mediated games and simulations in a form that can be used by students outside of normal classroom settings on media and game players that are ubiquitous and popular among today's young people.  Thus the project holds the promise of exploiting learning in informal settings to enhance traditional school experiences.",
