 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of university, government and private sector entities to successfully research and control plant diseases, or to improve crop productivity, depends upon the ability of agricultural colleges and universities across the US to prepare students with a strong knowledge of the plant sciences, including plant pathology, and the ability to apply that knowledge to agricultural productivity. However, the historic strength of this vital feeder system is at risk. Recent data documents a decline in the numbers of students entering the plant sciences and a nationwide loss of faculty numbers and expertise diversity, particularly those with experience in translational field research. These trends are occurring against the backdrop of a demographic profile that portends unusually large numbers of faculty retirements over the next 10 years. This workshop will bring together leaders of plant science-related professional societies, educators, government leaders, employers and students to (1) understand the current and projected status of plant pathology and plant science education in the US, (2) identify strategies for working together to strengthen plant science education, and (3) develop action plans for carrying out the proposed strategies. The American Phytopathological Society will act as convener of this workshop because the nature of plant pathology, as a cross-cutting and integrative discipline, makes it well-suited as a \"model system\" for national discussion and strategic planning regarding the plant sciences. Funding provided by NSF will be used to broaden participation of students, early career individuals, women, and those from underrepresented groups from the US scientific community.  A report that summarizes the outcomes from the workshop with proposed action items will be distributed to the American Phytopathological Society and partner societies and presented at a special symposium to be held at the 2009 Annual American Phytopathological Society meeting (August 1-5, 2009) in Portland (OR).",
