 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5.\r\n\r\nThe Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Georgia Institute of Technology will continue to offer summer research opportunities for undergraduate students recruited nationwide and teachers from inner-city and suburban public high schools in the Atlanta area.  Research topics are in multidisciplinary areas of Materials Science and Engineering and are grouped under three categories: (1) Materials for biological and sensor applications, (2) Materials for structural and extreme environments, and (3) Materials for energy applications.  The REU program is for 8 weeks and will support 14 undergraduates and 6 teachers each year during 2009 to 2013.  Participants receive research training in the laboratories of faculty mentors at Georgia Tech.  Some students also participate in international research experience at institutions in Brazil, China, England, Japan, and Singapore, through established collaborations between faculty mentors at Georgia Tech and researchers at institutions abroad.  While being immersed in one-on-one research with the faculty, the students attend presentations on various materials related topics, laboratory safety, technical communication, and guidelines for graduate school preparation. In addition, a one-day workshop on professional development focusing on ethics, entrepreneurship and public policy is also offered. The training fosters team work and prepares the participants to address difficult technological problems requiring multi-disciplinary and globally engaging approaches.   \r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate of National Science Foundation.",
