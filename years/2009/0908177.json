On the other hand,\r\ndeviations from the assumed linear relationship between the\r\npressure gradient and fluid velocity occur even at low Reynolds\r\nnumbers, and in porous media containing fractures.  Though these\r\ndeviations are commonly attributed to inertial forces, the actual\r\nnature of this phenomenon is not adequately understood.  The\r\nobjective of this project is to arrive at a model that transforms\r\ncurrent understanding and prediction of fluid flow in\r\nheterogeneous porous media.  Approaches and methodologies from\r\npartial differential equations, computational fluid dynamics, and\r\ndifferential geometry are deployed to attain this goal.  The\r\nmodels and methods involved include the following: a family of\r\ngeneralized nonlinear flow models, which spans existing models\r\nand forecasts new ones; a mathematical theory of the nonlinear\r\nDarcy equation where the permeability tensor depends on the\r\ngradient of pressure; a thorough study of the dynamics and\r\nrobustness of the equations; analysis of solutions to\r\nNavier-Stokes-Forchheimer equations; applications of the methods\r\nof differential geometry to nonlinear hydrodynamic flows; a\r\nmathematical model for coupled flows in discontinuous fractured\r\nmedia; computational methods to investigate the stability and\r\nconvergence of the multigrid algorithm for coupling nonlinear\r\nmultiphase flows in highly irregular porous media. \r\n\r\n     This project aims to better understand the complex phenomena\r\nof fluid filtration observed in nature or arising in modern\r\ntechnology and industry.  The work provides a novel theoretical\r\nand numerical framework to explore a wide class of nonlinear\r\nflows in porous media.  The methodology is based on modern\r\nresearch in nonlinear partial differential equations, real\r\nanalysis and geometry, as well as new numerical methods in\r\ncomputational fluid dynamics.  The mathematical models and\r\nmethods are novel, and their applications are not limited to\r\nnonlinear fluid filtration in porous media.  The research is\r\nintegrated in educational programs spanning various special\r\ntopics.  The results of this project are disseminated not only\r\nthrough professional meetings and journal publications, but also\r\nthrough a network of collaborations and partnerships with\r\nindustrial and reservoir engineering companies interested in\r\nemploying the tools developed in the course of the project.  On a\r\nlarger scale, results of the project bear on the prediction and\r\nevaluation of complex bio-hydrodynamic processes in the lumen and\r\narterial walls, transport of microorganisms in soil, new\r\ntechniques for image processing, and management of the nation's\r\ngroundwater and energy resources. \r\n",
