 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes, jointly with Toby Colding,  to continue our\r\ninvestigations on minimal surfaces and related areas of geometric\r\nanalysis, including geometric evolution equations such as the mean\r\ncurvature (MCF) and Ricci flow.    Our lamination theorem and one-sided curvature estimate\r\nplayed a key role in a number of results on minimal surfaces including the\r\nMeeks-Rosenberg proof of uniqueness of the helicoid,   our proof\r\nof the Calabi-Yau Conjectures, and the Meeks-Perez-Ros proof of\r\nthe uniqueness of the Riemann examples.\r\n  Minimal surfaces with uniform curvature (or area) bounds have been\r\nwell understood and the regularity theory is complete, yet\r\nessentially nothing was known without such bounds.     The study is\r\ndivided into three cases depending on the topology of the surface.  Our understanding is relatively complete in the first case when\r\n  the surface is a disk.\r\nThe main problems are to get  a finer understanding of compactness in the higher genus cases, to understand \r\nsingularities of potential limit laminations (especially generic properties), and to understand moduli spaces \r\nlike the space of genus one helicoids of \r\n M. Weber, D. Hoffman and M. Wolf (cf. with Hoffman and B. White).  The second broad area of the proposal centers on the study of singularities in \r\nMCF, including estimates for the size of the singular sets, a compactness theorem for the possible types of singularities, and\r\n a classification of generic singularities of the flow.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMinimal surfaces are surfaces that locally minimize their surface area and, thus, model soap films where surface \r\ntension is in perfect equilibrium and the film does not change other time.\r\nThey have been studied at least since\r\n  Lagrange's 1762 memoir, but recent years have seen\r\nbreakthroughs on many long--standing problems in the theory of\r\nminimal surfaces, with important contributions from many\r\nmathematicians.    There is a time-varying analog of this   where a surface (which is not in equilibrium) evolves to minimize its surface area as quickly as possible; this is called mean curvature flow or MCF.  Mathematically, this leads to a nonlinear partial differential equation  which is formally similar to the equation that governs the flow of heat in physics.  Clearly, minimal surfaces remain static under the MCF. \r\nMCF   and other geometric flows were   developed for their intrinsic beauty as well as their  \r\npotential applications to other   &#64257;elds \r\nto model, for instance, option pricing, motion of grains in annealing metals, and crystal \r\ngrowth.\r\nWhile key foundational results have been obtained, several of the most basic questions \r\nremain unanswered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
