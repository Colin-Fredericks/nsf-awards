 "awd_abstract_narration": "2009 Fall Workshop on Computational Geometry\r\n\r\n\r\nComputational geometry has rapidly emerged as a field of intense\r\nresearch in computer science and many related disciplines. Since many\r\nof the computations associated with both real and simulated physical\r\nsystems are geometric in nature, research in computational geometry\r\nhas been fueled by applications in numerous fields, such as computer\r\ngraphics, geometric modeling, molecular biology, sensor networks,\r\nengineering design, robotics, machine vision, data mining, and\r\nstatistics, to mention just a few.  All of these areas are on the\r\nforefront of current research activity in computational geometry.\r\n\r\nThe Fall Workshop in Computational Geometry will be organized at the\r\nDepartment of Computer Science of Tufts University, Medford, MA,\r\nNovember 13-14, 2009.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers from academia\r\nand industry, to stimulate collaboration on problems of common\r\ninterest arising in all areas of geometric computing.  The proximity\r\nto many universities in the Northeast will facilitate student\r\ninvolvement; requested funding is targeted particularly at making the\r\nworkshop accessible to students, both graduate and undergraduate.\r\n\r\nFollowing the tradition of the previous workshops on Computational\r\nGeometry, the format of the workshop will be informal, extending over\r\ntwo days, with several breaks scheduled for discussions.  There will\r\nbe a few (three to four) invited speakers, selected to speak on topics\r\nof mutual interest in computational geometry, computer graphics, and\r\nrobotics. A key focus of the workshop will be an Open Problem Forum in\r\norder to promote a free exchange of questions and research challenges.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will have broader impact in its education and involvement\r\nof students and young researchers, who will be exposed to the latest\r\ndevelopments in the field and will be given opportunities to present\r\ntalks and posters on their own work.  The workshop is designed to\r\npromote collaborations between computational geometry specialists and\r\nother experts in mathematical sciences and related scientific and\r\nengineering disciplines, in hopes of forming new alliances between the\r\nfield of geometric algorithms and the many application domains in\r\nwhich geometric problems and issues arise.\r\n\r\nFurther information, announcements, and the workshop program will be\r\navailable on the workshop website:\r\nhttp://www.cs.tufts.edu/research/geometry/FWCG09/\r\n\r\n",
