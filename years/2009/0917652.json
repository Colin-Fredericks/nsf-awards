 "awd_abstract_narration": "Independent Production Fund is producing a three-part public television series focusing on the latest research in the science of music.  The programs will explore how cutting-edge science is revealing new connections between music and the human mind and body, the natural world and the cosmos.  The series will follow researchers from a variety of fields including physiology, neuroscience, psychology, biology, physics and education, as they use groundbreaking techniques and technologies to unravel age-old mysteries about music's persistence, universality and emotional power.  It will show how these researchers are shedding valuable new light on the way brains work.  The impact of the programs will be extended through a content-rich companion web site and innovative formal and informal educational-outreach materials to both middle and high school age students, as well as a complementary radio component.  Mannes Productions will produce the series; Goodman Research Group will conduct formative evaluation and Rockman et al  will conduct summative evaluation.  \r\n\r\n",
