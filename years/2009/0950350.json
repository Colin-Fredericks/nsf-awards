Awardees will receive $1,000 each to help defray their travel expenses.  The 2009 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) will take place in Cairo, Egypt, from November 7 to 11, 2009.   The conference is sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society and is the premier forum for the presentation of technological advances and research results in the fields of theoretical, experimental, and applied image and video processing. ICIP 2009, the sixteenth in the series that has been held annually since 1994, will bring together leading engineers and scientists in image processing from around the world. Research frontiers in fields ranging from traditional image processing applications to evolving multimedia and video technologies are regularly advanced by results first reported in ICIP technical sessions. \r\nThe project will lead to enhancements in all fields of image and video processing by enabling a number of young and promising researchers to participate in the discussion and presentation of the latest advances and in theoretical, experimental, and applied image and video processing. Recipients of the travel awards will be selected using the following criteria:  (i) Full-time enrollment in a higher education US institution, (ii) Accepted paper of superior quality as evidenced by the reviews that the submission of the applicant received during the review process, and (iii) Letters of recommendation from academic advisors  commenting about their overall achievements.  No student of any of the selection committee members will receive a travel grant to attend ICIP 2009. \r\n\r\n",
