 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Johnson and his students will investigate microwave flash pyrolysis (MFP), a method developed at UNH. The MFP method greatly extends the range of microwave synthetic chemistry into high temperature regimes; this research will lead to the discovery of new high-energy chemical reactions and a greater understanding of microwave-induced chemical reactions on solid surfaces. Chemical functionalization of graphite, carbon nanotubes and other materials by MFP methods will also be explored. Diverse aspects of pericyclic reactions will be studied, using theory to guide experimental studies. Pericyclic reactions have been commonly applied to make or break molecular rings. In this project, the novel concept of dehydro pericyclic reactions, which involve unusually strained and reactive rings, will serve as a basis for the discovery of new chemical processes. In one additional component of this project, the reactions of ozone with carbonyl compounds will be investigated. Ozone is a highly reactive and short-lived substance. Planned research will lead to new understanding of atmospheric ozone chemistry, and may have applications in organic synthesis.  In a collaborative project with Professor William Bailey at the University of Connecticut, the PI and his students will create computational models for carbenoid reactions, probing critical aspects of mechanism and stereochemistry. New reactions, methods and materials discovered in this work will have broad applications in organic synthesis and materials science. Planned research will serve as professional training for graduate and undergraduate students. In addition to this research, Professor Johnson will develop an outreach program to help high school teachers enhance their chemistry curriculum with computer molecular modeling.",
