 "awd_abstract_narration": "CPS: Small: Collaborative Research: Foundations of Cyber-Physical Networks\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to investigate the foundations,\r\nmethodologies, algorithms and implementations of cyberphysical\r\nnetworks in the context of medical applications. The approach is to\r\ndesign, implement and study Carenet, a medical care network, by\r\ninvestigating three critical issues in the design and construction\r\nof cyberphysical networks: (1) rare event detection and\r\nmultidimensional analysis in cyberphysical data streams, (2)\r\nreliable and trusted data analysis with cyberphysical networks,\r\nincluding veracity analysis for object consolidation and redundancy\r\nelimination, entity resolution and information integration, and\r\nfeedback interaction between cyber- and physical- networks, and (3)\r\nspatiotemporal data analysis including spatiotemporal cluster\r\nanalysis, sequential pattern mining, and evolution of cyberphysical\r\nnetworks.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This project focuses on several most pressing\r\nissues in large-scale cyberphysical networks, and develops\r\nfoundations, principles, methods, and technologies of cyberphysical\r\nnetworks. It will deepen our understanding of the foundations,\r\ndevelop effective and scalable methods for mining such networks,\r\nenrich our understanding of cyberphysical systems, and benefit many\r\nmission-critical applications. The study will enrich the principles\r\nand technologies of both cyberphysical systems and information\r\nnetwork mining.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The project will integrate multiple disciplines,\r\nincluding networked cyberphysical systems, data mining, and\r\ninformation network technology, and advance these frontiers. It will\r\nturn raw data into useful knowledge and facilitate strategically\r\nimportant applications, including the analysis of patient networks,\r\ncombat networks, and traffic networks. Moreover, the project\r\nsystematically generates new knowledge and contains a comprehensive\r\neducation and training plan to promote diversity, publicity, and\r\noutreach.",
