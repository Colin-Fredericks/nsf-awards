 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trace elements are known to play important roles as nutrients in biological cycling, particularly in regard to enzymatic and catalytic processes in the open ocean. Isotopes are valuable tracers of these and related processes, and of the ocean's interaction with the atmosphere and the solid earth, which in turn play a role in shaping many trace element distributions within the ocean. Nevertheless, significant gaps exist in both our knowledge of the larger scale distributions of these TEIs (trace elements and isotopes) in the ocean and in our understanding of the processes responsible for those distributions. This shortfall has implications for numerous scientific endeavors that are relevant to a broad range of intellectual and societal issues, including the carbon cycle and climate change, as well as the marine food web and direct anthropogenic impacts on the oceans. Recent advances in sampling and analytical techniques coupled with a better understanding of the roles of TEIs in ocean biogeochemical cycles present us with an opportunity to rectify this problem. Moreover, we are motivated by the prospect of ongoing global change and the need to understand the present and future workings of the ocean's biogeochemical cycles. \r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Old Dominion University will be funded to handle the management and logistics associated with the first US GEOTRACES zonal section in the North Atlantic as part of a global survey.  With this support they will: 1) organize and mount a 52 day research cruise; 2) manage on-board water sampling, including GO-Flo and Niskin bottle operational QA/QC (quality assessment and control); 3) 0btain, store, and ship back to the U.S. trace-metal clean water samples; 4) monitor trace-metal clean sampling using on-board Zn measurements; 5) acquire, quality control and manage hydrographic data (including CTD, transmissometer, fluorometer, oxygen electrode data, discrete sample salinity and dissolved oxygen measurements, and micromolar and nanomolar inorganic nutrients); 6) QA/QC shipboard measurements and submit data to the GEOTRACES data repository; 7) prepare a framework hydrographic report/synthesis for cruise participants and publication; and 8) coordinate pre- and post-cruise meetings The cruise track and station locations were designed to highlight key processes and identify the major features of key TEIs distributions. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  It is widely agreed that the ocean biogeochemical research community needs a global picture of the key and ancillary GEOTRACES properties; the major impact of this project will be in its service to that community. This service will enable the development of better ocean biogeochemical models so that we can assess the likely impact of future climate change and anthropogenic pollution, and provide a basis for understanding changes observed in past oceans. The development of a reliable platform and procedures for sampling trace metals and isotopes will provide the community with a platform for future oceanographic fieldwork. The development of teams that understand the proper sampling and measurement techniques, many of whom will be graduate students and postdocs, will supply the community with a pool of skills necessary to achieve the goals of the next generation of ocean research programs.",

The campaign took place in two cruises (the first, in October-November 2010 was terminated due to ship propulsion problems, and the second completed the effort in November-December 2011). \nGEOTRACES is an international research effort aimed at determining and studying the global oceanic distributions of a number of key trace elements and isotopes. It has been known for decades that certain trace elements play an important role in regulating biological productivity in the oceans. Although we have a clear idea how this regulation takes place, there is a dearth of knowledge about (a) what the large scale distributions of these important substances are in the ocean, and (b) what precisely are the rates and mechanisms whereby these substances are delivered to the oceans. These are important gaps, as understanding and predicting how the marine biosphere will respond to global change (both anthropogenic and natural) rests such knowledge. A primary motivation of the GEOTRACES program is to document the distribution of these elements in the world ocean, and characterize the rates and nature of processes that maintain and or modify those distributions. In addition to these bio-necessary elements, GEOTRACES is involved in documenting the distributions and transformations of global pollutants, such as lead and mercury. Understanding the marine fates and rates of these potentially hazardous pollutants is an important step to formulating sensible international policy on their use in industry. \nIn managing and organizing the U.S. North Atlantic study, we coordinated a large number of state-of-the-art trace element and isotope (TEI) sampling and measurement programs on board the ship. Sampling of these properties without contamination is a daunting challenge, and extreme care must be taken. A range of sampling methods were used (see Figure 1).\nThe cruise, shown in Figure 2, was designed to travel through a broad range of oceanic regions, ranging from the highly biologically active upwelling region off the coast of Africa where prevailing winds serve to force deeper water to rise near the shore, through the central subtropical \"ocean desert\" to the coast of North America, which forms the western boundary of the North Atlantic Ocean basin. As a result of ocean dynamics, intense boundary currents (for example, the northward flowing Gulf Stream at the sea surface and southward flowing deeper currents below) hug the North American continental shelf and slope. The station locations are mapped in Figure 2 on the subsurface distribution of apparent oxygen utilization (AOU, essentially the intensity of oxygen deficit due to in situ oxygen consumption by organisms). The main purpose is to document the contrasting behaviors of these TEIs in difference oceanic environments. These observations are subsequently used along with computer models to infer the underlying processes and their rates. \nFigure 3 is a sectional \"map\" of the distribution of AOU along the cruise track. Note the strong maximum in AOU due to biological consumption emanating from the highly biologically active African margin. As part of this project, we combined measured hydrographic properties (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients) to quantify the distributions of various water types (see Figure 4 for an example). This allows us to interpret the distributions of the TEIs measured on the cruise in terms of mixing of water masses from a broad range of geographic origins.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/12/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William J Jenkins"
