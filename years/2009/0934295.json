 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's request funding to expand and enhance seawater facilities by increasing wet laboratory space through expansion into an adjacent field equipment storage room on one side of the existing wet lab room, and into the former shipping/receiving room on the other side of the current wet lab room. These rooms were made available upon completion of the new wing of the CMS building. The original building included a wet laboratory and seawater facility for which demand has increased greatly due to new faculty hires and growth of research and education programs. The wet laboratory is supplied with seawater drawn from the ICW at the end of a pier. The CMS wet laboratory provides about 1,500 ft2 of space with 9 seawater access points to meet the needs of 68 UNCW faculty, their graduate and undergraduate students, and visiting investigators. With rapid development of marine research programs since 2000, demand for wet laboratory space has exceeded current availability. chambers to be available for specific project use (rather than dedication to a single project). Use priority of one of the chambers will go to graduate students working on dissertation or thesis research. Intellectual merit: Expansion of wet laboratory space would greatly increase the options for research and education available to UNCW faculty, visiting scientists and students at CMS. Expanded laboratory space would accommodate the growing demand for culture facilities for many research programs, the science cannot begin until organisms can be reliably and dependably maintained. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:    \r\n\r\nThe site is very active in education and research-training of undergraduate and graduate students. The additions will enhance capacity for student research and 1 environmental chamber has even been set aside for student work. The addition will also contribute to the many educational programs that the site hosts by providing animal holding facilities for hands-on and exploration programs. The center has been involved in outreach for over 20 years via a MarineQuest program offering primary and secondary students and adults hands on experiences (66,000 to date), and also through a variety of camps, classes, and seminars.",
