 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multidisciplinary proposal explores dynamical processes of human learning and adaptation that occur at different time scales. For example, there are several variable time scales in the learning of motor skills, including the cyclical processes within a trial, the duration of a trial, the rest interval between trials, the number and timing of practice sessions in a day, and the distribution of practice sessions over days, weeks, months and years. These time scale relations are explored using both theoretical and empirical approaches. The project investigates 1)the influence of practice schedules on changes in learning dynamics in relation to the well known trade-off between speed and accuracy; 2) the time scales of temporary (adaptation) and persistent (learning) change; and 3) the changes in characteristic dynamic properties of learning that arise from different phasing of practice schedules in relation to the circadian cycle. One anticipated outcome is a new theory of practice that is relevant to instructional and practice strategies for enhancing performance in human motor skills in a number of contexts including human factors, music, physical activity and sport, in addition to the relearning of physical activities as in rehabilitation and physical therapy.",
