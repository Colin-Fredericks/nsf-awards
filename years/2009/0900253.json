 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under wind and traffic loading, slender long-span bridges can experience large responses which are typically caused by the dynamic interaction of the loads with the bridge structure.  These large responses can cause fatigue accumulation, deterioration, and, at times, related safety issues for the bridge system. In the United States, more than 800 long-span bridges contained in the national bridge inventory are classified as fracture-critical. This project will study these dynamic interactions and their potential to cause damage in long span bridge structures. The project will focus on understanding the dynamic behavior of bridge structures and develop an integrated dynamic model to assess the lifetime performance of long-span bridges under combined wind and traffic loads. A reliability-based analytical approach which utilizes improved traffic flow simulations combined with wind tunnel test data will be formulated to define equivalent wheel loads and the resulting factored design loads to ensure a targeted reliability level at several levels of expected performance. \r\n\r\nThis research will help engineers to reliably predict the response, performance, and remaining life of slender long-span bridge systems.  It will help to identify potential sources and risk of damage to current bridges with the ultimate objective of designing retrofit measures to improve performance and prolong the lives of the long span bridge structures. The reliability-based analysis and design methodology will be helpful in load calibration and in achieving a consistent level of risk for all bridge structures, which is the fundamental intent of any design specification. Such a consistent level of risk is not necessarily guaranteed now due to the lack of design specifications for long-span bridges.  The research results will be widely disseminated to other researchers and practitioners through conventional mechanisms and committee work. The project will provide advanced training to graduate students. Outreach educational activities are also planned to provide an opportunity to pre-college students to participate in cutting edge research with hands-on experience with wind tunnel experimentation, thus helping to foster interest in the next generation of engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
