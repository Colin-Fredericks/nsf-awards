 "awd_abstract_narration": "0824714\r\nMoecher\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks funding to upgrade the existing Applied Research Laboratories SEMQ electron microprobe at the University of Kentucky. Requested upgrades include replacing components of the beam-forming and imaging electronics, purchasing components to improve the imaging capabilities and enhance qualitative and quantitative analyses, and upgrading computer software and hardware. Electronics upgrades are sought due to the instrument?s age and considerable recent down-time. Refurbished components will be sourced from the manufacturer. To improve imaging capabilities, a cathodoluminescence (CL) detector is requested along with an OV98 multilayer crystal for wavelength dispersive analysis. A new EDS imaging system with Peltier cooling will provide analytical flexibility for the new detectors. New software/hardware will consist of upgrades to Probe for Windows to Enterprise edition and a new computer to hold DAQ boards and run software. The instrumentation upgrade will be employed for on-going NSF EAR-funded and other research projects. Major objectives include: 1) zircon and monazite geochronology - CL imaging will be a key component for elucidating compositional information, while automated stage positioned ED spectral analysis will facilitate geochronologic reconstructions, 2) garnet and other silicate zoning analysis using visualization capabilities - thermobarometry, geochronology and structural analysis will be assessed using X-ray mapping, 3) decompression microstructures - retrograde eclogites, high-pressure granulites, and their inclusions will be used to better understand the burial and exhumation history of Paleozoic collision orogenesis, 4) Paleoseismicity and petrogenesis - pseudotachylyte (PST) will be assayed in order to assess formation temperatures and fluid states, 5) coal and shale geochemistry and mineralogy - organic and inorganic components will be evalued using WDS and EDS in coals and black shales, and 6) SE, BSE and EDS analysis of archeological artifacts in order to characterize their origins and uses. The current probe has four wavelength dispersive spectrometers, a BSE, and an EDS. The new CL detector and crystal will be incorporated into the existing instrument configuration and supported by the proposed software upgrade. The instrument is housed in a modern, capable facility with ample services. Departmental funds are used for gases and liquid nitrogen. Instrument service is performed by the PI and graduate students. A service contract is funded by the University. Usage fees are collected when volunteered. \r\n\r\n***",
