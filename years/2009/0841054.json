 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Young Mathematicians Conference is an opportunity for students involved in REU programs in mathematics to present their research results in talks and posters presentations over the course of three days. Approximately 70 students from all parts of the US are invited to report on about 50 projects. Invitations are competitive and based on the review of abstracts by a panel of faculty reviewers. In addition the conference invites around a dozen mentors to exchange ideas and experiences in supervising undergraduate research. Moreover, about the same number representatives from graduate programs in mathematics from a variety of US institutions are invited to share their perspectives and insights about graduate studies in mathematics in open forums and individual conversations. \r\n\r\nHighlights of every conference are three plenary lectures by highly accomplished researchers and teachers, who introduce students to advanced, innovative, and exciting topics in mathematics. Speakers in the past included recipients of prestigious MacArthur and Sloan Fellowships, P\u00f3lya and Nevanlinna Prizes, as well as of the Haimo, Chauvenet, and Allendoerfer Awards for excellence in exposition and teaching. The event schedule strongly encourages discussions and interactions of students researchers with their peers as well as senior mathematicians. One of the main goals of the conference is to guide talented students from an initial research experience in mathematics towards a career as research mathematicians. The YMC series was started in 2003 and was held in every year since then (except for 2008) during the month of August.",
