 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nInterest in solid-state chemistry as a discipline has undergone tremendous growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area.   The 2009 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Solid State Chemistry is a flagship annual international meeting. The goal of the conference is to facilitate collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of young and senior researchers with interests in solid-state chemistry areas that address issues such as novel synthesis methods, crystal chemistry, electronic , magnetic and optical properties of new classes of materials, computational solid state chemistry, chemistry of materials in nanoscale, microporous materials and novel inorganic/organic hybrid materials.  Special emphasis will be given to materials for energy conversion and designing of ?green materials? for sustainable future.   The NSF support will go to US based students, post-doctoral scholars, and early career faculty, as well as senior session chairs and invited speakers.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe aim of the 2009 Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Chemistry is to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss the latest advances and challenges in the area of solid-state chemistry with the intent to promote an exchange of ideas and to build strong relationships among academic, industrial, and government researchers. Internationally known speakers and poster presentations from students, post-doctoral scholars, and early career faculty will emphasize recent technical advances and the discussion of new ideas and future directions emerging within the solid-state chemistry community.  It is well recognized that the field of solid state chemistry includes a broad cross-section of materials disciplines, and the intellectual exchange at the annual Gordon Research Conference truly shapes the future directions of the field.    Leading scientists working in various areas of solid-state chemistry are expected to draw the interest of many researchers in the field. Current frontiers to be highlighted include synthesizing, characterizing, and investigating the properties of wide variety of novel classes of inorganic solid compounds.   The area impacts the entire field of solid-state chemistry and much of materials chemistry research since it spans all materials types and a wide variety of exploitable properties. As a result, this conference will draw the interest of those working on diverse classes of compounds important to advancing new technologies.\r\n",
