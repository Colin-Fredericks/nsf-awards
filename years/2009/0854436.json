The research covers all areas of astronomy and astrophysics, including solar physics, stellar evolution, pulsars, novae, and astronomical site testing.  The students, who are drawn from universities throughout the U.S. with graduate programs in astronomy and astrophysics, will gain experience in conducting research in collaboration with foreign investigators, exposure to India's culture, and the opportunity to develop networks with IIA scientists that will influence their future careers.  The program is evaluated using technical reports, cultural reports, and a participant survey for both students and mentors.  The student research reports are published on the NSO website: http://eo.nso.edu/ires/.\r\nIntellectual merit: Astronomy and astrophysics are fundamental scientific topics. Advances in these areas increase our understanding of the physical laws that govern the universe. Solar physics topics are increasingly relevant to daily life that depends on modern technology for communications, navigation and power distribution. The research conducted by the students and their Indian mentors contributes to all of these areas. \r\nBroader impacts: The exposure of U.S. graduate students to life in India increases their global cultural sensitivity, leading to an enhanced appreciation for the accomplishments of other societies. By working with IIA scientists, the program provides the students with opportunities for future scientific collaborations.",
