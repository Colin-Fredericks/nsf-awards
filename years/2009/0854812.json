 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) has achieved design sensitivity and collected data at that sensitivity. Enhanced LIGO (eLIGO), with some improvement in sensitivity, will begin to take data soon, while construction of Advanced LIGO (AdvLIGO), whose improved sensitivity makes highly likely the frequent detection of cosmic gravitational waves, is underway. The Syracuse group will focus considerable effort on the rapid analysis of eLIGO data, in support of the search for short bursts of gravitational waves. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration's Burst Group has set a goal of producing vetted candidate burst triggers in 30 minutes or less. The Syracuse group has been charged with producing reliable data quality and veto information on a time scale consistent with the overall analysis goal. This will enable the Burst Group to recognize false triggers caused by instrument artifacts or environmental disturbances, and thus to help in recognizing any genuine gravitational wave signal that may be recorded. This work will also enable rapid recognition of problems with the interferometers, so that they can be fixed promptly. The Syracuse group will also carry out studies of the large-angle light scattering from high quality mirror coatings that are under consideration for use in Advanced LIGO or for near-term improvements to it by making use of a table-top imaging scatterometer developed under prior support. Members of the Syracuse group will continue to contribute to commissioning of the eLIGO interferometers and expect to participate in work at the Observatories that adds value to the Advanced LIGO interferometers. The Syracuse group will continue its long history of training undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs. The group will also continue to offer instruction to new members of our field through the Summer School on Gravitational Wave Astronomy at the University of Texas at Brownsville. The PI is developing a new course at Syracuse University on Vibrations, Waves & Optics that will make frequent integral use of examples from LIGO technology along with other projects to share the excitement of LIGO with the broader community.",
