The approach involves new chemistry for solution-based fabrication of inorganic functional materials from nanoscale building blocks. Specifically, functional nanostructured phases will be synthesized by combining colloidal inorganic nanomaterials (metal and semiconductor clusters, nanocrystals, nanowires, etc) and molecular metal chalcogenide complexes. Various molecular metal chalcogenide complexes, such as SnS44-, Sn2Se64-, In2Se42-, Ge4S104- will be used to completely replace original hydrocarbon surface ligands at the surface of colloidal metal and semiconductor nanostructures. After formation of a nanostructured assembly, new surface ligands will be converted into an inorganic solid, linking individual nano-building blocks into a macroscopic array of strongly electronically coupled functional modules. The project will combine the development of synthetic methodologies, detailed structural, electronic and optical characterizations of new materials and fabrication of prototype electronic and optoelectronic devices.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThe project aims to develop a generalized methodology for preparation of nanostructured inorganic materials through ?modular? self-assembly of nanoscale functional building blocks. This approach may lead to a novel class of solution processed semiconductors for the applications ranging from solar cells to thermoelectric heat converters, light-emitting devices and printable electronics. The integration of research and educational components will generate broad outreach and educational activities including participation in the conceptual design and development of the Nanoscience exhibit for Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. The Museum attracts approximately 2 million visitors per year, nearly 280,000 children in school groups and youth organizations visited the Museum in 2007. Aimed at inspiring youth to consider education and careers in the physical and biological sciences, the objective of new exhibit is to convey the excitement of modern scientific research, its multidisciplinary nature, and the synergy between different areas of science and technology. \r\n",
