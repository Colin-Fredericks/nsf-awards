 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chirality, or handedness, associated with molecular systems plays important roles in chemistry, perhaps most notably in biomolecular recognition processes and pharmacological function.  Most chemistry students are introduced to the concept of chirality through demonstrations of the interaction of chiral molecules with polarized light manifested as an \"optical rotation\" (with a well-defined direction and magnitude) which gives rise to the familiar \"R\" and \"S\" designations of chiral centers in molecular systems. While the intrinsic molecular parameters that control the dissymmetric light-matter interaction in chiral systems are well understood, the extrinsic factors (coupling to solvent or matrix) remain largely unexplored.  The fundamental issue is that much of the detailed information on the influence of local environment on the molecular chiroptical response is obscured through necessary ensemble averaging inherent in conventional (bulk) absorption (circular dichroism) or non-resonant scattering (optical rotatory dispersion) measurements.  The principal aim of this project is to use single-molecule chiroptical spectroscopy as a tool for probing the \"inhomogeneous broadening\" of chiroptical dissymmetry in the condensed phase. This proposed cross-disciplinary research has high fundamental scientific impact and will have a technological impact in the development of advanced display technologies, optical storage devices, and in asymmetric synthesis.  The proposed project also serves as an attractive vehicle for broadening the participation and retention of students.  Minority and underrepresented students will be recruited for this research project.  During summer, two middle or high school students from local area schools will be recruited to participate in this research, thus creating advanced opportunities for pursuing advanced work in science and mathematics. THe group will also increase the interaction between UMass Amherst Chemistry and the middle/high students and science teachers in the Five College area school districts and to provide opportunities for advanced work in science.  Such opportunities will help enhance interest in science and mathematics at the middle and high school levels.",

Our goal was to apply this same methodology to the study of chirality - the peculiar and fundamental aspect of molecular systems to show a \"handed-ness\" (right OR left) at the single-molecule level.  The fundament question we sought to address was whether a collection of single chiral molecules, whose ensemble (bulk-average) chiroptical signature is known, might individually show deviations or flucutations from the ensemble average.  Such information could provide new insights into the emergence of, for example, preferred left handed-ness for amino acids, as well as guide development for novel optical-electronic devices using circular polarized light.  Moreover, we anticipated that this research would result in new insights into how to control or tune molecular chiroptical response by specific (fixed) molecular orientation.  Finally, as a potential analytical technique, the instrumentation and methodology developed in this research could provide new routes to fast chiral screening of reaction products requiring only picomoles of sample.\n\nWe faced several significant technical challenges in this interdisciplinary work.  First, as nearly all single-molecule studies use visible molecular fluorescence as the information-carrying signal, we needed to synthesize chirally pure organic molecules with robust fluorescence.  Second, we had to design and implement an experimental strategy for detecting the (weak) differential absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light of a single chiral molecule, while also taking great care to avoid artifactual results from residual linear polarization in the excitation beam.  Finally, and perhaps most difficult, is the fact that the chiroptical response (characterized by preference for absorbing left- or right-circularly polarized light) is intimately tied with molecular orientation.
