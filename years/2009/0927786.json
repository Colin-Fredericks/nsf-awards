 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective in this research is to demonstrate electrochemically fabricated magnetic bit-patterned media using precision fabricated templates to achieve data storage densities above ten terabit per square inch, far surpassing what is available in today?s even most advanced magnetic data storage systems.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed multifaceted research is to contribute to the understanding of the materials science and engineering of underpotential codeposition of magnetic alloys, the potential of self-limiting ion milling for ultrahigh density square matrix template nanofabrication, and the effects of spatial confinement on face-centered-cubic to face-centered-tetragonal phase transformation kinetics in ultrahigh anisotropy iron-platinum materials system. The availability of ultrahigh magnetic anisotropy nanostructured arrays that will be developed in the course of this project will further facilitate the fundamental studies of the scalability limits of magnetic recording.\r\nThe broader impact of this research is to enable a range of transformative data-storage applications such as probe-based data storage, in which two-dimensional arrays of read/write nanotransducers are used to address the bits on patterned media. Extremely high data storage bit densities to be explored in the course of this project will be sufficient, for example, to serve all the data storage needs of the world?s largest corporation with a single desktop computer! The proposed program will be integrated with existing NSF-REU, RET, and NUE programs as well as State-supported programs, in which the investigators actively participate, to enhance the recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities into the fields of science and engineering.\r\n",
