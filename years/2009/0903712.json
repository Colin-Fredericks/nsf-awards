In microalgae, lipid accumulation generally occurs under nutrient limiting conditions, which are subject to environmental variability, and which prevents high biomass accumulation. Transferring control of lipid induction to intracellular processes will eliminate the variability, and identifying the key regulatory steps involved in controlling carbon partitioning in the cell coupled with metabolic engineering should enable greater partitioning of carbon into lipids during non-limiting nutrient growth conditions. These approaches are expected to have a substantial impact on the development of renewable biofuels technology. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The involvement of undergraduate and high school students in this project will enable them to experience \"hands on\" laboratory research. This is critical in the development of a young person's mind, to be able to appreciate the practical and dynamic aspects of discovery, as apposed to just assimilating information via lectures or reading. This importance of this cannot be overemphasized, because it develops an appreciation for the level of effort and commitment that must be applied to any successful endeavor. The students will participate as part of local training programs that emphasize the involvement of underrepresented minorities. The societal benefits of the proposed research will be realized through the technological application of developing diatoms as a source of renewable fuels. The potential benefits include reduced CO2 production and subsequent benefit to climate change, decreased dependence on oil imports, and establishment of new jobs in this emerging technology industry.\r\n",
