Each workshop, in addition to talks from invited speakers, includes at least two mini-courses, given by international leaders in the field, and aimed at advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Taken together, the mini-courses of the various workshops comprise a summer school for these young researchers. \r\nThe plan for the ?summer school? is to have graduate students come for several (4-6) workshops, rather than just for one specific one. All participants will be encouraged to invite their students, and the PIMS institute will be providing staff to assist with advertising the program to the mathematics community.  The funds requested to NSF will be used to support the travel expenses and local accommodation of US-based graduate students and young mathematicians (especially those who do not have their own grants). We are particularly dedicated to the participation of women and other under represented groups.  \r\n\r\n",
