 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student comprehension of scientific concepts and principles presents a particular challenge when the phenomena are not directly observable. This issue has emerged as core to effective teaching and successful student learning in chemistry. The goal is to identify whether students' individual differences influence the effectiveness of visualizations for learning scientific concepts as measured with process and product-based metrics of evaluation. The investigators will also develop design principles for the use of visualizations as instructional tools in chemistry and STEM fields more broadly. \r\n\r\nThe central issues are: When and how students rely on visualizations while trying to comprehend unobservable chemistry content; whether reliance on visualizations varies as a function of student characteristics; and whether usage patterns inform instructional interventions. In a series of randomized, controlled experiments involving undergraduates at four institutions, investigators will: (a) determine baseline chemical knowledge, spatial ability, reasoning ability, and interest in learning; (b) use eye tracking to characterize the moment-by-moment scan and fixation processes that students rely on while viewing visualizations; (c) utilize concurrent interview protocols to assess learning strategies and knowledge acquisition; and (d) implement post-visualization tests to examine student memory for the visualization content and application of knowledge.",

To better understand students\u00c6 use of visualizations, this project explored student interactions with chemistry visualizations both as they are being studied, and as a consequence of working with them.\n\nThe project focused on two issues with regard to students\u00c6 experiences with visualizations.  First, we examined the ways in which students engage with visualizations, and how those engagements might be supported.  There are countless visualizations available in STEM fields; as a starting point for our work we selected a commonly utilized visualization that has been growing in popularity.

We presented students with both familiar ball-and-stick as well as novel EPM displays and asked them to answer questions for which the EPMs are particularly useful (Hinze et al, 2013, Learning and Instruction).  Analyses of accuracy rates, eye-movements, and verbal explanations indicated (a) most participants initially relied on the familiar ball-and-stick displays to answer difficult questions, and (b) high-achieving students, but not low-achieving students, showed an inclination to begin utilizing and benefitting from the EPMs over the course of practice.

This was particularly surprising given that we presented the students with a multi-page introduction to EPMs prior to the task.  \n\nComplementing this work, we conducted a review of current editions of chemistry textbooks which revealed that while most texts present at least one example of an EPM, many do not provide instructional support sections or opportunities to practice with their use (Hinze et al., 2013, Journal of Chemical Education).  Thus, without the supports provided by teachers or other sources, students may never develop sufficient competence using the novel visualizations; rather than automatically enhancing performance, students\u00c6 understanding and use of visualizations necessitates knowledge and practice, just like any other educational tool or method.
