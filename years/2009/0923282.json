These groups try to advance their respective research via the computational study of physical chemical properties and simulation of chemical/physical processes in molecules, nano-materials and broad based bulk materials, physics based modeling in engineering disciplines, and other areas such as computational biology, finance, business, etc. Combined with advanced research training in computational science and engineering, the acquisition supports core projects and ancillary research projects, including:\r\n-\tComputational Science and Engineering Program (core program recently approved for a PhD)\r\n-\tAll Electron Studies of Organic Molecular Crystals (OMCs) under Pressure\r\n-\tPolymer Composite Fabrication Process Modeling and Simulations\r\n-\tAncillary Research Projects and Tools:\r\n  .Modeling C60 Reorientation of Various Solvents\r\n  .Modeling Material Deformation at Nano-Length Scales\r\n  .Computational Modeling and Simulation of Bio-Inspired Adaptive and Reconfigurable Systems\r\n  .New Research Tools for Collaborative Grid Computing and Visualization\r\n-\tResearch and Education Support\r\nBroader Impacts:  \r\nThis work fosters research and research and education training for underrepresented groups at a historically black college and/or university (HBCU) and additionally provides computational resources to other HBCUs. Moreover, it aims to gain a better description at the atomic scale of the OMCs and to improve the understanding of the manufacturing processes for advanced composites.",
