 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThis project uses Scratch (a 2D environment developed at MIT) to build a new CS0 course for at risk students - those students who are weak in mathematics and/or have not previously been successful in the introductory computer science (CS1) course. There are three objectives of this intervention for at-risk students. 1) To establish or improve students' understanding of core programming concepts, in order to prepare them for success in CS1. 2) To help students to establish a positive impression of programming. 3) To increase overall retention in computer science.\r\n\r\nThe use of Scratch offers some particular advantages. Scratch has a comprehensive set of audio/visual capabilities that allow the creation of interesting animations and games. Having been designed for younger students, Scratch is very intuitive. It does not allow syntax errors or require compilation, so students can focus on their higher-level problem-solving and design skills. Scratch provides instant gratification in an engaging audio/visual environment that is just not possible in most other languages. The Scratch community provides the added benefits of collaboration and competition, within a class, and among the world-wide online community.\r\n\r\nThe course materials developed in this project are made available to faculty at other institutions via a dedicated website. The project plan is shared with other educators interested in Scratch at the Scratch@MIT conference, and the project findings are presented at Scratch@MIT and at SIGSCE.\r\n",
