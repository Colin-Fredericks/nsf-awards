 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\r\n(Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nPervasive societal use of information systems has increased the need\r\nfor software to be both reliable and extensible.  One technique that\r\ncan be used to improve software reliability is the application of\r\nstatic analyses to discover and validate that properties hold across\r\nall program executions.  Unfortunately, additional challenges arise when\r\napplying static analyses to programs that can be dynamically extended,\r\nsuch as is the case, for example, with Firefox plugins, Microsoft Office\r\nAdd-Ins, and Eclipse plugins.  This project will develop techniques\r\nfor contingent static analysis that will be able to more precisely and\r\nefficiently analyze dynamically extensible software systems.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project will explore techniques for accommodating\r\ndynamic composition during interprocedural program analysis using a\r\nruntime mechanism to efficiently avoid making overly conservative\r\napproximations.  Analysis results will be expressed as contingent\r\nproperties of different program regions, where the validity of each\r\ncontingent property depends explicitly on the validity of properties\r\nfrom other program regions.  The runtime mechanism will then validate\r\nand invalidate these contingent properties as new code is dynamically\r\nloaded into the execution environment.  This approach will be applied\r\nto develop contingent escape and information flow analyses.",
