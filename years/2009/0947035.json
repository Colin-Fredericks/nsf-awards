 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis award supports infrastructure upgrades at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) that will ensure the viability of current NOAO assets for supporting research by the ground-based astronomical community. The funds are designated to support forefront astronomical optical and infrared research by replacing failing and outdated systems at NOAO telescopes and data handling facilities and to ensure the continued safety of operations at NOAO observatory sites for visiting scientists and staff. \r\n\r\nA total of $5.6M is awarded to address infrastructure problems associated with on-site safety, facility maintenance, operational efficiency, energy conservation, and modernization.  These activities will improve the longevity of government-owned facilities, reduce the cost of facility operations, enhance energy conservation, improve the safety of visiting scientists, staff and visitors, and improve the quality and quantity of data acquired with the telescopes. \r\n\r\nNOAO facilities are used by the US astronomical community to address outstanding problems in forefront astronomical research. Through these upgrades, NOAO's ability to support this research will be substantially enhanced. In addition NOAO participation in programs to broaden participation in research, such as its ongoing student programs, will benefit from improved observing and data handling capabilities, making it easier for students to work with forefront astronomical observations",
