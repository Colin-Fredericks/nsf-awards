Although electrons in metals mind their own business, barely\r\ninteracting with each other, in so-called 'strongly correlated electron'\r\nmaterials the interactions of electrons drive unique properties that are\r\nfascinating and often useful.  For example, so-called high-Tc\r\nsuperconductors carry electricity without loss at economically feasible\r\ntemperatures; multi-ferroic materials allow electronic data storage using\r\na magnetic field and magnetic data storage using an electric field; heavy\r\nfermion materials boast electrons behaving with thousands of times their\r\nactual mass; simple sheets of carbon called graphene allow electrons to\r\nzip along as if they had no mass at all.  These materials have in common\r\nthat their electrons interact strongly, and that those interactions are\r\npoorly understood.  This project will employ a spin-polarized scanning\r\ntunneling microscope to measure the energies and locations of electron\r\nspins with atomic resolution, starting with superconductors.  The project\r\nwill also use this technology to educate three deserving groups: Harvard\r\nstudents will benefit from a new undergraduate course on scanning\r\ntunneling microscopy; local elementary school children will be invited to\r\nsee a working science lab viewing real electrons; interested citizens will\r\nbe able to browse a colorful website explaining the fascinating variety of\r\nmaterials under investigation.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award funds a project to image electron spins in high-Tc\r\nsuperconductors, both cuprates and pnictides.  The common feature to these\r\nexotic materials is that their electrons interact strongly, and there is\r\nno broadly successful theoretical language to describe these so-called\r\n'correlated electron materials'.  Great strides have been made through\r\nvarious methods of imaging the interactions of electron charges, but\r\nunderstanding has been limited by the lack of effective tools to image the\r\ninteractions of electron spins.  This project will employ a low\r\ntemperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscope to measure the\r\nspin-resolved density of electronic states with atomic resolution.  In\r\nparticular, a comparison will be made between spin interactions in\r\ncuprates and pnictides, the only two known families of high-Tc\r\nsuperconductors, discovered in 1986 and 2008.  The project will also use\r\nthis spin imaging technology to educate three deserving groups: Harvard\r\nstudents will benefit from a new undergraduate course on scanning\r\ntunneling microscopy; local elementary school children will be invited to\r\nsee a working science lab imaging real electrons; interested citizens will\r\nbe able to browse a colorful website explaining the fascinating variety of\r\nstrongly correlated materials under investigation.\r\n",

Today\u00c6s highest-Tc superconductors, copper- and iron-based compounds, still operate only around or below the temperature of liquid nitrogen. For most practical superconducting applications, it remains imperative to find new, higher-Tc  materials. An important first step, to guide this search for new materials, is to better understand the energies and the interactions of the electrons which lead to superconductivity in known materials. An electron has two key properties: charge and \"spin\" &ndash; a kind of magnetic angular momentum. In this work supported by the NSF, under career grant DMR-0847433, we developed a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to map both the charge and spin properties of electrons in superconductors, with picoscale spatial resolution.\n \nCuprate superconductors\nOne known prerequisite for superconductivity is the pairing of electrons, which opens up a gap in their energy spectrum &ndash; i.e. a range of energies where no electrons are allowed. However, cuprate superconductors show a surprising energy gap far above their functional Tc. This \"pseudogap\" has mystified scientists for two decades, but it is considered crucial to understanding the superconducting mechanism. We used our STM to search for the origin of the pseudogap, and its effect on the superconducting properties. In the cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, we mapped nanoscale variations of the pseudogap energy, and correlated these variations to single oxygen atom defects in the crystal structure. Our work points to the importance of controlling oxygen vacancies, and suggests a route to increase Tc by ~10-20% through modified crystal growth recipes.\n \nA second prerequisite for superconductivity is the \"phase coherence\" of the electron pairs &ndash; in other words their wave functions must align in a single quantum mechanical state. In another study on the related material Bi2LaySr2-yCuO6+z, we found that nanoscale regions of strong pseudogap are correlated with decreased phase coherence &ndash; reinforcing the importance of controlling the pseudogap in order to enhance superconductivity. We also discovered that the pseudogap is associated with a periodic ripple of electrons, known as a \"charge density wave\", which pervades both the surface and the interior of the material, in complex fractal patterns. This charge density wave may be a key factor controlling the pseudogap and superconductivity, and is currently a topic of widespread investigation.     \n \nIron-based superconductors\nIn the iron-based superconductors, we used the atomic resolution imaging capability of the STM to investigate the role of single Pr atoms in elevating Tc in PrxCa1-xFe2As2, and single K atoms in pinning magnetic vortices (preventing electrical energy loss) in Sr1-xKxFe2As2.  \n \nIn the last two years, we developed a new capability, \"molecular beam epitaxy\", which allows us to grow new crystals by evaporating selected elements, one atomic layer at a time, onto a flat substrate. Large crystals of iron selenide (FeSe) exhibit a modest Tc of only 8 K, but when a single unit cell thickness of FeSe is grown on strontium titanate (SrTiO3), its Tc is enhanced by an order of magnitude, to above 100 K.  We grew FeSe on SrTiO3, transferred it through ultra-high-vacuum into our STM, and mapped the energy and momentum of the electronic states as a starting point for understanding the remarkably high Tc.\n \nBroader impact\nOver the course of this work, we made several contributions to STM techniques.  We developed a method of preparing chromium STM tips which allow the STM to probe the spin as well as charge properties of electrons in any material of interest. Our simple new preparation method circumvents the need for complex preparation procedures under ultra-high vacuum conditions.  We also developed new data analysis s..."
