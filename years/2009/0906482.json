For multivariate nonlinear time series, there is little solid mathematical theory on quantile regression in the literature, although much work has been contributed using the maximum likelihood or least squares estimation. In this research project the investigator develops spatial quantile regression modeling theory of multivariate nonlinear time series data with multivariate exogeneous variables. Several multivariate functional-coefficient models and associated estimation methods are proposed. From a theoretical perspective, the investigator and his colleagues study asymptotic properties of the estimators, variable selection, and parametric and nonparametric hypothesis testing for the proposed models, based on the global/local spatial quantile regression. The novel modeling approaches open a prosperous avenue of research in the multivariate nonlinear realm and are expected to stimulate others to address a number of problems which remain beyond the reach of existing models and techniques. The computational method for implementation of the proposed methodology is also considered.  \r\n\r\nIn financial markets, multiple time series are usually related. For example, the yields of three-month, six-month and twelve-month Treasury bills are highly related and exhibit co-movement.  For such multivariate time series data, one should use multivariate models. Although univariate models for each time series may be employed, they are not able to capture the relationship among different time series and may not be efficient. Since nonlinear features widely exist in economic data, it is important to develop some multivariate nonlinear modeling techniques. The investigator proposes flexible multivariate nonlinear models and introduces cutting edge techniques to refine the models and to achieve robustness and efficiency of estimation.  This is very important because it relaxes restrictive assumptions frequently used in statistical and economic research and hence enables us to achieve more accurate and realistic results. The proposed variable selection method is important because economic data often include many variables. Which variables should be chosen for the problems of interest? Decisions in variable selection are often arbitrary. The research will provide elegant methods to identify those relevant variables and enable investigators to make reliable decisions.  The proposed hypothesis testing methods are also important because they allow one to refine the models. After fitting a model, a relationship between variables is discovered. Is this discovery true in the real situations? With the aid of the proposed hypothesis testing methods, the question can be correctly answered with high probability, and hence the rate of error in discovery can be reduced. \r\n",
