 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Carol Korzeniewski of Texas Tech University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the processes that limit charge transfer during the conversion of chemical bond energy into electricity in electrocatalytic reactions. The proposed research is focused on two areas: catalysis of reactions relevant to fuel cells, and the impact of Nafion on catalysis as it adsorbs to noble metal catalyst sites. SEIRAS will be used to characterize the species at and near the surface; voltammetry will be used to examine the kinetics of the reactions of interest; and modeling will integrate this information to develop detailed and fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the surface reactions. The new knowledge gained on interfacial charge transfer processes would have broad applications in energy conversion processes such as fuel cells, corrosion, adhesion and signal transduction in electrical sensors. The educational activities involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach plans towards women and girls at K-12 through the Texas Tech University sponsored science and engineering outreach programs.\r\n\r\n",
