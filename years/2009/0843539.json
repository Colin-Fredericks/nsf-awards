This process requires signals from certain types of harmless bacteria in the intestinal tract. The goal of this project is to understand how intestinal bacteria cause rabbit B cells (the cells that make antibodies) to make changes in their antibody genes. To achieve this goal, the investigators will identify the pathway that rabbit B cells follow as they move though the appendix, to determine when and where they interact with bacteria from the intestinal tract. In addition, the investigators will determine whether bacteria signal B cells to alter their antibody genes by binding to B cell receptors that recognize molecules that are widely shared by different types of bacteria. These studies will determine how harmless bacteria in the intestinal tract cause rabbit B cells to make changes in their antibody genes that result in antibodies that protect the rabbit from dangerous bacteria and viruses. The investigators' results will add to a growing body of knowledge showing that the bacteria living in the intestinal tract of animals are important for helping animals develop normally and protect themselves from infections. This project's broader impacts include its contribution to the investigators' dynamic and interactive Department of Microbiology and Immunology, which has long been active in outreach efforts to communicate science to elementary, high school and undergraduate students, and the public. In addition, this project will provide 2 stipends per summer for the Department's Undergraduate Summer Research Program, which provides hands-on research experience to college undergraduates considering a career in biological or medical research.",
