 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objectives of this research are to synthesize and characterize thin films of high resistivity undoped, and semi-conducting p- and n-doped polycrystalline diamond and AlN thin films suitable for the fabrication of high temperature electronic devices, and to investigate the fabrication of high temperature microelectronic devices where silicon devices are not useful. \r\n\r\nThe approach consists of synthesis of diamond films by microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and measurement of their electrical and mechanical properties. The influence of process parameters on the composition, crystal quality, mechanical strength, and the electrical properties of the films will be studied. Advanced materials characterization techniques will be used to characterize nanoscale microstructure, which will be related to the properties of the films. Electrical properties such as I-V and C-V behaviors and carrier concentration will be measured over a range of temperatures. Young?s moduli will be measured on existing Michelson interferometer system. Fabrication of devices such as Schottky diodes, pressure sensor, and a voltage multiplier stack will be investigated. \r\n\r\nOn a broader scale, the proposed research has potentials for enormous payoffs by developing electronics for operation above 500oC for aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles and nuclear reactors thereby reducing engine maintenance costs, and improving reliability and performance efficiencies. An essential and important component of this research will be to provide education and training of graduate students, post-docs, and undergraduate seniors. In addition, minority/women and high school students will be mentored and exposed to this research through programs at our university. A significant outreach to high schools is proposed. \r\n",
