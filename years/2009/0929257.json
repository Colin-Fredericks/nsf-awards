The goal of ?Enhancing the Potential of Lane College Undergraduates in STEM Program? is to increase the number of STEM majors, and provide all science, technology, engineering and mathematics students with a challenging and enriching learning experience. \r\n\r\nThe project is being accomplished by implementing the following objectives: (1) build students? interest and confidence so they will pursue STEM degrees; (2) create programs that will enhance student retention and success in entry-level STEM courses; (3) provide targeted recruitment of underrepresented students to major in STEM disciplines; (4) create early undergraduate research experience in STEM by providing Summer internships for students; (5) provide stipends for faculty and students at collaborating universities and laboratories; (6) create an environment at Lane in which research is now accepted as an important part of a science student?s education; (7) provide professional development opportunities for faculty to ensure their participation and support for the project; and (8) improve STEM students? preparation for graduate or professional school by providing courses/ workshops for standardized exams. \r\n\r\nLane College is a coeducational, private historically black college that serves 2003 students, including 460 who are enrolled in STEM disciplines. Lane College offers the Bachelor of Science degree leading to majors in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. A major in Engineering is offered through a dual degree program with Tennessee State University in Nashville. Lane College is committed to increasing the number of minority students enrolling in and successfully completing baccalaureate programs that will prepare them to enter graduate and professional degree programs in STEM disciplines. \r\n",
