 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for a pilot project to conduct archaeological field work at the Moroccan site of Smugglers' Cave. Smugglers' Cave is one of the most important Mousterian/Aterian sites in Morocco and has served as a major reference site for archaeologists' understanding of the Mousterian and Aterian stone tool industries. This site was first excavated in the 1950s and recent excavations were started anew in the 1990s. In addition to numerous stone tools and non-human fossils, Smugglers' Cave has also yielded a number of significant Middle Paleolithic hominin remains. The researchers intend to develop a more accurate understanding of the site's true chronological and paleoenvironmental setting, its stratigraphic sequence and formation, and its fossil animal and tool assemblages. These data will allow them to better understand the behavior of fossil hominins and to get at answers to the question, \"At what point did we become fully modern?\"\r\n\r\nIn terms of excavation, the work will focus on the interior of the cave. The research team will analyze stone materials using a combination of earlier published methodology and also newer techniques. The team will also study the faunal collections. Together, these studies will provide preliminary results to allow the researchers to interpret the subsistence strategies and patterns of spatial organization of the early hominins. With respect to the geology and chronology, the team will study the stratigraphy and site formation processes using both optically stimulated luminescence and thermoluminescence dating techniques. The hominin remains from the site, including a newly discovered skull of a child in the Mousterian levels, will be analyzed through anatomical description and isotope studies. \r\n\r\nThis work has important broader impacts in that it will provide intensive training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, including underrepresented students from the United States and other countries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch funded by the NSF-funded project \"HOMINID: Assessing the Faunal and Lithic Assemblages and Chronology of the Smugglers' Cave Site\" was focused on the excavation and analysis of this important Paleolithic site located on the Atlantic coast of Morocco just south of Rabat. \n\nSmugglers\u00c6 Cave, also known as Contrebandiers Cave, has a long stratigraphic sequence that contains a succession of lithic assemblages, with good preservation of animal bone, mollusks, hominin remains, and stone tools.  It was first discovered in 1955, with the most recent work, a joint Moroccan- American collaboration directed by El-Hajraoui and Dibble, spanning from 2007 through 2012.  The current work focused on a relatively deep sequence of Middle Stone Age (MSA) deposits, capped by a small remnant of later Iberomaurusian occupation.  These excavations recov&shy;ered many important elements that have not only clarified the situation at this site, but which also contribute to un&shy;derstanding of the larger role of Morocco in the emergence of modern humans.\n\nTo help clarify the chronological setting of the Smugglers\u00c6 Cave deposits, three different dating techniques were employed:  Optically-Stimulated Luminescence, Thermoluminescence, and Electron Spin Resonance.   Together all of these techniques presented results that show that the original occupations of the cave occurred at around 120,000 years ago, and continued, at least for the MSA, until around 90,000 years ago.  The kinds of stone tools recovered reveal the presence of what has been commonly referred to as the Aterian and Mousterian industries, though our work has shown that these two variants are essentially the same thing.  Analysis of the faunal remains suggests that these occupations took place in a dry shrubland or grassland habitat in a coastal setting, though probably a coastal Mediterranean mosaic.  Analyses of the mollusks recovered from the site indicate the nearby presence of the coast. \n\nOver the past few years, early Late Pleistocene sites across North Africa have received increasing research attention, primarily because of their potential to contribute to the debate on the emergence of anatomically and behav&shy;iorally modern H. sapiens in Africa, and Smugglers\u00c6 Cave contributes significantly to this problem.  Earlier excavations recovered cranial fragments from the upper MSA levels that have been attributed to modern H. sapiens, and the current excavations recovered another hominid skull &ndash; that of a juvenile aged 6-8 years old &ndash; from a well-dated context.  This date is roughly 108,000 years ago.  The description and analysis of this find is still underway.\n\nAdditionally, artifacts recovered from the excavations include many examples of a particular marine shell, Nassarrius sp., that has been interpreted previously as having symbolic significance, which is an important element in the identification of modern cultural behavior.  Work on these finds also is on-going.\n\nAltogether, the collection of artifacts resulting from these excavations is considerable:  A total of 4, 650 stone tools and related debris and 5, 950 animal bones,   This collection is currently housed at the Institut National des Sciences de l\u00c6Archeologie et du Patrimoine, in Rabat, Morocco.\n\nIn terms of the broader impacts of this research, the excavations at Smugglers\u00c6 Cave have provided significant research experiences for a large number of students from across the globe.  Altogether over 50 students participated in the project, including a number of Moroccan students.  The excavation has and is serving as the subject of two dissertations, one from the University of Pennsylvania and one from Arizona State University.  In addition, it has resulted in several publications in various journals.  Work, on the faunal, molloscan, and microvertebrate remains is still on-going, but will result in more publications.  The excavation of the site has also been the subject of considerable media reporting, w..."
