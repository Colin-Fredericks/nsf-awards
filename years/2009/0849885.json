 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the REU site at the Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator Based ScienceS and Education (CLASSE).   This site will involve ten students per year in summer research projects at the Laboratory.   Supported by the NSF, the Laboratory has a constellation of programs including accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation research, and microwave superconductivity. Although the research of this REU is focused on understanding the fundamental physics of beams and accelerators and the uses of the radiation they produce, the techniques and technologies utilized are applicable to a much wider range of scientific careers.   The student participants will have full access to the resources of the Laboratory and University. They will work on a range of projects that advance the Laboratory's scientific mission, as well as giving the students the opportunity to experience the excitement and challenge of frontier research, acquire new skills, and meet researchers at all career stages.",
