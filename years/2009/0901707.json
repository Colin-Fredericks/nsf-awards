 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nIn this project, the PI intends to use the theory of motives to create new\r\ntools for the study of problems in algebraic geometry and number theory.\r\nThe PI will develop a theory of motivic sheaves. His approach is based on\r\nthe idea that the category of motivic sheaves over a scheme can obtained\r\nby gluing the DG categories of Voevodsky's motives over points. The PI\r\nplans to study the functor of motivic vanishing cycles and prove that this\r\nfunctor commutes with the Hodge realization and l-adic realization.\r\nThe PI will apply these results to the study of degenerations of\r\nalgebraic varieties and, more specifically, to the integrality conjectures in\r\nmirror symmetry. Additionally, the PI plans to use the theory of motivic\r\nsheaves to embed the category of log schemes into the category of motives\r\nproviding a bridge between the  Fujiwara-Kato-Nakayama Hodge and\r\netale realizations of log schemes.\r\n\r\nThe theory of motives is a central part of algebraic geometry.\r\nAlgebraic geometry deals with systems of algebraic equations. The theory\r\nof motives uses ideas from algebraic topology (study of shapes by means of algebra)to understand structural properties of the solution set\r\neven when one cannot actually solve the equation explicitly. This theory\r\nprovides a language to relate seemingly unrelated objects such as the\r\nspace of complex solutions to a given system of algebraic equations with\r\nintegral coefficient and the set of its integral solutions. \r\nThe PI plans to borrow some ideas from  singularity theory (a part of algebraic topology, that studies shapes by degenerating them into simpler ones), adapt these ideas to the new setting, using the language of motives, and then apply it to solve problems in algebraic  geometry and number theory that can not be\r\nsolved by other methods.",
