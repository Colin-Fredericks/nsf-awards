  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funds provided by National Science Foundation were used to support oceanographic research conducted on the R/V Point Sur.  The R/V Point Sur is owned by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and is operated by Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML).  The supported research took place exclusively off the West coast of the United States and ranged primarily from San Diego, California to the Oregon/Washington boarder.  The Oceanographic Technical Services proposal (OCE-0917849) was a three-year proposal (2009-2011), which provided funding for the marine technician group on the R/V Point Sur.  This group consisted of two technicians who are paid full time from this proposal.  A third person, (Marine Superintendent) who was primarily responsible for managing the group, was also funded by this proposal at a reduced level (10%).  The two primary individuals associated with this program are sea-going marine technicians and help support the technical aspects of the vessel.  The third person, functioned as a relief technician and went to sea as needed.  While at sea, the marine technician\u00c6s primary responsibilities include the following: serving as liaison between the ship\u00c6s crew and the research party, operating shared use equipment such as the CTD/Rosette, ADCP, UDAS and echosounding systems, assist with over the side operations, and instruct scientists in the safe and proper operation of the ship and scientific equipment.\n\nIn additiona to the safe deployment and operation of oceanograhic instrumentation, the Marine Techncians also provided assistance to the chief scientist of a cruise, in the training and education of graduate and undergraduate students.  This assistance usually took place during day cruises where students sailed on the vessel as part of an academic course or seminar.  Various different gear and techniques were discussed and demonstrated.\n\nAlthough this is a technical support program and does not conform easily to public outreach and education, there are several ways in which support of the R/V Point Sur operations will do exactly that.
