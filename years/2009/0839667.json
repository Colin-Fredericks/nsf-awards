 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project proposes to develop a real-time high-data-rate multi-carrier modem for underwater acoustic communications and networking. It will lead to a data rate increase by one order of magnitude over existing commercial acoustic modems. Furthermore, this modem will be equipped with modules that can facilitate advanced networking functionalities. The development of high-data-rate acoustic modems for underwater applications is hindered by the unique characteristics of underwater channels. Based on recent success in making Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) work in underwater environments with fast-moving platforms, this project will develop a real-time high-data rate OFDM modem. This will solve a long-standing problem in the underwater acoustic communication community. \r\n\r\nBy providing a real-time high-data-rate multi-carrier acoustic modem, this project will make significant contributions to the acoustic communication community and will be a significant step towards the commercialization of high-data-rate underwater modems. It will directly benefit the development of emerging underwater wireless sensor networks for a variety of aquatic applications such as oceanographic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster prevention, and tactical surveillance applications.\r\n",
