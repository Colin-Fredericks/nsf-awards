In particular, the\r\nwork contributes to our general understanding of the interplay between sensing, control,\r\nand computation as people attempt to design systems that minimize costs and\r\nmaximize robustness.\r\nPowerful new abstractions, planning algorithms, and control laws that accomplish basic\r\nmapping and monitoring operations are being developed in this effort. This is expected\r\nto lead to improved technologies in numerous settings where mapping and monotoring\r\nare basic components.\r\nAmple motivation is provided by technological challenges that involve searching,\r\ntracking, and monitoring the behavior of people, wildlife, and robots. Examples include\r\nsearch-and-rescue, security sweeps, mapping abandoned mines, scientific study of\r\nendangered species, assisted living, ground-based military operations, and even\r\nanalysis of shopping habits.\r\nThe work is particularly transformative because it lives outside of the traditional\r\nboundaries of algorithms, computational geometry, sensor networks, control theory, and\r\nrobotics. Furthermore, national interest continues to grow in the direction of developing\r\ndistributed robotic systems that combine sensing, actuation, and computation. By\r\nhelping to break down traditional academic and scientific barriers, it is expected that the\r\nwork will transform the way we think about robotics algorithms, the engineering design\r\nprocess, and the education of students across the robotics, computational geometry,\r\nand control disciplines.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0905523 PI Name:LaValle, Steven\r\nPrinted from eJacket: 05/06/09 Page 1 of 1",
