 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is aimed at performing three precision experimental searches for new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics.  The experiments use a maser operating simultaneously with Xe-129 and He-3.   By stabilizing one of the noble-gas masers to a frequency reference, the PI's group can control the environment of the masers and then use the other maser as a sensor for new physics.  The experiments to be carried out include:  (i) a sensitive test of the fundamental Lorentz invariance (one of the fundamental aspects of the theory of relativity) and CPT (Charge conjugation, Parity, and Time reversal) symmetry for the neutron; (ii) an order-of-magnitude improved search for the effects of torsion gravity, which arises if spacetime has a Riemann-Cartan geometry; and (iii) a sensitive search for anomalous spin-spin interactions in the neutron sector.  For experiment (i) and (ii) the project is expected to provide an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the best previous limits. Much of our understanding of fundamental physics would have to be radically altered if an effect is observed.  Experiment (iii) will provide a first sensitive search of this effect.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the program include the application of the atomic physics based precision measurement techniques of this research into the development of novel biomedical imaging tools (for example magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at low magnetic fields of hyperpolarized noble gas inhaled into human lungs), as well as the development of a high-sensitivity magnetometer using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond.  Other broader impacts include extensive student training with continued successful focus on inclusion and training in precision measurements techniques of students and postdocs who are members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.",
