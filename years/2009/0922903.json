The system will be configured to provide a high level of capability and maximum flexibility for use in a shared facility environment. A multi-pocket electron beam evaporator will provide a capability of depositing six different metals/dielectrics in a high vacuum for smooth and precise interface between them. The acquisition of an e-beam evaporator with the nano/micro facility at CCNY will enhance the quality and scope of the research training and education by incorporating hands-on experience in the class materials and also foster the integration of research and education by offering new research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. The research conducted using the proposed equipment is interdisciplinary and involves the collaborative efforts from various departments. This will be a great opportunity for our students to obtain interdisciplinary knowledge and research experience through participating in these research activities. CCNY is committed to providing a high-quality education to its predominant Hispanic American, African-American, and female students. Research opportunities resulting from the acquisition of the e-beam evaporator system will promote more underrepresented minority groups to pursue in advanced degrees in science and engineering at CCNY and better prepare them for the industry and graduate studies in nano/micro technology areas upon their graduation. The proposed equipment will fulfill a critical and growing need for both the education and research on nano/micro technology at the City College of New York.\r\n",
