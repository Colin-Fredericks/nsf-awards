The focus of the work will be on the top of the downgoing slab where fluids are released by metamorphic dehydration reactions, and the mantle wedge where fluids interact with high temperature solids to form magma. The work will start with 2-D models and extend to more challenging 3-D models. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThis project will contribute to the modeling infrastructure of the marine geology and geophysics community and other communities as well. It will also address the need for the synthesis of geochemical and geophysical observations as the MARGINS program enters its final stages. Finally, it will support a full-time post-doc.",
