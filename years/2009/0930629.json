 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims at developing a novel bioasphalt production technology using a recycled agricultural byproduct and recycled coal-fired power plant waste. Demand for asphalt in the United States is projected to increase 2.3 percent annually from 2006 to reach 38.5 million tons in 2011. Because of concerns over dependence on foreign oil, high energy consumption, a high asphalt price and unstable supply, and climate change, non-petroleum based bioasphalt made from renewable sources needs to be studied and developed. In this Phase I research, the optimal conditions for bioasphalt production will be determined, and the properties of the bioasphalt produced will be characterized. The performance of the hot mix bioasphalt concrete will be evaluated and compared with the petroleum based asphalt. The technical feasibility of this technology will be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success of this technology will result in a renewable and sustainable material that will ensure the asphalt industry a sustainable development and lead to a revolutionary change towards environmentally sound practices and foreign oil independence. The application of renewable material based bioasphalt for highway and other infrastructure construction will prompt local economic growth, increase jobs, and benefit the nation with environmental protection and energy independence. \r\n\r\n",
