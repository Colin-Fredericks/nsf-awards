The analyzer will be used to measure total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC) and total inorganic carbon (TIC). The instrument will be employed in paloclimatology and paleoenvironmental science using samples from terrestrial, marine and lacustrine systems. The early career PI has considerable experience with the requested instrumentation and will oversee purchase, set-up, maintenance and operation. The Department of Geosciences will provide 15% matching funds, and will support all infrastructure costs and long-term repair costs post-warranty. The PI will train new users and establish a nominal per sample fee to cover expendables and supplies. The PI will use the new instrumentation in understanding the biogeochemistry of the late Paleozoic ice age by analyzing the extent and duration of ice sheet events and the end-Permian biotic crisis. Additionally, carbon measurements will support the Antarctic Geologic Drilling Program. The PI will investigate the diagenic processes recorded in ice cores by extracting and analyzing pore-waters. Sediment samples have also been taken for analysis. Diagenesis will also be assessed in carbonate mounds by analyzing carbon speciation. Aragonite removal (or preservation) will be determined as a proxy for environmental conditions. Similarly, conditions by which aragonite skeletal remains are preserved will also assessed by analyzing cores from other locations. The instrumentation will provide a unique regional resource for the PI and other collaborative researchers. Results will be widely disseminated through the literature and at meetings. Student researchers will be trained and given access to the instrumentation. Class projects will also be supported. \r\n\r\n***",
