 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\r\n(Public Law 111-5).\"\r\nIntellectual merit: \"Super-eruptions\" - explosive eruptions that produce >450 km3 of\r\nmagma -arguably are the most catastrophic of all natural processes on Earth. They play\r\na central role in ongoing debates about the nature of crustal magmatism. Study of\r\nsuper-eruptions may illuminate [1] the processes by which large quantities of magma\r\naccumulate in the upper crust, are stored and modified, and erupt; [2] the relations\r\nbetween intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks; and [3] the construction of plutons and\r\nbatholiths. We propose a multi-faceted approach to investigate the generation and\r\neruption of the >600 km3 Peach Spring Tuff (PST: Miocene,\r\nArizona-California-Nevada). Exposure of the extensive outflow sheet as well as a thick\r\nintracaldera tuff section and related granite makes this a particularly appealing target for\r\nstudy. The PST phenocryst assemblage comprises a diverse array of accessory\r\nminerals, notably including abundant sphene (titanite), which plays a vital role in both\r\nrecording evolving conditions and driving trace element variation. Critical questions to\r\nbe addressed include: [1] What environmental factors control occurrence of key\r\naccessory minerals - especially sphene? [2] How does growth of accessories influence\r\ngeochemical signatures of magmas - and how can these signatures be used to\r\ncharacterize evolution of magmatic environments? [3] What are the conditions in giant\r\nchambers immediately prior to super-eruptions? [4] How much do conditions fluctuate,\r\nand are they a direct response to replenishment, eruption, or wholesale contamination?\r\n[5] How long do large systems last, and during how much of their lifetime is there a\r\nlarge chamber? [6] Are chambers containing super-volumes of eruptible magma\r\ninherently unstable, or is triggering suppressed for unusual lengths of time to permit\r\naccumulation of enormous quantities of magma? [7] How, and how efficiently, are large\r\nvolumes of melt-rich magma extracted from crystal-rich residue? [8] How and where are\r\nhighly-evolved, high-silica rhyolites generated? [9] What is the significance of similarities\r\nand differences between felsic intrusive and extrusive rocks? [10] Why are highly\r\nevolved plutonic rocks less voluminous than volcanic equivalents? [11] Do giant\r\neruptions have a different relation to their residual plutonic equivalents than\r\n'normal'-sized eruptions? Are their chambers far larger, or do they more efficiently\r\nextract the eruptible material?\r\nThis project will entail an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach involving PIs and\r\ncollaborators with diverse expertise and perspectives. The project will combine\r\nextensive field work, elemental and isotopic analyses of rock, glass, mineral, and melt\r\ninclusion samples, dating using several complementary geochronological methods,\r\nquantitative textural investigations, and experimental studies aimed at elucidating the\r\nstability and saturation behavior of sphene. We will employ, among other methods,\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0911726 PI Name:Miller, Calvin\r\nPrinted from",
