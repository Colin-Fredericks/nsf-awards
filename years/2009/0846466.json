 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this research is to develop a new class of optical frequency metamaterials that leverage magnetic dipole transitions in Lanthanide ions for photonic device applications.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Recent metamaterials research has expanded the range of materials and phenomena available for photonic devices. Whereas most metamaterials exploit artificial magnetic resonances in lossy metallic structures, this program explores the natural magnetic dipole transitions in Lanthanide ions. Enhancing these quantum magnetic resonances promises to enable the development of continuous, low-loss, isotropic metamaterials. Such metamaterials would have direct application in the areas of nanoscale lithography and imaging. Moreover, metamaterials incorporating Lanthanide ions offer the intrinsic gain necessary to realize amplification in newly proposed designs for nanoscale optical circuits and lasers.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: Lanthanide ions are light emitters in a board range of technologies from fluorescent lighting and color displays to lasers and fiber-optic amplifiers. This program leverages the societal and technological relevance of Lanthanide materials to: (i) advance cutting-edge research in the applied areas of optical devices and solid-state lighting, and (ii) improve the education of students from a diverse range of ages, backgrounds and disciplines. Specific plans include: (1) development of new interdisciplinary course on the \"Art & Science of Light\"; (2) continuation of summer workshop series to promote hands-on laboratory training; (3) expansion of SearchLight Project to raise awareness for energy and environmental implications of lighting; (4) development of new educational modules in collaboration with NSF-supported GK-12 \"Physical Processes in the Environment\" program for the Providence Public School system.",
