Specifically, the PIs intend to upgrade the computer system with newer, serviceable software (Probe for Windows), purchase a new energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) detection and electronics system, obtain and install a PC1 diffraction crystal for light element analyses, and procure such laboratory supplies to keep the instrument up and running effectively. The University will maintain the service contract on the existing instrument and has adequate support facilities. Research applications would include chondrite probe analyses to elucidate the geologic makeup and history of inner planets and asteroids, probe analysis of amoeboid olivine inclusions (AOIs) in carbonaceous and other chondrites as a proxy for hydrothermal alteration, understanding island arc magmas through zircon geochemistry, understanding early Earth geology through detrital zircon analysis, refine relationships between mafic xenoliths and their host granitoids, understanding batholiths associated with island arcs, dolomite trace element geochemistry, limestone age estimates based on strontium isotopes, beach rock lithification, and Sr/Ca ratios as paleotemperature proxies. The instrument is the only one of its kind in the Caribbean region. It will support 115-130 students in a pedagogical role during each school year. Over the next several years the PIs will incorporate usage and training into an upper level geology course. The upgraded probe will also be used in student research projects at both undergraduate and graduate levels. As a truly regional instrument, the probe will represent a unique resource for the region and support an institution attended almost exclusively by students from an under-represented population. \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
