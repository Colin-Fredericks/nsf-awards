The research goals are to characterize the surface corrosion products formed on bronze sculptures using scanning electron microscopy and x-ray fluorescence spectrometry. This will provide a deeper understanding of the natural patination processes in pristine and polluted environments and also lead to better preservation methods for art conservators. The education and outreach goals also integrate chemistry and art by developing a capstone course on community art conservation. This course will allow science majors to apply what they have learned in their major to a community challenge. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program supported postdoctoral and professional development models that combined research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellows are eligible to apply for this Faculty Development Award.",
