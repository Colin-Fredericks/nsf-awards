 "awd_abstract_narration": "Privacy is an important concern in the digital age, yet the adoption \r\nof privacy preserving technologies has lagged behind that of other\r\nsecurity technologies.  This is, to a great extent, due to the lack of\r\npractical, usable privacy preserving technologies.  The wide adoption\r\nof confidentiality and integrity technologies was triggered by a few\r\npractical software tools, such as SSL and SSH.  By contrast, practical \r\nprivacy preserving technologies still face considerable challenges.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop two practical privacy\r\npreserving technologies, which serve as a case study on unique\r\nrequirements and pitfalls of privacy preserving software.\r\n\r\nPrivacy preserving computation: Generic techniques are close to\r\npractical for some functions of interest, but a tantalizing gap still\r\nremains for many applications.  The practicality gap widens further if\r\nmalicious adversarial behavior must be tolerated.  This project focus\r\non new efficient methods to protect against malicious faults,\r\nretro-fitting at the algorithmic level to gain new efficiencies at the\r\ncryptographic protocol level, and new efficient methods to facilitate\r\nthe ongoing storage and processing of privacy-sensitive data.\r\n\r\nOff-the-record communication: This project will design protocols for\r\noff-the-record communication between group members.  Each member can\r\nverify the identity of the sender and ensure the confidentiality of\r\nthe message, but no subset of group members may conspire to implicate\r\nthe sender to any third party.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this project are to inform the general public that\r\nprivacy is not a lost cause in the digital age, and to create public\r\nappreciation and support for applied cryptography research.",
