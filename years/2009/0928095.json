This research will investigate a novel approach of harnessing mobile sensor networks for SHM.  With optimal placement and reconfiguration strategies, intelligent mobile sensor networks provide a means to adaptively reconfigure network architecture while achieving unprecedented high spatial resolutions. \r\n\r\nThe research will begin with investigating criteria and principles for designing mobile sensor nodes; a magnet-wheeled mobile sensor prototype will then be developed for navigating on ferromagnetic structures.  Substructure-based finite-element (FE) model will be updated and damage detection algorithms that best utilize the high spatial resolution provided by the mobile sensing nodes will be developed.  Finally a systematic methodology will be developed for adaptively optimizing and readjusting network configurations.  \r\n\r\nBenefiting from the high-valued educational tradition at Georgia Tech, considerable efforts will be made to recruit graduate and undergraduate students from minority groups.  The prototype mobile sensors will be integrated with a new course on advanced dynamics and smart structures, which is to be offered by the PI at Georgia Tech.  One-day outreach activities will be designed for groups of K-12 students, in order to spark their strong interest in science and engineering.\r\n\r\n",
