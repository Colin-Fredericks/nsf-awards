The approach is\r\ntwo-fold: (a) developing new information-theoretic tools to\r\nreveal the essential nature of implicit communication in a\r\nmanner analogous to (and compatible with) classical network\r\ninformation theory; (b) viewing the wireless ecosystem itself\r\nas a cyber-physical system in which spectrum is the physical\r\nsubstrate that is manipulated by heterogeneous interacting\r\ncyber-systems that must be certified to meet safety and\r\nperformance objectives.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project comes from the\r\ntransformative technical approaches being developed. The key to\r\nunderstanding implicit communication is a conceptual\r\nbreakthrough in attacking the unsolved 40-year-old Witsenhausen\r\ncounterexample by using an approximate-optimality paradigm\r\ncombined with new ideas from sphere-packing and cognitive radio\r\nchannels. These techniques open up radically new mathematical\r\navenues to attack distributed-control problems that have long\r\nbeen considered fundamentally intractable. They guide the\r\ndevelopment of nonlinear control strategies that are provably\r\norders-of-magnitude better than the best linear strategies. The\r\nkeys to understanding explicit communication in cyber-physical\r\nsystems are new approaches to active learning, detection, and\r\nestimation in distributed environments that combine worst-case\r\nand probabilistic elements.\r\nBeyond the many diverse applications (the Internet, the smart\r\ngrid, intelligent transportation, etc.) of heterogeneous\r\ncyber-physical systems themselves, this research reaches out to\r\nwireless policy: allowing the principled formulation of\r\ngovernment regulations for next-generation networks. Graduate\r\nstudents (including female ones) and postdoctoral scholars will\r\nbe trained and research results incorporated into both the\r\nundergraduate and graduate curricula.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0932410 PI Name:Sahai, Anant\r\nPrinted from",
