 "awd_abstract_narration": "Model My Watershed is a three year project to develop, test and disseminate a watershed-modeling tool set for secondary students.  It is designed to build on GoogleEarth and provide a dynamic interface where students can import as well as add data, modify both environmental conditions and underlying algorithms, work in a collaborative online learning environment, and be exposed to STEM careers. The design is based on the belief that students should have an authentic, exciting, intuitive and interactive tool set that allows them to investigate their own neighborhoods.  The investigations challenge students to make real world decisions based on scientific knowledge and models.\r\n\r\nThe project uses the complexity of environmental science to engage and excite students about the diverse STEM careers that are necessary to study and address environmental issues. Using existing scientific data in an authentic, hydrologic modeling toolset, students learn to predict how environmental changes to the ecosystem affect the hydrologic cycle in their local watersheds. In addition to being able to modify the underlying environmental conditions and model algorithms, the students can modify their watershed by drawing new surfaces or structures on the landscape using tools such as Google SketchUp.  A collaborative web-based communication platform is used to network teams of students and schools to pose questions or challenges and communicate their findings.  The project will directly impact 25 teachers and 1000 students in the Philadelphia area with plans for national dissemination.",
