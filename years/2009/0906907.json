 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will study three types of problems about stochastic partial \r\ndifferential equations (SPDEs) and backward stochastic differential \r\nequations (BSDEs).  Firstly, he will build a connection between SPDEs \r\nand BSDEs; and will use it to prove the strong uniqueness and regularity \r\nproperties for the solutions to such SPDEs. He will also study the rare events\r\nphenomena for financial market using large deviation principle.\r\nSecondly, the PI will derive a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) for \r\nstochastic optimal control problems arising from real world applications \r\nwhere the coefficients of the systems are not smooth. This will lead to two \r\nnew classes of BSDEs. He will study their solutions and will explore the \r\nnumerical approximation for these. Finally,\r\nthe PI will consider the parameter estimation\r\nproblem based on partial information. The key to the proof of the\r\nconsistency of such estimates is heavily dependent on the\r\nestablishment of a filtering stability result.\r\n\r\nThis research is motivated from the study of certain population\r\nmodels, the wireless communication and the mathematical finance. \r\nThe PI will develop mathematic tools to study SPDEs and BSDEs arising from these problems. \r\nThe results obtained will be applied to various real world applications for the benefit\r\nto the society. For example, the SMP can be applied  to the power control\r\nproblem to serve the society in improving the efficiency of the\r\ncommunication network. The study of the financial market will help\r\nthe government to regulate the market; especially,  the large\r\ndeviation problem  will help to characterize\r\nrare events in the financial market. The parameter estimation\r\nproblem can be used to locate various targets including the hidden\r\nsource of pollution. Long-term effects on graduate and post-graduate training of students in stochastic analysis and optimal control are also expected.",
