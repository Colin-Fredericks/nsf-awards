In recent years, the use of geographically (and often globally)\r\ndistributed teams to accomplish organizational tasks has become ubiquitous. One arena\r\nwhere the use of such teams is popular is in Information Systems Development.\r\nInterestingly, while the motivation for globally distributed systems development is often\r\nto harness appropriate human capital, scant attention has been paid toward addressing\r\nthe human resource issues faced by the IT professionals involved in this context. One\r\nparticularly challenging human resource issue is that of work-life balance of the IT\r\nprofessionals involved in globally distributed systems development, who routinely\r\nexperience overlaps and conflicts between their work and personal life domains. In spite\r\nof these recognized challenges, we know of no empirical examinations and very few\r\ntheoretical perspectives informing us about work-life balance issues in this context. Our\r\nresearch program attempts to fill this gap.\r\nIntegrating three theoretical perspectives (Border Theory, Social Exchange Theory, and\r\nDialectical Theory), this research seeks to develop a theoretical model for work-life\r\nbalance in globally distributed systems development settings, and provides a more\r\ncomplete, credible, and theoretically-informed picture of the work-life balance\r\nphenomenon as it relates to this context. We utilize a multi-stage multi-method empirical\r\napproach involving exploratory interviews and pilot survey, followed by a full-scale\r\nsurvey, and finally in-depth interviews of globally distributed systems development\r\nworkers within a cross-cultural context.\r\nThe research will help demonstrate that workers in distributed/virtual settings face\r\nunique challenges. The study will help understand the specific nature of these\r\nchallenges, both in terms of factors and processes, and also facilitate the development\r\nof best practices and programs that organizations can implement beyond the popular\r\nfamily-friendly policies and flexible work arrangements, to help employees manage their\r\nwork and personal lives. The results will also enable us to understand the effect of\r\nwork-life balance (or the lack thereof) on worker turnover and organizational\r\ncommitment, among others, and thereby lead us to discover ways to ensure a steady\r\nsupply of globally distributed systems development -capable professionals, such that\r\nthe distributed/virtual form of work in IT and related areas can be sustained over a\r\nlonger period of time. Finally, through the cross-cultural analysis, we hope to uncover\r\nthe cultural nuances associated with work-life balance -related issues, and allow us to\r\nlearn from the best practices in diverse locations. We believe that the knowledge gained\r\nfrom this research will be of interest to the scholarly communities in several disciplines,\r\nincluding information systems, computer supported cooperative work, human resource\r\nmanagement, and international business.",
