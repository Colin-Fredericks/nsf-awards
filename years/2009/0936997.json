Dr. Ghosh will investigate the preparation and characterization of semiconductor-metal hybrid nanostructures for use as potential electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction.  Dr. Ghosh will work in collaboration with scientists at the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  In his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Ghosh will work with local area high schools to teach students about emerging alternative energy technologies.  In addition, Dr. Ghosh will sponsor and mentor three undergraduate students to do summer research at the Molecular Foundry.  \r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Ghosh is aimed at developing better materials for fuel cells.  The ultimate goal of research like this is to increase the efficiency for conversion of fuel to energy in these devices.  These improvements will help society become more sustainable.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Ghosh are aimed at increasing the participation of young people from underrepresented groups in the sciences.\r\n",
