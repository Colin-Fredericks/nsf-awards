 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to New Mexico State University, Las Cruces is to develop and evaluate unique properties of a new class of hybrid nanomaterials and to study hydrophobicity switching process in nanoporous materials. Hydrophobicity is a fundamental property that is responsible for numerous physical and biophysical behaviors of nonpolar substances in water. This water-induced effective attraction between nonpolar molecules is called the hydrophobic interaction. The interplay between hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties is due to conformational changes in biologically important molecules and is responsible for many of their biochemical functionality, such as stability and penetration of bilipid cell membranes, protein folding and misfolding, DNA-protein interaction and many other related phenomena. This project will study the hydrophobicity switching in response to various physical and chemical stimuli for possible regulation of molecule and ion transport through lipid bilayers or cell membranes.  A systemic study of hydrophobic switching will be carried out to understand the release of intracellular release of molecules including drugs in response to their high concentrations using two types of nanopores, namely, hydrophobic nanoporous membranes and hydrophobic nanotubes.  In addition, the proposed model for a new drug delivery mechanism will be evaluated that could avoids endocytosis and thus avoiding many side effects during intracellular drug delivery.\r\n \r\n\r\n The proposed project is expected to develop an understanding of how to control\r\nhydrophobicity and transport of molecules and ions through hydrophobic nanopores, and this knowledge base is critical in the development of novel drug delivery systems.  The use of hybrid nanomaterials and bio-inspired approaches in these applications offers the possibility of innovative solutions that are not only versatile, but also cost effective, robust and environmentally benign.  The New Mexico State University at Las Cruces is a Hispanic-serving institution, and the PI plans to continue recruiting, teaching and training students (graduate, undergraduate and high school), especially underrepresented minority students including women and Hispanic students.  In addition, web-based education, recruiting and training students for Chemical Olympics and Chemical Education are some of the other planned outreach activities.",
