 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neutron stars are the evolutionary end points of massive stars and are valuable probes of matter under extreme conditions of density and magnetic fields. Neutron stars with ages less than 10,000 years are extremely important for studying physics of core collapse, the properties of matter at nuclear densities, and the workings of astrophysical particle accelerators. Young neutron stars are heterogeneous in their properties, and very hard to find. \r\n\r\nDr. Camilo and his group will undertake three complementary searches for young neutron stars by a detailed analysis of existing data from large-scale surveys at radio wavelengths.  These data are the most sensitive current probes of neutron stars, at least until the advent of the next generation of radio telescopes. The goals of his work will be to obtain a full picture of the properties of young neutron stars that power bright gaseous nebulae, to determine the birthrate of a newly identified class of high magnetic field young neutron stars, and to characterize the nature of transient radio sources.\r\n\r\nThis research project will also emphasize the training of graduate students  and the involvement of high school students and teachers in frontline scientific inquiry, with a view toward increasing their understanding and appreciation of science.  The existing survey data will also be made available to the wider astronomical community.",
