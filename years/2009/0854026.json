This phenomenon has much relevance to many chemical membrane systems, such as battery and fuel cell electrolytes, but the scientific understanding has been limited due to the lack of controlled experimental platform. Using micro-nanofluidic systems Professor Han's group will carefully characterize field, flow, and concentration distribution around the ion concentration polarization zone, which could lead to better understanding and optimization of chemical membranes. At the same time, novel applications of ion concentration polarization, such as desalination and biomolecule concentration, will be explored. In doing so, Professor Han's group will engage and involve early undergraduate students, in order to broaden the participation of undergraduate students in real-world engineering research. \r\n",
