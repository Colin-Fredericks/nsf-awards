 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Under this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Ryszard Jankowiak from Kansas State University will use spectral hole-burning (SHB) and single photosynthetic complex spectroscopy (SPCS) to study excitonic structure and excitation energy transfer (EET) processes in two photosynthetic complexes from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. It is anticipated that information from SBH data will provide new insights into the electronic structure and EET dynamics of the PSII core and PSI-C43' complexes. The key goals are to improve understanding of EET processes and the electronic properties of the cofactors in these two photosynthetic systems, and to broaden applicability of SHB. The rationale is that a better understanding of the structure-function relationship of these natural systems will further facilitate the development of artificial photovoltaic devices. One of the key objectives is to develop an algorithm to (simultaneously) model various types of optical spectra to improve our understanding of the functioning of photosynthetic complexes. Excitonic calculations will be performed using available crystal structures to correlate experimental results with known structures and to provide more insight into the structure-function relationship. In summary, a number of complementary methods and new approaches will be used to advance our understanding of photosynthesis. Professor Jankowiak will devote considerable attention to the involvement of students from under-represented groups and will develop a program for high school students to influence them early in life to pursue careers in science. A Chemistry Symposium will be organized once a year for high schools students and chemistry teachers from Kansas.",
