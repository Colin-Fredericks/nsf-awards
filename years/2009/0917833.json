 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will explore a range of issues related to new and emerging technologies for advanced research for imaging related to capturing, digitizing and analyzing historical objects.  These include historical documents, visual images, and three-dimensional (3D) artifacts, many of which are to be found in widely-scattered collections and having restricted accessibility. By digitizing historical objects, critical attributes are both preserved and at the same  time enable studies that are impossible with the traditional approaches. Such studies might have been impossible up to now either because a research question requires study of large quantities of data preserved in collections around the world or because the study wishes to examine details invisible to the human eye, such as the remains of erased texts preserved in palimpsests,  miniature scripts on cylinder seals, etc.  or patterns that are hard to compare objectively (e.g., patterns of quilt images).  A team at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications organize and convene the event in collaboration and with support from the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC).",
