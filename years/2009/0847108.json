 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop and understand organocatalyzed reaction methodology that can lead to useful processes in organic synthesis. An effort to exploit the utility of novel phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric reactions will be explored.  In this end, synthetic routes based on this technology could allow for the preparation of novel chiral heterocycles.  This chemistry will also be used as a 'chiral enabling technology,' translating the stereochemistry for subsequent transformations.  An effort will also be made to apply phosphoric acid-catalyzed aza-Friedel-Crafts chemistry to the preparation of natural products.  Mechanistic studies will be used to explain the observed enantioselectivity and to gain insight into the development of new reactions or to improve existing methods. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Jon C. Antilla of the Department of Chemistry at The University of South Florida.  Professor Antilla's research efforts center on the development of new organocatalytic reaction methods and their application to synthesis.  These synthetic methods could be used to prepare basic chiral synthons for the development of pharmaceuticals and for use in material science.  Professor Antilla will also pursue an educational initiative whereby under-privileged high school students from local High Schools will attend a six-week long chemistry laboratory enrichment course as part of the University of South Florida Upward Bound program. The exposure of an interactive laboratory experience in the chemical sciences should help in scientific literacy, college enrollment in the sciences, and also to acclimate the students to a college environment.",
