 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tPhenylpropanoids are an important class of plant secondary metabolites that are critical for growth and survival, with functions ranging from providing flower color, protection from ultraviolet light, and defense against pathogens, to the regulation of hormone transport. These metabolites are also of medical importance due to their documented anti-oxidant and anti-cancer properties in humans. Extensive molecular and biochemical characterization of the pathway responsible for the synthesis of phenylpropanoids, combined with recent insights into the physiological functions of the metabolites themselves, make this an ideal system to address fundamental questions about cellular metabolism using an integrative, multidisciplinary approach to place these molecular and biochemical events into a physiological context. Understanding the controls of this pathway will provide insights into engineering the synthesis of phenylpropanoids and other plant metabolites, both for improving plant growth and facilitating the production of these important compounds for the nutritional and dietary enhancement of crops. \r\n\tIn this Arabidopsis 2010 project, six research groups will come together in a unique discovery effort, involving the establishment of biological framework models that integrate gene expression, protein expression, and metabolite production into a comprehensive map of phenylpropanoid function, signaling, and metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. This project addresses the priorities of the 2010 project by collecting one of the first unified sets of time course gene expression, protein expression, and metabolite data and then use emerging computational methods to combine these comprehensive data sets in order to create testable models of integrated biological networks. This project combines modeling, theory, and experimentation to produce a systems-level understanding of the hormonal controls of the transcriptional and regulatory mechanisms controlling phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Research results from this project will be made widely accessible to the public through publication and through construction of an information-rich website at http:// www.phenylpropanoid2010.wfu.edu. This project will result in interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. In addition, the PIs will partner with local and national groups to enhance science education, including development of K-12 student and teacher experiences and providing research opportunities for individuals from groups underrepresented in science.  \r\n",
