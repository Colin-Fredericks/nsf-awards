 "awd_abstract_narration": "HELP is a cross cutting and transdisciplinary initiative of the United Nations Educational Scientific Organization (UNESCO) led by the International Hydrological Programme.\r\nHELP is creating a new approach to integrated catchment management through the creation of a framework for water law and policy experts, water resource managers and water scientists to work together on water-related problems. From the technical perspective, the broad objectives of HELP are to strengthen field-oriented, experimental hydrology using the drainage basin (up to scales 104 to 106 km2 as the framework. Water related physical (hydrological, climatological, ecological) and non-physical (technical, sociological, economics, administrative, law) observations will be made in these catchments which address the most critical policy and management issues as perceived by ?users? under different biophysical and socio-economic environments, taking into account needs for sustainable development. The desire for this new programme to be truly ?user-driven? will require the active involvement of both policy and facilitating (water and land resource managers) groups to set the policy agenda and ensure the scientific results will benefit societal needs through the revision of policy and management practices.\r\nA workshop is being held in Tucson, Arizona, hosted by SAHRA and sponsored by ICIWaRM, to conduct a ten-year review of the progress in the HELP program as measured by the original HELP objectives and to provide new or modified programmatic guidance for the next phase of the HELP program.  To lay the foundation for cooperative work between HELP Basins within North America and between North America and South America Basins.  \r\n\r\n",
