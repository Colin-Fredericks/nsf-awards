 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop complementary techniques to analyze the stability behavior of stochastic delay systems.  In addition, we will examine phenomena caused by the combination of noise and time delays.  These investigations will be tailored towards the specific applications of real time dynamic substructuring and machining experiments.  We will also investigate two alternatives for parameter identification in nonlinear systems that contain delays and stochastic parameters.  In summary, the proposed research will provide new tools that could potentially impact a broad scope of applications in engineering, physics, biology, and signal processing.  \r\n\r\nThe above research objectives consider timely and relevant studies to advance the frontiers in two important application areas. Educational efforts will include outreach activities in teaching Jr./Sr. high school students about vibrations through demonstrations.  Graduate student experiences will include cross-training at both universities, industry interactions, and research interactions with international collaborators.  The PIs will work with the Society of Hispanic Engineers, Alliance for Minority Participation, and the Society of Women Engineers to identify under-represented students with compatible interest.\r\n",
