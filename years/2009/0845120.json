The approach is to use an active electrogcorticography (ECoG) electrode array ?fabric\".  ECoG recording uses a planar, flexible 2-D electrode array on the surface of the brain. It provides much higher spatial resolution and signal fidelity than electroencephalography scalp recording, and is less invasive and more robust than penetrating single-unit neural recording electrodes. ECoG brain surface recording is a highly promising candidate for future neuroprosthetic devices.\r\nThe intellectual merits of this research include the design of low energy communications circuitry for wirelessly transmitting ECoG data, low power mixed-signal circuitry for recording and interpreting low-level neural signals, and miniaturized system integration. The ECoG fabric will integrate a distributed network of low power ICs across a biocompatible microelectrode array. Each IC records from multiple electrodes and forms the core of thin, flexible ?unit cells?. The high spatial resolution and scalability of this architecture provides high signal quality. \r\nThis project will impact the field of neuroprosthetics by demonstrating a new class of active fabric neural implants. This research will directly impact science currently underway at the University of Washington and elsewhere, which will provide realistic local testbeds to verify the devices while providing a significant outreach opportunity to the medical community. Additionally, this project will provide a platform to promote the participation of underrepresented minority and women students through collaborations with local teachers and the Engineering Advising and Diversity Center.\r\n\r\n",
