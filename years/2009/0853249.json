 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\n0853249\r\nCupples\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaking underground storage tanks (LUST) sites have resulted in BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenezene and xylenes) compounds, oxygenates such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) or tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) migrating into surface and groundwater and eventually show up in drinking water supplies. Even though MTBE is being phased out, the problem is not likely to be resolved soon because of its historical widespread use, the recalcitrant nature of MTBE,  and the physiochemical properties of the compound that favor movement to water supplies.  Bioremediation through natural attenuation is the most favored cost-effective way of cleanup. However, information on the microorganisms involved at different sites and their ability to efficiently transform these chemicals under various environmental conditions is still lacking.\r\n\r\nThe principal objective of this proposal is to develop and apply stable isotope probing (STP) methods to identify and to study the microorganisms responsible for the transformation of contaminants from leaking underground storage tanks (LUST) under in situ conditions. Major research tasks are: (1) to address the limitations associated with STP and further refining methods accuracy, (2) to apply STP to identify the organisms responsible for the biodegradation of BTEX, MTBE, and TBA, and (3) to determine the impact of in situ conditions on the populations and activity of these microorganisms. The proposed work builds on s strong set of techniques already developed in the PI?s laboratory and is national interest because of the potential contribution to better understanding and the solution of water pollution by leaking LUST. \r\n\r\nThe PI has made a strong attempt to develop the broader impacts of the research and has laid out a detailed set of plans for outreach to underrepresented groups, K-12 education, and international collaborators. Information gained by this project will be broadly disseminated. The proposed international collaboration with a group in Newcastle that is exploring a related topic on biodesel will be very enriching experience for the researchers involved in this effort.",
