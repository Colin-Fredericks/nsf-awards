 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop polyaniline nanofibers into a biologically responsive multi-functional material for use as a tool for the rapid and inexpensive diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) through a novel precipitation based smart biosensor platform. The bulk synthesis of conducting polymer nanofibers is green and highly scalable yielding a product which forms water stable colloidal suspensions. Conducting polymers have multiple responses that can be utilized for sensing, including colorometric, conductivity and oxidation state changes. This project will add an additional functionality to polyaniline nanofibers which causes them to form a gel precipitate in the presence of specific sequences of DNA or RNA giving a rapid visual indication of the presence of a target such as from UTI bacteria for the detection of a UTI in a patient. This will be accomplished through a novel functionalization of polyaniline nanofibers with single stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes. Since this process is aimed at direct analysis of patient samples without additional sample handling, or equipment, this technology promises to be a real-time test with accuracy competitive with more expensive current clinical standards.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of successfully developing a urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity test for bacteria to determine the presence and type of an infection a patient has within seconds rather than days.  The test will also determine the proper course of treatment. A patient's actual range of conditions can also vary significantly from those causing mild inconvenience to those causing painful and serious ailments. This testing deficiency results in increased demand on the healthcare system from additional unnecessary costs of treatment and repercussions from overmedication, such as the development of drug resistant bacteria. The goal is a UTI diagnostic accuracy approaching 100% through the use of conducting polymer nanofibers with multiple-analyte probes for bacteria identification and/or target genes to determine antibiotic resistances. This technology will enable the initial diagnosis of the UTI as well as identify the proper course of treatment based on the antibiotic susceptibilities of the infecting bacteria within minutes instead of days at a cost of a few dollars.\r\n\r\n",
