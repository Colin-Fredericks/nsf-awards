 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the collaborative research program of Prof. Elisabeth Gwinn and Prof. Deborah Fygenson of the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Profs. Gwinn and Fygenson and their students will study clusters composed of just a few silver atoms that are stabilized within artificial, nanometer-scale DNA cages. The goal of these studies is to use the exquisite structural control provided by self-assembly of designed DNA strands to create tiny photon emitters with cage-selected optical and chemical properties. Optical characterization at the single molecule level, together with solution fluorescence, mass spectroscopy, electrophoresis, and modeling will contribute to a fundamental understanding of these fluorescent silver cluster-DNA molecules, which are poised for impact on technology through future use in DNA-templated nanodevices and in probing the structure of DNA constructs at scales below the resolution of existing microscopies.  The graduate and undergraduate students involved in this interdisciplinary research project will be trained in a complementary suite of advanced techniques that encompasses optics, chemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology.  The students will also be involved in Family Science Nights at local public schools where they will use fun hands-on activities that tie to their research to inspire K-12 students' interest in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: The PIs investigated the light-emitting properties of tiny clusters of silver atoms that are held within strands of synthetic DNA (deoxy-ribonucleic acid, one of the polymeric molecules that is a building block for life).  It has been known for many years that silver clusters composed of just a few atoms can emit light, or \"fluoresce\", when isolated within elaborate vacuum apparatus.  The encapsulating strands of DNA used by the PIs allow the clusters to retain their fluorescent properties in watery environments, greatly expanding their potential for useful applications.  Remarkably, the specific sequence of the encapsulating DNA controls the color (wavelength) of the silver cluster fluorescence, as established by the PI's prior work and subsequently exploited by other research teams.\n\n            The main themes of the PIs\u00c6 work under this NSF grant were to 1) determine the size of the fluorescent silver clusters and gain understanding of how their color relates to their shape; 2) determine what wavelengths of incident light can excite silver cluster fluorescence; 3) determine what aspects of the DNA environment are necessary for stabilizing fluorescent clusters, and whether synthetic RNA (ribonucleic acid, the workhorse for information transfer within cells) might also be a suitable stabilizing host; and 4) determine whether the clusters can be organized onto artificial, highly ordered DNA scaffolds generated by techniques of  DNA nanotechnology.  The next paragraph summarizes the outcomes of these themes.\n\n            Theme 1: By developing sophisticated separation techniques that can sort out silver clusters according to their size and to the shape of the DNA host, the PIs found that the numbers of silver atoms ranges from 10-20 in silver clusters with fluorescence colors from the green (560 nm) through the infrared (780 nm).  Optical data on pure solutions of silver clusters, and on individual clusters, indicate that they have rod like shapes, with the length of the rod  being the primary determinant of color. Theme 2: The PIs found that, in addition to excitation of fluorescence at wavelengths ~ 100 nm shorter than the emission wavelength, all DNA-encapsulated silver clusters also fluoresce when the DNA bases are excited near 260 nm, establishing both that energy transfer takes place from the bases to the cluster, and methods for optical tests to assay the simultaneous presence of multiple types of fluorescent clusters. Theme 3: The PIs determined that although RNA is more fragile than DNA, it also serves as a robust host for fluorescent silver clusters.  The PIs found that for DNA and RNA strands that contain a single type of base (cytosine -C, guanine-G, adenine-A and thymine-T for DNA; C,G, A and uridine-U in RNA), the formation of fluorescent clusters required C or G bases, while A, T or U bases alone could not support fluorescent clusters at the pH levels compatible with life.  Theme 4: The PIs demonstrated the formation of fluorescent silver clusters on DNA nanotubes, which are made by weaving many short DNA strands into long, stiff, thin, hollow ropes that are only ~ 10 nm in diameter but up to thousands of times longer.  This work showed that fluorescent silver clusters can be formed within single-stranded pieces of DNA that protrude from the nanotube like bristles from a cylindrical brush.  While the designed separation between individual clusters along the tube was large (~ 500 nm) compared to the nanotube diameter, this success is promising for future use of silver clusters at much higher spatial density to \"light up\" artificial structures formed from DNA. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts: Tiny, fluorescent silver clusters that are held within synthetic DNA strands are beginning to emerge in innovative applications for imaging, molecular logic, and selective sensing. The PIs' contributions towards the central but previously not understood issues of silver cluster sizes and shapes, and of how the..."
