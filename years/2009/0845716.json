For example, a computer representation of a three-dimensional object is usually constructed from a set of points sampled from its surface using a 3D laser scanner.  Another example is the set of snapshots from the simulated trajectory of a folding protein, a four-dimensional point set.  Given any set of points, topological analysis tries to recover how the original space was connected.  As such, topological analysis is a significant first step in understanding data, discovering its global structure.  Due to its fundamental nature, topological analysis has applications in diverse disciplines, such as shape description, terrain analysis, sensor networks, and dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the theoretical and algorithmic development of persistence theories.  Intuitively, persistence is the technique of identifying features by analyzing geometric histories of data.  The key notion is that features persist through history while noise is short-lived.  Currently, there exists a persistence theory only for one class of data: the theory of persistent homology for static point cloud data.  This aim of this research is to develop persistence theories for other major classes of data that arise in the practice of computational topology, such as parameterized data, dynamic data, and data in diagrams.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTopological Persistence gives a rigorous way to define and\ncompute shapes from samples.  It is best illustrated with an engineering\nexample from computer aided design: Scanning a mechanical part gives isolated points that need to be connected to make the underlying shape of the\npart. One may want to think of the points as blobs of a given radius to\nsee how they connect. Make the radius too large, however, and you see only one big blob; too small and not everything connects. Topological Persistence maps out at how the connections, holes, and cavities form and vanish as the radius grows, and reveals the right resolution to study the shape of the\nsamples.   \n\nThis project developed the mathematics and algorithms for\nmultidimensional persistence: e.g., if you know where the scanner was, you\ncould represent points as disks with two parameters -- the radius in two\ndirections, and a smaller thickness in a third direction, toward the\nscanner.  The principle investigator (PI) with his students and\ncollaborators designed and implemented a number of algorithms for computing simplicial complexes (an underlying framework for topological persistence) in arbitrary dimensions and abstract spaces. Since these complexes can become large, the project developed new techniques to work with only a relevant subset of the simplices. \n\nThe underlying mathematical techniques apply broadly, in\nwhat is increasingly called Topological Data Analysis, and are used in science (from molecular biology to geological exploration), healthcare, and\nfinance. The PI in particular looked at protein structure and language\ntranscription. Several students were trained in this new area of data\nanalytics, and the PI spent part of his time at Sandia National Labs,\ncollaborating with data scientists there. The PI\u00c6s books on computational\ntopology have also help disseminate these new techniques.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Afra Zomorodian"
