 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this award is to promote undergraduate and graduate student interest and involvement in nanoscience and engineering within forest produces sector by encouraging participation in the high level scientific forum ?The International Conference on Nanotechnology for the Forest Products Industry?.  Initiated in 2006, this is the sole conference that is devoted to nanotechnology in the forest products industry.  With over 150 national and international attendees from industry, academia, and national labs, this is the largest gathering of forest products professionals and decision-makers with a focus on nanotechnology R&D, nano-manufacturing and business.  The 2009 conference will be held in Edmonton, Canada on 23-26 June.  Considered in this proposal are funds to support to lower student registration fees and offer subsidized travel expenses for participating students, junior faculty, and Keynote speakers.  The conference also includes a graduate and undergraduate student poster competition to encourage further student involvement & participation.   \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this conference is that it provides a forum for researchers and students to gain exposure of new advances in nanoscale science and engineering applied to lignocellulosic biopolymers.  This years conference there is an increased focus on the nanocrystalline materials from forest based materials (characterization, imaging, mechanical properties surface functionalization, composite processing, self-assembly), health and environmental issues, and applications of nanotechnology in biobased materials.  There will also be a nanotechnology short course taught by Paul Burrows to help connect the fundamental science to forestry based applications.  The broader impact of this conference is that it supports the development of the underlying science and technology necessary to understand and utilize the nanodimensional structure and properties of wood-based materials and thus enabling a research pathway that contributes to the next generation of sustainable and renewable nanobiocomposite materials.\r\n",
