 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis CPATH award funds an extension of a CPATH community building project between Michigan State University (MSU), Lansing Community College (LCC), and the Corporation for Skilled Workforce (CSW) to prepare a globally competitive engineering workforce that is able to apply Computational Thinking (CT) to a broad range of societal challenges and opportunities. Broadly defined in the context of the engineering practice, computational thinking involves solving problems and designing systems by making use of fundamental computer science concepts. The goal is to redesign the role of computing within the engineering programs at MSU and LCC to develop CT competencies informed by industry needs by infusing CT learning opportunities into the undergraduate engineering curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe project has several major activities.  A primary focus is on developing and implementing instructional modules in Chemical Engineering and Civil Engineering at MSU and the pre-engineering courses at LCC.  The approach is to identify and implement authentic problems for curricular revision in two engineering disciplinary curricula at MSU and the engineering transfer curricula at LCC and to identify the computational principles for each disciplinary epitome and use these principles to help design the instructional modules. The team plans to develop appropriate materials to support the disciplinary faculty who will be teaching the modules. Comprehensive evaluation is to be conducted including the design and implementation of quasi-experimental evaluation and assessment components to document CT competencies in the engineering students. Finally, the group plans to improve information and knowledge exchange via the CPACE Engineering Talent Development Network and dissemination and communication efforts.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit lies with the strong interdisciplinary team that plans to redefine the role of computing within engineering programs and the collaborative network including industry partners that are involved.  The project includes identification of computational thinking concepts and correlation with engineering competencies.  The research results should inform future innovation in multiple engineering disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include the diverse group of students and stakeholders involved and engaged. Transfer from Lansing Community College into engineering programs is to be facilitated and students should be better prepared using the resources of this project. Dissemination of the resources and model is broad, thus allowing for replication and adaptation on a national scale.",
