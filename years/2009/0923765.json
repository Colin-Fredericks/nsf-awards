 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of sensory cues and signals mediating plant-animal interactions have tended to focus only on one scale (community or individual) and one context (attraction). Relatively little is known as to how sensory cues modify behavior across scales and in different contexts. In this study, the tobacco hornworm hawkmoth (Manduca sexta) will be used to address the behavioral roles of relative humidity in foraging choices at different scales (local, habitat and landscape) and contexts (sex, age, nutritional status) and how these interact (additively, synergistically) to modify transitions in nectivorous behaviors of orientation, habitat selection and foraging and their implications for moth fitness. Cross-disciplinary training will be given to atmospheric science undergraduates from Cornell who will not only model relative humidity profiles at the study site, but will come to Arizona to learn, first hand, how climactic variables influence biological processes. This study will also support an outreach program that uses insects to teach biological principals to 2nd grade students in specially designed workshops and classroom visits, reaching over 5000 elementary school students most of whom are minority and of poverty economic status. These students will gain hands-on experience as to the importance of water and humidity in desert environments, how and why insects behave, and that bugs are inherently fascinating. Over 70 Undergraduate Preceptors will be trained in outreach teaching and how to convey an enthusiasm for science to the general public. An outreach program at Cornell ('Insectapalooza') is focused on the extraordinary biology of insects, and will guarantee a strong impact of this project on the public in two diverse cities. The undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows will receive cross-disciplinary training in ecophysiology, behavior, pollination biology, nutritional ecology and community structure, as well as one-on-one mentoring in experimental design, manuscript writing and the oral presentation of scientific research.",

Context-dependence &ndash; the impact of an animal&rsquo;s physiological state, experience, or an external cue that modifies meaning &ndash; remains a major hurdle to reaching a nuanced, predictive understanding of behavior, including our own. For example, it has long been known that pest insects, such as locusts or cutworm moths, are indifferent to sex pheromones during migration. This context-dependence of pheromone responses advises to avoid biocontrol strategies (such as pheromone traps) when pest insects are migrating, and suggests alternative control methods, which could exploit, for example, orientation cues used by these insects as they travel long distances. Despite recent breakthroughs in our understanding of insect sensory biology, ranging from identification of the key visual, olfactory and other chemical stimuli that define their sensory world to mapping how nervous systems encode and perceive these stimuli, there remain surprising gaps in our knowledge of how environmental cues (temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>) modify the perception of such stimuli. We studied the importance of ambient humidity at several spatial scales and in different behavioral contexts, on the orientation, feeding behavior and survivorship of the tobacco hornworm moth (<em>Manduca sexta</em>), a well-studied model insect, and a related, more abundant species, the white lined sphinx moth (<em>Hyles lineata</em>).</p>\n<p>The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intellectual merits</span> of this project stem neither from novel technological approaches nor from the discovery of hidden genes or neural circuits, but rather from the project&rsquo;s nested design of exploring the effects of humidity (and the resource it represents &ndash; water) at several different scales, and behavioral contexts.

One of our most exciting discoveries was that the night-blooming flowers pollinated by hawkmoths produce transient humidity gradients when they first open, due to the presence of large volumes of nectar within them. We showed that <em>Hyles lineata</em> moths detect and prefer such flowers over those without humidity gradients, and interpret this to mean that they can use such information to find rewarding flowers without having to land or probe within them. In a similar vein, we used behavioral assays to measure how <em>Manduca sexta</em> moths respond to humidity at different scales and contexts.
