 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a framework for the development\r\nand deployment of next-generation medical systems consisting of integrated and\r\ncooperating medical devices.  The approach is to design and implement an\r\nopen-source medical device coordination framework and a model-based component\r\noriented programming methodology for the device coordination, supported by a\r\nformal framework for reasoning about device behaviors and clinical workflows.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the formal foundations of the\r\nframework that will enable rapid development, verification, and certification\r\nof medical systems and their device components, as well as the clinical\r\nscenarios they implement.  The model-based approach will supply evidence for the regulatory approval process, while run-time monitoring components embedded\r\ninto the system will enable \"black box\" recording capabilities for the forensic\r\nanalysis of system failures.  The open-source distribution of tools supporting\r\nthe framework will enhance its adoption and technology transfer.\r\n\r\nA rigorous framework for integrating and coordinating multiple medical devices\r\nwill enhance the implementation of complicated clinical scenarios and reduce\r\nmedical errors in the cases that involve such scenarios.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, it will speed up and simplify the process of regulatory approval for coordination-enabled medical devices, while the formal reasoning framework will improve the confidence in the design process and in the approval decisions.\r\n\r\nOverall, the framework will help reduce costs and improve the quality of the\r\nhealth care.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModern clinical practice relies on a wide variety of medical devices for treating patients.  Many devices are network-enabled, allowing them to send out measurement data and, in some cases, accept data and even commands from the network.  Tthese networking capabilities enable a wide array of new clinical technologies.  For example, data from multiple medical devices can be combined and analyzed in real time to provide more powerful decision support for doctors.  New safety interlocks can be introduced to improve patient safety in cases where treatments can interfere with each other.  As an example, a laser scalpel cannot be used for throat surgery while the patient is receiving oxygen.  Closed-loop, semi-autonomous treatments can be introduced, when infusion of medication can be adjusted by a computer based on readings of patient vital signs supplied by other devices. \n\nAll of these technological advances can be realized only if medical devices can interoperate, that is, work together to achieve a common clinical scenario.   Such interoperation is enabled by a networking infrastructure that ensures safe coordination of medical devices.  In this collaborative project with Kansas State University, we have developed a prototype of such an infrastructure called MDCF (Medical Device Coordination Framework) and studied its use in clinical scenarios for decision support, smart alarm, and closed-loop treatment.\n\nIn order to assess safety of scenarios involving multiple devices, we have developed, in collaboration with the Medical Device Plug-and-Play Interoperability Program at the Center for  Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology (CIMIT), the concept of clinical applications.  Clinical applicationa include the specification of the workflow that need to be implemented in the course of treatment and requirements for the devices that can be safely used in this scenario.  Such a specification can be analyzed for safety and presented to regulatory authorities for approval.  When the clinical application is implemented on the MDCF platform using a given collection of devices, MDCF ensures that all necessary devices are connected and satisfy requirements laid out by the application.\n\nIn a parallel, but related, line of research, we explored the use of interoperable devices for decision support and closed-loop continuous treatment.  This effort is best exemplified by a \"smart alarm\" system to improve the quality of alarms in a clinical setting.  Most medical sensors, such as blood pressure monitors and pulse oximeters, provide alarms that go off when they detect a problem based on the patient data they measure.  However, these alarms lack awareness of the larger patient context and, as a result, up to 90% of alarms are spurious, that is, do not indicate that the patient is in danger.  A typical example of a false alarm is when the finger clip of a pulse oximeter falls off and the device assumes that the patient has stopped breathing.  By coordinating readings from multiple devices, the alarm system can infer that the problem is with one of the devices and not with the patient.  Moreover, we can also detect problems with the patient earlier.  In particular, a coordinated deviation in readings of two devices can be understood as an indication of the problem before either of the devices individually reaches its alarm threshold.  As a proof of concept for such a \"smart alarm\" system, we have developed a coordinated alarm for patients recovering from coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  We worked with nurses from the University of Pennsylvania Health System to develop coordination rules. The attached picture shows the interface of the system, which shows data streams provided by the devices, as well as color-coded alarm indicators that display the level of alarm.  Initial evaluation of the system showed that false alarms have been reduced by 50%, without missing any true alarms.\n\nResearch results from this project have been ..."
