 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\n\r\nSome bacteria can enter a nongrowing \"persister\" state that allows them to survive antibiotics and other treatments that normally kill them. By suspending growth, they may also free resources for their genetically identical clonemates.\r\n\r\nMost species form only a few persisters.  This makes persisters hard to study, despite their importance in long-term infections.  However, certain harmless bacteria from plant roots can form up to 40% persisters.  These will be used to determine whether persisters benefit mainly from enhanced stress resistance or by increasing the growth of their clonemates.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this research will provide two main benefits:  First, this research will determine the conditions that favor the spread of persister-forming bacterial strains over nonpersister strains, and the genetic basis of persistence.  This can provide direct medical benefits by aiding the development of novel management strategies, drug targets, and eventually treatments for patients infected with persister-forming bacteria.  Second, some conclusions may apply to other species that are difficult to eradicate because they, too, form dormant, stress-resistant stages.  These include many agricultural weeds and some species of mosquito. One key advantage of the proposed approach is speed: experiments that would take decades with weeds or mosquitoes can be conducted in months with bacteria. This research will provide training opportunities and jobs for undergraduates, high school students, and a post doctoral researcher.\r\n",
