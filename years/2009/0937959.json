 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wisconsin Hierarchically-Redundant, Decoupled storage project (HaRD)\r\ninvestigates the next generation of storage software for hybrid Flash/disk\r\nstorage clusters. The main objective of the project is to improve the\r\nperformance of storage in a variety of diverse scenarios, including new\r\napplication environments such as photo storage as found in Facebook and\r\nFlickr, high-end scientific processing as found in government labs, and\r\nlarge-scale data processing such as that found in Google and Microsoft. The\r\nHaRD project focuses on three key issues in order to improve performance of\r\nthese important applications: client-side Flash-based RAID and file-system\r\nintegration, server-side memory reduction and multicore scheduling of\r\nfile-system tasks, and scheduled network transfers. HaRD pulls together these\r\ntechnologies into a synthesized whole through three targeted storage systems:\r\na scalable photo server, a high-performance checkpoint subsystem, and an\r\nimproved file system for MapReduce workloads. The impact of this project is\r\nsignificant, as HaRD helps to shape the storage software architecture of the\r\nnext generation of cloud computing services, which are of increasing relevance\r\nto both industry and society at large.\r\n\r\n",
