 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research proposal aims at developing a new alignment-free metrological method for optical surfaces with high measurement speed and high dynamic range. Next generation optical surfaces will need to be mass-produced with high departure from spherical shapes, and high numerical aperture. Manufacturing these optical components is challenging because of today?s limited metrology methods: contact sensors are too slow to be used in-process whereas interferometers and wave front sensors have a small limited dynamic range and require careful alignment. The research objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a polarization based method and to evaluate its speed, dynamic range, accuracy, and insensitivity to alignment. The proposed approach combines an innovative polarization camera, a specific illumination, and a novel algorithm for automatic 3D shape extraction.\r\n\r\nThe proposed metrology approach will have a major impact on the manufacturing of aspheric optical components used for various applications: concentrating photovoltaics (CPV) for solar power generation, optical instruments, ophthalmic lenses and consumer electronics (cameras, phones). The system would allow mass production of high quality aspheric lenses with individual inspection of each manufactured component. High numerical aperture lenses would also be measured easily in-process which will drastically increase productivity. This will translate into the faster deployment of cheaper, more efficient solar power production, lighter optical systems, and better corrected contact lenses.\r\n",
