With previous NSF support, this team has developed a suite of Newtonian and general relativistic MHD numerical simulation codes suitable for exploring the global properties of accretion flows onto black holes and the jets they sometimes generate.  This collaborative project, led by Dr. Krolik, will now extend prior work to consider accretion thermodynamics and energetics, the impact of large-scale magnetic fields, and how an accretion flow oriented obliquely to the black hole rotation axis at large distances interacts with Lense-Thirring torques.  Emphasis will be placed throughout on creating quantitative links between dynamical simulation data and observable properties.\r\n\r\nThis work should provide genuine guidance for the controversy over how much large-scale magnetic flux may be brought deep into the accretion flow.  It should also reveal how accretion flows stressed by magnetic fields with intrinsic large-scale structure may differ from those without.  In addition, computing MHD stresses within the accretion flow is essential to the question of the extent of disk bending by gravitomagnetic forces, and it should soon be possible to calculate disk structure with sufficient resolution to address this issue.\r\n\r\nBoth simulation codes and data from specific models will be made available to the community, strengthening the software infrastructure of the discipline.  The project will provide graduate student training in numerical simulation techniques.  Successful public outreach efforts based on simulation results will continue, including planetarium shows and television documentaries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMatter falling into black holes powers some of the most dramatic astronomical phenomena in the universe, such as quasars, active galaxies, gamma ray bursts, jets and X-ray binaries.  An accretion disk surrounds the black hole; orbiting gas within the disk slowly spirals inward as turbulence dissipates orbital energy into heat.   This turbulence arises because rotating gas becomes unstable in the presence of magnetic fields due to the magneto-rotational instability.   This research investigates the black hole accretion process through three-dimensional, time dependent computational modeling.  Large-scale numerical simulations probe the physical processes that occur in accretion, and the simulations are used to infer specific observable properties of black hole systems. \n\n \n\nThe detailed properties of the magnetized turbulent gas within the disk were investigated through simulations of an isolated section of a disk.  These simulations revealed how magnetic field strength and orientation, as well as disk resistivity and viscosity, influence the overall strength of the disk turbulence.  Such simulations were also able to determine averaged properties of the magnetized turbulence that were subsequently adopted to gauge the quality and reliability of simulations of the full, global disk system.   Global simulations are used, in turn, to derive observational predictions.  In one study, the total luminosity emitted from the inner part of the disk was increased by 5-20% by the action of magnetic fields, in contrast to predictions from simpler, non-magnetic models.  X-ray satellite observations of disk systems have detected a detailed spectral signature arising from ionized iron in the region closest to the black hole.  If the shape of that feature can be better understood, the observations would provide a way to determine the spin of the black hole.  This research has led to more detailed predictions of the spectral shape of that feature that are consistent with the underlying magnetic turbulence driving the accretion.\n\n \n\nGlobal disk models were employed to investigate more exotic configurations than the accretion disk lying in the equatorial plan of a single black hole.  One such example is a disk that surrounds a binary black hole system.  Binary black holes eventually merge and produce gravitational waves; such waves have recently been observed for the first time by the LIGO project.  The appearance of such a system in electromagnetic radiation, both prior to and during the merger, is uncertain.  The behavior of the surrounding circumbinary disk is an important first part of developing such predictions. A binary system inside a surrounding disk of gas can exert torques on the gas, but their magnitude depends on details of the gas's density distribution in the region a short distance outside the binary's orbit. That density distribution is controlled by a complicated interplay between the gravity of the stars, pressure forces in the gas, and internal stresses in the gas. Previous work used phenomenological models for the internal stresses; computing them on a physical basis reveals significant changes in the magnitude of the torques and their back-reaction on the orbit of the binary, as well as significantly more accretion onto the binary than had previously been estimated.\n\n \n\n \n\nEnergetic plasma jets are observed to emerge from many black hole systems. Jets are powered by the spin energy of rotating black holes that is transferred to magnetic fields extending along the hole?s spin axis.   This research revealed a new mechanism by which large-scale magnetic fields can be brought down to a rotating black hole?s horizon, allowing them to subsequently drive the jets. \n\n \n\nThe simplest models assume the spin axes of the hole and the disk are aligned; in reality it is likely they are misaligned.   However, a spinning black hole can exert a torque on surrounding orbiting matter that will drive orbiting matter toward the hole?s equatorial plane.  In principle this can lead the disk to become aligned.  Past models of this process have relied upon a simple formulation for the internal stresses that work with the torque to create alignment.  This research replaces that simplification with full magnetohydrodynamic simulations where the stress arises from turbulence.  The simulations found for the first time a transition to a time-steady alignment front in the disk.  The inner disk aligns with the black hole?s equatorial plane, while the outer disk maintains its original orientation.  A diffusion model can describe the location of the alignment front where misaligned angular momentum is transported inward and mixed with fluid whose angular momentum is in alignment.\n\n \n\nWhile this research focuses on the specific properties of magnetized accretion disks surrounding black holes, the results have potential broader impacts.  Rotating, magnetized fluids are ubiquitous, and found in a variety of contexts including such diverse things as planetary dynamos and laboratory devices such as tokomaks and magnetized coquette cylinders.  Finally, the simulation results have been used to create visualizations illustrating black hole phenomena for public outreach, including documentaries and planetarium shows.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John F Hawley"
