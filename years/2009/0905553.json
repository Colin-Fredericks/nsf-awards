 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nTraditional database systems are designed to provide the user with a\r\nclear picture of past states of the world as is represented in the\r\ndatabase. Recently, stream processing systems are introduced to\r\nproduce near real-time answers for those applications applications\r\nthat require up-to-date information. Thus, we see a trend toward\r\nshrinking the ?reality gap? to zero. But for some applications, even\r\nreal-time is not good enough. There is often a desire to get out in\r\nfront of the present by delivering predictions of future events to\r\ntake advantage of opportunities or to avert calamity. Security\r\napplications are a good example since they are typically interested in\r\npreventing a breach rather than simply reporting that one has\r\nhappened. There is currently no database system that can effectively\r\nserve as a generic platform to support such predictive applications.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to fill this gap by designing and building a\r\nprototype database system called \"Longview\" to enable data-centric\r\npredictive analytics. Longview facilitates the use of statistical\r\nmodels to analyze historical and current data and make predictions\r\nabout future data values and events. Users can plug new predictive\r\nmodels into the system along with a modest amount of meta-data, and\r\nthe system uses those models to efficiently evaluate predictive\r\nqueries.\r\n\r\nLongview treats predictive models as first-class citizens by\r\nintelligently managing them in the process of data management and\r\nquery optimization. This involves automatically building models and\r\ndetermining when and which model(s) to apply to answer predictive\r\nqueries. This also involves creating and using the proper physical\r\ndata structures to facilitate efficient model building, selection, and\r\nexecution. Longview handles both streaming and historical queries. In\r\nfact, many streaming queries need efficient access to an archive of\r\npast values, making it necessary to seamlessly combine both stream and\r\nhistorical processing. Finally, Longview investigates \"white-box\"\r\nmodel support, in which the database leverages the operational\r\nsemantics and representation of models to improve performance.\r\n\r\nLongview's goal is to make it much easier to build predictive\r\nanalytics applications in data intensive situations. Seamlessly\r\ncombining data and model management is key to make the process of\r\ncomputing with predictions far easier to express and more efficient\r\nthan the current ad-hoc application-level approaches. The resulting\r\ntechnology also allows for a better understanding and support for\r\nuser-defined functions in database systems.\r\n\r\nLongview is initially used for a real-world sensor-based tracking\r\napplication and a predictive web portal for easy experimentation with\r\ndifferent models and data sets.
