 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kewalo Marine Laboratory of the University of Hawaii has acquired a suite of instrumentation for gene delivery and microscopy with support from the National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. Because of their proximal location to marine fauna, marine laboratories provide unprecedented access to a diverse array of research opportunities unavailable at most university campuses.  Researchers at the Kewalo Marine Laboratory, uniquely situated adjacent to living coral reefs near downtown Honolulu, use cellular and molecular approaches to investigate a wide variety of biological phenomena utilizing a full range of marine organisms. Research at the Kewalo Marine Lab runs the gamut of studies that includes the evolution of body plan diversity, life history evolution, regeneration, symbiosis, and effects of biofilms and environmental stressors on developing embryos and larvae.  This grant funds an integrated system for labeling, tracking, and documenting living single cells over time within the intact organism. Cell labeling strategies include a precision intracellular microinjection apparatus and a gold particle ballistic delivery system, both of which have advantages in particular preparations.  Imaging of labeled cells will be performed by multi-channel confocal microscopy that can image the variety of fluorescent proteins/reagents simultaneously required for each preparation while eliminating background noise. The integrated system is effective and adaptable to the wide array of animal models currently utilized at the Kewalo Marine Lab. This system of cell labeling and documentation will allow students/trainees to exploit the most modern techniques to address fundamental problems in cellular, developmental, evolutionary, and environmental biology.  Results from the studies will be disseminated by student and faculty presentations at local and national meetings, and in peer-reviewed journals.",
