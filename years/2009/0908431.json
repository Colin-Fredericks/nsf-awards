 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\" \r\n\r\nThis award provides funding for a 3 year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Texas A&M University (TAMU) entitled, \"RET Site: Enrichment Experiences in Engineering (E3) for Teachers Summer Research Program\", under the direction of Dr. Robin Autenrieth. This program is a renewal of a successful RET Site and is a collaborative effort with the TAMU College of Engineering, College of Science, and College of Education. \r\n\r\nLed by Dr. Autenrieth, and co-PI, Karen Butler-Purry, the E3 RET Site will continue to match 10 inservice and 2 preservice teachers per year (36 total) with TAMU engineering researchers for a six week summer research experience. This Site addresses the program's goal of involving K-12 teachers in NSF-funded engineering research to bring knowledge of engineering and technological innovation into their classrooms. To accomplish this goal the program has the following four major objectives linked to the intended outcomes and impacts: 1) Provide contemporary engineering research experiences and enhance understanding of the nature of engineering. 2) Scaffold teacher development of authentic inquiry activities.  3) Improve public school teachers knowledge about  careers in engineering.  4) Build a community of teachers who remain engaged with TAMU Engineering and network among themselves.",
