Mueller and Joyce Van Eck (Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research), Stephen M. Stack (Colorado State University) \r\n\r\nThe plant family Solanaceae includes tomato, pepper, potato and eggplant and is the most important vegetable family worldwide in terms of both economic value and volume of production. Tomato is also an important model system for studying fruit biology and plant responses to disease with discoveries impacting the production of many other crops. Recent advances in DNA sequencing have made it feasible to sequence the entire genome of an organism and an international consortium of 10 countries has initiated sequencing of tomato as a reference genome for the Solanaceae family of crops. This project represents the US contribution to the tomato genome sequencing effort and specifically encompasses creation of: 1) a low resolution DNA sequence of the entire tomato genome based on state-of-the-art sequencing technologies, 2) high quality DNA sequence of two of the twelve tomato chromosomes (chromosomes 1 and 10) to complement the remaining 10 chromosome sequences being created by our international partners, and 3) creation and enhancement of electronic web-based resources to allow characterization, analysis and delivery of the tomato genome sequence to researchers who will exploit it for biological discovery in tomato and additional crop species important as sources of food, fiber and energy. Availability of a tomato genome sequence will facilitate research and discovery leading to a broader understanding of plant biology, biodiversity and domestication and will impact agricultural improvement efforts directed toward crop sustainability, productivity and quality of tomato and related species.\r\n\r\nThis project encompasses the US contribution to the international tomato genome sequencing effort. Public access to a reference genome sequence for tomato and related vegetable crops (potato, pepper, eggplant) will support and accelerate research activities focused on both basic understanding of plant biology and development of crop varieties with improved yield, performance, quality and sustainability, thus enhancing US and world food security. In addition to the impact of the resulting science, the project will also provide education and training opportunities. Specifically, four Ph.D. scientists (postdoctoral), two graduate students, approximately 20 undergraduate students and 17 computer programmers, research technicians and other professionals will receive training and employment under this project. The project will provide public outreach activities including presentations to K - 12th graders at schools in the vicinity of the participating research laboratories and summer research internship opportunities for ten undergraduate students in addition to those mentioned above. The project partners with ongoing USDA-funded research to convert output of the tomato genome sequencing effort into tools to assist crop breeding in addition to the development of web-based tools for their presentation to interested members of the research community and the general public. Information developed through this project will be deposited in the NCBI public DNA sequence database (GenBank), published in peer-reviewed journals and presented through the Solanaceae Genomics Network database (www.sgn.cornell.edu) that this project will support and expand.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTomato is one of the most important fruit/vegetable crops in the world in terms of consumption, economic significance and nutritional contributions to human diets.  US per capita consumption of tomatoes (combined fresh and processed) is 70 lbs/year and provides a significant component of dietary vitamin A, C and antioxidants.  The overall goal of the project was to contribute significantly to an international effort toward sequencing of the tomato genome as a public resource promoting tomato variety improvement and biological inquiries into tomato specifically and plants in general.  Efforts included substantial DNA sequence generation,  genome assembly, sequence annotation and development and maintenance of the database that houses and presents the data to the research community and public in an efficient and user-friendly and manner (http://solgenomics.net).   The result has been one of the highest quality plant genome sequences assembled to date.  The sequence and related genomics resources and infrastructure (e.g. Solgenomics.net database, tomato gene and genome fragment clones, DNA markers, and precise localization and gene expression data) have supported a snowballing number of research activities since their release and have helped establish tomato as a model crop system adopted by an expanding number of researchers interested in fundamental and applied aspects of pant biology.  Direct discoveries of the tomato genome sequence included the discovery of a genome triplication event in the ancestry of the plant lineage leading to tomato that occurred at the time of the dinosaur extinction and resulted in generation of new genes contributing to fruit development and quality.  In the short period since its release, the reference tomato genome sequence has enabled the re-sequencing of hundreds of tomato varieties and tomato wild species, providing insights into fruit biology and the genetic selections critical to domestication of this species, in addition to molecular tools that are revolutionizing the way tomato breeders select for improvements in crop performance, yield and quality.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James J Giovannoni"
