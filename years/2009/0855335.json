 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of qualitative and quantitative properties of solutions of the partial differential equations of fluid mechanics including the Navier-Stokes equations. The latter constitute the basic mathematical model of fluid flow and are believed to contain turbulence among their solutions. Turbulent transport and mixing have important applications in many areas of applied physical sciences and engineering and present a number of outstanding challenges for mathematical physics. The investigations will be carried out utilizing modern applied analysis, computation, and numerical simulation in collaboration with graduate students performing doctoral research and postdoctoral researchers working under the direction of the PI. The project has three major components.\r\n\r\nAdvection: Mathematical methods developed by the PI and collaborators will be applied to the advection-diffusion equation and turbulent mixing. This analysis will place absolute limits on diffusive enhancements for passive scalar fields in terms of bulk and statistical features of the stirring flows, and indicate particularly efficient or inefficient stirring strategies. New searches for optimal stirring strategies will be undertaken, and the mixing effectiveness of turbulence will be investigated. \r\nConvection: Theoretical issues in thermal convection will be studied using rigorous analysis and numerical simulation. Differences between convective turbulence sustained by fixed heat flux and fixed temperature conditions will be investigated. The analytical techniques of the PI will be developed and applied to surface tension driven convection.\r\nEnergy dissipation and enstrophy production: Work will continue to determine how maximum enstrophy generating flow-field configurations are related to structures observed in fully developed turbulence. Variational approaches for the derivation of a priori bounds on energy dissipation rates for complex and turbulent flows will be extended to flow configurations relevant to geophysical and astrophysical applications.\r\n\r\nKnowledge gained from this project will contribute to our fundamental understanding of mathematical models in fluid dynamics, of direct relevance in the applied physical sciences and engineering. With regard to this activitys broader impacts in education, it provides frontier dissertation research  opportunities for doctoral students and support for postdoctoral researchers at the University of Michigan. This research also involves extensive collaborations and interactions with investigators from institutions worldwide. In the long term this research will aid the development of practical techniques for applications ranging from aeronautics to astrophysics, and meteorology to materials manufacturing.",
