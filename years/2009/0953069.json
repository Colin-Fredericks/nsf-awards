Science teaching and learning, grades K-8, is improved through a continuum of university preservice preparation, new teacher induction, on-going inservice and leadership development for over 1300 preservice students and inservice teachers.  Establishing a career spanning professional development model, which includes rich content and methodology workshops, provided by regional leaders for professional development, retains a pool of well-prepared K-8 science teachers. \r\nElementary and middle school students experience exemplary inquiry and laboratory-based lessons linked appropriately to math, literacy, and technology resulting in higher achievement. \r\nEngineering faculty devote time as consultants in middle schools.  While they contribute scholarship and content background they also learn by viewing the variety of teaching strategies that serve diverse student needs.   Undergraduate engineering education is improved through close collaboration between engineers and teachers. \r\nPreservice instruction at San Jose State University is improved with the development of a new MA degree in Elementary Education with a focus on science, which should be readily transportable. \r\n",

Active involvement of district administrators is developed by having a working Advisory Council of district administrators from each participating partner.  Working with the Project Management team, they coordinate project and district goals,\n\nensure district level support for materials refurbishment, and maintain high visibility of how the project goals align with overall district plans.   Involvement with school principals is seen to be a key alliance for success.  Principal involvement is developed by including principals at annual workshops and updates on work through site-based lead teachers.\n\n \n\nStudent achievement, particularly with the goal of decreasing the achievement gap, is monitored by discussion with teachers, classroom observation and review of performance on standardized tests.
