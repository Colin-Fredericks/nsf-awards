 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pollution sensing and diagnosis have long been separated from the people most impacted by them. It was conducted by specialists with expensive and scarce equipment. As a result, testing was infrequent and decisions on mitigation were made by central planners with limited access to data. Worse yet, individuals with the ability to dramatically limit dangerous exposure via minor changes in behavior have been left blind to the relationship between their daily actions and exposure to pollution. Advances in computing, sensing, and wireless communication technologies have the potential to allow those most affected by pollution to participate in pollution sensing, rational cost assessment, and mitigation.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on developing a distributed mobile system for socially-collaborative environmental monitoring, which greatly reduces the problem of environmental sensing data scarcity, supports richer environmental sensing data analysis, and enables better environment awareness and protection via social collaboration. This project will develop a system composed of inexpensive sensing and computation devices purchased by individuals for their own edification and protection. These embedded systems will communicate with each other and aggregate data, enabling multi-sensor localization of pollution\r\nsources and quantification of the potential damage by each polluter. By measuring pollution and modeling its impact, it will be possible to associate pollution sources with the costs they impose. Furthermore distributed networking will allow individuals to actively participate in and socially collaborate on environmental monitoring and protection.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe people most impacted by air quality have long been separated from\ninformation to help them understand how their own behavior influences exposure\nto pollution.  In part, this was because air quality sensing systems were\ngenerally large, expensive, and stationary, and required experts to operate\nthem.  Even though many of these systems could accurately measure pollutant\nconcentrations, only a few locations could be monitored, and most people spent\nmost of their time at other locations, locations that were \"in the dark\" from\nthe perspective of air quality sensing science.\n\nA major goal of this project has been to develop technologies to support\ninexpensive, personal, air quality monitoring.  To this end, we have worked on\nsensor calibration and characterization, embedded sensing hardware and\nsoftware, methods for increasing the accuracy of pollution estimates, and field\ntrials.  In the following paragraphs, we summarize our efforts and\ncontributions in these areas.\n\nSensor calibration and characterization: To make personal air quality sensing\naccessible, sensing hardware must be easy-to-carry, inexpensive, and require\nlittle professional maintenance.  This, unfortunately, rules out large and\nexpensive sensors.  For many pollutants, the types of sensors appropriate for\ncompact personal air quality sensing systems are subject to errors as a result\nof the presence of other pollutants (cross-sensitivity) or due to changes in\nenvironmental conditions such as temperature and humidity.  We have studied\nthese dependencies in order to develop techniques to compensate for\ncross-sensitivity and changes in environmental conditions, and our findings\nhave been published.\n\nEmbedded sensing hardware and software: We have also designed, fabricated, and\nopen-sourced the hardware/software embedded system necessary to support\npersonal air quality monitoring.  This hardware is compact and contains\nmultiple air quality sensors (e.g., for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and\nvolatile organic compounds) as well as other sensors (e.g., temperature and\nhumidity) to help correct for susceptibility of the air quality sensors to\nchanges in environmental conditions.  This embedded system communicates with\ncommodity smartphones via Bluetooth, allowing data to be stored, aggregated,\nand analyzed on our servers.  In addition to serving as gateways between our\nsensing hardware and remote servers, smartphones also allow users to see the\nrelationship between their behavior (e.g., motion patterns) and pollution\nexposure, and to see position-dependent pollution data from other sources,\nincluding other mobile sensors.\n\nOne pressing challenge for our studies was developing a method of accurately\nestimating the locations of sensors when indoors, where GPS is generally not\navailable.  We developed and published a number of new ideas on this topic,\nculminating with a method of automatically estimating building floorplans by\nobserving the motion patterns of participants.\n\nMethods for increasing the accuracy of pollution estimates: Inexpensive,\nportable sensors are susceptible to cross-sensitivity to other pollutants, as\nwell as dependencies on environmental parameters such as temperature and\nhumidity.  In addition, many such sensors have readings that gradually drift\nover time.  This project has yielded three main techniques to improve the\naccuracy of pollution estimates.  (1) We developed a drift compensation\ntechnique allowing mobile sensors to opportunistically recalibrate whenever\nthey are near other mobile or stationary sensors.  We developed a method of\nusing knowledge of the rate of drift to optimally weight the conflicting\nreports of different sensors during the recalibration process.  This idea\nimproves the accuracy of personal mobile sensors without requiring annoying\nexplicit recalibration by study participants.  (2) We developed a technique to\nestimate pollution concentrations in based on knowledge of room-to-room air\nflow patterns in indoor environments. ..."
