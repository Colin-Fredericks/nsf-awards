 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental research program is aimed at studies of electron-impact ionization of atomic helium. One experiment will measure electron angular distributions of the two electrons, one the incoming electron and one the electron from the ionization, scattered from the atom over a full 360 degrees. Data will be taken in the region of the helium autoionizing states (excited states of atoms that decay by emission of particles rather than light), both on and off resonance. The results are expected to add new insight into a postulated double scattering mechanism.  A second experiment will investigate helium autoionization in the presence of a laser field. Ejected electron spectra will be measured which will contain sidebands separated from the normal autoionization peaks by energies equal to integral numbers of the photon energy. The profile of the autoionization peaks are also expected to be modified by the presence of the laser. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the program involves student education. Students acquire skills in lasers, electronics, vacuum systems, and computer programming, networking, and interfacing with experiments. They present their work at national and international conferences.\r\n",

The light from a laser cannot directly transfer energy to a free electron (one not bound to an atom), because energy and momentum cannot both be conserved. The situation is different when an electron is in the act of scattering from an atom. While it is close to the atom it can emit or absorb the energy of a photon; the atom helps with energy-momentum conservation. Experiments that investigate this process are called laser-assisted free-free (LAFF). There is a remarkably simple semi-classical theory, known as the Kroll-Watson approximation (KWA), that describes this process. This theory uses a classical description of an electromagnetic wave, and assumes that the atom plays no role except to balance energy and momentum - i.e., the electric field of the electromagnetic radiation is not large enough to affect the atom's electrons that are closely bound to the nucleus. Surprisingly, the KWA has never been systematically tested. This project did just that, by carrying out three experiments that (a) examined the effect of varying the free electron energy, (b) varying the polarization direct of the laser (i.e., the electric field direction of the electromagnetic wave), and (c) varying the target by using helium, argon, and molecular nitrogen. It was found that the KWA was in agreement with all the experiments, thus vindicating this simple theory for the case of low to moderate laser intensities. Why is this of interest? Because it is a fundamental axiom of physics that you use the simplest theory that you can get away with. Thus, for example, if you want to model an astrophysical plasma, one component of the model would describe how radiation interacts with the ionized free electrons in the plasma. A description of the whole plasma is complex, and it is helpful to make each component as simple as possible. The present research shows that the KWA would be applicable in many cases.<br /><br />(2) The (e,2e) experiments, which investigate the ionization of an atom by an electron beam. In general the aim of such collision experiments is to provide data which can be used to test theoretical calculations. When theoretical calculations are able to accurately reproduce a wide variety of collision processes, then the description of complex systems (such as the astrophysical plasma example given above) becomes feasible. The (e,2e) experiments carried out here, investigated the process known as autoionization, where, in helium, both electrons are simultaneously excited to levels whose combined energy lies above the ionization threshold. This leads to a resonant ionization process that can affect the ionization balance in a plasma. The ionization of helium by electron impact, that proceeds via autoionization, is surprisingly hard to calculate theoretically, even though helium is the second simplest atom with only two electrons.&nbsp; It has taken nearly 40 years for electron-impact calculations of helium autoionization to be sophisticated enough to agree with experiment.
