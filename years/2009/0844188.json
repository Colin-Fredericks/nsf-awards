Lagrangian morphisms in the\r\nsymplectic category are viewed as morphisms between manifolds\r\nthat are not necessarily symplectomorphic, but their geometric\r\ncomposition is generically singular.  A previous project\r\npartially resolves this problem, with consequences including the\r\nconstruction of invariants for three-manifolds and knots; the\r\nnext goal is to fit these invariants into a framework of\r\ntopological quantum field theory, and another goal is to extend\r\nthe existing framework to a refined Fukaya category, leading to a\r\ntool for mirror symmetry proofs.  An ongoing project on the\r\nAtiyah-Floer conjecture will continue, and more speculative work\r\nwill consider non-squeezing effects in PDE flows from an\r\ninfinite-dimensional symplectic point of view.\r\n\r\nThe research projects described in this proposal concern\r\nsymplectic geometry, the geometric structure that lies behind the\r\nHamiltonian formulation of mechanics.  Recent applications of\r\nideas from symplectic geometry include invariants that help to\r\ndistinguish one three-dimensional space from another. Broader\r\nimpacts of this project concentrate on promoting women in\r\nmathematics, and feature both a conference at MIT on women in\r\nmathematics that is aimed at junior researchers and Girls' Angle,\r\na math club for girls that is based on close informal interaction\r\nwith female mentors from mathematical areas.  See \r\nhttp://www.girlsangle.org/ for more information.\r\n",
