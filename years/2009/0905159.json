 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nAnderson and LeBrun plan to study a cluster of related geometric structures on low-dimensional manifolds. Their research program focuses on the discovery and development of fundamental connections between Riemannian geometry,  differential topology, and issues in theoretical physics.  Anderson will investigate problems concerning conformally compact Einstein metrics  and the AdS/CFT correspondence, the structure of Einstein metrics on bounded  domains and mathematical aspects of general relativity. Meanwhile, LeBrun will study  the existence  and moduli of canonical metrics on 4-manifolds, with an emphasis on  extremal Kahler metrics, Seiberg-Witten theory, and the twistor geometry of holomorphic disks.\r\nThis research program aims both to  explore fundamental issues in the mathematical field of  differential geometry, and simultaneously to discover new links between mathematics and theoretical physics. Much of the planned research activity takes its inspiration from current attempts to bridge the gulf separating Einstein's theory of gravitation  from the quantum field theories that describe the forces of nature on a microscopic scale. Some of the research concerns  the problem of describing all possible geometries of 4-dimensional  \r\nuniverses governed by Einstein's gravitational field  equations.   \r\nOther aspects of the  research program are intimately linked to recent developments in string theory. By also training a group of graduate students to pursue research in this area,  the project will additionally help foster interactions between mathematics and physics on an immediate, human scale, through its  long-term educational impact.\r\n\r\n",
