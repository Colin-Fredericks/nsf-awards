 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Watt's research deals with the rise of complex biological adaptations from simpler beginnings. His team uses as a study system a group of insects whose field and lab biology are both well known, allowing for greater analytical power to study the whole process of natural selection, from chemical mechanisms to actual differences in fitness among inheritable variants in the wild. Also, the fact that these insects' energy-demanding flight uses physiology common to all cellular life makes the studies of this \"evolutionary model\" system of general relevance to many other physiologically active animals (including humans).\r\n\r\nRecently, Dr. Watt has found evidence of a historical \"innovative step\" in the structure of a particular catalytic protein which is central to animal energy processing. This \"step\" confers sharply increased resistance to heat stress on populations and species which carry it, as compared to other ancestral species. Perhaps as a consequence, in one population of a lowland species, now thermally resistant in this energy processing mechanism, Dr. Watt and his team find a very wide range of new variation experiencing temperature-related natural selection. Further, out of this range of variants, new and more complex combinations are becoming successful. This work will first explore the nature of the processes generating these combinations, and then test the generality of the findings among genes and species.\r\n\r\nThis work will bear on major conceptual issues in evolutionary biology, such as: \r\n- How living complexity arises from simple beginnings, which has been a central focus since Darwin;\r\n- The likelihood that some living mechanisms may exhibit chronic natural variability, rather than there routinely being one superior \"type\" which is predominant in populations;\r\n- Clarification of the connections between large-scale, long-term \"macroevolution\" across populations and species, and local \"microevolution\" adjusting populations to local conditions in the short term.\r\n\t\r\nUnderstanding the complexity of adaptation to naturally changed thermal conditions will be important in understanding the stresses placed on these mechanisms by rapid human-caused change of local and global thermal conditions. There are implications here for conservation and environmental management and for agriculture and medicine as the environmental context for both change rapidly.",

Work on this topic by a doctoral research student and the Principal Investigator has produced the first structural analysis of one of these protein variants at high resolution, and now that the techniques are well established a range of these variants will be studied more quickly. Other analysis techniques have suggested that one more complex difference between variants, which is associated with differences between species in resistance to natural heat stress, acts by altering internal structural bonds in the protein and thus affecting its overall stability. This hypothesis will be among those tested directly by our structural studies.\n\n            2) We had initial data on the evol..."
