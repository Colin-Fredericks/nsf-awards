 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this proposal involve research and education goals that will allow the integration of magneto-optical garnet in non-reciprocal devices to enable source-integrated photonic and optoelectronic integrated circuits (PICs/OEICs). Garnet is the obvious material for such devices, due to its figure-of-merit (rotation/loss) which is several orders of magnitude higher than any other magneto-optcical material, but the integration of garnet with semiconductor platforms has long been thought impossible.   \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Using a recently developed process, garnet devices will be realized here on Si, InP and GaAs for use in the near infrared (1.3 and 1.55um) and infrared (~2um) wavelengths. The research will focus on doped garnet waveguide isolators, garnet photonic crystal (PC) circulators, semiconductor-core isolators (with garnet claddings for evanescent coupling), and quasi-phase matched rotators.  These devices will be the first of their kind to be monolithically integrated, and they therefore promise to transform the field of photonics.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. This project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning from graduate student training through K-12 outreach, including a focus on under-represented groups. In addition, this project truly enables the \"missing link\" in photonics such that the first generation light sources will be integrated with photonic integrated circuits and opto-electronic integrated circuits near the completion of this project.",
