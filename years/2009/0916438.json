 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop techniques for monitoring systems to check if their executions satisfy a property specified by an automaton or a temporal logic specification. Systems to be monitored are modeled as a stochastic system. The project proposes accuracy measures that denote how accurately the desired property is monitored.  The research will implement the accuracy measures as monitors for such systems. The research will also develop active monitors that interact with the underlying system to ensure the correctness properties, as well as techniques for detection of failures from a system?s external behavior  and static verification techniques based on model checking employing symmetry based reduction.  The work will lead to mathematically rigorous and powerful techniques that will improve the reliability of increasingly complex systems.",
