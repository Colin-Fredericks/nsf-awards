 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  \r\n\r\nThis project will initiate efforts to identify DNA catalysts (deoxyribozymes, DNA enzymes) for catalysis of reactions of small-molecule substrates with multiple turnovers.  Nucleic acids are used as natural catalysts in the form of ribozymes (RNA enzymes).  DNA has practical advantages over RNA in terms of cost, stability, and ease of synthesis.  In this project, studies will be performed to establish in vitro selection methodology to identify deoxyribozymes that operate with multiple turnovers on small-molecule substrates.  Deoxyribozymes will be identified for catalysis of Diels-Alder reactions and other reactions of small-molecule substrates, with particular emphasis on chemical selectivity.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Scott K. Silverman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Professor Silverman's research efforts focus on developing the catalytic abilities of DNA.  This research will expand our fundamental understanding of the catalytic properties of nucleic acids.  In addition, successful development of the methodology will have practical impact on synthetic techniques by fostering new approaches to selective chemical synthesis.",
