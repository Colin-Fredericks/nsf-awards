 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award provides support to the 16th International Couette-Taylor Workshop to be held at Princeton University in September 2009. The Couette-Taylor Workshop is an international meeting that began in 1979 with its original focus on Taylor-Couette flow. In the past 30 years the research topics covered at the meeting have expanded to include non-linear dynamics, instability, centrifugal flows, transition, Goertler/Dean vortices, and more recently magneto-hydrodynamic flows relevant to geophysics and astrophysics. At the heart of the workshop is the close interaction and cross-fertilization between international working groups often from different disciplines that occurs at the meetings. The Workshop is held alternately in Europe and the US every two years for most of its history. However, the last three workshops were held either in Europe (Le Havre, France in 2007 and Barcelona, Spain in 2003) or in Japan (Sapporo in 2005). This proposal seeks support in defraying travel and conference expenses for (1) U.S. students and young researchers with priorities for women and minorities and (2) attendances from developing countries. A special issue of a journal dedicated to papers from the Workshop is planned.\r\n\r\n",
