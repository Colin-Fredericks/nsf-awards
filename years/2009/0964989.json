The current US target is to have wind provide 20% of the nation electricity by 2030. Marching towards this ambitious target would necessarily involve larger turbines than what is commonly used today, in order to more efficiently capture the wind energy. However, large turbines also come with significant technical challenges. The structural vibration of the turbine could compromise wind energy capture, generate undesirable acoustic emission, and cause blade fatigue and premature failure. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The goal of this feasibility research is to explore the application of active flow control to reduce structural vibrations during dynamic motion of the blade. As part of the project the PI will characterize and analyze the flow field around the blade, the blade/flow interaction, and use the result to optimize blade design, improve turbine operation, and enhance the overall system safety. The proposed research will develop full 3D characterization of the flow field during a flapping/pitching blade under the activation of active flow control via arrays of synthetic jets to mitigate blade vibrations and to achieve improved performance in a variety of real-world conditions. This research aims to achieve the following objectives: (1) reduce vibrations at all operating conditions, and (2) reduce loads and vibrations on the blades during gusts. These objectives will ameliorate blade fatigue, and increase energy capture while maintaining safe operating limits. At high wind speed and/or wind gusts, flow control strategy will be developed to reduce blade loading and vibrations. Various sensors, mounted on the blades, would allow determination of the environmental operating conditions, blade structural state, and flow condition. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed research will result in longer life-time of the blades, as well as enhanced power capture by enabling the design of larger turbines and improving operation under various dynamic conditions. The proposed project also has a strong educational component. Wind energy offers a timely and intriguing application and opportunity to engage and attract students. The PI will incorporate this research into his classroom to include the interdisciplinary nature of the project, involving fluid/structure interaction and aerodynamics. Prof. Amitay is a member of RPI's newly funded NSF GK-12 outreach program on Energy and Environment. He recently recruited a Hispanic Ph.D. student that has been working 15 hours a week with a high school teacher from Troy, NY in a wind energy related project. Furthermore, one grad student (Victor Maldonano, Hispanic) as well as an undergraduate student (Becca Ostman, female) will be appointed as research assistants for the duration of the program. Finally, Amitay is one of the directors of the Summer at RPI program and has been instructing short summer camps for middle and high school students in the last two summers on the Wonderful World of Flight. He will propose Wind Energy as next year's camp theme.",
