 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nA request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Thomas Thompson, a 274? general purpose Global research vessel and the R/V Clifford Barnes, a 66? general purpose Coastal vessel. Both vessels are operated by the University of Washington as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The request includes two items listed by priority:\r\n\r\n\t1) C-Nav 2050 R\r\n\t2) Scientific Network Upgrade\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. The enhancement of the navigation system aboard R/V Thompson coupled with the upgrade to the computer network will provide the global class vessel with state-of-the-art positional and data transfer capabilities to be utilized by all science groups.",
