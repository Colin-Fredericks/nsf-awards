The variability in spatial and temporal scales of the NO2 measurements and the parameters used to characterize urban form/structure/transportation network will be included in the closure analysis.  The focus largely will be on the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) in Southern California, owing to its large number of monitors and generally sunny climate (low cloud-cover is important for satellite measurements) and to the extensive body of work on air pollution in the SoCAB by project PI Marshall and many other researchers.",
