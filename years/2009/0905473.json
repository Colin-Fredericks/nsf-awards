 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomenal advance in computer technology in terms of processing\r\nspeed and capacity, closely described by Moore's law, in the last four\r\ndecades has been outpaced by the explosive amount of data that are used\r\nto describe more realistic models in scientific computing. For instance,\r\nthe number of unknowns in a linear system has grown from hundreds in \r\nthe past to tens of millions nowadays. Fast algorithms such as the\r\ncelebrated fast multipole method (FMM) have provided a computational\r\ntool for narrowing the gap. At the same time, there is a great need\r\nand challenge to develop better computation techniques and utilize the\r\npresent and emerging computers, with the gain in speed up to a couple \r\nof orders of magnitude. The goal of the proposed research is to \r\nadvance computational theories and techniques, in order to meet the \r\ndemand and challenge for large scale simulations of complex \r\nsystems in scientific, medical and engineering studies.\r\n\r\nThe research team proposed to investigate, innovate and integrate the\r\nkey simulation steps, from analytic re-formulation of system models with\r\ncomplex geometries to combinatorial optimization in mapping numerical\r\nalgorithms to computing architectures.  Many traditional models are\r\nformulated in terms of linear or nonlinear partial differential\r\nequations (PDEs) with boundary conditions on complex geometries. By\r\nthe work of other researchers and principal investigators,\r\nintegral equation (IE) formulations have lead to better numerical\r\nalgorithms in both efficiency and stability, and more importantly\r\nenabled certain important large-scale simulations. It is proposed first\r\nto study the reformulation of traditional PDE models into IE models, as\r\na direct and analytical approach to innovative algorithm design. Next,\r\npreconditioning techniques will be studied as an indirect and\r\nstabilization approach. Furthermore, Graph-theoretic methods will be\r\napplied to optimize the FMM-based algorithms on various modern\r\ncomputer architectures, especially, parallel architectures.  These key\r\ncomponents will be studied in conjunction, not in isolation.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the proposed work are three-fold. \r\nIt sheds lights on (1) the model reformulation into IEs of the second \r\nkind as a fundamental analytic-algorithmic approach to accelerating \r\nand stabilizing numerical computation, (2) the connection between \r\nreformulation and preconditioning, and (3) on the mutual dependence \r\nof numerical algorithms and computer architectures. The proposed \r\nwork will have broader impacts on various applications through\r\ntimely dissemination with demonstration of case studies.  Three\r\napplication areas of specific concern are electrostatics calculation \r\nin molecular dynamics simulations, computational fluid dynamics, and \r\nthe study of oxygen delivery in tissues and tumors via microvascular\r\nnetworks. The proposed work involves interdisciplinary research\r\ncollaboration and cultivation of young and new researchers with\r\nmulti-disciplinary backgrounds.  Finally, the findings and \r\nalgorithms will be embodied in open source high performance \r\nsoftware to facilitate research computing by and large and to \r\nbe used in classrooms.",
