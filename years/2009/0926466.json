 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to the University of Southern California (USC) for the support of a Workshop to Explore a Partnership for Nanotechnology Education, under the direction of Dr. James Murday of USC and Dr. Aldrin Sweeney, University of Central Florida (UCF) who are serving as co-chairs of the organizing committee. The workshop will be held April 26-28, 2009 at the Davidson Conference Center, on the campus of USC. \r\n\r\nThe intent of this proposed workshop is to involve representatives from the various stakeholder communities, including K-12 teachers, community colleges, universities, continuing education, various professional communities, industry, foundations, state/local education authorities, and pertinent Federal agencies.  The workshop participants will be exposed to the present status of nanoscale education.  They will be charged with identifying opportunities/challenges associated with: a) the infrastructure needed to develop effective \"nano\" education; b) a functional stakeholder partnership(s) that addresses needs/opportunities, and c) mechanisms for that partnership(s) to provide information fo the state/local authorities, industrial leaders, and foundations to use in developing goals, strategies and programs toward effective nano education. \r\n\r\nA workshop report will be prepared to transmit the workshop recommendation and it will also be published in a refereed journal to ensure the broadest dispersion.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is being co-funded by the NSF Directorate for Engineering, Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.",
