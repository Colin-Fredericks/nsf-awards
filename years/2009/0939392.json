Therefore, the fracture behavior of solders at high strain rates is a critically important design parameter. A new methodology is proposed for mixed-mode fracture toughness testing of elasto-plastic adhesive joints under dynamic conditions. It is further proposed that this methodology be used to generate fundamental mechanistic insight into the role of several microstructural/process and test variables on the fracture of solder joints, including the effects of solder pad finish, aging, interfacial intermetallic structure, strain rate, mode-mixity and electromigration effects. The work will be of substantial technological importance by developing a new dynamic joint fracture testing methodology which will be eventually transferred to industry. Secondly, the work will be of substantial fundamental importance in generating new mechanistic insights into the role of microstructure on dynamic fracture, and by developing fracture mechanism maps that can be utilized in the design of new joining schemes for emerging chip/package interconnection architectures.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMobile electronics such as PDAs, MP3 players and ultra-portable laptops are often dropped during use, making it important to build the electronic packages which constitute the brains of the system in a robust fashion. The tiny solder joints that constitute an important part of these packages are highly susceptible to fracture under drop conditions, and therefore, the fracture behavior of solders at high strain rates is a critically important design parameter. In the proposed work a new methodology will be developed for fracture testing of solder joints under drop conditions, and used to gain knowledge about how to design highly robust and reliable lead-free solder joints which will be much more resistant to drops than those currently available. This will lead to more reliable electronics with longer usable lifetimes.",

Since solder joints, which serve as mechanical and electrical interconnects in a package, are particularly prone to failure during a drop, the fracture behavior of solders at high strain rates is a critically important design parameter for enhanced life.\n\n         This three-year project, conducted in collaboration with INTEL corporation, was aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of the role of processing history and microstructure on the fracture behavior of solder joints under drop conditions.  Pb-free solder joints, subjected to rapid loading under conditions where an electronic component is inadvertently dropped, typically undergo catastrophic failure via fracture dominated by the interfacial region.  Therefore, the key features of this project were to develop procedures for valid fracture mechanics testing of thin elastic-plastic adhesive joints which fail via interface-dominated fracture under rapid and mixed-mode loading conditions.  This is the first time that fracture mechanics tests have been conducted under a combination of the above conditions. Intel arranged for supplementary funds to support the project through a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) grant.\n\n         This project provided detailed insight on the role of the interface in solder-joint fracture.  Three specific tasks were accomplished: (1) an experimental approach and the associated theoretical underpinning for measuring the fracture toughness of elastic-plastic adhesive joints under high strain rate and mixed-mode loading was developed; (2) a fundamental understanding was developed of the role of solder and interfacial microstructures on the mechanisms of solder joint fracture as a function of reflow and aging conditions, and loading mode-mixity and strain rate; and (3) a methodology for plotting fracture mechanism maps (FMM) for solder joints was developed, and FMMs were constructed for several Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu (SAC387) solder joints attached to Cu and Ni substrate surface-finishes for loading under different mode-mixities.\n\n         The experimental approach to measure the fracture toughness of thin adhesive elastic-plastic joints under high strain rates and mixed-mode loading, as well as the fracture mechanism maps was transferred to Intel Corporation, who intend to use these in their package quality and reliability assessment protocols.  The project team also collaborated with Freescale Semiconductor and Texas Instruments, who supplied joint samples for characterization, the principal features of which were then replicated in the fracture-mechanics test joints.  The results of the project were also shared with Freescale and TI, as well as with the larger community of semiconductor companies served by SRC.  All the results and associated experimental methodologies developed in this work were disseminated through a number of journal and conference publications.  Several presentations were made at various stages this work at Intel Corporation and Freescale Semiconductor to inform packaging engineers about the findings and methodologies developed.\n\n         One graduate student, Ms. Zhe Huang, completed her PhD work based on this project in December 2012.  A postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Praveen Kumar, who is currently an Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Science, also worked on this project.  In addition, a high school senior (Mr. Dongyang Chen) worked as an intern during the summer of 2011 on this project, and was trained on various materials processing and characterization techniques.
