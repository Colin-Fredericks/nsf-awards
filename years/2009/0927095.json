 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this BRIGE award is to apply new and existing operations research and economic decision analysis techniques to understand tradeoffs, both in the healthcare safety net for children and in dental disease intervention policies. A mixed-integer programming model will be built for a network of clinics, incorporating issues such as equity and fairness that do not typically arise in operations research models, to quantitatively compare the impact of increasing access to health services through government-subsidized clinics against expanding government-subsidized insurance. The resulting co-dependencies will be studied.  Markov models will be created and analyzed to determine optimal interventions in disease progression. A comprehensive dental disease progression model will be built and incorporated into a cost-benefit analysis to compare interventions for various populations, quantitatively describing critical tradeoffs in disease prevention and treatment. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to optimization tools that have tremendous potential to inform and shape government programs ? saving cost and/or redirecting scarce resources to more effective programs. The research will lead to a greater understanding of the health care safety net for children and highlight opportunities for increased efficiencies. The disease progression model will quantify, from a systems standpoint, the benefits of health promotion and disease prevention as opposed to care and disease management. Research results will be incorporated into course materials and outreach initiatives to demonstrate the human impact potential of engineering and help attract additional underrepresented students to engineering.  The work will provide opportunities to reduce disparities in healthcare currently experienced by minorities as well as opportunities to use the research ? combined with the targeted outreach ? to boost interest in engineering in the same underrepresented groups. \r\n",
