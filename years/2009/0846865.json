 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to explore new paradigms for multifunctional agility in reconfigurable antennas and multifunctional smart skins through a biologically inspired concept. The approach is to examine the blending of structural shape-shifting and electromagnetic reconfiguration found in the Cephalopoda class of marine animals to develop structurally embedded micro-fluidic networks transporting functionalized dispersions of nanoparticles in antennas and frequency selective surfaces.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to contribute innovative and potentially transformational concepts in electromagnetic agility and a paradigm shift in reconfigurable antennas through the structural integration of pressure-driven mechanisms and a decreased reliance of wired devices from the radiating aperture of system. These adaptive capabilities and their linkage between structural and electromagnetic properties can lead to many attractive communication and multifunctional capabilities for industrial processes, scientific exploration, and many other systems operating in electromagnetically harsh environments.\r\n\r\nThe successful development and practical implementation of these electromagnetically agile enabling mechanisms will significantly impact future systems that require a high degree of multifunctionality. This will likely have a significant impact on society through advanced technologies and by stimulating new avenues of supporting research. Investigating the synergy between biological mechanisms and engineered systems will attract undergraduate students into research and help retain their interest in both science and engineering. This project creates exciting educational topics that will be used by the PI in conjunction with the educational resources and many opportunities for outreach at Texas A&M University to engage individuals from all walks of life, underrepresented groups, and technical fields of interest.",
