In addition to elastic energy of the bend,\r\narbitrary nonlocal interactions between the charges are\r\nconsidered.  The studies are kept completely general and can\r\ninclude electrostatic interactions, the Lennard-Jones\r\ninteractions preventing self-intersection of the string, or any\r\nother nonlocal interactions.  The investigator and his colleagues\r\nderive an exact geometric theory of the motion of the nonlocally\r\ninteracting elastic strings and apply it to a variety of\r\nproblems.  This theory is based on the Simo-Marsden-Krishnaprasad\r\ntheory of exact elastic rods.  After the theory is derived, an\r\nexplicit method for computing exact helical solutions of the\r\nequations is found.  The investigator also shows that for\r\ngeometric reasons, an explicit dispersion relation for the\r\npropagation and stability of linear waves on helical solutions\r\ncan be derived.  This technique also provides a method for\r\ncomputing linear combinations of elastic constants if the shape\r\nof helical molecules and the interactions between the charges are\r\nknown.  The investigator also derives a discrete analogue of the\r\nequations allowing a wide class of exact solutions, called\r\nn-helices.  These are discrete helices with the pattern repeating\r\nafter n shifts.  The bifurcation structure of these discrete\r\nn-helices is examined.  Finally, it is shown how to use helices\r\nas basic building blocks for construction of more complex\r\nmolecular conformations.\r\n\r\n     Long chains of organic molecules, like proteins, form the\r\nbasis of all life on Earth.  The shape of these molecules plays a\r\ncrucial role for their function in a living body, and thus\r\nunderstanding of the inner structure of these molecules is an\r\nimportant task.  It has been found that the inner structure of\r\nmany proteins consists of tightly wound helices, and those\r\nhelices are packed together in a complex fashion.  The helices\r\nare held together by a complex interplay of electrostatic and\r\nelastic (and other) forces.  How can one describe the formation\r\nof these complex shapes?  Why are helices so ubiquitous in\r\nNature?  The investigator and his colleagues approach these\r\nquestions by deriving a theory of molecular chain evolution that\r\ncan include many possible interactions between individual atoms. \r\nThe investigator shows that, because of geometric reasons,\r\nhelices are stationary states for simple molecules, no matter how\r\ncomplex the interaction between the atoms may be.  This theory\r\nforms a basis for understanding of the inner structure of\r\nbiological molecules and their dynamics.  Better understanding of\r\nthe spatial structure of molecules and their formation helps in\r\ndesigning better polymers for the chemical industry, better drugs\r\nfor medical applications, and materials with novel and improved\r\nproperties for high-tech engineering of the future.\r\n",
