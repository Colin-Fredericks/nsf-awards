 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, measurements of elemental mercury (Hg(0)), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM), and particulate mercury (HgP) will be made at Appledore Island, 10 km off the southern New Hampshire coastline, and sampling artifacts for RGM and HgP will be investigated.  Three objectives will be addressed at this island sampling site: 1) determination of the phase partitioning of mercury (Hg(0), RGM, HgP, and TGM [total gaseous mercury; Hg(0) + RGM]) with high time resolution, quantification of its spatial and temporal variation in the marine environment, and comparison with nearby coastal and inland sites, 2) assessment of the relative importance of sources and sinks of atmospheric mercury in the marine boundary layer (MBL) and construction of a first-order budget, and 3) documentation and an improved understanding of the impact of Hg(0)-rich polluted continental outflow on maritime cycling of atmospheric mercury.  This work will provide detailed information on mercury source and sink strengths in the MBL, which is critical for determining the lifetimes of Hg(0), RGM, and HgP, and ultimately regional and global budgets.\r\n\r\nTwo graduate students will be involved in the measurement and data analysis components of this research.  Two undergraduates will help with the field site setup and ongoing maintenance activities at Appledore Island and participate in data analysis.  An outreach program at the University of New Hampshire will be utilized to better inform the public about mercury (a ubiquitous toxic contaminant in the global atmosphere) in the Northeast through public displays and a quarterly publication.  The results from this project will also be integrated into an NSF-sponsored teacher training program.",
