 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, \"NUE: Enhancing Undergraduate Student Learning and Research Experience through Hands-on Experiments on Novel Nanohybrid Devices and Systems\", at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,under the direction of Dr. Junhong Chen, aims to introduce the recent advancement of nanotechnology in hybrid nanomaterials and devices/systems to undergraduate students through nine well-designed laboratory modules which will be used to develop a new senior-level laboratory course as well as to enrich five existing courses of various levels at the UWM. The availability of the course modules and the new course on hybrid nanomaterials and devices/systems constitutes a timely update of the existing nanotechnology teaching materials database to reflect the forefront of nanotechnology advancement. The nanotechnology-related courses will be used to develop a nanotechnology certificate program at UWM in the near future and many of these courses will also be counted toward the existing integrated BS-MS program which can be used as a mechanism to attract students to pursue graduate degrees in engineering and science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have developed a hands-on experimental nanotechnology course centered on novel hybrid nanomaterials and nanodevices for undergraduate nanotechnology education at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM).  This new course introduces the recent advancement of nanotechnology in hybrid nanomaterials and devices/systems to senior-level undergraduate students through integrating nine carefully designed laboratory modules.  These laboratory modules have also been incorporated into existing nanotechnology-related courses of various levels at UWM, which significantly enriches the UWM nanotechnology education. \n\n \n\nTwo major innovative aspects of the new course are worth noting: its unique content (i.e., attractive hybrid nanomaterials and devices/systems) and a new pedagogical approach featuring active and inductive learning.  The hybrid nanomaterials addressed include nanoparticle-carbon nanotube (CNT) structures, nanoparticle-nanowire structures, organic-inorganic hybrids, and inorganic-inorganic hybrids, which represent a new class of materials that could potentially display not only the properties of constituent components but also additional properties due to the interaction between the two.  These hybrid nanomaterials are attractive for device applications ranging from renewable energy, environmental monitoring, to biosensing.  In each lab module, students actively participate in hands-on experience on selected topics.  In addition, students are asked to survey the current literature on the particular topic and propose potential research directions for the topic.  This type of learner-centered pedagogy likely inspires the creativity of students.  Rigorous evaluation strategies have been used to track the success of the project.  In particular, we have evaluated the effectiveness of each module in order to enhance students\u00c6 learning in class.  Overall, students were highly satisfied with all aspects of the instruction in the modules.\n\n \n\nThe availability of the course modules and the new course on hybrid nanomaterials and devices/systems constitutes a timely update of the existing nanotechnology teaching materials database to reflect the forefront of nanotechnology advancement.  The integration of the newly-emerging nanotechnology advancement into the undergraduate curriculum will not only expose students to these nanotechnology forefronts but also provide students with a platform for integrated learning and research opportunities to inspire innovations.  The new laboratory nanotechnology course, along with existing lecture-type nanotechnology courses, contributes to offering a comprehensive nanotechnology education program at UWM.  The impact of the project is further augmented to go beyond UWM students by aggressive dissemination measures.  Results from the project have been disseminated through various routes.  All lab modules and new course materials are made available to the rest of the world.  Educational findings have been published in J. Nano Education.  The project also features rich outreach activities that introduce the new nanotechnology forefront to high-school teachers and students through teaching materials development and science projects. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/20/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Junhong Chen"
