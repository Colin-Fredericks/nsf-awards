 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).   The award supports the University of Minnesota REU / RET physics site which introduces undergraduates to forefront research in physics by having them work with research groups for 10 weeks in the summer. Each student works in the research group of a faculty member of the School of Physics and Astronomy, making the transition from classroom instruction to state of the art research, from mastering old knowledge to participating in the creation of new knowledge.  In addition to participating in frontier research, the students attend weekly research seminars given by faculty members, tour the Soudan Underground Physics Laboratory to see an example of big science performed outside of a single university laboratory, take Ethics training based on case studies, are given safety training, take a machine shop course, attend a course of preparation for the Physics Graduate Record Examination, and participate in social activities in the Twin Cities with their peers from summer research programs in other disciplines. The research advisors are faculty at the University of Minnesota School of Physics and Astronomy, and are acknowledged international leaders in their fields. At the conclusion of the summer program, students describe their results through oral presentations to their peers, in poster presentations, and through a written report. In addition, high school teachers participate in research programs for six weeks as part of the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program. The teachers are integrated in many of the activities with the REU students.",
