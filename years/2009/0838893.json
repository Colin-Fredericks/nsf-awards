 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research proposal will demonstrate an innovative Ribbon-Beam Amplifier (RBA) which significantly advances the state-of-the-art in solid-state and vacuum electronic Radio Frequency (RF) amplification. The goal is to determine the feasibility of a ribbon-beam amplifier that is highly efficient (56%), broadband (1930-1990 MHz), and high power (100 W in continuous-wave operation). As a next-generation RF amplifier, the RBA is expected to be applicable to third-generation (3G) wireless communications and future wireless communication platforms such as emerging fourth generation (4G) and ultra-wide-band (UWB) wireless communications. If successful, this project will lead to commercially deployable RBA products overcoming the limitations of existing solid-state multi-carrier power amplifiers (MPCAs) which have low efficiency, complex and expensive linearization circuits, and narrow instantaneous bandwidth (30 MHz).\r\n\r\nThe proposed technology will significantly lower both the capital cost and operating cost of commercial wireless base station amplifiers. Using increases in efficiency of a factor of 2 to 3 over current solid state products provides for cost reduction in primary power usage by the amplifiers themselves; operating cost and capital cost reduction from lower power output requirements of backup power sources such as batteries and auxiliary power generators needed for power outage conditions; smaller power supplies; and smaller less expensive cooling systems. \r\n",
