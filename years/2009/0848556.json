The goal of these experiments is to develop a better understanding of the multiple exciton (electron-hole pair) dissociation as well as the multiple exciton generation processes that are proposed to occur in certain nanoscale semiconductor structures.\r\n\r\nThis research is relevant to many potential applications for nanoparticles, including solar energy conversion, photocatalysis, nanoscale sensors, and molecular electronics. In addition to the broader scientific impact of the proposed research, Prof. Lian will work with undergraduates from the southeast region to become involved in science. His efforts will include providing summer research positions, seminar visits, collaborative research projects, and regional conferences.\r\n",
