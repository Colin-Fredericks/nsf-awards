 "awd_abstract_narration": "A part of the project is devoted to the study of various classes of parabolic partial differential equations with symmetries.   The basic question to be addressed is how positive solutions reflect   the symmetry of the  equation.  For  elliptic equations,  there  are  classical  theorems on  symmetry  of  positive solutions  and some  motivations  for symmetry  problems in  parabolic equations  stem from  these  theorems (when  viewing  solutions of  an elliptic  equation as  steady  states of  the corresponding  parabolic equation).  Other very interesting and challenging symmetry problems are specific to parabolic equations. Such are, for example, problems concerning the asymptotic symmetry of positive solutions as time approaches infinity. The principal investigator will continue his research in this area with the goal of obtaining a better understanding of the manner in which positive solutions approach the space of symmetric functions.  Results in this vein would be instrumental in using the asymptotic symmetry of solutions to study their temporal behavior.  The principal investigator will also continue his research concerning parabolic Liouville theorems.  Such  theorems state  that certain  very  specific parabolic  equations  do  not have  nontrivial solutions  in a class  of admissible  functions.  Liouville theorems, when available, are very powerful tools for the qualitative analysis of parabolic equations.  In combination with scaling arguments, they can be used, among other things, for the derivation of a priori estimates and for establishing blow-up and decay rates of solutions. The goal  of this project   is  to prove  new  Liouville   theorems  and   pursue further applications  of Liouville  theorems in  various classes  of nonlinear parabolic  problems. Liouville theorems, as well as results on symmetry of solutions, will play important roles in another part of the project, which concerns threshold solutions. Such  solutions appear as separatrices  between  solutions  exhibiting  two different  kinds  of behavior, such  as the decay  to zero and  blow up in finite  time, or decay to zero and locally uniform convergence to a positive steady state. Solutions of this type are  studied, for example,  in   connection  with  quenching  and  propagation phenomena in  models from  combustion theory and  population genetics. Up to now, existing theorems mostly treated one-dimensional equations or problems with a variational structure, thus excluding important equations  that  involve   advection   terms   or explicit   time dependence. The project will focus on these nonvariational problems.    \r\n\r\nIn less technical terms, the project can be characterized as qualitative or geometric analysis of solutions of a certain type of nonlinear evolution equations. Such equations are widely used in models in applied sciences, in particular, chemical engineering, combustion theory, and ecology. Understanding qualitative properties of solutions is important for the internal development of the mathematical theory of partial differential equations as well as for improvement of their modeling relevance.  The present project addresses questions that concern geometric properties of solutions (such as their symmetries when viewed as functions of spatial variables), as well as their behavior with respect to time (periodicity properties, stabilization to equilibria, blow up in finite time). Development of new mathematical techniques for addressing such questions is an integral part of the project.",
