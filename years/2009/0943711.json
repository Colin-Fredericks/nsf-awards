 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photovoltaics in Nanoscale Ferroelectric Films\r\nProposal no: ECCS 0943711.\r\n\r\nAbstract \r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe objective of this exploratory effort is to investigate photovoltaic effects in nanoscale ferroelectric films. The approach is to demonstrate higher photovoltaic conversion efficiency in solar cells made from nanoscale ferroelectric films. Compared to the conventional Si solar cells where the limited charge transport at the junction constrains the PV conversion efficiency of the cell; the effect is essentially a bulk-effect in ferroelectrics. This property makes nanoscale ferroelectric films an excellent choice for such applications which remain unexploited to date.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nEnhanced photovoltaic effects in nanoscale ferroelectric films will be demonstrated with the potential for higher photovoltaic conversion efficiencies in solar cells made from these materials.  This work could pave the way for future research directions in photovoltaics based on nanoscale ferroelectrics.  This activity will lead to research data in photovoltaics and other optical applications for nanoferroelectric films that can be used in future devices, combining the ferroelectric, electronic and optical functionalities of such materials.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis effort will contribute to new knowledge in processing, characterization and understanding of the transport properties responsible for photovoltaic effects in nanoscale ferroelectric films. The knowledge gained will have broader applications for the research community in applying processes to similar ferroelectric systems. The education plan is to incorporate results from the proposed research in a graduate/undergraduate level course on ferroelectrics. The project will impact students by preparing them for the workforce as well as for graduate study/advanced research on nanoferroelectric based photovoltaics. Results will be disseminated to the research community through conferences and journal papers. A strong outreach activity involving students, including minority student, from elementary age to graduate level will be conducted.",
