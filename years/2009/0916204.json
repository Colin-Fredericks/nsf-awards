 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\r\n(Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nEven in the US, many regions suffer poor Internet connectivity, due to\r\nhigh prices, capacity limitations, poor infrastructure, or low\r\npopulation density. Rural communities may be underserved because of\r\nDSL distance limits and the high cost of bringing fiber optic cable to\r\nlow-density regions. Even when businesses or schools can be connected\r\nby DSL, its capacity limits may still provide poor end-user experience\r\nwhen many people share the connection.  This research is addressing these\r\nproblems by using intelligent software to enhance network\r\nconnectivity.  By aggressive data caching and off-peak prefetching,\r\ndata can be stored on disk and retrieved locally instead of always\r\nbeing fetched from the Internet. For environments with many users,\r\nthis system can reduce bandwidth consumption by an order of magnitude,\r\nproviding higher effective end-user bandwidth, or allow cost\r\nreductions by purchasing less wide-area bandwidth.  The expected\r\noutcome of this research is an open-source system that can be deployed\r\nat Internet gateways, which will transparently improve network\r\nperformance. Possible locations include schools, small businesses, and\r\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs). In schools, when a classroom full\r\nof students accesses a topic, only one copy is downloaded, and\r\nthe rest get it from the cache. For news sites that update during the\r\nday, only the changed portions get downloaded, instead of whole\r\narticles. Prefetching will also reduce latency, by determining user\r\npatterns and preloading content before it is needed.  \r\n",
