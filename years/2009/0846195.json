 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing reliable software systems is a key challenge for our\r\nsociety.  Despite many years of effort, software systems still suffer\r\nfrom catastrophic failures.  All too often, software failures are\r\ncaused by the propagation of errors through critical components of the\r\nsystem.  Unfortunately, current software development tools and\r\npractices actually encourage the introduction of unnecessary\r\ndependencies that serve to propagate errors between conceptually\r\nunrelated components.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to explore a new approach for creating\r\nsoftware systems that are robust against failures.  The approach\r\nexposes the high-level structure of a software system to the compiler\r\nand run-time environment to enable the automatic application of techniques that\r\nappropriately manage error propagation to make software systems more\r\nresilient.  The foundation of this approach is a specification\r\nlanguage that allows the developer to identify tasks and describe when\r\ntasks should be invoked and how each task changes the conceptual\r\nstates of objects.  A set of techniques use this information to\r\nmonitor and analyze task execution to eliminate unnecessary\r\ndependencies.  The broader impact of this research is the potential to\r\nmitigate the effects of software faults.",
