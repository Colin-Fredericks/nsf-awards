 "awd_abstract_narration": "MIRTHE Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Industry\r\nMIRTHE, the NSF-sponsored Engineering Research Center for Mid-InfraRed Technologies for Health and\r\nthe Environment, conducts a vibrant education and outreach program that starts at K-12 and culminates\r\nat the post-doctoral level. Here, we propose a new addition to MIRTHE's post-doctoral research and\r\ntraining program, i.e. the MIRTHE Post-doctoral Fellowship in Industry program.\r\nA small group of recent MIRTHE graduates will be competitively selected to conduct year-long, postdoctoral\r\nresearch on-site with MIRTHE industry member companies. The research projects are closely\r\nlinked to the fellows,former MIRTHE research and strengthen the university industry partnerships arising\r\nfrom the joint work and the group of academic and industrial mentors tied together by the post-doc\r\nfellows. In addition to full time work in industry, the post-doctoral fellows will be assigned mentors at\r\nPrinceton University; they will report twice yearly on their research to the entire MIRTHE community. The\r\nfellowships are competitive, with a strict selection process, and are tightly woven into MIRTHE's overall\r\nformal post-doctoral mentoring program.\r\nThe post-doctoral fellows are appointed through Princeton University at the base salary rate; the hosting\r\ncompanies will raise the fellows, salary to the companies? rate and will fund the fellows research\r\nexpenses; we estimate this to amount to at least 25% cost-sharing by industry.\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nMIRTHE is leading the development of an entirely new platform of trace gas sensor systems that provide\r\nhigh-performance, cost-effective, and networked sensing capabilities. These sensor systems are based\r\non mid-infrared Quantum Cascade laser spectroscopy and excel through their compactness, autonomy,\r\nnetworking capability, and fast time response. They fulfill the application requirements of trace chemical\r\nsensing on the individual point sensor, urban sensor network, remote sensor, and regional scale. In doing\r\nso, MIRTHE addresses the important societal challenges of securing a clean, safe, sustainable, and\r\nhealthy environment, clean air to breathe and accessible healthcare on the national and global scale.\r\nThe here proposed MIRTHE Post-doctoral Fellowship in Industry program sends five or more highly\r\nqualified, competitively selected post-doctoral fellows to work on-site with MIRTHE industry members on\r\nMIRTHE-related research projects. Their high degree of engineering excellence will strengthen\r\nuniversity,industry collaborations and will advance MIRTHE's mission and bold vision stated above.\r\nBroader impacts\r\nMIRTHE successfully trains and graduates a diverse and globally competitive U.S. workforce ready to\r\nassume engineering leadership for the 21st century. Since 2006, MIRTHE's post-doctoral training program\r\nhas grown to encompass 9 current post-doctoral fellows with career aspirations in academia,\r\ngovernment, and industry. Three fellows have already ?graduated? to long-term employment in\r\nacademia. MIRTHE has a proven track record to reach out to groups historically underrepresented in\r\nscience and engineering, and its researcher and student diversity consistently exceeds comparable\r\nnational averages. The here proposed MIRTHE Post-doctoral Fellows in Industry program provides an\r\noutstanding opportunity to increase the size and improve the diversity of MIRTHE's post-doctoral\r\nresearcher pool.\r\nThe program will provide MIRTHE's graduates with additional training, skills, knowledge, and insights,\r\nand will make them more competitive in the job-market, hence allaying the gravest of our post-doctoral\r\nresearchers, concerns about their career opportunities in the current weak economy.\r\nThe program will attract specifically post-doctoral researchers interested in a career in industry and in\r\nstarting up their own company. The post-doctoral fellows will also form key connections between\r\nacademia and industry in MIRTHE's industrial/practitioner collaboration program, which develops\r\nprototypes of cost-effective, market-ready, mid-infrared sensing technologies; these technologies result in\r\nnew profitable product lines and new revenue streams for important industry sectors.",
