NSF funds are targeted to increase the participation of graduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the STEM (Science, Technology,\r\nEngineering, and Mathematics) disciplines, as well as of junior faculty at the beginning stages of their careers.\r\n\r\nMicroplasmas at atmospheric and higher pressures have properties that enable diverse applications, including remediation of gaseous pollutants, medical sterilization and biological decontamination, novel plasma processing, high-power lasers, and excimer lamps and other non-coherent vacuum-ultraviolet light sources. This workshop is the only forum devoted exclusively to the advancement of the scientific challenges and technological opportunities afforded by microplasmas. It covers experimental, theoretical, and modeling of the basic plasma physics as well as technological applications.  Special emphasis is given to biological and medical applications, and one session is dedicated to industrial and commercial applications. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of this activity arises from the participation of microplasma experts from across the United States and from various countries, dissemination of their technical findings, their communications with students, and their visions of future research directions.  Broader impacts include the consequent educational impact as well as the advancement of technologies for the betterment of society.\r\n\r\n",
