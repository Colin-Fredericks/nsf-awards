 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands the workforce preparation for the renewable energy and environmental technology industries through a partnership of Red Rocks Community College (RRCC) with the Colorado Governor's Energy Office, the University of Colorado, the Colorado School of Mines, Colorado State University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, and the Jefferson County School District. The project advances environmental sustainability and energy technology education through curriculum development, materials preparation, professional development, and hands-on energy science experiences in the RRCC Energy Laboratory. The critical education juncture of high school through community college (grades 9-14) is the focus of the student education and teacher professional development. Workforce development focuses on adults in career transition as well as underserved traditional students. The project connects renewable energy and environmental technology education with partner research universities to increase Colorado's competitiveness in propelling renewable energy technology transfer from research and development to commercial application. The project offers teachers an opportunity to increase their understanding of and improve skills in energy science and environmental technology as well as prepare students for the future using new materials and instructional methods. The partnerships with the Governor's office and the national laboratory allows the project to reach across the state in supporting high school students, community college traditional and non-traditional students, and teachers underrepresented in science and technology careers.",

Red Rocks is located in Jefferson County just west of Denver, Colorado.  The college was established in 1969 and serves Lakewood, Golden, Wheat Ridge, Arvada, and nearby mountain communities. RRCC offers Associate of Science (AS), Associate of Arts (AA), and Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees and certificates in more than more than 60 academic areas and high demand fields.  Red Rocks Community College has strong relationship with Colorado School of Mines sending over 75 students per year as juniors into their engineering programs.  The National Renewable Laboratory (NREL) is also located in Jefferson County and Red Rocks students have interned at the laboratory.  These partnerships made Red Rocks well positioned for the NSF grant award.\n\nProject Overview: Reducing America\u00c6s dependence on imported fossil\nfuels has created a call to action across all business sectors and energy\nsectors.  Through the Green Collar project, RRCC has better prepared the future workforce by examining the core learning competencies across disciplines to ensure that today\u00c6s students are equipped with the skills and knowledge required to achieve a sustainable energy future. The college has developed new renewable energy and environmental programs and trained incumbent environmental technicians in complying with Environmental Protection Agency standards in air, water and solid waste management.\n\nProject Goals:\n\nGoal 1 Increase the availability of individuals prepared for careers in\nrenewable energy and environmental technology.\n\nRRCC worked with NREL, CEO and local industry partners to adopt statewide residential energy efficiency guidelines.  The resulting Building Performance Industry (BPI) guidelines drove curriculum development for our energy program.  RRCC developed 5 unique AAS degrees and 10 certificates in Renewable Energy and Technology. The degrees can be viewed at  www.rrcc.edu/renewable\n\nAn energy laboratory (ERG) was developed to provide laboratory exercises in renewable energy and environmental technologies including a solar array for project-based learning.  A general education integrated science course, Science In Society (SCI 159) was developed engaging  non-science majors in designing and developing projects in solar thermal, fuel cells, hydro power, geo thermal and wind.\n\nGoal 2  Increase enrollments of\nunderserved students in the renewable energy and environmental technology degree programs.\n\nRRCC faculty developed a lab-based course PHY 107, Energy Science and Technology.  This course provides an in-depth look at the science of energy and energy technologies, with a focus on renewable energy resources and clean technologies.  It can meet the lab-based science requirement for AA degrees and for dual enrollment as a science course in high schools.\n\nGoal 3   Develop core Transfer science courses and transfer degree pathways.\n\nRRCC faculty worked together with 2 and 4 year faculty to get PHY 107 approved as guaranteed transfer science coursefrom any 2 year college to any public 4 year college in Colorado.\n\nA major objective of the grant was the development of Green Apps.  Green Apps are designed to reinforce sustainability principles through hands on learning activities. College faculty and high school teachers were convened to develop sustainability curricula and teaching strategies for their classrooms across all instructional areas.\n\nIntellectual Merit   \n\nThe Renewable Energy degrees\nprepare students with the knowledge that is required in industries specific to\nenergy and environmental sustainability. The SCI 159 and PHY 107 courses engage non-science majors in experiential learning that includes gathering of scientific information and applying critical thinking and the scientific method to recognize how science plays both positive and negative roles..."
