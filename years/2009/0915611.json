Modular reasoning \r\nmeans verifying software components assuming the specification of each \r\nused component. Modularity is important for productivity and scalability, \r\nbut is difficult to achieve for OO software. To support modular reasoning, \r\nresearchers have proposed several methodologies that restrict programs and \r\ntheir specifications. The goal of this project is to provide a theoretical \r\nbasis that supports practical techniques for justifying and using \r\nmethodologies.\r\n\r\nThis project provides guidance for the designers of programming and \r\nspecification languages, verification logics, and associated tools. The \r\nresults will improve the utility and extensibility of verification tools \r\n--- a key goal of the Verified Software grand challenge.  Software \r\ndevelopers may benefit from the integration and harmonious interoperation \r\nof best-practice methodologies. This project is potentially \r\ntransformative: it aims to enable combinations and customizations of \r\nmethodologies by tool users, scalable to real applications.\r\n\r\nImproved OO programming methodologies may greatly improve programming \r\npractice, especially in applications needing high assurance, reliability, \r\nand security.  This will benefit society, which increasingly depends on \r\ncomputing systems built using OO components. Unification of methodologies \r\nand streamlining of tools also facilitates the education of software \r\ndevelopers.",
