 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the role of atmospheric transport barriers (ATBs) in the biological invasion of Fusarium--one of the most important groups of fungi in the world and a devastating disease agent of many crops. Fusarium species use the atmosphere to travel from one habitat to another. Their atmospheric transport is poorly understood, yet necessary to assess their ecological roles in agricultural ecosystems and to evaluate risks posed by invasive Fusarium. The goal of this work is to develop an increased understanding of the atmospheric transport of microorganisms. The specific objectives are to: (1) develop a framework for understanding the role of ATBs in shaping the populations of Fusarium at both local and regional scales, (2) evaluate the population structure of Fusarium collected in the lower atmosphere associated with predicted ATBs, and (3) deliver an innovative outreach program to attract and retain students at the interface of aerobiology and engineering. \r\n\r\nThis transdisciplinary project will create a new framework for understanding how atmospheric transport influences the ecological biology of airborne microorganisms. Research and resulting new technology will be showcased through Field Days at Virginia Tech's Kentland Farm, aerobiology workshops for high school students, and an ambitious program at a Virginia high school allowing students to explore microorganisms in the atmosphere through cutting-edge microscopy.",
