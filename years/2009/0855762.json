The research program at Muhlenberg College has two distinct science themes.  \r\n\r\nThe first theme concerns the behavior of matter at very high density, corresponding to conditions a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, when a hot, dense brew of quarks and gluons existed.  One goal of the RHIC program is to recreate these conditions via colliding nuclei at very high energies.  The Muhlenberg group will help to characterize some of the properties of the plasma by measuring a quantity called transverse energy.  It has been proposed that event-by-event fluctuations in the transverse energy could be a signal for a critical point in the phase diagram of nuclear matter.\r\n\r\nThe second theme concerns the quest to understand the spin of the proton in terms of its underlying constituents of quarks and gluons.  The Muhlenberg group will play an important role in an upgrade of the PHENIX detector that will more directly address this issue by detecting so-called W bosons emitted during proton-proton collisions.\r\n \r\nThis collaborative activity at a national laboratory exposes students to research experiences they could not otherwise obtain at a small college.  It provides students with new skills and a better understanding of the scientific enterprise, and it can help with informed career choices, whether in physics or in other areas.\r\n",
