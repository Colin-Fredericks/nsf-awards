 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) has assembled an international collaboration to test whether coronal mass ejection (CME) build-up can be ascribed to a four-stage process of magnetic field evolution that ultimately leads to the triggering of a CME. This four stage process consists of (1) canceling of magnetic fields along a polarity reversal boundary; (2) formation of a filament channel concurrent with the ascent of horizontal magnetic field into the chromosphere from cancellation sites; (3) thread-by-thread formation of a filament magnetic field and visible filament when the filament channel attains maximum development; and finally, (4) thread-by-thread building of the filament cavity magnetic field as mass drains from the visible threads, thereby incrementally releasing filament magnetic field into the cavity magnetic field until one of many possible triggering mechanisms initiates the CME. \r\n\r\nThe PI's team will examine these distinct stages and the mechanisms linking them, taking advantage of the synergy offered by new observations, data analysis, numerical modeling, analytic theory, and laboratory plasma experiments. The PI's team expects this project to provide a greatly improved understanding of how CMEs originate and evolve. This improved knowledge of the CME environment is needed to develop predictive tools so that critical space weather events can be accurately forecast.",

Instead of observing the Sun, the Bellan Plasma Group at Caltech has produced small-scale replicas of these phenomena in a controlled laboratory experiment.

The basic building block of magnetohydrodynamics is a set of magnetic field lines twisting around a common axis like a barber pole.  This is called a magnetic flux tube and flux tubes are typically arched with ends attached to a surface such as the solar surface.\n\nThe Bellan lab (see Fig. 1) creates arched plasma-filled, magnetic flux tubes similar to those on the Sun but much smaller and much shorter lived.  The lab flux tubes are created in a controlled, reproducible fashion so behavior can be examined in detail.  Time and space scales are both about one billion times smaller than on the Sun, but the same equations apply and the geometry is similar.

Since different gases emit light at different wavelengths, i.e., with different colors,  using different gases effectively color-codes different parts of the plasma so it becomes possible to distinguish one flow from another. High-speed movies (several million frames per second) show green plasma flowing from one footpoint and red plasma flowing from the other. Together these flows fill up the arched flux tube and do so in such a way that as the hoop force increases the flux tube volume by increasing the flux tube length, the density of plasma in the f..."
