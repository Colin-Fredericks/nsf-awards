 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nPortals of Discovery, a partnership between the University of Wisconsin-Manitowoc and the University of Wisconsin-Stout, engages and retains students in STEM fields through collaborative research. Students move through a pipeline of STEM education from high school to a two year, associate degree-granting institution and then to degree completion at the baccalaureate institution. The goals of the project are to recruit new populations of STEM students, retain STEM students during the crucial early stages of their education, and see those students through to the completion of their baccalaureate degrees. The project includes 1) summer research workshops and research-based curriculum development at the high school level, 2) financial support, peer tutoring, faculty and peer mentoring circles, curriculum development, and participation in undergraduate research at the two year campus, and 3) a 10-week research immersion program for transferring students, continued faculty mentoring, participation in undergraduate research, and student opportunities to serve as peer mentors at the 4-year campus.\r\n\r\nThe complete integration of research, coursework, and mentorship across institutions ensures that STEM students have a persistent support network throughout their undergraduate career. Research activities develop critical thinking, technical skills, and confidence. Outreach and mentor support networks reach students of diverse demographic backgrounds who otherwise would be unlikely to pursue or persist in STEM education. The model is being developed for expansion across all twenty six UW-System two and four year campuses, resulting in a comprehensive effort to alleviate Wisconsin's need to increase the technology workforce.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching goal of the Portals of Discovery project was to create collaborative research, mentorship, and instructional programs that join high schools, 2 year UW Colleges campuses, and 4 year baccalaureate UW institutions throughout the state.  We successfully completed a model collaboration joining the 2 year UW-Manitowoc campus, area high schools, and UW-Stout in undergraduate research, developed seed grants to spur similar collaborations across the UW System, and in the end were able to sustain undergraduate research and mentoring beyond the funding period via community and institutional support.\n\nA key goal of the STEP program was increasing the number of STEM graduates and majors in the United States.  At UW-Manitowoc, enrollment in biology majors courses increased 38% from the inception of the program through Year 4.   Because we are a liberal arts transfer institution, many students do not declare majors, therefore, we use enrollment in majors courses as an indication of STEM majors.  This significant increase in course enrollment indicates that we are likely reaching our goal of 15 additional students per year at UW-Manitowoc.  Enrollment in the reporting period (2014-15) declined compared to the previous years.  However, this still represents  growth since the beginning of the program.  Comparatively, overall enrollments at UW-Manitowoc have declined over the same time frame, indicating a larger proportion of students pursuing STEM at UW-Manitowoc. Other STEM disciplines at UW-Manitowoc have also seen growth; there was a 7.8% increase in Chemistry course enrollment, for example, since 2009.  Chemistry enrollments represent 10% of overall course enrollments at UW-Manitowoc, which is also the highest over the past ten years.  At UW-Stout, STEM Majors have expanded greatly from the inception of the program. Specifically, in the science realm, Environmental Science branched off of Applied Science in 2013, while a third science major, Applied Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, will launch in 2018.  STEM major enrollment increased 9.5% from 2012 through 2016 and total science degrees granted increased from 29 to 48 over the same time frame (65% increase).\n\nAnother key objective of our program was to discover ways in which teaching-focused undergraduate programs could integrate research and mentoring into their institutions, given the \"lean\" budgetary realities.  We used the lessons from this pilot study to develop an extensive collaboration based on water quality research,which led to the development of the Lakeshore Water Institute (LWI)--a formalization of the partnerships, outreach, and research activities developed at UW-Manitowoc since initiation of the STEP grant.  Its mission is educating and engaging youth and developing science-based decisions and leaders at the local government level.  Through the LWI, our community partners have included funding for our work in their grant activities.  In addition, we were able to work with our university foundation to help realize that early-college students would benefit from research stipends as well as scholarships.  In 2016, the UW-Manitowoc Foundation was awarded an endowment to fund a number of research stipends for the long-term future.  We also explored other ways to support research and mentoring for undergraduate students, including integration of research into all freshman biology laboratory courses, using college students as \"near-peer mentors\" to high school students, and creating opportunities for students to present their work in local, regional, and statewide forums.  We note that as an open-access institution, retention is a concern, especially in the STEM fields.   Students involved in the STEP program who have transferred also have been competitive at large universities in terms of opportunities to participate in high-impact undergraduate research and/or scholarship support.   Retention of participating students has been higher for each institution than retention in the general student population.\n\nAs we transition away from STEP funding, we continue to have strong participation in the program established by the Portals program.  We are continuing to involve students through classroom activities, and have supported independent research through class credits, and other external funding sources.  Most significantly, we have created a culture where students are excited to participate in experiential learning in and out of the classroom, and where faculty are supported in involving students in professional development.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca Abler"
