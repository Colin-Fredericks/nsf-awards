 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This project will initiate work on the development of methods for two unprecedented reactions:  (1) in situ Grignard formation and use in cross-coupling reactions in water, and (2) formation of unstabilized ylides for Wittig-like olefinations, also in water.  These will take advantage of micellar catalysis, where the reactive species to be generated either on the surface of the metal, or within a micelle, are protected from their aqueous surroundings by the hydrophobic interior of these nanoparticles.  For these studies, many variables will need to be screened, including the nature of the amphiphile that is to supply a dry reaction medium, in water.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Bruce H. Lipshutz of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Professor Bruce Lipshutz's research efforts revolve around the development of new synthetic methods for the formation of C-C, C-H, C-O, and C-N bonds.  Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis, as these new processes will be developed in the absence of organic solvents.  Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical, fine chemicals, and agricultural industries.",
