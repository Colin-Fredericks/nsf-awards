 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis 3-year award facilitates the purchase of two pieces of equipment to form a package well suited to advance research and research-related education in the areas of (i) Materials for the Built Infrastructure, (ii) High Performance Composites for Aerospace Applications, and (iii) Atmospheric Science.   \r\nThe equipment includes a customized, servo-hydraulic MTS High Rate Material Testing Workstation and a Phantom V.12 high-speed video camera.  The material testing workstation allows for low- to medium-velocity impact testing of materials, while the high-speed video camera is used in conjunction with the material testing workstation to record high-resolution video of the impact.  The accompanying motion analysis software provides state-of-the-art data collection and analytical capabilities for precise measurements of distance, velocity, acceleration, and time.  Data collection for both apparatus can reach a threshold of 1,000,000 data samplings per second.\r\n\r\nThe equipment-based projects expected to provide advancements related to ?Materials for the Built Infrastructure? include: (a) energy harvesting sensors for structural bridge health prognosis, (b) impact response of sprayed fireproofing, and (c) engineered concrete using polystyrene fillers and recycled automobile tires.  Investigations related to impact-critical, ?High Performance Composites for Aerospace Applications? include: (a) biomimetic composites based on fracture of human cortical bone, (b) high-temperature syntactic foam and phosphorescent coating, and (c) discrete fiber-reinforced composites using alumina fibers.  While the equipment is experimental, it will validate analytical predictions offered by state-of-the-art programming facilitated by collaboration with Teledyne and NASA.  Equipment utilization in ?Atmospheric Science? consists of studying sea-spray generation phenomena observed in hurricane force winds.\r\n\r\nA novel innovation stemming from the acquired equipment is the creation of a ?Virtual Laboratory? for real-time exchange of high-speed video and material testing data with remote collaborators.  This internet-based application seamlessly merges into the existing College of Engineering infrastructure and expands the breadth of research capabilities of engineering faculty.  Furthermore, the Virtual Laboratory can be expanded to include future equipment such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT).\r\n\r\nIn terms of technology transfer, students on all levels (including high school) will be gradually exposed to this state-of-the-art technology. Formal equipment training for undergraduate students has been strategically integrated into the existing curriculums of the PIs? respective engineering Departments.  This arrangement ensures a large base of trained student operators, exposes students to state-of-the-art technology, and simultaneously introduces them to the research arena.  Opportunities in the PIs? Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs allow supervised operation of the equipment, followed by independent utilization and peer mentoring during advanced graduate study.\r\n",
