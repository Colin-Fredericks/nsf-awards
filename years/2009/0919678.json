 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe ability to perceive and respond to light is vital to plant growth and development. Previous work has identified two genes (LRB1 and LRB2) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that have roles in light responses. Plants with disruptions of these two genes are more shade tolerant, a result of increased sensitivity to red wavelength light. Analysis of the sequences of the LRB genes suggest that they act by regulating the breakdown of other proteins, therefore the likely role of the LRBs in plant cells is to modulate the levels of a protein or proteins that participate in red light perception/response. This project will use a variety of standard molecular, genetic, and biochemical approaches to more fully elucidate the role of LRB genes in plant shade responses by determining where in red light-response pathway the LRB genes act, identifying the proteins that are regulated by LRB1 and LRB2, and investigating the structure of the molecular complexes of which the proteins which are encoded by the LRB genes are a part. \t\r\n\r\nShade responses are important in agriculture, as shading can reduce agronomic performance by increasing lodging (falling over) or decreasing yield, therefore the information obtained in this project may help guide future work on light responses in crop plants. Also, the majority of work in this project will be conducted by undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire (a four-year public comprehensive university), significantly enhancing their education and making them more competitive and better prepared as they enter graduate/professional school or the workforce.",
