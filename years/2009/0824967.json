While the University has TIMS capabilities, the requested instrument will be used for in situ and high-precision low ionization efficiency elemental isotope ratio measurements. Target elements are Hf, Fe, U, Th, Ta, and W). PIs are considering either a Thermo Neptune or NuPlasma HR which currently are comparable in performance and price. The PIs currently have a CETAC LSX-213 laser ablation system and dedicated Class 500 clean laboratory. Many fundamental geoscience and cosmochemical questions rely on precise, high-resolution elemental isotope ratio measurements. The main research questions to be addressed with the new MC-ICP-MS involve 1) Understanding mantle evolution. Lithospheric accretion at non-volcanic rifted margins and at ultraslow mid-ocean ridges processes will be studied by combined basalt and mantle rock Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf and Re-Os analyses. Os, Sr, Nd, and Hf isotope analyses will elucidate processes occurring during mid-ocean ridge mantle melting. 2) Planetary geology ? lunar basalts and SNC meteorites will be used to understand early Moon and Mars differentiation processes through Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd analyses, 3) Crustal evolution during orogeny ? crust-mantle interactions, arc magmatism, and mountain belt dynamics will be studied in terms of Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd geochronology of high- and ultrahigh-pressure rocks, 4) Environmental geology ? petrochemical processing impacts (atmospheric inputs) will be assessed by tracking isotopic and elemental fingerprints related to refinery operations. The new instrument will be housed in a 300 ft2 clean room already allocated by the University. The University will contribute $50K per year for 3 years to support a full-time technician. The University also funds and staffs machine and electronics shops. The lead PIs along with the technician will be responsible for day-to-day maintenance, instrument operation and student/user training. A scheduling committee will be created with the lead PIs and an outside scientist. Instrument time will be prioritized by committee. Ample preparation laboratories/facilities currently exist at UH. The instrument will represent the only on of its kind in the greater Houston area. Students will be incorporated from coursework level through using the instrumentation for dissertation research. Minorities will be encouraged through NSF-sponsored projects providing opportunities for underrepresented populations.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
