 "awd_abstract_narration": "New outstanding chemical, mechanical and physical properties are potentially exhibited in nanostructured materials. The nanostructured thin film with extremely high strength/ductility as well as fracture toughness can be very attractive for MEMS components and thin film coatings. Although mechanical behavior of bulk nanostructured materials has been investigated, there is lack of understanding on source of strength?Cductility and fracture as well as their fundamental relationships in nanostructured thin films. In order to design and process better thin film with ultrahigh strength, ductility and fracture resistance, novel nanostructured thin film processing and understanding on the source of strength and ductility in the films are important. Therefore, the research project is aimed at (1) developing a new fabrication technique to achieve better mechanical behavior (high strength and toughness) in nanostructured thin films for MEMS and coating application, and (2) understanding strengthening mechanism and fracture process in the thin films so as to identify a ?gproper?h microstructure for best mechanical performance. The nanoscale characterization on the nanostructured thin film is expected to contribute to the advancement in nanostructured thin film and nanocharacterization. \r\nThe project will integrate research and education by (i) providing training for graduate and undergraduate students, (ii) course development on nanostructured thin films, (iii) increased participation of underrepresented groups into the research through current Minority Engineering Mentoring Program in University of Pittsburgh, and (iv) outreach to elementary school and exposure of young students to nanoscale science & technology through Internet explorers and Pittsburgh Carnegie Science Museum. \r\n",

Experiments with nanostructured samples on strength and deformation have been done. The graduate students have been working on nanocrystals to study deformation and strengthening as well as fracture mechanisms using the in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM). In-situ TEM training in National Laboratory has helped graduate students for the project. Movies of deformation process of nano-metals from this project have been supplied to Pittsburgh Science Center for showing to 5 ~ 12th grade children. PI presented 10 invited talks in TMS, MRS, Engineering Science Society meetings and other international conferences during the life of this award. PI also has 12 journal publications including Nature, Nature Communications and Physical Review Letters from this award. Posters on the project were also presented in 2011 and 2012 NSF Engineering Research and Innovation Conferences. One of graduate students under this NSF support has been awarded Silver Medal of 2014 MRS graduate student award in Materials Research Society.\nThrough in-situ tensile tests conducted under TEM, we obtained direct evidence that ultra-twinned FCC gold (twin size &lt; 2.8 nm) exhibit near-ideal strength and a transition from ductile to brittle failure with increasing twin density. We found that ultra-high density twins give rise to homogeneous dislocation nucleation in Au NWs, which profoundly contrasts with the heterogeneous slip model. This new regime of size-dependent fracture opens new opportunities for mechanical properties in nanoscale metals at the theoretical limit of strength, by modulating twin densities, which will have large impact on the ultra-high strength thin film processing. Different from strengthening induced by decreasing grain size or sample size, strengthening through angstrom-scaled twins can make single pure metallic element with much higher strength by triggering homogeneous dislocation nucleation, which is important for application in micro-mechanical device processed with single metallic element using  the thin film process approach. \n    \nRevealing the nanoscale defect dynamics during mechanical deformation of metals and alloys is critically important to the development of the high-performance structural components that are durable, lightweight, and energy efficient for advanced nanomechanical devices. It is a long-standing challenge to reveal the interaction mechanisms of dislocations in the interior of the small-volume nanocrystals, which is crucial for understanding the size effect on the deformation behaviors in nanocrystals.  we have achieved the first atomically resolved observation of stacking fault tetrahedra (SFT), a 3D defect structure bounded by stacking faults, during its birth, growth and death, via dislocation interactions inside nanocrstal gold using in situ high resolution TEM.  The in situ experiments reveal the first ever instance of the deformation-induced SFT, providing a novel understanding of the nanoscale deformation mechanisms operative in various FCC metals and alloys. Our discovery is significant for understanding the mechanical behaviors of nanocrystals, including yield strength, work hardening, ductility, and size effects in thin films. The work also advances the fundamental knowledge about the 3D crystal defects in metallic nanostructures under non-irradiated conditions. It will motivate additional experimental and modeling studies on the dislocation dynamics and the nucleation of higher order defects in nanomaterials or thin films for the application of nanomechanical devices.\nTwinning is a fundament..."
