 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe investigator will complete a detailed evaluation of suitable locations in Argentina, to determine the potential next site to relocate and operate the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR). This relocation of the AMISR instrument aims to create a global scale ionospheric plasma laboratory by placing two National Science Foundation (NSF) - Upper Atmospheric Facilities (UAF) at both ends of the same geomagnetic field line. \r\n\r\nThe research effort will involve three parallel and complimentary work activities: \r\n\r\n1) A logistic approach to establish the most suitable location to install and operate AMISR, via a series of field trips and technical workshops. \r\n\r\n2) A scientific approach in which crucial atmospheric measurements will be made in Argentina, some coincident with the Arecibo radar and its soon-to-be-operational ionospheric HF heater. \r\n\r\n3) A human resources development approach in which, through a series of educational programs, the PI will build a teaching environment to train Argentine and US students and postdocs through collaborative studies and international interactions\r\n\r\nThe research will pave the way for an improved understanding of the 3-dimensional structure of the atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere (AIM) system, especially at Southern latitudes, where there is currently a scarcity of ground based measurements. The work will leverage existing NSF upper atmosphere observing facilities in a synergistic fashion, and thus extend the capabilities to provide improved global coverage of important AIM interactions. \r\n\r\nThe investigator is involving young students in the site evaluation work, and will develop valuable international teaching courses to prepare the next generation of atmospheric scientists to operate the radar, and interpret the scientific results. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the opportunity to perform a series of studies, using a test radar and several optical cameras, to better understand inter-hemispheric large-scale dynamics and electrodynamics studies at Southern latitudes, and prepare for the possible deployment of the AMISR instrument in Argentina, which represents a logical expansion of the NSF UAF network. \r\n\r\nThis work is funded jointing by the NSF Upper Atmosphere Research Section in the Division of Atmospheric Sciences, and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE). \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
