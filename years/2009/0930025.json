 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a time critical (RAPID) response cruise by a coalition of investigators to examine a newly discovered explosively erupting undersea volcano (Mata) in the Western Pacific Ocean.  The discovery of actively erupting undersea volcanoes is a rarity and data that addresses many fundamental geological, hydrothermal, volcanic, and biological issues will be collected.  The volcano being investigated is presently erupting unusual lavas of compositions indicative of the initial stages of arc formation.  As such they have an unusual chemistry and are thought to be associated with hydrothermal fluids of exotic and extreme compositions.  The likelihood that novel and previously undiscovered microbiological life forms associated with these fluids is a study target.  Short lived radiogenic isotopes in lava samples from the volcanic vent will be measured to obtain an eruptive timeline.  Coexisting hydrothermal fluids and erupted lava samples will be examined to elucidate the relationship between volatile and element partitioning between solid and fluid phases during this type of magmatism.  Broader impacts of the work include graduate student training, support of a PI whose gender is under-represented in the sciences, support of PIs from an institution in an EPSCoR state, and public outreach.  Outreach to the Tongan people in terms of presentations on research activities and results will also be carried out.",
