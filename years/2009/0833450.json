The endeavors emphasize providing data and a rich set of tools, services, and collaborative activities that will enable the community to advance scientific exploration and learning.  It will continue to provide real-time meteorology data to over 170 institutions to instruct and conduct research.  The goals, objectives, and activities in this projet are based on national science, technology, and education trends, as well as community concerns and needs.",
