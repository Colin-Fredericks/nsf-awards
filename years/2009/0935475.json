 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating in the International Workshop on Concentration, Functional Inequalities and Isoperimetry to be held October 29-November 1, 2009 at Florida Atlantic University.  Support will be provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for some plenary speakers. It is understood that much of the funding will be directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain senior participants will be funded as well.\r\n\r\nThe program will feature 16 one hour plenary lectures and a number of contributed talks. The principal objective of this meeting is to introduce young mathematicians to the field, as well as to provide a forum for presentation of the current state of the art of the theory. The organizers intend to actively involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and mathematicians from other under-represented groups, to which much of the funding will be directed. Graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.\r\n",
