 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project develops a portable training model that school districts can implement themselves in order to train teachers on using the customization service to plan and augment their classroom instruction. The project will use Denver Public School teachers and professional development personnel in the design and provision of this training. A mixed-method study protocol is used that combines passive data collection via instrumentation with both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The customization service is instrumented to collect detailed data on teachers' use of system features and NSDL resources. The use of the customization service helps teachers to increase their use of NSDL resources and to develop their pedagogical knowledge and skills for: 1) identifying appropriate NSDL resources for classroom use, 2) evaluating the utility of resources for improving student engagement, and 3) evaluating the utility of resources for addressing specific learner needs (customizing for knowledge, skills and interest).",
