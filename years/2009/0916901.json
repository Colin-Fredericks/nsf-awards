 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \r\n(Public Law 111-5).  \r\nThe research funded by this award targets the difficult  problem of how to debug programs running on large parallel systems.  The state \r\nof hundreds to hundreds  of thousands of parallel tasks that form a single \r\ncomputation are too complicated for a programmer to usefully analyze.  \r\nThis project will develop tools to find similarities between the state of \r\ndifferent processes, simplifying the task of the programmer.  The challenge \r\nin finding these similar tasks is to do it efficiently, without imposing an\r\noverhead so hight that the tool is useless.  A naive implementation would \r\ncompare the state of all processors against one another, and would introduce \r\noverheads increasing as the square of the number of processors.  Our approach \r\nwill successively refine sets of similar processes, will use key attributes \r\nof program behavior (e.g. communication patterns) to perform this grouping.   \r\nWe will also investigate the use these groups of similar processes to allow \r\ninvariance and statistically based techniques developed for sequential \r\nprograms (such as value and PC invariance) to be effectively adapted to \r\nparallel programs.  Because these techniques look for rarely occurring program\r\nactivities, applying them to disparate processes together will introduce\r\nnoise into the analysis, severely diminishing their accuracy.  The use of \r\nour grouping strategy  will allow effective parallelization of the \r\ntechniques, allowing them to be applied with significantly less overhead \r\nthan when used with sequential applications.\r\n",
