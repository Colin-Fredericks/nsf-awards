This innovative tissue engineering technology could be applied to in vitro bone tissue growth as well as a synthetic graft material for direct implantation. Using bioactive glass particles as feedstock, the unique 3D fabrication capabilities of SLS will be utilized to generate resorbable tissue scaffolds that mimic the structure and mechanical properties of trabecular bone.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are to provide synthetic bone materials for people who are facing a growing burden from bone disease and fracture due to the aging of the population. The novel bone tissue scaffolds proposed will enable progress in the in vitro growth of bone tissue. These bone tissue scaffolds can also be used directly as synthetic bone grafts in order to meet the needs of the increasing number of individuals who will require restoration of skeletal structure and function due to bone disease and fracture in the next decade. The collaboration between Mo-Sci Corp. and the Missouri University of Science & Technology (Missouri S&T) will promote a strong link between an industrial partner and academia in SLS manufacturing.\r\n\r\n",
