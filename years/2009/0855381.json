 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to produce surfaces with characteristics in the nanometer to micrometer range that enable desired functionality for complex-shaped components. Surface generation will be realized using a magnetic field to locally manipulate abrasives, which cause material removal and surface deformation. This magnetic field assisted finishing (MAF) process will be specifically applied to austenitic stainless steels due to their immediate relevance to free-form biomedical applications, including knee implants. The research agenda is divided into two primary tasks. Task 1 involves the development of models for material removal and magnetic particle motion. When considering the particle dynamics, effects such as the motion of the abrasive particles in the magnetic field and the plowing/cutting forces between the particles and surface will be incorporated into a discrete element simulation. Task 2 includes the experimental validation of the model and a study of the relationship between surface fabrication mechanisms and the resulting tribological properties of free-form surfaces. The outcomes of these tasks will combine to demonstrate the feasibility of MAF for surface functionalization.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide a new fabrication technique for functionalized surfaces on complex-shaped components. Surface functionalization has great potential for enhancing the performance of biomedical technology and improving the quality of life for sufferers of joint disease. The production of these functionalized surfaces will advance understanding of the magnetic abrasive behavior, material removal, final surface finish, and tribological performance, as well as their interrelationships. The multi-disciplinary research plan will provide a stimulating learning environment for both graduate and undergraduate-level students. In addition, a new mentoring program for women undergraduates will be implemented to develop relationships that lead to an improved support network. This program will better engage women undergraduates in the university engineering experience and enhance their long-term retention in engineering careers.\r\n",
