 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Engaging Youth in Engineering (EYE) Module Study is developing, pilot testing, and field testing two engineering modules for middle school science and mathematics classes: Bioengineering the Future with a focus on seventh grade life science; and Engineering Clean Energy targeting eighth grade physical science. Each module addresses an engineering design challenge of relevance to industries in the region and fosters the development of engineering habits of mind. The approach integrates technology and other resources to engage and meet the diverse needs of children in a large, urban school district, and deepens student understanding of selected middle grades mathematics and science content. The theoretical foundations for the module development are grounded in contemporary learning research. Instructional design of the materials emphasizes contextual learning, collaboration, content integration, and embedded assessments within the framework of the backward design process.\r\n\r\nTeacher professional development materials are being developed and participating mathematics and science teachers from the collaborating middle schools engage in at least one week of professional development each summer. An EYE Coach assists with professional development and supports the teachers on site during the implementation of the modules. The field testing sites offer opportunities to assess the impact of the instructional materials in across diverse groups of students.\r\n\r\nThis project explores the workability of incorporating engineering design experiences into standards-based courses to move toward an integrated STEM middle school curriculum in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This approach has potential to strengthen middle school STEM programs through the integration of engineering experiences. \r\n\r\n",
