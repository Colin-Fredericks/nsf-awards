R/V Langseth, a 235? seismic survey vessel purchased in 2005 from Western GECO to be operated as a geophysical research vessel (with some additional general purpose oceanographic capabilities) is owned by the National Science Foundation  It replaced R/V Maurice Ewing, a 236? research vessel operated by LDEO from 1990 to 2005.\r\nLDEO is requesting funds to support both basic and specialized services for operation of airgun seismic sources and multichannel seismic data acquisition in both 2-D and 3-D modes.  They propose to provide three technicians on each seagoing research project to provide basic services and to maintain equipment, calibrate sensors and provide support for qualified users.  Additional personnel are included for operation of the specialized seismic systems. The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.\r\n",
