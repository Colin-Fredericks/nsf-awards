 "awd_abstract_narration": "Truman State University's NSF-PRISM program, \"Scientists Prepared, Engaged, Enriched, and Challenged Through Research Activities\" (SPECTRA), seeks to increase the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors. Faculty members from mathematics, biology, and chemistry will be involved. The goal is to enhance the interdisciplinary, research-based experiences for undergraduates and to create a cross-disciplinary learning community. Students' experiences will include (1) a summer bridge course before their first semester (2) a new freshman seminar which will orient students to the University and to STEM degrees in an integrative fashion, (3) a second-semester Inquiry Seminar which will prepare students for independent research and (4) support for conducting research with faculty.  SPECTRA will providing focused support for early-career students and will enhance their opportunities to participate in integrative STEM learning experiences both through new courses and through academic-year research experiences. Scholarships will attract students to STEM degrees and support them as they work through their major degree programs. A special pathway course for potential majors will be offered to first-time freshman in the summer before their first regular semester of courses. Tutoring support and academic\r\ninterventions will be used to assist students in their pathway courses.\r\n\r\nThe SPECTRA program will create a community that will attract STEM majors and increase the number of STEM graduates. The SPECTRA program will also work with our community college partners to develop pre-STEM and 2+2 programs to help decrease the time-to-STEM-degree for community college students who transfer to\r\nTruman, and it will provide pre-STEM students with scholarships to encourage them to transfer.",

Our community college partners were Saint Charles Community College, Moberly Area Community College, and Metropolitan Community College of Kansas City. \n\nThese programs have had an impact on increasing the number of students earning a STEM degree and on increasing the STEM knowledge of students that do not earn a STEM degree.

Student participants in the Summer Scholars program have demonstrated a strong likelihood to be retained to STEM majors and increased success in academic performance compared to non-participant peers.

Our interdisciplinary courses were designed to give students a strong foundation in integrated sciences.

These participants are better informed on scientific issues than the general public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitte..."
