 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the mechanisms that lead to the origin of new species is a primary goal of evolutionary biology. Although new species have traditionally been viewed as originating in isolation from close relatives, recent data suggest that unique evolutionary entities can diverge even with high levels of gene flow. Although both genetic and ecological factors contribute to divergence of new taxa, the balance and roles of connectivity and isolation in diverging populations remain poorly understood. This project uses molecular genetic, ecological, and morphological data to understand patterns of divergence resulting from the balance between isolation and interbreeding in many populations of two endemic Lotus species in the California Channel Islands. These islands are close to each other and mainland California, but contain many unique species not found on the mainland. \r\n\r\nThis project contributes to the documentation of biodiversity and understanding of the underlying processes that generate new species. Such understanding is needed for effective conservation and management of biological diversity and the ecosystem services it supports. This study will clarify how natural processes influence connectivity and divergence in ecological communities of islands, with applications also to similar continental regions. The research also offers interdisciplinary research training for many undergraduate and graduate students and significant outreach to agencies and NGOs that are charged with conservation and management of biodiversity. \r\n",
