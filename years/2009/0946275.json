The proposed work will help create a new, original, method of developing a scientific agenda that can lead to exciting research in areas such as batteries, low-cost photovoltaics, and others.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will promote partnerships between industry and academia and, therefore, will increase learning on both sides by exposure to new science and technology contained in each one?s organizations.  IRI is committed to diversity in all its programs and services.",
