 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Development of Multidepartmental,Multidisciplinary Concentrations at Tuskegee University\" project seeks to reform the approach to biology instruction by infusing a strong genomic-bioinformatics and biophysics focus into the current biology curriculum and linking it to a collaboratory research experience that will promote critical thinking, enhance quantitative skills, ascertain mastery of integration of knowledge learned, and illustrate the interconnectedness of STEM disciplines for all students.\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to develop a genomic-bioinformatic and biophysics stream of concentration by developing requisite courses including Microbial Genomics, Introductory Bioinformatics, Computational Genomics, with dry and wet labs with genomics data search using computers; by integrating genomics and bioinformatics modules into existing courses; by implementing and evaluating the newly developed courses using wet/dry project collaboratories and computer-based lectures; and by disseminating the results of these efforts among undergraduate faculty in general and those at HBCUs and MSIs in particular.\r\nThis effort will result in an increase in the quality of educational instruction in biology, production of a cadre of very talented students (particularly minority students) who are capable of employing diverse aspects of mathematics and physics to answer biological questions, and better-trained faculty who are capable of deploying pedagogical approaches that infect students with an enthusiasm for scientific discovery. The transformation of the biology curriculum will have the outcome of effecting changes across the natural and physical sciences departments and increasing the dialogue of how best to train students for the practice of science in the 21st century.",
