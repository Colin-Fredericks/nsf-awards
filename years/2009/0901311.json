 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers are in the first phase of a study to analyze the impact of three different curricular approaches to the learning of algebra.  The three approaches are represented by: 1) instructional materials developed with NSF support (The Interactive Mathematics Program and Contemporary Mathematics in Context, also known as Core Plus Mathematics); 2) \"hybrid\" curricula (University of Chicago School Mathematics Project and the Discovering Mathematics Series by Key Curriculum Press); and 3) traditional texts (those published by Glencoe, McDougal Littell, and Pearson Prentice Hall).  The primary criterion for selecting these curricula is the level of market penetration.  This first phase of the study analyzes the three approaches in order to develop comparative maps that highlight the algebra content and cognitive demands across the curricula being studied.  This project is developing reliable and valid instruments to assess student learning, which, will be used to examine and compare student understanding of algebra in the later phases of the study.",
