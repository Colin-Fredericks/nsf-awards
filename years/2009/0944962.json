These visits will develop existing relationships and explore a variety of  NSF-fundable projects in: sustainable development, plant and animal biotechnology, and science education.  Dr. Temple's work is in bacterial pathogens and science education. Dr. Striebig is an engineer and works with environmental systems design and the development of sustainable infrastructure systems. The PI and Co-PI will give formal or informal presentations describing their interests in scientific research and education, as well as those of other JMU scientists who have committed to participation in these partnerships.  The investigators will be hosted by the University of  Hyderabad, Loyola College, Chennai, and the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi.    \r\nThe goal of the visit is to develop collaborative research and education proposals to be submitted to NSF programs.  These include a proposal for an international Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) to be located at one of the Indian universities and a workshop proposal to address common goals in science education.",
