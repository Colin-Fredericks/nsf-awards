 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas A&M University Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2013. Twelve students will be selected to participate in a 10-week research experience in biochemistry. The major goals of this program are to prepare students to pursue graduate training and careers in research, and to instill in those students an appreciation of the effort and satisfaction involved in this pursuit. Students will be trained in a diverse array of modern biochemical methods in a vibrant department, and will develop effective oral and written communication skills to describe their scientific projects. Recruiting efforts are focused on students who have completed their junior or sophomore year at colleges and universities in Texas and mid-Southern states, particularly those from institutions that do not offer doctoral degrees. Applications from students in underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged. Undergraduate participants will perform cutting-edge research in biochemistry while integrated into pre-existing laboratory groups of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, undergraduate students and technicians. At the conclusion of the program the students will present their research accomplishments in both written and oral reports. More information is available at http://biochemistry.tamu.edu/?ch=reu, or by contacting Mary Bryk at bryk@tamu.edu or the Program Director, Dr. Gary Kunkel at g-kunkel@tamu.edu.",
