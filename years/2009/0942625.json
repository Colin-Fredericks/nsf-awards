 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop on Constructive Mathematics will bring together leading and starting researchers from around the world to identify and make progress on the most important questions in constructive mathematics. There will be four sessions, each on a major branch of mathematics and led by an international expert: algebra (Fred Richman), analysis (Doug Bridges), set theory (Michael Rathjen), and topology (Bas Spitters). The goal is that, with the concentrated time on each topic and time between sessions for reflection, results can be achieved during the meeting itself. In addition, the attendees will have the opportunity to form collaborations, and will leave with renewed focus and\r\nstimulation to continue work on the problems identified. The intent is to increase productivity in constructive mathematics across the board.\r\nBesides these research sessions, there will also be a lecture on constructive mathematics and computer science by Vladimir Lifschitz. The target audience will be the attendees at the co-located sectional meeting of the AMS, and the talk will be pitched to a general math audience. The result should be greater awareness of and appreciation for constructive mathematics within the broader mathematics community.\r\nAnother benefit of the workshop will be to raise the profile of Florida Atlantic\r\nUniversity, a young institution still establishing itself and its math program.",
