A quasi-experimental, pre-post design will be used to examine the impact of these two types of scaffolds, as well a no scaffold treatment group, on middle school students' STEM learning, problem solving, and interest.\r\n\r\nWhile a wide range of video games are now being developed for educational purposes, very little is known about how to effectively design and use embedded scaffolds to support learning within these environments. This research will contribute to the field's understanding of how to effectively design and use embedded scaffolds to support middle school students as they learn about STEM and other similarly complex topics. Providing well-designed video games that effectively support learning has the potential to increase the accessibility of high quality STEM materials that support both learning and interest in the content areas.",
