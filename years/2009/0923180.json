 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of sensory cues and signals mediating plant-animal interactions have tended to focus only on one scale (community or individual) and one context (attraction). Relatively little is known as to how sensory cues modify behavior across scales and in different contexts. In this study, the tobacco hornworm hawkmoth (Manduca sexta) will be used to address the behavioral roles of relative humidity in foraging choices at different scales (local, habitat and landscape) and contexts (sex, age, nutritional status) and how these interact (additively, synergistically) to modify transitions in nectivorous behaviors of orientation, habitat selection and foraging and their implications for moth fitness. Cross-disciplinary training will be given to atmospheric science undergraduates from Cornell who will not only model relative humidity profiles at the study site, but will come to Arizona to learn, first hand, how climactic variables influence biological processes. This study will also support an outreach program that uses insects to teach biological principals to 2nd grade students in specially designed workshops and classroom visits, reaching over 5000 elementary school students most of whom are minority and of poverty economic status. These students will gain hands-on experience as to the importance of water and humidity in desert environments, how and why insects behave, and that bugs are inherently fascinating. Over 70 Undergraduate Preceptors will be trained in outreach teaching and how to convey an enthusiasm for science to the general public. An outreach program at Cornell ('Insectapalooza') is focused on the extraordinary biology of insects, and will guarantee a strong impact of this project on the public in two diverse cities. The undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows will receive cross-disciplinary training in ecophysiology, behavior, pollination biology, nutritional ecology and community structure, as well as one-on-one mentoring in experimental design, manuscript writing and the oral presentation of scientific research.",

Relatively little is known as to how sensory cues modify behavior across scales and in different contexts. In this study, the tobacco hornworm hawkmoth (<em>Manduca sexta</em>) was used to address the behavioral roles of relative humidity in foraging choices at different scales (local, habitat and landscape) and contexts (sex, age, nutritional status) to modify transitions in nectar feeding behaviors of orientation, habitat selection and foraging. This study shows that relative humidity has a substantial effect on the foraging behavior of the hawkmoths at multiple scales. At the scale of a single flower, hawkmoths can detect the humidity gradient released from the nectar at only 4% above ambient. Moths preferentially forage on flowers that exhibit this humidity gradient, which provides a reliable signal to the moth on the presence or absence of nectar in the flower. At the local scale, moths altered their foraging behavior when placed in low humidity environments by increasing the volume of nectar imbibed and by consuming more dilute nectar. When placed in high humidity environments the total volume of nectar imbibed decreased. As a consequence, foraging decisions made by <em>M. sexta</em> kept under different ambient relative humidity levels allow individuals to meet their water balance demands while maintaining a constant energy input. When moths did not have a choice of nectar concentrations, the average amount of energy consumed increased with relative humidity. On the habitat scale, higher concentration nectars require a longer time to digest and have a higher metabolic cost of digestion. This has a significant effect on the metabolic cost of processing nectar during flight as flight metabolism increases the higher the concentration of nectar that the moths consumed just before flight. On the scale of a whole landscape, hawkmoth abundance and diversity increases dramatically with the increase in relative humidity at the onset of the summer rainy season. Behavioral assays of orientation to humidity showed that females had strong a preference for high humidity whereas males had a marginal preference for the humid habitats within the landscape. Hawkmoths are prevalent in hot environments. Energy expenditure and water loss in <em>M. sexta </em>increases with increasing temperatures. Under high temperature stress, moths prioritize energy over water balance and incur a water debt in an attempt to balance the energy budget. This is achieved by ingesting floral nectar with relatively high sugar concentrations. These results suggest that the general foraging strategy of <em>M. sexta </em>is to balance water status, and therefore to avoid excess water, while at the same time to accrue a net gain in energy. Plants belonging to the hawkmoth pollination syndrome generally offer floral nectar with sugar concentrations greater than 25%, suggesting that they evolved an energetic strategy to secure the services of these efficient pollinators.
