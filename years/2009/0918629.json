The resources are designed to be used by teachers of middle and high school biology, ecology, and environmental science classes. The project will produce three complete curriculum modules. They will include new scientist at work profile videos that will be disseminated online through a web interface that enables teachers to select and customize scaffolding and to address their particular students' needs in the classroom. The program will also develop in-person and online courses at CCNY and AMNH for local New York City public school teachers and teachers nationally to explore their own connection to environmental issues and ecology and to reflect upon the role of scientific inquiry in building understanding of the natural world. \r\n",

These case study modules are <em>Highways Block Bighorn Sheep</em>, <em>Winter Roads Make Salty Streams</em>, and <em>Chesapeake Bay Food Webs</em>. &nbsp;Each case study explores scientific data that demonstrate the impact of daily life on ecological function. For example, <em>Bighorn Sheep</em>, explores data that show how highways, built to connect Los Angeles and Las Vegas, break apart bighorn sheep habitat and lead to inbred sheep populations. <em>Winter Roads</em>, investigates how road salt, applied to roads to prevent car accidents in winter, runs off into freshwater streams, changing its abiotic components to make some streams nearly as salty as seawater. Finally, <em>Chesapeake Bay</em>, uses historic and present day food webs to explain how historic shrimp overharvesting contributes to algal blooms and dead zones in today&rsquo;s bay.

Randomized controlled trials in the classrooms of 26 teachers across 16 public New York City high schools (N=2,234 students) showed that students using the <em>Ecology Disrupted</em> curriculum learned significantly more about human impact and ecology than students using their regular curriculum. They got 15.7% more correct items on the posttest than on the pretest, compared to just 3.3% for the control group.&nbsp;The data show that being exposed to the <em>Ecology Disrupted</em> curriculum has a positive and significant impact on student learning of both human impact and ecological function and that explicitly linking these topics is a valuable approach for improving student learning. In addition to this study, this project contributed exemplary curricular resources for student learning of ecology and human impact. These resources are freely available on the American Museum of Natural History&rsquo;s website and a case study workbook is in development to be published by Pearson. Study of the teacher professional development program (N=36) showed that the <em>Ecology Disrupted</em> implementation positively affected teachers&rsquo; dispositions toward using authentic data and real-world media about scientific research to explain how people impact ecological function. Teachers demonstrated increased appreciation and capacity for using data and media for learning how humans disrupt ecological function.
