 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nMalicious software is one of the most pressing security problems on\r\nthe Internet. The main reason for the apparent failure of current\r\ndefense approaches is that malware detection techniques are too\r\nspecific. This is most obvious with virus scanners, which rely on\r\nsignatures that are specific to individual malware instances. However,\r\nalso behavioral detection techniques typically target only specific\r\nfeatures of malicious code. Examples include the scanning behavior of\r\nworms and the command and control channels of bots. Unfortunately,\r\nsuch techniques become obsolete when malware evolves and the targeted\r\nfeature disappears.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we develop a novel malware defense system that\r\novercomes the shortcomings of current approaches. To this end, we\r\ninvestigate techniques that specify and model program behavior at a\r\nlevel of abstraction that captures general properties and features\r\nthat are fundamental to the execution of programs. In addition, we\r\ndevelop a stealth and comprehensive analysis environment that\r\nautomatically extracts the characteristics of novel malware strains\r\nwhen they appear, expressing these characteristics in terms of the\r\ngeneral, behavioral properties. These characteristics are then\r\nautomatically translated into efficient detection models. This allows\r\nour system to quickly react to and eliminate novel malware variants.\r\n\r\nThe research on novel techniques to eliminate malware presents rich\r\nopportunities for industrial and societal impact, and will have broad\r\nimpact though education and outreach. We will introduce a new course\r\non malware analysis at UC Santa Barbara, perform outreach activities\r\nthrough a newly established diversity center, and cooperate with\r\nwell-known players in the anti-malware industry.",
