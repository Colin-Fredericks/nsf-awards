 "awd_abstract_narration": "0519415\r\nVuille\r\nThe tropical Andes are one of the regions of the globe where recent climate change is\r\nmost evident, consistent with the notion that high-elevation mountain ranges that extend into the\r\nmid-troposphere will experience greater warming. As a result glaciers are receding throughout the\r\ntropical Andes, with potentially severe consequences for the availability of drinking water, and\r\nwater for irrigation, mining and hydropower production.\r\nGeneral Circulation Models (GCMs) run with a 2.CO2 scenario predict an additional\r\nwarming of more than 2.5.C by the end of the century. However large uncertainties exist about\r\nthese future projections, especially because the coarse resolution of GCMs is inadequate to\r\nresolve the meso- and local-scale circulation features associated with the steep Andean\r\ntopography. To accurately understand and predict future climate change and its impact on tropical\r\nAndean glaciers, higher resolution models and a better simulation of variables other than\r\ntemperature are required.\r\nWe propose to simulate climate variability and change in the Andes under both presentday\r\nconditions (1961-90 and 1958-2001) and two different IPCC-SRES emission scenarios\r\n(2071-2100) with a regional climate model (PRECIS) to gain a better understanding of how\r\nfuture climate change might affect tropical Andean glaciers.\r\nResults from our regional climate model will be validated with observational data from\r\nspace before they are used as input into a glacier-climate model (ITGG 2.0) to simulate how\r\nglacier mass balance will be affected by future climate change. The simulated present-day mass\r\nbalance of selected glaciers will be compared with observational records from the tropical Andes\r\nto verify the accuracy of our results. To gain a better understanding of the consequences of\r\nglacier retreat, the ITGG 2.0 model will also be used to simulate changes in runoff from Andean\r\nwatersheds. The anticipated results of our proposed research are:\r\n1) The use of a high-resolution model will improve simulations of climate in this area of complex\r\nterrain and yield more accurate predictions of future climate change than are available to date\r\nfrom GCM.s.\r\n2) An in-depth model validation with observational data will lead to a better assessment of model\r\nperformance (for both the RCM and the ITGG 2.0).\r\n3) We will for the first time establish robust projections of how glaciation and runoff will change\r\nin this region at the end of the 21st century. This has important implications for the anticipated\r\nfuture water shortage in the region and will provide much needed information to implement\r\nadaptation and mitigation strategies.\r\n4) Finally we anticipate a significant model improvement as a result of using regional climate\r\nmodel data instead of course resolution reanalysis data as input into the ITGG 2.0 model.\r\nWe strongly believe that our proposed research addresses a key issue related to future\r\nclimate change in the tropical Andes, which is of high scientific interest but also of primary\r\nsocio-economic relevance for the region. The potential for a future water crisis is evident and this\r\nwater shortage is related to a projected future change in runoff, due to the observed rapid glacier\r\nretreat. The scientific merit of this proposal is therefore to gain a better understanding of both\r\nmechanisms and consequences related to the disappearance of tropical Andean glaciers. This\r\nincreased knowledge on how fast and how far glaciers will recede and how much this will affect\r\nfuture runoff and water availability from the Andes will have a significant and broad impact on\r\nlocal economies and populations. Without a better and much more detailed knowledge of how\r\nfuture climate change will affect glaciological and hydrological systems in the Andes, no\r\nmitigation and adaptation strategies can be put in place.\r\n\r\n",
