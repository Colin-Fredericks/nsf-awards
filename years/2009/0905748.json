Leininger\r\n\r\nThis project aims to study the geometry of various structures on\r\nsurfaces, actions of the mapping class group on these spaces, and\r\ntopological/dynamical aspects of surface homeomorphisms.  This\r\nincludes (1) an ongoing project with R.P. Kent on convex\r\ncocompactness in the mapping class group, with a focus on free\r\ngroups and surface groups; (2) a topological investigations of\r\nalgebraic relations in the mapping class group and the closely\r\nrelated braid groups with D. Margalit; (3) a study, via geodesic\r\nlength functions, of certain singular euclidean geometric\r\nstructures on surfaces and their degenerations in a joint project\r\nwith M.  Duchin and K. Rafi; (4) a continuing project with\r\nB. Farb and D. Margalit to provide a topological model for\r\n\"minimal complexity\" surface homeomorphisms.\r\n\r\nSurfaces---like the surface of a ball or a doughnut---have been\r\nstudied for hundreds of years, and are fundamental and beautiful\r\nobjects in mathematics.  The study of surfaces is intrinsically\r\ninteresting, but is also responsible for the creation of entire\r\nfields of mathematics, as well as the development of techniques\r\nin many others.  As such, the theory of surfaces and their\r\ngeometries lies at the juncture of several fields of mathematics\r\nincluding complex analysis, differential geometry,\r\nlow-dimensional topology, geometric group theory and dynamics.\r\nMany geometric objects can be described using surfaces as the\r\nbasic building blocks. To study these objects one naturally\r\nencounters the notion of a \"homeomorphism\" of a surface: this is\r\na kind of \"symmetry\" which preserves only the most basic\r\nproperties of the surface.  The set of all homeomorphisms is\r\nsomewhat unwieldy, but the most important features can be\r\ndistilled into a more manageable structure called the \"mapping\r\nclass group.\"  This project proposes the study of several related\r\nproblems about surfaces, their homeomorphisms and mapping class\r\ngroups, and the implications of these studies to related\r\ngeometric objects.\r\n",
