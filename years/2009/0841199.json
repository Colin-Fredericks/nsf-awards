 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the University of Idaho GK-12 program is to improve graduate Fellow communication, teaching, collaboration, and teamwork skills, while increasing inquiry-based science taught in rural middle and high schools in Idaho and Washington. Graduate Fellows will be from interdisciplinary degree programs: Waters of the West - Water Resources, Environmental Science, and Environmental Engineering. The STEM theme will be water resources and the environment as a context for learning physical, Earth, and life sciences. The theme and interdisciplinary approach will raise working knowledge of water resources, one of the most compelling and complex topics facing the world today. Fellows will use their research to convey scientific concepts to students, linking the science content to local water resource issues (e.g. aquifer depletion, floods and droughts, or the inter-relationship of salmon, hydropower dams, and Indian Tribes) that are relevant to the teachers, students, and community.\r\n\r\nThe program will serve seven rural school districts, including the Lapwai (Nez Perce Tribe) district, which is 82% Native American; all schools are within river basins subjected to integrated analysis by the Waters of the West program. Five specific impacts are: (a) Fellows will effectively communicate scientific concepts in classroom and public contexts, (b) Fellows will successfully apply collaboration and teamwork skills in teaching and research (c) Fellows will demonstrate inquiry-based teaching skills, (c) STEM teachers will demonstrate increased content knowledge, mentoring skills, and confidence and competence in inquiry-based teaching, and (e) grade 7-12 students will demonstrate increased scientific knowledge, excitement, confidence and career awareness.\r\n",

The title of the grant was &ldquo;New, GK-12 Project in Water Resources for Middle and High Schools in Rural Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington.&rdquo; Through this grant, graduate fellows in the WoW program were funded to teach science in middle and high school classrooms for one year. These graduate fellows received training in teaching and science communication skills.

They also were encouraged to teach students about their own research and other applicable current research.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Through the WoW GK-12 program, three groups of program participants benefited. Graduate fellows learned to effectively communicate scientific concepts in a variety of contexts, apply collaboration and teamwork skills in teaching and research settings, and demonstrate general and inquiry-based teaching skills. STEM teachers gained content knowledge, mentoring skills, and confidence and competence in inquiry-based teaching. Grade 7-12 students increased scientific knowledge, excitement, confidence and career awareness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Over the course of the award period, 46 graduate fellows participated in the program, each spending 6-10 hours per week in the classroom in addition to preparation time outside of class. Twenty-seven 7<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> grade STEM teachers from 17 different secondary schools participated in the GK-12 program, and over 2,000 7<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> grade students benefitted from the presence of a graduate fellow in their classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">NSF has a goal that all GK-12 programs will have a lasting impact and systemic change within the university in which they are working. Therefore, during the final years of our program, in addition to achieving GK-12 goals, we developed, trial tested, and acquired additional funding for a program that would carry forward the goals of the GK-12 program. This sustainability effort is called The Confluence Project (TCP) and shares the same goals as the original GK-12 program by partnering graduate students with high school science teachers to deliver inquiry-based science education to high school students. TCP also brings place-based, project-based education to the classes it works with. High school students learn science by going into the field to conduct research with graduate students and other local experts. Thus far, this program has been well-received by teachers, students and school administrators. In order to continue this program into the future with potentially limited funding, graduate students will receive training and focus their efforts on leading field experiences and mentoring students to do research projects. We have found that through those tasks, graduate students greatly improve their science communication, teamwork and teaching skills. At the same time, teachers have become more excited about their curriculum and day-to-day instruction while high school students learn research and critical thinking skills while getting to know their local environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/15/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jan&nbsp;Boll</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div c...",
