 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n \r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis REU site is focused on cognitive communications at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and hosts 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks for 3 years. The site recruits, trains, and retains undergraduate students to research by supporting them in the following ways:\r\n? Prepares them to think creatively and independently;\r\n? Motivates them to pursue graduate studies;\r\n? Helps them to develop general research skills in an interdisciplinary context;\r\n? Allows them to gain hands-on experience in cognitive radios, wireless networking, and their applications;\r\n? Promotes a sense of confidence, team spirit, and an appreciation of the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration in creating new knowledge;\r\n? Exposes them to the intellectual excitement involved in research activities; and\r\n? Teaches them to effectively assimilate latest research, assess their own knowledge, present experimental results, effectively prepare reports and publications, and understand the methods for translating ?research to practice (R2P).?\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Cognitive communications is an area of high interest to researchers in wireless communications. The mentors in the project have a strong background in this area and are well suited to carry out the projects with the students. The site has access to a high quality test bed for student experiments.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project recruits a high percentage of the students from underrepresented groups in computing. They especially focus upon minority serving institutions without large research programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
