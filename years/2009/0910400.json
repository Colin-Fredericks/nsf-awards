 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding morphological adaptation is a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. However, this goal is challenging because most traits are composed of many components, and it is often unclear how these components individually, and collectively, contribute to performance. For example, in locomotion, multiple muscles and skeletal elements contribute to movement. This study will use morphological and performance measurements, a systems approach, and evolutionary modeling to identify how each component of the locomotor system evolves and how they are functionally integrated to produce locomotor systems adapted for specific lifestyles. Desert lizards are an ideal system to study this question because they vary widely in ecology, which appears to have selected for different locomotor capabilities. \r\n\r\nThis work will further our knowledge of the fundamental rules governing the design of terrestrial locomotor systems. This study will be synthetic, bringing together functional morphology, ecological physiology, and evolutionary modeling. Furthermore, it will be the first application of a systems-approach to whole animal function in order to identify where within the system adaptation occurs, the degree of complexity involved, and help identify key features and selective pressures that explain morphological diversity, a concept important for conservation.\r\n",
