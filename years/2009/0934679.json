 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this planning grant, steps are being taken to develop the framework for a Teaching Fellows and Master Teaching Fellows program. Through this program, Bard College is expanding its impact on high needs schools in New York City, California's Central Valley, and upstate New York. As part of this planning project, the guiding philosophy behind the program is being defined and program elements are being planned based on that philosophy. The curriculum and structure of an existing MAT program is being revised to support the needs of the Fellows and to align the project with the goals of the Noyce program. A non-profit organization that has the willingness, capacity, and expertise to support the goals of the program is being identified and recruited. A detailed assessment plan is being developed that details the measures and methods of data collection and analysis. Other planning activities include identification of sources of university cost share, securing school district support for implementing salary supplements for the Fellows, and defining the roles and responsibilities of all participants.",
