 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for a scientific workshop to identify critical topics where drilling to obtain samples, make subsurface measurements, or emplace instruments will make important advances in the geosciences in the near future, and to outline longer term plans for the development of future initiatives in land-based scientific drilling.  The workshop will use insight from members of the international geoscience community to develop contemporary themes, such as CO2 sequestration and climatic controls on rates of evolution; and other themes that may emerge from the workshop or elsewhere. \r\n\r\nThe result of the workshop will be a brief but comprehensive working document that will publicize projects currently in progress and in planning stages, identify efforts that are only in conceptual stages that may come to fruition in the next 5 years, encourage collaboration between the continental drilling community and other geoscience communities and entities, and articulate the resources necessary for the implementation of scheduled, planned, and envisioned projects. The working document will be made available to the geoscience community, to science planners and administrators, and to agencies that either fund science or appropriate funds for science primarily as a web document (.pdf). The meeting will be used to provide the basis for planning a larger-scale international meeting in 2010 that will be designed to produce a long-range (decadal scale) science plan for continental drilling.\r\n***\r\n",
