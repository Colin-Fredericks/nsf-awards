 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThis research focuses on combining foundational and lightweight formal \r\nmethods to verify the safety, security, and dependability of \r\nlarge-scale software systems. Foundational approaches (to formal \r\nmethods) emphasize expressiveness and generality, but they have not \r\nbeen successfully scaled to large-scale systems. Lightweight \r\napproaches emphasize automation and scalability, but they are less \r\neffective on low-level programs and on providing explicit proof \r\nwitness. The PIs are developing new high-level and low-level \r\nlightweight methods and adapting them into various foundational \r\nverification systems. More specifically, at the high level, the PIs \r\nare developing lightweight dependent-type systems and \r\nseparation-logic shape analysis, and connecting current methods such as \r\nconventional type systems, slicing analysis, and flow analysis; at the \r\nlow level, the PIs are designing specialized provers and decision \r\nprocedures to verify low-level programs and to support certified \r\nlinking of heterogeneous components. If successful, this research will \r\ndramatically improve the scalability of foundational verification \r\nsystems and provide new powerful technologies for building trustworthy \r\nsoftware systems. Combining lightweight and foundational approaches \r\nalso provides a common thread that will pull different verification \r\ncommunities together and unify them into a single framework.",
