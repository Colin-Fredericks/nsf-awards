 "awd_abstract_narration": "Architecturally Diverse Systems for Streaming Applications \r\nAbstract (0905368)\r\nMany important scientific computing problems, called ?streaming applications,? have high input data rates derived from real-time sensor data or directly from data streaming from disk arrays. Real-time sensor based data (e.g., telescopic astrophysical data obtained in the search for new planets) is frequently sourced from analog devices and requires filtering and various data cleaning prior to performing a host of complex computations.  Large disk based data sets (e.g., genome and protein sets used in understanding disease factors) are often passed at high data rates from disk storage.\r\n\tChoices for dealing with such applications include a multiplicity of computing devices (e.g., general purpose processors, chip-multiprocessors, graphics processors, field programmable gate arrays, etc.). While each individually is well matched to certain types of computations, often more effective solutions are found by integrating multiple computer types into a single system. \r\nThe central research issue is determining how to effectively integrate diverse computing resources for solution of complex streaming applications. The research includes further development of the AutoPipe design environment. AutoPipe provides tools for algorithm specification, and for design, simulation and deployment of diverse integrated computing architectures. Techniques for inclusion of analog devices in mixed analog-digital systems is being undertaken so that Auto-Pipe can handle mixed signal, analog/digital algorithmic functional and resource components in a single system. The research activity is driven by two important applications taken from the astro-physics and computational biology domains. There will be heavy involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the research.\r\n\r\n",
