Prof. McCarley and his students plan to investigate how to prepare stimuli responsive liposomes with the capability to deliver molecules that are internalized in the liposomes as a result of liposome destabilization. They will investigate the mechanism and kinetics associated with liposome opening by chemical reducing agents and enzymes. The project could have significant impact on various industries that focus on environmental remediation, chemical analysis and drug delivery. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in a highly multidisciplinary research area. It will also support the participation of Prof. McCarley and his students in the Louisiana Board of Regents \"Speaking of Science\" program for K-12 students and in the LSU's ChemDemo K-12 outreach program, which has already impacted 60,000 Louisiana students.",
