The numerical study employs direct numerical simulations (DNS) to examine the two way interactions between freely moving vaporizing droplets and isotropic turbulence. The droplets will be fully resolved in 3D space and time, i.e. not treated as point particles, and all the scales of the turbulent motion are resolved down to the smallest relevant length and time scales. The emphasis will be on the two way exchange of mass, momentum and energy between the vaporizing droplets and the surrounding turbulent gas. The experiment employs a turbulence generating active grid and optically accessible wind tunnel section to measure the evaporation rate of free flying single droplets (i.e. one way coupling) in isotropic turbulence with properties identical to those in the DNS. Anamorphic optics for imaging and an interferometric fringe technique are used to provide a large axial field of view with high resolution droplet-sizing capability.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\n\r\nThe proposed DNS study will be the first that fully resolves the flow inside and outside a large number of freely-moving vaporizing droplets in a turbulent flow. The detailed results of the proposed DNS, with two way coupling between the droplets and turbulence, can be used to develop and verify the mathematical models for the subgrid scales of large eddy simulations (LES) as well as Reynolds averaged models. It should be emphasized that the detailed DNS data which will be obtained from the proposed research are not available in any published experimental or numerical study (Birouk & Gokalp, 2006).  The proposed experimental study will examine the exects of turbulence on the vaporization rate of a single droplet moving freely in isotropic turbulence. In addition to enhancing the understanding of the physics of interaction between turbulence and vaporization, the measurements will be used to validate our DNS methodology since no other comparable experimental data exist for free flying droplet evaporation in isotropic turbulence where the Kolmogorov length scale of turbulence is smaller than the initial droplet size. Hence, the coupled experiment and computations will determine the key interactions between evaporation and turbulence.\r\n\r\nBroader impact\r\n\r\nThe results of the proposed study will have a significant impact on the efficient utilization of energy.  This impact stems from the fact that the vaporization rate is the main controlling mechanism of fuel droplet combustion and that liquid fuels are the most important source of energy for all modes of transportation and will remain as such for the foreseeable future. Understanding the physical details of the vaporization and mixing processes in a turbulent flow is an essential prerequisite to understanding the chemical reaction process and the eventual control/optimization of the energy conversion process. The PIs have a record of accomplishment in the field of study and in combining research and teaching, including outreach to undergraduate students and underrepresented students in the sciences. For example, three women Ph.D. graduates of the investigators are now University Mechanical Engineering faculty (Univ. of California San Diego, Univ. of Denver, Calif. State Univ., Los Angeles). In addition, the co-PI is Regional Director for the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP), an NSF-funded activity to enhance the number and success of underrepresented students in STEM fields.  Through CAMP, this project can provide research motivation for such students. The experiment in this investigation will also be used as a demonstration in COSMOS, a summer residential program for talented high school students interested in the sciences and engineering in which the co-PI participates.  Our DNS digitized data have been transmitted to universities in Japan and Brazil as well as the European Science Foundation to be used as a reference for researchers in Europe. A video made of these data showing the motion of the longitudinal vortical structures in a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer has been selected by Prof. G.M. Homsy (UCSB) to include in the Multimedia Fluid Mechanics-II CD which provides a cross-platform, interactive, visual resource, for students and professional alike.  The results of the proposed research will be disseminated similarly",
