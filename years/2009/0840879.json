The MARGINS office provides a framework for cross-disciplinary studies of the evolution of the continental margins. It provides the infrastructure to advance science planning, disseminate results, foster interdisciplinary collaborations and lead educational and outreach activities for all four MARGINS initiatives.  Priority for the office in FY10 will be to support the MARGINS Steering Committee activities during the transition to a potential successor program to MARGINS, facilitate major that synthesize past results and begin the process of compiling a new Science Plan for the program through a major workshop.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts will include support of educational and synthesis meetings, maintenance of a website and Newsletter, holding of distinguish lecture series and support of outreach activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany of the most challenging problems in solid earth geoscience require broadly multidisciplinary approaches.  Furthermore, most active solid-earth processes with highest societal impact (great earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, etc.) take place on both sides the shoreline, a traditional dividing line between scientists in onshore and marine sciences.  To overcome these barriers and make progress in these critical problems, NSF began in 2000 the decadal MARGINS program.  It funded research in four Initiatives:  Sediment Source to Sink that studies sediment creation and delivery, the Seismogenic Zone Experiment that studies processes generating great earthquakes, the Subduction Factory where material and fluids/gasses recycle from oceans to deep interior and out volcanoes, and Rifting Continental Lithosphere that explores problems of continental breakup and creation of new ocean basins.  Individual scientists and teams apply directly to NSF\u00c6s MARGINS program to work in these areas.\n\n \n\nThe MARGINS Office provided support to facilitate this roughly $50M scientific investment. This award and its predecessors support the MARGINS Office, operating under the present PI from 2006 to 2010, and a transfer period in 2010-11 to its successor.

This award covers the last year of operation at Columbia University, and the final years of the MARGINS program as originally planned.\n\n \n\nThese years saw tremendous activity in completion of projects, synthesizing what had been learned from MARGINS, and then planning a new successor program designed to pursue some of the more important problems uncovered in the MARGINS decade.
