 "awd_abstract_narration": "With NSF support, Fisk University proposed second phase CREST Center for Physics and Chemistry of Materials (CPCoM) will primarily establish a sustainable program that integrates high-quality science education with state-of-the-art research and develop it over the course of CREST support into an internationally recognized research center in the area of physics and chemistry of advanced materials. Education of undergraduates and graduates will be a vital component of the Center. The major objectives of the CREST-CPCoM Center are to continue establishing a world-class research center for the study of electronic and optical materials and related technologies. The research focus of the proposed Center for Physics and Chemistry of Materials is in the study of advanced materials, novel processing methods, new properties and phenomena while enabling new devices for science, industry, energy, environment, and medicine. Phenomena and their applications will focus on detection, emission and modulation of electromagnetic radiation based on selected electronic and optical materials in the form of crystals, nanomaterials, amorphous materials and glasses, glass-ceramics and thin films.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include dramatic increases in the production of well prepared members of underrepresented groups (primarily Afro-American and/or female) with Masters and PhDs at CPCoM and its partners through rich interdisciplinary interactions and cross-fertilizations of ideas among the faculty and students in the discovery and study of novel materials and creating breakthroughs based\r\non scientific and technological excellence.",
