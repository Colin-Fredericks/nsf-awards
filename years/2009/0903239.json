 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advice and recommendations of its Business Advisory Council, the Convergence Technology Center determined the knowledge and skills required by technicians who work with systems that combine voice, video, data, and images over one secure network.  The Center forecasted the hiring needs of regional and local industry and created awareness of the career opportunities and developed curriculum to educate over 400 faculty and 2000 students.  The Center began to mentor other community colleges developing convergence technology programs.  The Center now extends its work to reach 18 other community colleges.  The new activities include recruiting and retaining especially Hispanic students presently underrepresented in the technology workforce.  The curriculum and professional development is expanded to include Green information technology especially as it relates to decreasing the energy consumption of technology.  The evaluation conducted by an external evaluator investigates the effectiveness of the curriculum, including hybrid courses, the impact of the professional development, the increase in the minority students in the program, and the changes in the mentored colleges.",
