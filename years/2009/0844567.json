The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Anne Richards of Texas Christian University for the study of novel, functionalized phosphonic and phosphinic acids.  These new compounds are employed in the systematic exploration of oligo- and polymeric main group metal phosphonates, bimetallic phosphonates and related phosphinates.  Professor Richards' graduate and undergraduate students work to understand the role of the metal phosphinates, arsonates and heterometallic materials in a large range of applications from single molecule magnets to catalysts, gas absorbers, and photoluminescent materials.  Collaborations with scientists at Georgetown University and Monash University in Australia aid in the characterization of the new materials.  Professor Richards also mentors a high school chemistry teacher and is a faculty advisor to the TCU Chemistry Club, which has an outreach program to high school seniors.",
