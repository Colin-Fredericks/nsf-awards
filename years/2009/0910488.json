 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Cheuk-Yiu Ng of the University of California, Davis, and his research group will measure the ionization energies, bond dissociation energies, and vibrational and rotational constants of diatomic molecules MX and their cations MX+, where M is a 3d transition metal (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni or Cu) and X is a main group non-metal (X = H, C, N, or O).  The general experimental strategy takes advantage of the fact that most MX species possess long-lived, low-lying electronic states that allow a variety of double resonance techniques (initial visible excitation followed by photoionization, photoelectron, or photodissociation) to be applied which can circumvent the normal problems of spectral congestion or signals due to impurity species.  Photodissociation studies will involve a two-color velocity-mapped ion-imaging method, which should make it possible to determine accurately not only MX dissociation energies, but the branching ratios of the various dissociation channels.\r\nBeyond the specific questions related to diatomic molecules containing transition metals, the techniques developed during this research project will have important impacts in other areas of physical chemistry, astrochemistry, and virtually any other chemical science arena where precise spectral and dissociation energy information is needed. This research project will also provide an excellent vehicle for the training of students and post-doctoral researchers who themselves may go on to develop novel laser based techniques. Finally, Prof. Ng is a participant in the undergraduate research program (MORE/CAMP/MURPPS) for underrepresented minority students at UC Davis.\r\n\r\n",
