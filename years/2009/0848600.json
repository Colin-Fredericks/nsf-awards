 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop and build a method and system for integrating sophisticated advertising capabilities into the Scientific Media Concise Message Routing System. The technology allows anyone with an internet domain name (individuals, small businesses, large corporations, or other organizations) to quickly, easily, and cheaply distribute information via a variety of mobile media, with particular emphasis on text messaging, or SMS. The technology comprises hardware and software that route text-message requests and responses between \"subscribers\" who access information and \"content publishers\" who distribute information. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to create the system and methods needed to append highly-targeted advertisements to the content requested from publishers by subscribers.\r\nScientific Media believes that the system establishes the framework of an important new method of distributing information via SMS that can be applied in a variety of settings, including consumer, education, and research settings.",
