 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nA team of multidisciplinary researchers at Oklahoma State University (OSU), in collaboration with local public school officials, will measure changes in young students' STEM interests, achievement, and attitudes over three years and relate these changes to identifiable parent/teacher influences. The research goal is to determine significant predictors of low-income, rural Native American boys' and girls' early interests in science and mathematics that can provide guidance for classroom practices that encourage young girls' STEM interests. Specifically, this research will (1) determine and examine family and school influences related to changes in students' science and math interests and achievement from 3rd - 5th grade among rural, largely Native American populations in Oklahoma and (2) generate case studies that illustrate influences on girls' STEM interests within this special population.\r\n\r\nThe targeted school region includes large numbers of low, socio-economic status (SES) students (those eligible for free and reduced-price meals) and Native Americans. The 35 schools in this study are (1) small, rural schools within the Cherokee, Pawnee and Osage Indian Nations and (2) located near the research base. The study includes 800 students (with approximately 45% Native American students) in grades 3 - 5 with similar numbers of girls and boys at each level. A Native American Advisory Board will provide guidance to assure cultural awareness and sensitivity informs methodology and analysis. Methods include observation protocols, survey instruments, focus groups, and student test scores.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nResearch results and new strategies will be widely disseminated at national conferences, in professional publications, and to tribal groups and policy makers. This study will break ground as the first research-based research of home and school influences on STEM interests among rural, Native American populations. Educational infrastructure will be enhanced by providing research opportunities for diverse students, creating new partnerships with rural schools, and expanding the network of educators prepared to address gender and minority equity issues in STEM. Long-term, innovative changes will be measured in the determination of pedagogical teaching practices that encourage STEM interests of young Native American women. This research has implications for improving opportunities for a larger and more diverse domestic science and engineering workforce. Oklahoma State University is strongly committed to faculty and student diversity, actively recruiting among many traditionally underrepresented groups. It should be noted that OSU has the highest enrollment of Native American college students in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the EPSCoR and the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering programs.",
