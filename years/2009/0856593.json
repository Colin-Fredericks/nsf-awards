Twenty students will be selected each year to participate in a pre-freshman summer undergraduate research experience and participate in an intense one-week skill enhancement program in applied mathematics.  With university support, additional math tutoring will be continued through the students' freshman year.  These students, who will be joined by 52 additional AASU students, will participate in an academic year learning community experience that will include research supportive courses (inquiry-based format), experiential activities (field trips, community service projects, etc.), a monthly colloquium, and faculty and peer mentor tutoring and counseling.",
