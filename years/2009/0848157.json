 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific Research:  Cytokinesis in animal cells is brought about by assembly of an actomyosin contractile ring that constricts the cell around the spindle equator.  The molecular basis underlying the organization and constriction of the contractile ring is well documented, yet the mechanics of how actin filaments redistribute and assemble into the ring remain poorly understood.  This project aims to elucidate the mechanics of contractile ring assembly by learning how microtubules interact with actin filaments and how the filaments incorporate into the ring. Knowledge gained from this project can be applied to analogous cellular processes, such as polarized growth and wound healing of a single cell.\r\n The working model is as follows.  During early anaphase, dynamic astral microtubules exclude actin filaments from the poles, ultimately resulting in actin accumulation at the equatorial cortex.  Meanwhile, at the plus ends of the relatively stable central-spindle microtubules, actin filaments are assembled de novo, and delivered to the equatorial cortex by laterally splaying microtubule bundles.  There they coalesce with the actin excluded from the polar cortex to assemble the contractile ring.  Based on this Microtubule Induction model, the project aims to dissect the mechanics of microtubule-mediated transport of preexisting actin filaments.  Exclusion of these filaments from the poles by microtubules may occur via two distinct mechanisms.  If actin filaments are driven towards the equatorial cortex by elongating microtubules, mechanical interactions between microtubules and actin filaments will be demonstrated and perturbed in living cytokinetic cells.  In cells deprived of the spindle apparatus, a microneedle will be used as a surrogate for microtubules to recruit actin filaments, in order to rescue furrow positioning.  Alternatively, if actin filaments are transported by motor proteins along spindle microtubules that are contiguous to the cortex, direct observations of their movement on microtubules will be made in living cytokinetic cells.\r\nThe project will use a newly-developed approach that employs multimode micro-techniques to surgically remodel spindles and cells so as to mechanically dissect microtubule-mediated assembly of the contractile ring. This unique approach combines classic micromanipulation and microinjection with modern laser microbeam surgery - on a microscope equipped with both digital-enhanced polarization and spinning disc confocal microscopy. Thus, the approach permits direct micromanipulation of both unlabeled and fluorescently labeled cytoskeletal components in living cells and in vitro.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The general impact of this research project will be increased in multiple ways. Concomitant with achieving the specific aim, one to two graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow will be trained in designing and conducting experiments, presenting data at scientific conferences, and publishing papers in respected journals.  The research will also be used as an effective teaching tool for science education in a variety of contexts - in undergraduate and graduate Cell Biology courses, the HHMI-supported undergraduate summer research program, the NSF-supported OSU outreach programs to GK-12 students and teachers, the HHMI-supported Science & Math Investigative and Learning Experiences (SMILE) program, and in communicating with the general public. This research generates striking, aesthetically compelling data via cutting edge technology, making it ideally suited for educational outreach.  Furthermore, because this basic research uses grasshopper spermatocytes as a model for understanding cell division, it may steer applied research toward novel ways of suppressing reproduction in agriculturally destructive insects.",

Prior to cell cleavage, cytokinetic proteins are recruited into the nascent contractile ring composed largely of actin and myosin II filaments. Interactions between spindle microtubules and the cell cortex may play a critical role in this recruitment, since microtubules have been shown to affect distribution and activation of proteins within the cortex. However, direct evidence for physical interaction between microtubules and the cortex has been lacking. Hence we proposed to study the mechanics of how actin filaments redistribute and assemble into the ring by understanding how spindle microtubules interact with the actin filaments and mediate their incorporation into the ring.</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific findings:</strong> We used a multimode micro-technique to surgically remodel spindles and cells so as to mechanically dissect microtubule-mediated assembly of the contractile ring. Specifically, we probed the physical connection between astral microtubules and cortical actin filaments, by micromanipulating the fluorescently tagged cytoskeleton in living spermatocytes of the grasshopper <em>Melanoplus femurrubrum</em>. We demonstrated that when microtubules were tugged with a microneedle, they in turn pulled on cortical actin filaments, interrupting the filaments' journey toward the cell equator. Further displacement of the actin dragged the cell membrane inward, showing that the cortical actin network physically linked spindle microtubules to the cell membrane. Regional disruption of the connection by breaking spindle microtubules prevented actin accumulation in a segment of the ring, which locally inhibited cleavage furrow formation. We proposed a model in which dynamic astral microtubules physically redistribute cortical actin into the incipient contractile ring.</p>\n<p>While pursuing our proposed research in cytokinesis, we serendipitously discovered a novel phenomenon in which phosphorylated myosin II, i.e., the activated form, localized to the bivalent chromosomes during meiosis in grasshopper spermatocytes. Our preliminary results, based on pRLC (phosphorylated myosin Regulatory Light Chain) antibody staining, showed striking spatial and temporal distributions of phosphorylated myosin II on meiotic bivalent chromosomes (Figs. 1-3), which may have the following implications. &nbsp;1) These findings suggest that phosphorylated myosin II might be involved in pairing and/or crossing over of homologous chromosomes. Consistent with this proposition<em>, </em>phosphorylated myosin II did not localize to mitotic chromosomes in grasshoppers, or to meiotic bivalents in drosophila spermatocytes, which by nature do not undergo <em>homologous</em> recombination. Failure of recognition by the pRLC antibody was highly unlikely, as the antibody stained phosphorylated myosin II elsewhere in these cells.&nbsp; 2) The data also suggest that myosin II might mediate the separation of homologous chromosomes before they are able to segregate to the spindle poles. Unlike chromosome separation in mitosis (or meiosis II), which is driven primarily by degradation of cohesin, separation of bivalents requires additional breakage at the chiasmata between homologous chromosomes.&nbsp; If phosphorylated myosin II is involved in pairing and/or crossing over of homologous chromosomes, its dephosphorylation could also be required for separation of the bivalents. In support of this proposition, phosphorylated myosin II localized precisely to the site of bivalent separation, and its dephosphorylation coincided with the onset of anaphase I.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> This project has trained a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow, and resulted in publication of a research paper entitled Astral Microtubules Physically Redistribute Cortical Actin Filaments to the Incipient Contractile Ring.
