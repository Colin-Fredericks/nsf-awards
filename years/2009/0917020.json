 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe edge of the Internet continues to spread rapidly over the wireless medium. To cope with the escalating demand, every available opportunity in wireless networking will has to be maximally exploited, particularly at the border of physical and higher layers. One such opportunity is the capability of successfully capturing a frame even in the presence of an interfering frame, i.e., message-in-message (MIM). With MIM, two concurrent transmissions may be successful if they are activated in a specific order, but not the reverse. Towards harnessing MIM, this project aims to: i) Understand the intrinsic potential of MIM through theoretical analysis; ii) Draw on this understanding to design efficient higher layer protocols; iii) Develop a prototype testbed to validate/evaluate the MIM-aware protocols.\r\n\r\nThis project offers obvious benefits to the broader community as it attempts to satiate the growing demand for bandwidth hungry applications over wireless networks by extracting the most from the scant spectral resources. Additionally, this project facilitates: i) Development and strengthening of the laboratory and curriculum for wireless networking at University of South Carolina and Duke University; ii) Involvement and mentoring of undergraduate students in wireless networking research; iii) Deployment of experimental wireless technologies within The Duke SmartHome.",
