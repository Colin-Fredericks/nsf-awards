 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to develop fundamental understanding and predictive modeling of power and energy transduction in structurally integrated thin-film active sensors for autonomous structural health monitoring (SHM). The educational objective is to address active sensors education and outreach with involvement of underrepresented minorities.\r\nThe adequate modeling of power and energy transduction in structurally integrated thin-film sensors and actuators is of prime importance in the design of energy-efficient autonomous systems because it affects battery life and energy harvesting needs. The approach will consist of fast and efficient analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental validation. The focus will be on exact analytical modeling of the shear-lag interaction between a thin-film active sensor and the multi-modal ultrasonic waves present in the structure. The methodology will be first developed for isotropic metallic plates and then extended to generic multi-layer anisotropic systems (e.g., adhesive bonding, composites, or hybrid structures).\r\nThe outcome will be an advanced methodology for modeling of power and energy transduction in structurally integrated thin-film active sensors. This methodology will allow rapid and accurate exploration of the design space to achieve optimum transduction efficiency for long-term operation of autonomous SHM systems and other autonomous active sensing devices.\r\n",
