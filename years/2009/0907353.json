 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract \r\n\r\nThis award supports experimental research and education in the field of spintronics. The project entails synthesis of epitaxial magnetic nanostructures for systematic control of the transport and energy spectra of spin-polarized current. The research will be directed toward the understanding of outstanding issues in spintronics, which are both fundamental and essential to applications. In particular, measurements of the single magnetic-domain-wall resistance in single crystal half-metals will be carried out as well as the development of nanostructures that will take advantage of the expected large domain-wall resistance. The project also aims at investigating nanostructures with periodic magnetic domain walls, and using itinerant spin currents to stimulate the modified spin-wave excitations arising from this periodicity. Experimental methods include variable-temperature magnetotransport studies, epitaxial chemical vapor deposition, magnetron sputtering, and submicron lithography. Students will be trained and they will acquire cutting edge skills in advanced experimental techniques and materials processing. There will be efforts to recruit students from underrepresented groups in science, including women and minorities, to participate in this research. \r\n\r\nNon-technical Abstract\r\n\r\nSemiconductor technology is facing severe challenges in miniaturization.  Future electronics will likely rely on the fundamental attribute of electron spin. Spintronics concerns itself with several, equally important issues, related to highly spin-polarized solids and spin transport in microscopic systems. This individual investigator award supports a project to harnesses the electron's spin to create new electronics devices. In particular, measurements of the magnetic-domain-wall resistance in half-metals will be carried out as well as the development of nanostructures that will take advantage of the expected large domain-wall resistance. The project also aims at investigating nanostructures with periodic magnetic domain walls, and using itinerant spin currents to stimulate the modified spin-wave excitations arising from this periodicity. The primary impact of the activity will be the training of human resources. Students will be trained and they will acquire cutting edge skills in advanced experimental techniques and materials processing. There will be efforts to recruit students from underrepresented groups in science, including women and minorities, to participate in this research. This research will generate new knowledge and data on novel spintronic nanostructures. New spintronic devices will be invented and adapted to applications areas where existing solutions are inadequate.",
