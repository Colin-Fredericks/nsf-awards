The continuation funding is enabling the establishment of a secure future by positioning CSERD to respond to shifts in web technologies and building a self-sustaining enterprise model.  \r\n\r\n CSERD partnerships with Sigma Xi, and national associations representing Hispanic, American Indian, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, along with the SuperComputing conference, offers focused, customized faculty training for use of CSERD and NSDL resources across the curriculum. By leveraging partnerships with TeraGrid and the new XD program, CSERD is bringing underrepresented groups into the computational sciences, and by extension, to all STEM areas.\r\n",
