 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project between Old Dominion University, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, the Mid-Atlantic Maritime Academy, Marshall Community and Technical College and South Louisiana Community College is modernizing marine technology education in three major shipbuilding and maritime areas of the country.  The project is developing instructional modules in lean six sigma, value stream engineering, green manufacturing and shipyard environmental footprint.    The instructional modules utilize active learning instructional methodologies that have been documented to improve student learning.  Fifteen community college faculty and sixty secondary school teachers are being trained in the use of these modules and subsequently integrating the modules into the curriculum at their respective institutions.  The project has strong participation and support from major shipbuilding entities, including the Virginia Ship Repair Association and the American Society of Naval Engineers, who are providing input on the content and quality of the instructional modules.    The project includes job placement activities for students interested in careers in shipbuilding.   An independent evaluator is implementing formative and summative evaluation plans throughout the life of the project.",
