 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued research into the nature of fundamental theories of gravity, and their connection to cosmology. Topics to be investigated include (1) the principles which determine the quantum state of the universe and the generalizations of quantum mechanics necessary to understand it, (2) the gravitational aspects of string theory, a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, and (3) the notion of locality in quantum gravity and its application to quantum cosmology and the evaporation of black holes.\r\n\r\nThis work in centered in the ongoing quest of physics for a unified theory of nature's fundamental forces and the origin of the universe. These are subjects not only of great interest to scientists but also the general public. By engaging the interest of students and public the investigators hope to encourage the support of science generally.  In addition, the project will develop human resources for science and technology by training graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in advanced techniques.",

In classical physics, no information can emerge from a black hole.  While Hawking showed long ago that black holes can radiate energy, his effect also failed to radiate information.  Yet there is strong evidence that, at least in string theory, information does emerge from black holes as they evaporate.  Marolf and collaborators argued that this implies a dramatic failure of normal physics at the horizons of sufficiently old black holes in string theory.\n\nThe research of Hartle and collaborators supported by this grant was aimed at providing a quantum theory of the origin of the universe.
