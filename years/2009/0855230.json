While GMTK is currently widely used for speech recognition, the extensions being performed, however, are optimized not just for speech recognition but for all time-series applications. New infrastructure is also being developed that significantly enhances GMTK?s abilities, speed, documentation, source code availability, and pedagogical structure. This work will give to both the student and the researcher an enormous number of dynamic graphical model facilities. With its new features, GMTK will be able to perform computationally difficult time-series processing on extremely large and diverse data sets.",
