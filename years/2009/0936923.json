Dr. Gorodetsky will develop chemically modified carbon nanotubes (with attached DNA) to be used in field effect transistors.  The suitability of these molecular electronic devices to detect small quantities of proteins will be assessed.  Dr. Gorodetsky will conduct experimental work in collaboration with scientists at Columbia University, and will work with theorists at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  For his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Gorodetsky will recruit and mentor women chemists from Stern College, Yeshiva University in research to be conducted in the laboratories of Prof. Colin Nuckolls at Columbia University.\r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Gorodetsky is aimed at developing new sensors for biological molecules.  The ultimate goal of research like this is to develop improved methods for the rapid detection of important biological molecules (e.g. cancer biomarkers) to aid researchers and clinicians in making measurements quickly and inexpensively.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Gorodetsky are aimed at increasing the participation of young people from underrepresented groups in the sciences.\r\n",
