Specific tasks include the definition of an SQL schema, the development of an ASCII-to-WordNetSQL table translation program, a searching interface and additional format conversion utilities. Syntactic limitations on WordNet?s lexicographer files and compiler are eliminated so as to allow long, variable-length word strings and special characters found technical terminology. The table-based SQL format is designed to allow a virtually unlimited number of relations per word form or synonym set, both user-created and ?original? to the Princeton WordNet. User extensions and modifications to WordNetSQL are distinguished from those made ?domestically,? ensuring that development of the core WordNet database remains independent of external updates, and that WordNet?s large user community continues to have available a common, consistent database against which automatic systems can be evaluated. We develp conversion tools for WordNetSQL and other popular WordNet representations (RDF/OWL, Prolog, XML). Maintenance of  the Princeton WordNet lexicon and user support continue.  \r\nThe major impact of  the freely and publicly available WordNetSQL is to enable flexible extensions by a broad and diverse user group to specific and technical domains including biology and medicine.\r\n\r\n",
