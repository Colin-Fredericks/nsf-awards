Due to advances in optical machining technology it\r\nis now possible to essentially machine a surface of any shape. \r\nThis increase in design possibilities calls for new design\r\ntechniques.  Traditionally, partial differential equations and\r\ndifferential geometry did not play a role in optical design\r\nbecause of the restrictions of what surfaces could actually be\r\nmade.  Now, using these methods, and in particular the viewpoint\r\nof exterior differential systems, we have a framework to attack\r\nthese complex problems.  Additionally, new models for optical\r\nsystems are developed based on functional differential equations. \r\n\r\n     In recent years a plethora of difficult new optical design\r\nproblems have appeared.  Energy conservation has become a problem\r\nof global concern, and in particular the problem of efficient\r\nlighting.  Significant advances are currently taking place in\r\nillumination technology, due to the rise of the light emitting\r\ndiode.  Yet the design problem for illumination systems has\r\nproven to be notoriously difficult, and is currently more of an\r\nart than a science.  The investigator and his colleague develop\r\nnew mathematical methods to deal with these challenges in optical\r\ndesign.  The project provides a framework for illumination\r\ndesign.  Another application is to automotive safety.  The\r\nprincipal investigator has already designed a driver-side mirror\r\nwithout a blind spot, that has no distortion.  The problem of\r\ndesigning a similar mirror for the passenger side of a car is\r\nmore complex, and is pursued in this project.  Finally, the\r\ninvestigators disseminate this work through interactive exhibits\r\nbased on the project that are hosted by The Franklin Institute, a\r\nmajor US science museum located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich is visited every year by over 750,000 people. \r\n",
