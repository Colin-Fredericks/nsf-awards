Analysis of chemical species has been important to many technological advances. Current technologies rely on adsorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography (GC) and a few other diagnostics. Depending on the industry, there is often one tool that is considered the standard. For example the EPA sets pollution standards based on the capability of GC tools which employ ICP-AES tools within the system. The PI proposes to complete the basic development of a new diagnostic system that has the potential to replace ICP-AES and thus revolutionize both emission spectroscopy studies as well the capabilities of GC systems. Specifically the new tool is based on the use of well characterized variable electron beams to produce the emission. By employing a variable electron source, the density of the electrons can also be controlled independent of the electron energy. This change allows the development of a new class of emission spectroscopy tools that are inexpensive, easy to calibrate and allow direct density measurements.",
