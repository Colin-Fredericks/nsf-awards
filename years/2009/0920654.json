 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  The \"Before, During and After Class Learning Cycle Activities\" project focuses on large introductory lectures and the need for instructional materials that support an inquiry-oriented instructional strategy, and encourage active student engagement in a cooperative learning setting. The project is developing 24 sets of instructional materials that support instruction in a one-year course for science and engineering majors. These instructional materials will be activities for \"before\", \"during\", and \"after\" class meetings based on the Learning Cycle Approach. Before lecture students will complete a web-based Before Class Exploration (BCE), consisting of a data collection activity using a simulation program and questions about the data.  Responses are stored in a database so the instructor can assess student's pre-existing knowledge, allowing lecture activities to be customized for each class. The During Class Invention (DCI) uses data generated in the BCE along with questions/problems to develop a concept that focuses on course learning objective(s). Cooperative groups complete the DCI and individual/group responses are reported using clickers. The After Class Application (ACA) is a web-based set of conceptual and algorithmic questions that allow students to apply their knowledge of the concept introduced by the BCE and \"invented\" by the DCI. The instructional tactics used in this project are supported by the research on cooperative learning, inquiry-based instructional strategies, and advance organizers. The innovative instructional materials use sound research-based principles and can serve as a model for instructors in other disciplines. A two-day workshop for faculty teaching large lecture sections will provide training, theoretical background, and opportunity to generate new sets of activities.",
