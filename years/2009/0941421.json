 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crime scene investigation (CSI) is a highly visual and quantitative analysis characterized by a time-sensitive need to gather, organize, analyze, model, and visualize large, multi-scale, heterogeneous and context-rich data. CSI is also characterized by a fundamental need for rapid coordination and data translation across disciplines, agencies and levels of expertise as crime scenes are processed, reconstructed, solved and ultimately prosecuted over time, often critically in front of laypeople comprising a jury. The core intellectual contributions of this research include a shift to 3D virtual crime scene reconstruction and collaboration protocols for virtual CSI work. Embedded within the virtual scene will be all of the conventional evidence data, but will also include advanced data resulting from the development of non-invasive nano-scale methodologies and databases for advanced surface and cross-sectional materials chemistry analysis, especially fibers. The new data will lead to development of revolutionary high statistical significance when comparing similar materials commonly encountered in CSI. Further, collaboration protocols for dynamic virtual team assembly and interaction will be developed, assessed and optimized for contextual knowledge transfer.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research and education agenda include critical benefits to research and education infrastructure, public health and safety, and the justice system. The resulting system will be used as a novel research tool to increase the level of scientific rigor and advance the knowledge of forensic analysis. It provides a platform for integrating research with engaging science and engineering education opportunities for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups and communities.",
