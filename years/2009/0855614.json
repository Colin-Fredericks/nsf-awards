 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research that the PIs intend to perform consists of several projects involving both formal and phenomenological aspects of String Theory and related theories of gravity, and supersymmetric gauge theories. The purpose of the proposed activity will be to extend our knowledge of fundamental physics, including but not limited to the structure of cosmic singularities like the Big Bang, the quantum nature of black holes, critical properties of gauge theories, and the relation between physics at very short distance scales characteristic of string theory and physics at scales observable in experiments. More specifically, the PI will conduct research aimed at understanding space-like singularities using holographic correspondences involving non-critical string theory, Matrix theory, and the AdS/CFT correspondence. He will also use scattering techniques to decode microstates of black holes. The co-PI will investigate the properties of strongly-coupled scaling limits of SUSY gauge theories, applying new techniques that he recently helped to develop. He will also study the structure of magnetically charged particles in SUSY gauge theories and the flows of a class of string-inspired gauge theories from high to low energies. Part of the funds will be used to invite leading workers in the field to visit the University of Kentucky to give seminars and to engage in detailed discussions, which could lead to future collaborations. A few distinguished visitors will be invited to deliver popular lectures aimed at encouraging young undergraduates to choose physics as a career and to disseminate frontier results in physics among a broad cross-section of the community.",
