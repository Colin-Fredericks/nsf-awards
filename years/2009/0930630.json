 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)Phase I project seeks to develop a commercially viable, self-calibrating, piezoelectric micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphone. The acoustical specifications of these microphones (measured by noise floor, linearity, sensitivity) will meet or exceed those of existing laboratory quality microphones. The devices developed in this project will be significantly smaller (1 order of magnitude) and less expensive (2 orders of magnitude) than the present state of the art. In addition, these MEMS microphones would have the capability of in situ self-calibration. The availability of a self-calibrating microphone would usher in a new age of instrument quality microphones with integrated sensing, actuation and adaptation.\r\n \r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of successfully developing high quality microphones that hold the potential to affect everyone who has a cell phone uses a hearing aide or other microphone based communication device. These microphones will have a lower noise floor and higher dynamic range than existing technologies thereby enhancing communication. In addition, the availability of very small (less than 1mm2), sensitivity, and self-calibrating microphones could improve hearing aid technology and thereby help the hearing impaired. The affordability, manufacturability, and performance of these microphones, has the potential to become the dominant microphone technology in applications ranging from studio microphones to cell phones. The commercialization of self-calibrating microphones would open up new markets and revenue streams.\r\n\r\n\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"",
