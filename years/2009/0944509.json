 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) collaborative research award is to test the hypothesis that the laws of continuum mechanics hold inside a micro-well of molten copper such that, when Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes are introduced into the micro-well, because of their high aspect ratio they will follow the fluid streamline and cling to this alignment upon solidification. The mechanical properties of this nanotube/copper composite are critically influenced by the alignment of the nanotubes in the Copper matrix. The approach to achieving this objective will be to employ a high brightness laser for creating a molten well of 50 micron diameter and 200 micron deep on a copper substrate and then introduce the nanotubes into the micro-well. It has been shown through computer simulation that there exists a vertical laminar flow pattern in the laser-induced micro-well. The microstructure of the composite will be examined to determine how well the vertical alignment is accomplished.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this research will include enabling technologies to allow copper alloys to be used in a number of applications that require high mechanical strength in combination with high electrical and thermal conductivities. A potentially transformative benefit is for the $65 billion die and mold making industry. Building dies and molds enforced by the nanocomposite will simplify the manufacturing process, reduce the lead time, prolong die life, and create a new workforce of die and mold makers.",
