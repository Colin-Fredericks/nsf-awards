 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for organizing an NSF-sponsored symposium entitled the First International Symposium on Semiconductor and Plasmonics-Active Nanostructures for Photonic Devices and Systems. The symposium will be held at Vienna, Austria, between October 4-9, 2009. It is targeted at reviewing the state-of-the-art progress and identifying the potential manufacturing challenges at the forefront of nanotechnology-enabled photonic technology. The symposium will (1) review the latest progress in the fabrication and assembly of metallic nanostructures, zero- and one-dimensional semiconductor systems, and photonic crystals; (2) identify new opportunities for implementing semiconductor and plasmonic active nanostructures in photonic device applications, and (3) investigate the system-level integration of nanoscale semiconductor and metallic components with devices for enhanced performance. \r\n\r\nThe symposium will bring together researchers working in academia and industry to stimulate interaction among scientists, engineers, and students working on various aspects of semiconductor and metallic nanostructures and their applications. This will help to strengthen this community, to reveal new directions of research which are key to the ultimate success of nanotechnology in the real world. Efforts will be made in the conference plan and organization to increase the college-level student attendance and promote the representation of women and minorities. As an international symposium co-organized by American and European scientists, the symposium will also help U.S. researchers promote communication and establish research connections with overseas institutes and laboratories.\r\n",
