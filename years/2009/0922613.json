Faculty and undergraduate researchers from Lewis & Clark College will use the microscope to investigate a broad range of important biological topics ranging from fundamental aspects of cell structure/function to the characterization and documentation of new venomous brown recluse spider species.  The imaging system will significantly expand the scope of questions Lewis & Clark College faculty and students can collaboratively address and strengthen the ties between research and teaching so fundamental to the most effective science education.  Use of the microscope will be integrated into the College curriculum, so that 60 undergraduates a year will be trained in cutting-edge light microscopy techniques that they will utilize while carrying out independent research into topics directly related to faculty research programs.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the microscopy system will be a centerpiece of ongoing outreach activities in area science classrooms and summer research programs targeting high school and community college students from underrepresented groups in science.  The research and training outcomes from use of the microscopy system will be published in peer-reviewed journals and highlighted on Cell Biology/Molecular Biology/Biochemistry course related websites, faculty research websites, and outreach associated websites at Lewis & Clark College.\r\n",
