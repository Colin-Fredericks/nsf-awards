 "awd_abstract_narration": "To enhance and build on NSF-funded efforts already underway in the informal science education community, this proposal requests funding to: (1) bring together educators working in informal science environments for a two-day professional development conference that will focus exclusively on climate literacy in all of its dimensions, and (2) provide opportunities for informal science educators to interact on the topic of climate change with scientists and science media who will be participating in the AAAS annual meeting that immediately follows. This Climate Literacy professional development conference will take place on February 17-18, 2010 in San Diego.\r\n\r\nAAAS will organize the conference in partnership with the Birch Aquarium, the public exploration center for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In addition to presentations on all aspects of climate literacy and what it entails for educators and for the public, this professional development conference will also provide a variety of hands-on opportunities for participants to apply their new knowledge and skills to their own programs and projects. An expert advisory group will guide the development of the conference program and the selection of speakers and participants, focusing especially on including and serving the needs of informal science educators from institutions of varying sizes and types and serving diverse public audiences. \r\n",
