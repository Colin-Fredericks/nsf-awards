 "awd_abstract_narration": "The national conference \"First National Forum of Young Topologists\" will take place at Tulane University in New Orleans (most likely November 13 - 15, 2009). The main aim of the conference is to bring together graduate students working in various areas of topology. Prominent topologists will talk to the students about the past and the future of topology of manifolds in  higher and lower dimensions. Some young topologists will share with students their experience of being succesful in completing Ph.D thesis and securing a job in academics.\r\n\r\nDuring the conference students will exchange ideas, and will talk about their problems and worries that they face when working on their Ph.D degrees. They will also have a chance to obtain more global and comprehensive views of several active research areas of topology. It is hoped that this conference will establish a network among graduate students in topology and will build a sense of community.",
