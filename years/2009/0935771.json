 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Indian Language Development Institute (AILDI) will celebrate its 30th anniversary in the summer of 2009. In honor of this celebration, and with support from NSF's Documenting Endangered Languages (DEL) Program, AILDI will host a workshop which brings together presenters who are actively involved in both documentation and revitalization for Indigenous languages. There are several interesting aspects to this event. First, it will reunite the fellows from the 2006 NSF/AILDI partnership in language documentation. Second, ten new fellows will be invited to AILDI for this summer's workshop as participants in a course to build more capacity in language documentation through the month-long training opportunity AILDI offers every summer. Third, the workshop also will include presenters who have been lead PIs on DEL projects involving Indigenous languages. The over-riding goal of this workshop is to gain an Indigenous perspective on language documentation and to better understand its place in relation to community goals of revitalization.",
