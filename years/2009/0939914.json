 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel funding to increase US participation in the\r\nhalf-year program on Stochastic Processes in Communication Sciences at the\r\nIsaac Newton Institute at Cambridge University, January 11 through July\r\n2, 2010. The program aims at the exposition of the latest developments in\r\nmathematical sciences that sit at the boundary between the disciplines of\r\nstochastics and communications. The program will bring together experts\r\nfrom the mathematics, probability, engineering, and computer science communities, to advance the field and identify important research directions. Up\r\nto twenty Visiting Fellows will be in residence at any time through the period\r\nof the program, and additional Program Participants will be invited for\r\nshorter periods. Four transversal workshops, a satellite workshop for young\r\nresearchers and several shorter events are being organized, the primary ones\r\nbeing: \r\n(1) New topics at the interface between probability and communications\r\n(11 - 15 January 2010); \r\n(2) Stochastic Networks (22 - 26 March 2010);\r\n(3) Spatial Networks (6 - 9 April 2010); \r\n(4) Satellite meeting for young researchers\r\n(At ICMS, Edinburgh, 7 - 11 June 2010); \r\n(5) Statistics of Networks\r\n(21 - 25 June 2010).\r\nThe NSF funding will be used to facilitate the interaction of young US\r\nresearchers with the top researchers in these areas who will be in residence\r\nat the Newton Institute during this program, by supporting the travel of\r\njunior researchers (graduate students, post-docs, and faculty members at\r\nmost seven years beyond Ph. D.), woman researchers and researchers from\r\nunderrepresented minorities.\r\n",
