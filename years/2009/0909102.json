Together with simultaneous infrared spectral image cubes, these data will be used to calculate the wind field at two altitudes, and to retrieve maps of below-cloud CO abundance.  The cloud-level wind fields and below-cloud CO abundance will also be calculated from similar data acquired since 2001.  This award will support simultaneous observations from the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) on the Venus Express spacecraft, and from the ground-based IRTF, during the next two inferior conjunctions.  Wind fields and CO abundances can be determined from the south pole to 60 degrees north, while VIRTIS is observing the clouds.  The combined IRTF and VIRTIS datasets will provide information on Venus' atmospheric motion at levels that have not previously been explored.  Any evidence for return flow, eddies, or Hadley circulation, will give a much better picture of Venus' overall atmospheric circulation, and the variations in CO abundance beneath the clouds may also be correlated with lower cloud convective activity.\r\n\r\nAdvances in planetary exploration suggest that studying other planets can help to understand the limits of Earth's systems.  The atmospheric forecasting of weather and climate on other planets has great public appeal, and this study will inform popular publications, museum presentations, and radio shows, in an effort to expand the public's awareness of other planets.  Teacher training, school presentations, and work with dedicated volunteers at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, all add valuable informal educational efforts to this research project.",
