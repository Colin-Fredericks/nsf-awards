 "awd_abstract_narration": "New York University (NYU) will study children's developing epistemological understandings of evidence (e.g., what is scientific evidence, how does it differ from other kinds of evidence, why is it durable and tentative and what is its role in scientific thinking). NYU seeks to understand the experiences and conditions that facilitate elementary science students understandings of the nature of scientific evidence. This will be accomplished through a design-based research program.The project will take place over a 2-year period to study the possibility of emphasizing more challenging forms of science and epistemological forms of understanding than is typical for U.S. elementary school children. The overarching research goal is: To determine whether elementary school children can learn the nature of scientific evidence when provided a coherent, contiguous course of study in one topic area (development and interactions) sustained over time (a 2-year period; grades 3-4). Along with documenting how and to what extent students can understand the nature of scientific evidence, identification of what teaching-and-learning supports are necessary to achieve this and if not, what are the barriers to learning.\r\n\r\nThe work will be conducted in elementary classroom and laboratory settings at an elementary school in New York City with a diverse student population (grades 3-4). The design-based research model proposed for this study is one of iterative cycles of intentional intervention and analysis. Through this approach NYU will develop and test instructional tools (materials, interactions, experiences) that shape and are shaped by an activity theory model for development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExploratory Project Demonstrates that Elementary School Children can Understand and Use Scientific Evidence\n\n \n\nOutcomes\n\nIn this exploratory research project, researchers at New York University and CUNY Graduate Center developed instructional tools that help children, ages 8-11 (grades 3-4), understand and apply scientific evidence within three weeks of instruction.  By the end of the project test period students: (1) described knowledge claims and evidence as interdependent elements, (2) viewed evidence as a process of science and appreciated that evidence is used for challenging or strengthening a scientific explanation, (3) shifted from using expository texts as their primary source of information to drawing on a variety of sources when making decisions and learning, and (5) were more highly motivated to persevere through difficult text and challenging scientific questions,.\n\n \n\nImpacts/Benefits\n\nWhen students studied their own answers and the answers of others to questions such as: \"What do we know about ____?\", \"How did we come to know that about _____?\", \"Why do we believe _____ is true?\" and \"If we had to prove _____ what would we do?\" they began to understand what scientific evidence is used for, the practices governing the production of scientific evidence, and how to evaluate evidence.  This research demonstrates that children are capable of learning the nature of scientific evidence when provided with explicit and interesting, but challenging school science experiences.  Learning about scientific evidence will provide students with a foundation for future learning in mathematics and science.  Students who develop an analytical worldview may be more likely to pursue coursework, and possibly careers, in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n\n \n\nBackground/Explanation\n\nCurrent elementary curricula that use expository text and hands-on demonstrations provide information and facts, but typically fail to provoke the following essential questions during science instruction:  How did someone figure this out?  What is the evidence for this claim?  Why do you need evidence?  How do we resolve these apparently conflicting statements?  The goal of this study was to identify whether and how elementary school students formulate answers to these questions when provided with carefully designed instructional tools. \n\n \n\nThe research team worked with 12 teachers and approximately 160 3rd and 4th grade students for two years to develop and test five teaching units designed to introduce students to the meaning and purpose of scientific evidence.  The first unit they designed (What is Knowledge?) is a unit, intended for all ages, that introduces the concepts of claim and evidence within the context of studying knowledge and how facts, claims and inferences are generated.  This was followed by one of four content-area units designed to provide students with opportunities to use and evaluate evidence.  Each unit features a problem for which a scientific community of researchers is still investigating and debating answers. \n\n \n\nScience of Sound (tested in 3rd grade) applies a historical approach to learning how we came to know what we know about sound and a student exploration of current research in an area of the physics of sound.\n\n \n\nThe Debate of the 2,000-year old seed and the Challenge of Storing Seeds (tested in 3rd grade) includes experiments and investigations about seed longevity and contemporary seed banking projects. \n\n \n\nContemporary Questions in Science (tested in 4th grade) in this research and conference discussion format, students present and discuss new discoveries and open questions reported in \"AAAS EurekAlert\" and similar science news outlets for kids. \n\n \n\nPollination Crisis!  The Missing Honeybee Mystery (tested in 4th grade) includes an in depth study of the research being conducted to determine the cause of Colony Collapse Disorder, which is affecting U.S. honeybees and commercial honeybee populations..."
