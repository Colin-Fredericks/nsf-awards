Support will be provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for main speakers. It is understood that much of the funding will be directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain senior participants will be funded as well.\r\n\r\nThe program will feature four speakers, each to deliver three lectures, and several contributed talks. The principal objective of this school is to introduce young mathematicians to the field, as well as to provide a forum for presentation of the current state of the art of the theory. The organizers intend to actively involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and mathematicians from other under-represented groups.  Several graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.",
