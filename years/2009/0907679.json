The new surface analytic methods will make use of the gamma-ray signals arising from the annihilation of positrons (the antimatter equivalent of the electron) with electrons in atoms in the topmost atomic layer of the materials studies.  Because the gamma-rays can easily penetrate through gases and solids it will be possible to probe chemical interactions at both external and internal surfaces of porous materials, rough technical surfaces, and granular materials.  Experiments carried out using the new spectroscopies combined with theoretical modeling of positron annihilation processes can be expected to yield critical new knowledge about the interaction of atoms and molecules with surfaces that cannot be obtained using other methods and that will have broad scientific and industrial impact.  This project will provide extensive opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to design, build and implement new experimental and theoretical resources and to employ these resources in cutting edge research giving them invaluable research training in areas of great technological and scientific importance.  This award receives support from the Division of Materials Research, the Division of Chemistry, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, and Environmental Transport Systems.\r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThis project will employ experiments utilizing a beam of low energy positrons in combination with first principles calculations in studies aimed at understanding fundamental interactions of positrons with surfaces and at the development of new methods for surface analysis using element specific information obtained from annihilation gamma spectra.  The new spectroscopies will yield surface specific chemical information with top atomic layer specificity.  The penetrating nature of the gamma rays will make it possible to probe internal surfaces in porous materials, rough technical surfaces, and granular materials.  The new spectroscopies will be combined with first principles theoretical modeling of annihilation probabilities on nano-structured surfaces to study important questions in catalysis and photo-catalysis including charge transfer at the surface of nanostructures and the nature of active sites in catalytic and photo-catalytic systems.  This project is anticipated to lead to the development of important new in-situ methods of surface analysis and to yield critical new knowledge about the interaction of atoms and molecules with surfaces.  The project will provide training for Ph.D. and undergraduate students at the forefront of research in surface and interface science.

In PAES, the core-holes necessary for Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) are created by the annihilation of positrons with core electrons and not by impact-ionization (as in conventional Auger methods).  Our studies have demonstrated that this unique method of initiating the Auger process allows PAES to selectively probe the topmost atomic layer due to the trapping of positrons in an image potential well at the surface before annihilation.  Further, we have demonstrated that PAES can yield Auger spectra that are free of the large secondary electron background that complicates conventional Auger spectroscopy while delivering an extremely low energy dose to the sample.\nIc) Highlights of Research Activity \nFirst demonstration of Auger-mediated sticking of positrons to surfaces: Our measurements provided the first experimental demonstration of an Auger-mediated sticking mechanism of positrons to surfaces. We showed that this mechanism, whereby a positron makes a direct transitions from a positive energy scattering state to a bound surface state, makes it possible to implant positrons directly into bound surface states with very high efficiency at energies below the thresholds for impact induced secondary electron emission and beam induced damage.  The energy associated with the positron transition from an unbound scattering state to a surface-bound image potential state is coupled to a valence electron which may then have sufficient energy to leave the surface. Due to its similarities to the Auger transition in solids, this process has been termed as Auger mediated sticking (AMS). We further demonstrated that it was possible to use this very low energy sticking mechanism to obtain positron annihilation induced Auger spectra characteristic of the top-most atomic layer that were completely free of secondary electron background. This result has important implications in that it showed that very low energy beams of positrons (of order 1 eV or below) can be effectively used to obtain unique information regarding the surfaces of fragile nanosystems. These measurements also demonstrate the possibility of greatly reducing the beam induced surface damage associated with Auger analysis by using incident positron energies below the threshold of chemical bond breaking\nPredominance of multi-electron processes contributing to the intrinsic spectra of low-energy Auger transitions in Cu, Ag, and Au: We applied the Auger mediated sticking technique (discussed above) to efficiently excite Auger transitions by trapping positrons directly into the image potential  state at Cu, Ag, and Au surfaces using a low energy positron beam (&sim;1.5 eV).  The beam energy was kept below the threshold for secondary electron emission allowing for the measurement of the spectra stemming exclusively from electrons emitted as a direct result of the Auger transition itself (CVV) and electrons emitted via intrinsic loss processes (e.g., C-VVV transitions, etc.) (C, core; V, valence). Additionally, such PAES spectra are free of post-collision interaction effects as the initial core electron is annihilated to initiate the Auger process  The spectrum (see figure) indicates that there is an intense low energy tail (LET) associated with the Auger peak that extends all the way to 0 eV. The measurements reveal that integrated intensity of the LET in Cu(100) and Ag(100) were 6 and 2 times larger than that of the Auger peak itself. It has been proposed that th..."
