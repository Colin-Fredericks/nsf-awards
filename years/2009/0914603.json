 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collaborative team develops and implements computationally of a Bayesian\r\nformulation of syndromic surveillance targeted at early detection of disease\r\noutbreaks. The research spans statistical theory and methodology, as well as\r\nissues of algorithms and computational science. Conditional autoregressive\r\nmodels, or CAR models, form the basis of the formulation, in order to\r\naccommodate spatial as well as temporal effects. The principal challenges are\r\nscalability (7,500 major U.S. hospitals are linked into the reporting\r\nnetwork), multivariate reports, complex dependence structure in the data, low\r\ndata quality, and incorporation of regional and other covariates. The unifying\r\ntheme is principled calculation of uncertainties.\r\n\r\nThe research is framed by an application of national significance. There is\r\nenormous social and economic benefit from early discovery of disease. The\r\nstakes are immense: the US Office of Technology Assessment estimates that a\r\nrelease of 100 KG of anthrax spores upwind of Washington, DC would, if not\r\ndetected rapidly, lead to as many as three million deaths and a trillion\r\ndollars of economic losses. The research produces actionable, easily\r\ninterpretable information that supports decision makers: a clear statement of\r\nthe probability that a particular disease is present somewhere in the US, or\r\npresent in a particular city, together with the associated uncertainty.\r\nFalse alarm rates are controlled, making them commensurate with resources\r\navailable for post-signal investigation and taking into account\r\nconsequences such as the psychological and financial impacts of a false alarm.",
