This project will emphasize the STEM areas of genetics and neuroscience, as well as development of skills in conducting scientific research, scientific reasoning, and using information and communication technology. The project builds on a previous project, which involved high school students conducting a research study on smoking behavior. That study collected genetic and environmental data from 300 adult smokers and nonsmokers and entered them into a smoking behavior database. In this study students will use the database to answer their own research questions about factors that affect smoking behavior.\r\n\r\nThe project is expected to test a model of how to design a curriculum so that students can effectively conduct research using databases. Their study examines the effects of this research experience on how students think about scientific research, student learning of STEM knowledge, and student interest in STEM learning and careers.",
