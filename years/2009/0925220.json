 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a fabrication technique for producing complicated gradient-index electromagnetic components in the millimeter-wave and terahertz spectral bands. The approach is to modify existing rapid-prototyping hardware and fabrication polymers to yield a system capable of producing arbitrary 3D index profiles via an effective-medium approach. The ability to produce such profiles in these spectral bands will enable new component designs of significant elegance and utility. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This research explores how effective-medium approaches can be combined with rapid-prototyping to fabricate gradient-index electromagnetic structures. Novel prototyping materials, design strategies, and gradient-index components will also be developed in this project. This effort will contribute to the understanding and engineering of these structures and provide new ways of thinking about these components, design strategies, and fabrication methods. In addition, it will lay the groundwork for further research into fabrication of more complicated electromagnetic components in these spectral bands.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The development of a practical fabrication method for 3D components in the millimeter-wave and terahertz bands will impact many applications across the sciences and engineering---including medical imaging, security screening, astronomy, manufacturing and process control, as well as a host of communications and radar applications. The results from this research will be incorporated in a number of outreach activities including traditional academic courses, seminars for the academic and industrial communities, multidisciplinary design projects for undergraduates, and enrichment activities for at-risk students from diverse backgrounds.",
