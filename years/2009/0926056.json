 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\"\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to fill the technological \"gap\" at the THz spectral region, by developing the first generation of THz graphene-based photodetectors with exceptional sensitivity, dynamic range, response rate and non-cryogenic operating temperatures. The approach is based on monitoring conductance change induced by THz radiation in graphene in quantum Hall states, and/or in double quantum dot single electron transistors. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis research exploits graphene's exceptional electronic mobility, long ballistic length and unique relativistic band structure, which could enable new detectors of THz radiation. Graphene THz detectors will be explored as functions of bias, device geometry, temperature, charge carrier density and magnetic field, for evaluation of crucial device parameters such as operating temperatures, selectivity, tunability, sensitivity, and noise levels. The long-term goal of this research is the development of THz imaging systems at non-cryogenic temperatures.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nSuccessful implementation of this research program will provide significant advancement to fill the technology \"gap\" at the THz region, which has vast application potential ranging from semiconductor industry, biomedical research, space exploration to tools for study of fundamental processes in materials. The program also provides an ideal platform to integrate physics education and outreach with research efforts, by involving high school, undergraduate and graduate students, by encouraging participation of women and underrepresented minority students, and by outreach to local communities with ethnically diverse populations.",
