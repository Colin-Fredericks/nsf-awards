 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ad hoc workflows are everywhere in service industry, scientific\r\nresearch, as well as daily life, such as workflows of customer\r\nservice, trouble shooting, information search, etc.  Optimizing ad\r\nhoc workflows thus has significant benefits to the society.\r\nCurrently the execution of ad hoc workflows is based on human\r\ndecisions, where misinterpretation, inexperience, and ineffective\r\nprocessing are not uncommon, leading to operation inefficiency.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to design and develop\r\nfundamental models, concepts, and algorithms to mine and optimize ad\r\nhoc workflows. The project includes novel research on the following\r\nkey areas: (1) Network Modeling and Structure Mining. A network model\r\nis built that statistically captures the execution characteristics\r\nof ad hoc workflows, and is optimized to improve the execution of\r\nnew workflows with respect to different optimization objectives.\r\n(2) Workflow Artifact Mining.  The network model built on workflow\r\nexecutions is then extended with workflow artifact mining to realize\r\nan optimization system that is able to take advantage of both\r\nexecutions and text contents. (3) Role Discovery and Relation\r\nAssessment. A computational framework is built to analyze the roles\r\nand relationships of agents involved in ad hoc workflow executions\r\nin order to further optimize workflows.\r\n\r\nAdvances from this project include models to represent ad hoc\r\nworkflows, algorithms for mining hidden collaborative models, and\r\ntechniques that optimize ad hoc workflow processing.  The project\r\nbridges two emerging research areas: service science and network\r\nscience, and enriches the principles and technologies of data mining.\r\nIt also enhances research infrastructure through the collaboration of\r\nteam members from different areas (data mining, database, and\r\nnetwork). This research is tightly integrated with education through\r\nstudent mentoring and curriculum development. \r\n\r\nPublications, software and course materials that arise\r\nfrom this project will be disseminated on the project website:\r\nURL: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~xyan/smartflow.htm",
