 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Joseph A. Schmidt of the University of Toledo to examine recently discovered palladium 3-iminophosphine (3IP) catalysts for the synthesis of biologically-important molecules such as indoles, epithilone analogues, and glycosyl ureas via more efficient pathways.  These targets have particular relevance for diabetes and cancer treatments.  Catalytic coupling reactions will be screened and optimized to determine the breadth of the reactions amenable to catalysis and the hydroamination of phenylacetylene and isoprene have been chosen as model reactions to identify the unique, selective, and highly reactive catalytic mechanism.  High school students participating in the American Chemical Society's Project SEED conduct research in Professor Schmidt's laboratory.   These and other students are recruited from the Latino Youth Summit (for grades 6-12).  Professor Schmidt has also introduced a hands-on laboratory component to the highly successful Saturday Morning Science Program at the University of Toledo.  This program invites teachers, parents and students of all ages and backgrounds to participate in chemistry experiments.\r\n",
