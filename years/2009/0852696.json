 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microdialysis, which is used for brain recording technique, requires the analysis of neurochemical molecules. The micro-fluidics neurochemical analyzer that will be developed will enhance brain and spinal cord recordings with microdialysis by rapidly quantifying multiple neurochemicals with greatly reduced cost and complexity. The instrument, after optimization, is expected to measure neurochemicals such as glutamate, choline, acetylcholine, GABA, glucose and lactate in samples collected from the brain and spinal cord. The resulting inline detectors, coupled to a modern computer-instrument, are expected to have a time resolution of one measurement per second, detecting biologically-relevant levels of neurochemicals. The new analyzer will significantly impact neurosciences, where large numbers of scientists are limited in their use of microdialysis to study the temporal properties of neurotransmission in the brain by the current analytical methodology: A simple literature search yields more than 12,000 articles identified by the term brain microdialysis. The new instrument will have increased time resolution, enhanced sensitivity, rapid sample throughput and lower cost of operation and utilization than current equipment. All of these factors will contribute to an instrument that will be widely adopted to accelerate the efforts of biological researchers and clinicians. Demonstrations related to chemical recordings will be used in several outreach programs for K-12 educational ventures in Kentucky.  For more information please contact the PI.",
