The apparatus will also be adapted to allow for observation of in situ p-wave velocities and resistivity in sample materials.  The design will allow for long term (1-6 months) high P/T samples runs so as to simulate in situ conditions representative of the shallow crust. The equipment will be used to examine the evolution of deformation, pore fluid pressures, deformability, and chemically assisted compaction and micro-fracturing in a variety of rock samples in order to advance understanding of the evolution of basin rocks, fault gouges, proppants, caprocks and natural fractures in natural and engineered systems.   The system will be unique in Penn State?s Energy Institute PSU and will complement other NSF-funded rock deformation experimental facilities in the Department of Geosciences and elsewhere in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.  Research applications described include several of high intellectual merit and broader societal impact including understanding the evolution of fluid transport (including liquid CO2 and radionuclide bearing fluids) and chemistry in fractured and granular media.  The equipment to purchased be purchased is made in the U.S.A.\r\n\r\n",
