 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ever since the first FORmula TRANslator, compilers have purported to\r\ntake an algorithm, formulated in human terms, and compile it to an\r\nefficient executable.  Practice clearly does not live up to this\r\nideal, as programming languages force execution-oriented design\r\ndecisions on the programmer, and compiler imperfections necessitate\r\nfurther manual optimizations.  While the ordinary programmer can\r\nignore this problem by using libraries, the library developer cannot.\r\nThe problem appears more desperate now than ever, since it is not\r\nknown what form future architectures will take, combined with a trend\r\ntowards pushing complexity away from the architecture (for example to\r\nlower power consumption) and onto the program and compiler.\r\n\r\nThe FLAME project already allows linear algebra libraries to be\r\ndeveloped and coded at a high level of abstraction that better\r\ncaptures the underlying algorithms.  It has already been shown that\r\nthese technique greatly simplify the porting of libraries to different\r\nplatforms ranging from conventional sequential computers to exotic\r\nmultiGPU accelerators.  However, the APIs for coding at a high level\r\nof abstraction incur a considerable performance penalty for operations\r\nthat in each step perform relatively little computation (e.g., level-2\r\nBLAS operations and ``unblocked'' algorithms).  As a result, a\r\nnontrivial part of libflame, the library that has resulted from the\r\nproject, still requires coding at a low level.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop a source-to-source translator will take\r\nalgorithms expressed at a high level of abstraction and will transform\r\nthese into a range of representations, including high-performance\r\nlow-level code.  This will overcome the final legitimate objection to\r\nthe FLAME methodology since coding at a high level of abstraction will\r\nno longer carry a performance penalty.  The approach will be\r\ngeneralized so that code transformations that an expert applies by\r\nhand in order to target different platforms will be made mechanical.\r\nTogether, these represent a major departure from traditional\r\napproaches to library development.\r\n\r\n",
