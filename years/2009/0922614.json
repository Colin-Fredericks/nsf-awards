 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to acquire a nanolithography instrument, which will significantly improve the research capabilities at Iowa State and the University of Iowa in the fields of microelectronics, photonics and biology. The nanolithography instrument is an e-Line system, which is capable of 20 nm accuracy and can be used to make nano patterns over large areas. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The instrument allows for precise patterning at the nanoscale of electronic, photonic and biological materials and devices. It will allow fabrication of photonic crystal structures for improving the efficiency of solar cells. The instrument will be used for defining nanochannels for ordered regrowth of neurons and stem cells and for defining channels that will be utilized for studying the influence of various pesticides on mobility of nematodes, which are a major corn pest. The instrument will also be used  to produce the patterns needed for negative index materials for advanced photonic devices such as waveguides and light valves. \r\n\r\nBroad impacts: The technological impact of the research will be significant in many varied fields such as solar energy conversion, stem cell development, photonic devices and more efficient lighting. There will be significant integration of research and teaching through development of new lab courses and introduction of new lab modules in existing courses. Women and minority students at the graduate and undergraduate levels will be involved in the various research projects and will also benefit from the new lab classes that will be developed. \r\n",
