ICDM is the world's premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and systems, and applications, as well as related areas such as data management, machine learning and bioinformatics. The conference proceedings are published by IEEE.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the Web, the Internet, and data intensive technologies such as Sensor Networks and Bioinformatics, ICDM seeks to continuously advance the state-of-the-art in data mining as an extremely important area in Information Technology. The total number of ICDM participants in the past has been in excess of 300, with a majority of the participants from the U.S., then Europe and Asia. This travel support is expected to provide scholarships to 15 U.S.-based graduate student participants to partially defray travel costs for the qualified student participants. An additional aim is to broaden participation in computer science among the underrepresented students. A strong representation of U.S. junior researchers at the ICDM 2009 is useful in fostering U.S. competitiveness in this important area.\r\n",
