 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the incidence of infectious diseases in both wildlife and human populations continues to rise, studies addressing the ecology of disease are becoming more important.  Too often, though, our understanding of pathogens and parasites in natural systems develops from studies abstracted from the complex ecological communities in which disease dynamics actually play out.  Recent evidence suggests that the presence/absence and relative abundance of different species in the biological community can substantially influence the outcome of host-parasite interactions.  However, changing the composition of the community can result in either an increase or decrease in disease risk, and the mechanisms responsible for these outcomes have been experimentally investigated in very few systems.  This research will experimentally investigate the role of community composition in modulating disease outcomes in a complex host-parasite system composed of snails, amphibians, and a trematode parasite.  A series of experiments will address how infection of parasite hosts is influenced by changes in the composition and relative abundance of multiple hosts, multiple parasite infectious stages and non-host competitors.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will establish a collaborative research program between the laboratories of the PIs at Virginia Tech and Radford University (a predominately undergraduate institution 25 km from Virginia Tech) that will provide broader educational experiences for the students at both institutions.  The partnership between Virginia Tech and Radford University includes collaborative research projects, joint laboratory meetings, and support of graduate students at Virginia Tech and undergraduate student research at both universities. In addition, a teaching module on host-parasite interactions based on the research results will be developed for Ecology and Parasitology courses at Radford University and will be disseminated to the broader teaching community.\r\n",

Ecologists now believe that the diversity and relative abundance of different host species in a region plays a major role in controlling pathogen transmission in nature.  A prominent theory in this field is called the \"dilution effect\", where communities with more host species (often including hosts that aren't as effective at transmitting the pathogen) often have reduced pathogen transmission compared to communities with just a few host species.  The dilution effect is an important idea because of current global losses in biodiversity, and the potential for those losses to result in increases in pathogen transmission and disease risk.  We studied these questions relating to the role of community context in parasite transmission in pond systems, namely with trematode parasites and their amphibian and snail hosts, though the concepts and results could apply to many wildlife and human diseases.\n\nOur results suggest that variation in parasite infection can be explained by variation in host competency and host community assembly in terms of host density, but interestingly in a different way than predicted by the prominent dilution effect theory.
