 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quest, produced by KQED, is a multimedia initiative designed to raise the profile of STEM issues throughout the Northern California region and activate citizens to discuss and investigate them.  Led by KQED, Quest is created and maintained by an active consortium of 16 participating informal science education organizations.  Based on the successful Quest model, KQED will build on its prior collaborative work to develop regional partnerships with other public broadcasting stations and community-based organizations around the country, making possible a new and innovative partnership in science media production and informal science education.  This grant will support a) a growing collaborative of science centers, museums, research institutes, and community-based organizations for editorial development, education outreach, and content creation; b) the production of at least 10 hours of television, weekly radio science news reports, and a dynamic online website that supports and extends the broadcast material; and c) educational resources and professional development workshops.  \r\n\r\nSTEM content will encompass research drawn from the physical sciences, life sciences, and earth sciences.  Most of the stories will also incorporate content about the technology and engineering used to support scientific endeavors.  The KQED Educational Network (EdNet) will administer the community and educational outreach initiatives, including creating viewer/listener guides, developing and delivering workshops, and providing information built around Quest media.  Project collaborators include the Bay Institute, California Academy of Sciences, Chabot Space and Science Center, East Bay Regional Park District, Exploratorium, Girl Scouts, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Lawrence Hall of Science, Museum of Paleontology, Oakland Zoo, and The Tech Museum of Innovation.  In expanding the model to regional hubs, Quest will also involve the Coalition for Public Understanding of Science (COPUS), the Encyclopedia of Life, and an array of peer public broadcasting organizations.\r\n\r\nThis project offers a useful and exciting model for public television and radio stations nationally in building community collaborations that advance informal science education.  The detailed and informed ways in which the team works with its community partners via multiple platforms are innovative.  This proposal builds on prior work in Northern California to explore additional regional partnerships with other public broadcasting stations and community-based organizations, making possible a unique partnership in science media production and informal science education. This project extends reach by developing up to ten regional \"hubs\" across the country.  Evaluation will be conducted by Rockman et al.",
