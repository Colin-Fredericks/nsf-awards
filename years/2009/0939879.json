Products of such a discharge include ozone, radicals, electrons, hydrogen peroxide, and UV emission. In water, because these products are strongly antiseptic, they should automatically treat the water, opening the possibility of plasma-based, point-of use water treatment for application in underdeveloped countries where water-borne diseases account for 80% of the deaths of children. In addition, charged products from the process would also lead to coagulation of particulates, making filtering relatively straightforward. This plasma approach would circumvent problems associated with portable filtration and UV systems.\r\n\r\nThe key is to make plasma in gas bubbles in water with an RF field whose frequency is in resonance with the natural oscillation frequency of the bubbles. This resonance would lead to periodic expansions and compressions, during which the electric field inside the bubble would be amplified, thus lowering the electrical breakdown threshold.  The immediate goals of this research are (1) demonstrating and quantifying the conditions necessary to drive the bubble compression, rarefaction, and break-up by Raleigh-Taylor-driven or electric-field-induced stress with a time-varying imposed voltage at the resonance frequency; (2) determining the shape, neutral density and pressure of the bubble over the oscillation period; (3) determining the voltage pulse characteristics (pulse width, voltage magnitude) necessary to initiate the discharge in the oscillating bubble.  If these tasks can be achieved, longer-term goals would be characterizing the bubble plasma evolution over a cycle using time-resolved spectroscopy and assessing the effects of the plasma discharge on oxidation-reduction markers placed in the water. \r\n\r\nThis research will greatly expand our knowledge of the physics of plasma-in-bubble discharges, forming new guideposts for further research and potentially leading to a means for implementation in practical plasma-chemical reactors.  The research will involve graduate and undergraduate students and will aid their education in plasma science and engineering. It also advances broader societal goals of broader representation by engaging researchers from under-represented groups. Finally, the possible water-treatment technology would have favorable societal and technological impacts.  \r\n \r\n",
