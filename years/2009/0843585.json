 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in brain cell energy affect activity throughout the brain, but the exact mechanisms that link brain energy metabolism with brain activity are not well understood.  Nevertheless, the relationship between brain energy and brain activity is central to understanding how brain function is regulated and how metabolism influences ongoing behaviors such as sleep, sensory processing, learning and memory, and cognition.  ATP and its core molecule adenosine provide a unique link between energy and brain activity, and may play a key role in translating changes in cell energy directly to changes in brain activity.  \r\n\r\nThe investigators will test the hypothesis that ATP and adenosine link brain energy to brain activity both at the cellular level and the behavioral level by performing a combination of electrophysiological recordings of brain activity, measurements of ATP and adenosine using an enzyme-based sensor, and behavioral testing.  These experiments will provide new insight into the evolutionarily important relationship between brain energy and brain activity.  In addition, the investigators will mentor undergraduate students as research partners both during the academic year as part of their academic courseload and support them in doing research full-time during the summer.  Undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of this interdisciplinary proposal, participate in weekly laboratory meetings and attend and present research at several local, regional and national conferences.  \r\n\r\nTaken together, this project is an ideal use of both research monies and tax dollars: it offers innovative and important research on the relationship between brain metabolism and brain activity, and provides a comprehensive year-round educational and training environment and individualized mentoring for a diverse set of undergraduate students aimed toward a career in scientific research.  \r\n",
