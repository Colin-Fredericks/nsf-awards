 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT HRD 0929092\r\n\r\nSouthern University at New Orleans (SUNO) is strengthening undergraduate recruitment and retention activities in the STEM disciplines. Their goals are being achieved through several interrelated activities such as: (1) improving the quality of incoming high school students through Summer Enrichment Program (SEP), Early Career Awareness, Science Fair and Algebra tutorials, (2) developing high school mathematics and science teachers through content enhancement workshops, Summer Enrichment Program and software and technology training, (3) improving the quality of undergraduates through scholarships, learning center support, research mentoring, placement in summer internships, and GRE preparation, (4) implementing an aggressive faculty development through peer mentoring, seed grant award for research development, and sponsorship to HBCU research consortium workshops, and (5) enhancing curriculum through infusion of algebra to science learning, instituting Computer Aided Learning (CAI) software in mathematics and science courses, and developing an environmental awareness elective for all majors. \r\n\r\nThe expected project outcomes include: (1) increased STEM graduation; (2) increased faculty participation in research, publications, and grants writing; (3) enhanced quality of undergraduate research experiences; (4) strengthened partnerships with academic institutions and research labs; (5) increased use of technology in teaching and research in all STEM disciplines; and (6) increased numbers of STEM students completing the path from high school through college to graduate school. This proposal builds on the successes of the previous HBCU-UP grant, which resulted in significantly increasing student research and summer internships, enrollment in graduate schools, and graduation rate in STEM disciplines. The project team anticipates that this project will enable SUNO to regain some of the ground lost in STEM disciplines due to the impact of hurricane Katrina.\r\n\r\nProject leadership includes Dr. Joe Omojola, Professor of Mathematics and Physics, who was honored with the distinguished 2006 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM), given in an award ceremony at the White House.\r\n",

The proposed project meets the institutional planning priorities which are congruent with National Science Foundation&rsquo;s (NSF) objectives of increasing long-range improvement in STEM areas at predominantly minority institutions and increasing the flow of under-represented ethnic minorities, particularly minority women, into scientific careers. This was accomplished and documented by empirical data from the following interrelated outcomes: (1) improved the quality of incoming high school students through<br />summer enrichment programs (SEP), (2) improved the quality of STEM<br />undergraduates through academic scholarships and Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE), learning center support, research mentoring, placement in summer internships in REU programs and at collaborative institutions and research laboratories, and GRE preparation, (3) implemented an aggressive faculty development through peer mentoring, seed grant award for research development, and sponsorship to HBCU research consortium activities for STEM faculty of Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) under the umbrella of the Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science and Engineering (INCREASE) <a href=\"https://www.bnl.gov/education/program.asp?q=125\">https://www.bnl.gov/education/program.asp?q=125</a>&nbsp;which enabled several faculty to participate in workshops and trainings at the Center for Nanotechnology (CFN) and National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and (4) enhanced the STEM curriculum in the Department of Natural Sciences through emphasis of algebra in STEM courses, and developed and implemented an environmental awareness elective for all majors. E<sup>3</sup>MaS activities for the lifetime of the program are summarized in figures 1 &ndash; 5. One of the limitations in proposed<br />program activities was the lack of expected improved quality of high school<br />mathematics and science teachers through content enhancement workshops, summer program, and software and technology training due to limited response from local schools. Overall, E<sup>3</sup>MaS is one of the signature programs at Southern University at New Orleans in impact, magnitude, scope, and reach especially for STEM students, faculty, programs, and infrastructure. It significantly enriched and enhanced programs in mathematics and sciences.
