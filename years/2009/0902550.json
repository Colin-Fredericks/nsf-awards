Friedman and S. Simpson, and topos theory. NSF support is provided for some of the expenses of the speakers and attendees, in particular of the graduate students.\r\n\r\nVia the meetings sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains the vitality of the field of mathematical logic. Special emphasis is placed on enhancing the participation of younger researchers and members of traditionally underrepresented groups, especially women. This is done by providing an intellectual forum in which all interested persons are invited to contribute and in which there are lectures on current topics of research.\r\n\r\n",
