 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: The goal of this project is to develop systematic surface modification strategies to improve the interrelated issues of morphology, energetics, and charge transport across organic/inorganic interfaces. The approach is based on difunctional molecular layers. One end is designed for surface attachment while the other end imparts a special chemical or electronic characteristic to the modified interface. Research will be directed toward developing surface molecular layers on semiconducting oxides, with a special emphasis on ZnO/polymer blends. The overall focus of the work is on identifying design rules that could be applied to a broader class of oxide interfaces and organic constituents, which would simplify future development of organic/inorganic composites. Advanced optical, structural, surface, and electronic characterization techniques will be applied to these systems to develop an understanding of the properties of the specific functionalized surfaces under study, and define a systematic approach to uncovering the interfacial morphological and electronic properties of organic/inorganic hybrid materials. \r\nNon-Technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities for potential next generation electronic/photonic devices. Organic/inorganic composites have the potential for creating electronic materials with new functionality in energy efficiency, biological, medical, and environmental applications. This project will accelerate the development of these materials by providing fundamental understanding of one of the key issues limiting performance. The proposed project directly integrates research with education. Students and faculty will work with an existing outreach program at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) aimed at Denver elementary and middle schools with large populations of underrepresented groups. Modules, which connect basic science concepts to the impact that advanced materials are having on the world, will be introduced into these schools. Approaches developed during the project will also be included in a teacher recertification program taught by one of the Co-PIs. The project includes significant undergraduate research involvement through summer REU opportunities and an international student exchange with NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology). All of the students will work on a daily basis as part of an integrated team with their advisors, collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) which is located in close proximity to CSM, with scientists at NTNU, and with colleagues at the University of Arizona. A focus on diversity, communication skills, and developing skills for work in a team environment are all integral parts of the proposed program. This project is co-funded by the DMR Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, and the DMR Electronic and Photonic Materials program. \r\n",
