In this\r\nproject the investigators include students who are not from the\r\nparticipating institutions.  The program is geared toward\r\ngraduate students in the mathematical sciences.  The 2009 summer\r\nprogram on the mathematics of inverse problems covers three\r\ndifferent themes: inverse problems for hyperbolic partial\r\ndifferential equations, inverse scattering in the frequency\r\ndomain, and variational techniques for inverse problems.  The\r\nprogram covers the techniques used to tackle problems at the\r\ncutting edge of mathematical research in each of these areas. \r\nWeek-long lectures and problem-solving sessions are presented in\r\nan informal environment by world leaders in each of these areas\r\n-- William Symes (inverse problems for waves), John Sylvester\r\n(inverse scattering), and Jonathan Borwein (variational\r\nanalysis).  Two of the three lecture series (inverse scattering\r\nand variational techniques) are under contract to appear as\r\nseparate chapters in a book to be published by Springer in 2010. \r\n\r\n     Inverse problems are everywhere, from determining the causes\r\nof global warming, to finding oil and natural gas under the\r\nearth's surface, to diagnosing diseases with medical imaging. \r\nThe basic idea of an inverse problem is simple:  given an\r\nobservation, determine the cause.  Unfortunately, most inverse\r\nproblems are not easily solved: the model for the observation is\r\noften incomplete or incorrect, and, even if the model is a\r\nperfect match to the truth, it may be impossible to accurately\r\ndetermine the cause from an observation (the curse of so-called\r\n\"ill-posedness\").  The last 20 years has seen a dramatic shift in\r\nthe mathematics of inverse problems and the capabilities for\r\nsolving them, initiated largely by improvements in computing\r\npower and the concurrent evolution of what is often called\r\n\"experimental mathematics.\"  Never before have new theoretical\r\ntools been able to be tested with such immediacy and practical\r\nimport.  This IMA/PI Summer School on the Mathematics of Inverse\r\nProblems aims at preparing future mathematicians for research in\r\nthis growing and increasingly vital field.  The schools bring\r\nstudents together with outstanding researchers in an intensive\r\nsetting that is intended to lead students from the more familiar\r\ncourse-oriented problem solving skills to the frontiers of\r\nmathematical research.  Students gain experience not only in\r\nattacking problems on advanced and research-grade topics, but\r\nalso in working collaboratively with people from different\r\nbackgrounds.  The 2009 program has received 51 applications from\r\na diverse group of individuals, 29 from participating IMA\r\ninstitutions and 22 from non-IMA institutions.  This project\r\nsupports students from non-IMA affiliated institutions. \r\n",
