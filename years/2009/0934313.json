The multi-university center is headquartered at the Georgia Institute of Technology, with an affiliate group at the Ohio State University.  CERCS was established in 2001. The focus of the CERCS faculty at Georgia Institute of Technology is on the core systems of technologies underlying large scale computing systems-technology creation.  \r\n\r\nCERCS will continue to entertain a large number and variety of projects, driven by faculty interests, industry connection and center capabilities.  Three key domains of interest to CERCS are Enterprise Systems, Scientific Computing, and Embedded Systems; and, underlying and uniting these domains are four significant research thrusts. CERCS is committed to fostering interdisciplinary research, establishing a culture of experimental research reaching out to local and national industry, and to encourage participation and contribute to the regional and national economies through the availability of talent and emerging technologies.   \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of CERCS is on the application of the research results on the IT producer and consumer companies.  CERCS plans to stimulate and ensure practical research with broad practical impact by collaborating with industry partners.  Work in energy management, multicore software stack, and applications to scientific computing, enterprise computing, and mobile computing will all benefit society by reducing costs of computing and allowing society to efficiently address larger computing problems than currently possible.  CERCS also plans to create broad student community for research and education activities and to educate qualified students to join the software/computing industry.  \r\n",
