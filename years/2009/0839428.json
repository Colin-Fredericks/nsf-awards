 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research project would demonstrate proof of principle for the production of ultra capacitors with energy densities competitive with lithium ion batteries, but that can be charged in seconds to minutes as opposed to hours or days. These ultra capacitors are based on the development of new, super-high permittivity (30-100,000 epsilon) nanostructured titanate particles that allow for high charge storage along with high dielectric breakdown strength that are arranged in percolative networks in a very low cost polymeric film. More specifically, the project goal will be to demonstrate multilayer capacitor prototypes having dielectric breakdown strength above 5000 V/mil and effective permittivity above 20,000 (goal is 30,000) at room temperature, and demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating these formulations into capacitor devices using an innovative low cost metallized film production technology. \r\n\r\nThe successful development of high energy ultra capacitors having energy storage densities above 150 J/cc has the potential to revolutionize energy storage and power conversion technologies for backup power supplies, as well as plug-in and hybrid vehicles by greatly reducing the size and cost of energy storage systems. Competing products are flywheel storage, advanced battery chemistries, and electrolytic capacitors, which are all substantially more expensive and have lower performance. The primary current market for film-foil super-capacitors is high peak power electrical applications and includes pulse power supplies (lasers and flash lamps), defibrillators, and high rep rate applications. \r\n",
