Professional development is provided for 40 secondary teachers in Career and Technical Education (CTE), mathematics, and science. Participants and researchers then examine the effectiveness of the modules on the learning and science and technology efficacy of 800 secondary students.\r\n\r\nThe project has five objectives.\r\n1. Increase higher-level technology integration, database use and management, spatial thinking, and web interface skills of teacher participants.\r\n2. Increase teacher participant pedagogical content knowledge in science, data analysis, and spatial thinking skills.\r\n3. Provide an opportunity for teachers to develop and implement their own problem-based teaching modules in their classrooms.\r\n4. Increase data analysis, critical thinking, and spatial thinking skills of students in  grades 9-12.\r\n5. Expose 9-12 grade students to STEM content and careers and encourage students to participate in STEM classes.\r\n\r\nThe project will utilize the facilities of Northern Arizona University, especially the Geospatial Research and Information Laboratory (GRAIL). \r\n\r\nDeliverables include three modules created using the Legacy Cycle (Schwarz and Bransford) on analysis of temperature data. Each of the 40 teachers will create a curriculum module that can be shared. Research on the educational model will be disseminated through professional meetings and journals.\r\n\r\nEvaluation will be carried out by Carol L. Henderson-Dahms of Southwest Evaluation Research. The evaluation team will include NAU graduate students who represent a traditionally underserved population of Native Americans. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to evaluate the objectives of the project. The evaluation will attempt to establish the following.\r\n1. The elements of a high-quality STEM education professional development program;\r\n2. How GIS-based learning affects spatial thinking;\r\n3. The affect that GIS-based learning has on student uses and analysis of database information; and\r\n4. The affect the GIS-based learning has on how students view the integration of science, math and technology and their interest in STEM careers.\r\n",
