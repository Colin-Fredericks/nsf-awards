 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop new oxidative cross coupling reactions for the synthesis of biaryl molecules and will test a mechanistic hypothesis for this novel process.  The primary goal of the work is the development of a model that explains the observed phenomena and can be used to predict the ideal reaction conditions for a given aryl substrate.  Systematic competition and kinetic studies will be used to probe the reaction mechanism, and the information gleaned from these experiments will be used to develop new oxidative coupling reactions.  \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Brenton DeBoef of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Rhode Island.  Professor DeBoef's research efforts are focused on the invention of new chemical reactions that cleave strong carbon-hydrogen bonds and form new carbon-carbon bonds in a single step.  These new processes may streamline the synthesis of high-value molecules such as drugs, herbicides, and dyes for organic light emitting diodes.  Additionally these novel reactions have less environmental impact than many of the existing technologies.  Dr. DeBoef is also developing new research-oriented curricula involving multi-step chemical synthesis and green chemistry.  Undergraduate and graduate students are being trained for careers as synthetic chemists in the global marketplace, and will benefit from the International Chemistry Program that Dr. DeBoef is developing at the University of Rhode Island.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe primary outcomes of this project are the new chemical reactions that were discovered and systematically studied.  Each of the reactions that were developed synthesized carbon&ndash;carbon (C&ndash;C) or carbon&ndash;nitrogen (C&ndash;N) bonds from simple carbon&ndash;hydrogen (C&ndash;H) bonds.  As C&ndash;C and C&ndash;N bonds are the main structural components of virtually all organic compounds, and as all organic compounds contain numerous C&ndash;H bonds, the technology that we have developed has the potential to be widely used for the construction of complex organic structures, such as biomolecules, polymers or dyes.   Moreover, these new reactions represent a greener approach to the synthesis of C&ndash;C and C&ndash;N bonds because they can be synthesized directly in a single step from simple starting materials containing C&ndash;H bonds.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nOne of the most evident broader impacts of this award is the new curriculum that was developed as a key component of this work.  Two new laboratory exercises for a sophomore-level organic chemistry course have been developed and published.  These new experiments have been used to teach the principles of green chemistry to over 500 students at the University of Rhode Island and other institutions.  Additionally, the broader impacts of this work are the nine graduate and six undergraduate students who have been directly trained on these projects and have all matriculated to careers as scientists or science educators.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brenton Deboef"
