 "awd_abstract_narration": "Web applications are prevalent and enable much of today's online\r\nbusiness including banking, shopping, university admissions, and various\r\ngovernmental activities.  However, the quality of such applications is\r\nusually low, and they are increasingly popular targets for attack.  This\r\nproject aims at developing practical testing and analysis mechanisms and\r\ntools to secure web applications. In particular, it focuses on\r\ndeveloping novel, principled techniques to address the following\r\nresearch issues: (1) how to formalize security threats in web\r\napplications; (2) how to provide runtime security for deployed\r\napplications via dynamic monitoring; and (3) how to provide static\r\nsecurity enforcement during application development and testing.\r\n\r\nThe project is interdisciplinary, touching upon a number of requisite\r\nareas including computer security, software engineering, and programming\r\nlanguages. It has the potential to advance knowledge in each of these\r\ndisciplines with novel formulations of security requirements, systems\r\nconcepts, and advanced testing and analysis techniques.  The project\r\nalso has the potential for significant industrial and societal impact.\r\nThrough the proposed research, education, and outreach activities, the\r\nproject will empower web application developers with the knowledge,\r\nmethodologies, and development tools to build secure web\r\napplications. Testing and analysis tools developed in the project will\r\nalso be distributed to other institutions and the industry for teaching,\r\nresearch, and experimental evaluation.",
