 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns the development and analysis of new numerical \r\nmethods for Navier-Stokes equations involving discontinuities,\r\nfree boundaries, moving interfaces, and problems on irregular domains. \r\nThe new methods will be applied to several important applications in\r\nmulti-phase flows, fluid structure interactions with interfaces, fluids, \r\nor solids. In the proposal, augmented immersed interface methods are proposed\r\nto tackle those difficulty problems. The new methods are based on sharp \r\ninterface models (no smearing),  second order and implicit discretization. \r\nThe new methods are proposed to be implemented to simulate several \r\nimportant applications such as the moving contact line problem using one \r\nand two phase flow models; non-extensible interfaces in incompressible flows, \r\nopen-ended interfaces, and moving interfaces with masses. \r\n \r\n\r\nThe projects described in the proposal have wide applications in mathematical \r\nbiology, material science, aerodynamic and mechanical engineering. The \r\nnon-extensible interfaces have been used to model the motion of red blood \r\ncells in the life science. Efficient numerical simulations will have positive \r\nimpact on early detection of illness related to the red-blood cells. The moving\r\ncontact line problem has direct applications in the material science. Efficient \r\nnumerical simulations using computers may avoid expensive experiments. This\r\nis true for other projects in the proposal as well. This proposal will also \r\nhave positive effect on education by attracting under and graduate \r\nstudents to conduct research in this area. Some components of the\r\nprojects will be designed as undergraduate projects. Furthermore, the research \r\nresults can lead to a computer software package that would be useful to the\r\ncomputational science involving free boundary and moving interface, and \r\nproblems defined on complicated domain.\r\n",
