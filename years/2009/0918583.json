The resources are designed to be used by teachers of middle and high school biology, ecology, and environmental science classes. The project will produce three complete curriculum modules. They will include new scientist at work profile videos that will be disseminated online through a web interface that enables teachers to select and customize scaffolding and to address their particular students' needs in the classroom. The program will also develop in-person and online courses at CCNY and AMNH for local New York City public school teachers and teachers nationally to explore their own connection to environmental issues and ecology and to reflect upon the role of scientific inquiry in building understanding of the natural world. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEcology Disrupted is a collaborative project of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and the City College of New York (CCNY) that produced innovative digital curriculum materials for students to work with real scientific research data on environmental issues in a way that leads them to awareness and understanding of ecological principles. \n\nThree curriculum modules were produced.  Two modules, on fragmentation of bighorn sheep populations by highways and water pollution from salting icy winter roads, were built on existing exhibition media produced by AMNH.  All modules, including the third on Chesapeake Bay food webs disrupted by the fishing industry, were based on current published scientific research.  The project team developed data analysis activities that enabled students to work directly with the research data. AMNH produced two new videos that profiled the lead scientists of the bighorn sheep and winter roads modules to show them working in the field and talking about what motivated their interest in their research.  The materials also included teacher guides, worksheets, demonstrations, and other classroom activities.\n\nThe curriculum modules were extensively field tested over the three-year project and continuously updated and refined to incorporate evaluation results and teacher recommendations. About 50 teachers participated in this testing, and also provided valuable formative input on the future web site design.  Project evaluation staff graded student pre-&shy; and post-&shy;assessment responses from the curriculum field testing.  Their analysis, which compared student learning between control and experimental groups, showed that the Ecology Disrupted implementations had a positive and significant impact on student assessment scores.\n\nTo disseminate project outcomes to practitioners, we proposed an innovative approach to online delivery of the curricular resources that would both support teachers' faithful implementation of the published curriculum, while also enabling them to access and repurpose individual elements of the materials and adapt the materials to their students' particular needs.  The AMNH web site, which has high visibility and good reputation among science teachers through outreach and industry recognition, was selected to be the dissemination vehicle for Ecology Disrupted.\n\nAs with the curriculum itself, the dissemination website was developed with valuable input from teachers through focus groups, surveys, and field testing.  A key early design decision, informed by teacher input, was to make certain the materials could be easily discovered, appropriated, and implemented with the digital tools that teachers were already using, rather than require them to learn any new methods or tools.  The result is a digital \"kit of parts\", where all Ecology Disrupted materials are available in multiple file formats that can be accessed and presented directly from the website or downloaded for customization and/or offline use.  The \"parts\" are fine-grained curriculum elements that are organized in the sequence that was tested and proven effective in the classroom, and that can be discovered and appropriated individually so that teachers can adapt the lessons, or even integrate elements into other lessons and curricula. \n\nWebsite usability and effectiveness was evaluated with about 40 teachers, some who were already using the curriculum, and others who were new to Ecology Disrupted.  The final evaluation report confirmed that we had met our design goals for the web site: to make it easy to discover materials, appropriate them, create new materials with them, implement the materials, and share them.  Comments from participating teachers, both experienced and novice users of the curriculum, also attest to the web site\u00c6s success:\n\nIt was really well set up. It was nice to look at the whole thing and decide what I was going to use and what I wasn\u00c6t going to use.\nIt\u00c6s much more easily modifiable. I can ada..."
