 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of\r\n2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nNon-technical explanation:\r\nThe ability to predict the response of crystalline solids to forces that\r\ncause them to change shape, or in other words deform, is important in many\r\nareas including materials engineering, metallurgy and geoscience and has\r\napplications to problems ranging from metals forming to mountain building.\r\n This research project will investigate the deformation behavior of\r\nquartzite, a common quartz-bearing rock, at the temperatures and pressures\r\nrelevant to the earth's interior. We will use a combination of in-situ\r\nsynchrotron x-ray diffraction, computer based simulations and sample\r\nanalysis to study the behavior of specific groups of crystals within the\r\nrock which will improve our understanding of how the behavior of groups of\r\ncrystals within a rock integrate to produce the overall behavior of the\r\nrock.  Our results will be most useful in understanding geological\r\nprocesses such as those that produce mountains or determine where in\r\nEarth's crust, earthquakes occur.  However, because the deformation\r\nmechanisms that allow quartz crystals to deform are the same as those that\r\noperate in metals and ceramics, we anticipate that our results will also\r\nshed light on more general questions that have applications to a range of\r\nengineering problems.  The majority of the funding requested for this\r\nproject will support the education of young scientists including\r\nundergraduate, graduate and post-graduate scholars by supporting them as\r\nthey participate in cutting edge research.\r\n\r\nTechnical explanation:\r\nThis project will use in-situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction from high\r\npressure, high temperature deformation experiments on quartz combined with\r\nelastic plastic self consistent modeling and careful examination of sample\r\nmicrostructures to learn about the distribution of stress between grain\r\npopulations during deformation.  The experiments are designed to allow us\r\nto examine the relative roles of various deformation mechanisms and\r\ngrain-grain interactions in generating the overall rheological behavior of\r\npolycrystalline quartz.  In addition, the combination of microstructural\r\nanalysis with synchrotron diffraction observations will add a great deal\r\nto the understanding and interpretation of diffraction data gathered from\r\nhigh pressure deformation experiments.  Therefore the results from this\r\nstudy will have implications for and applications to deformation studies\r\nof other earth materials made with large volume high pressure apparatus,\r\nas well as ultrahigh pressure deformation studies in the diamond anvil\r\ncell (DAC) that utilize the same type of diffraction data.  The results\r\nwill also have implications for neutron and x-ray diffraction studies of\r\nengineering ceramics and metals.",
