The investigator\r\naddresses fundamental problems arising from the mathematical\r\nanalysis of multiscale geometries of sets, and multiscale\r\ndecompositions of function spaces on such sets.  The complexity\r\nof the geometry of these sets, which are embedded in\r\nhigh-dimensional spaces, are noisy, and often have different\r\ndimensions at different locations, is analyzed at multiple\r\nresolutions.  He develops robust mathematical and statistical\r\nquantitative multiscale methods of analysis, yielding estimators\r\nof intrinsic dimensionality that are extremely robust to noise\r\nand succeed with high probability even for small sample size.  He\r\ndevelops algorithms for multiscale processing of high-dimensional\r\npoint clouds much as is done for low-dimensional functions, by\r\nmeans of a geometric multiscale transform.  He studies and\r\napproximates functions on data by constructing data-driven\r\nmultiscale dictionaries, generalizing approaches familiar in\r\nlow-dimensional Euclidean spaces.  He develops efficient\r\nalgorithms for computing these multiscale decompositions and\r\ndictionary expansions. \r\n\r\n     Many important application problems directly require the\r\nanalysis of high-dimensional data sets, dynamical systems, or\r\nlarge graphs, or they are posed on a framework of\r\nhigh-dimensional data sets, dynamical systems, or large graphs.\r\nSuch problems arise for instance in different disciplines and\r\nreal-world situations where instruments or simulations produce\r\nlarge amounts of data.  The investigator develops novel methods\r\nfor the analysis of high-dimensional data sets and of statistical\r\nmodels with a large number of variables, under the assumption\r\nthat the number of free parameters (which in some sense\r\nrepresents the intrinsic dimensionality or complexity) of the\r\ndata is small compared to that of the ambient space.  He further\r\napplies these methods to algorithms that are able to learn\r\nfunctions on such data from examples, or learn models of complex\r\ndynamical systems (e.g. molecular dynamics, protein folding,\r\nneuronal activity, etc.), or learn behavior patterns in social\r\nnetworks.  This Career award is funded by the Applied Mathematics\r\nprogram in the Division of Mathematical Sciences/Directorate of\r\nMathematical and Physical Sciences and by the Office of\r\nCyberinfrastructure. \r\n",
