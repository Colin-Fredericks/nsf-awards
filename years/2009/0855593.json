 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neutron is stable when confined inside a nucleus.  Once removed however, it is known to live for only about 15 minutes, decaying into a proton, electron, and neutrino.  Scientists would like a more accurate and reliable value of the lifetime for understanding both the early days of the universe and the forces that govern many of the processes that we observe each day. We are in the process of measuring the lifetime of the neutron by confining them using magnetic fields.  Once confined, we are able to directly observe each neutron decay, allowing us to measure the lifetime with improved accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative effort provides an excellent opportunity for both graduate and undergraduate students to participate in a broad spectrum of research that encompasses the areas of nuclear, low-temperature, atomic, and condensed matter physics.  Training future researchers in the field of neutron physics is also essential to insure the ultimate success of new neutron facilities being construted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  Many of the techniques developed will enable other experiments that seek to improve our understanding of the Standard Model of Physics, which describes all particles and their interactions in the world in which we live.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe undertook an experimental program to measure the beta-decay lifetime of a free neutron using a new technique with a completely different set of systematic uncertainties than those of previous measurements.  Ultracold neutrons (UCN) were produced by inelastic scattering of cold (0.89 nm) neutrons in a reservoir of superfluid 4He (the ``superthermal'' process). These neutrons were then confined by a three-dimensional magnetic trap. As the trapped neutrons beta decay, the energetic electrons produced in the decay generate scintillations in the liquid 4He; each decay is detectable with nearly 100% efficiency.  The neutron lifetime can be directly determined by measuring the scintillation rate as a function of time.\n\nNeutron decay parameters provide essential inputs to investigations of the weak interaction.  A precise value for the neutron lifetime is required for several consistency tests of the Standard Model including searches for right-handed currents and tests of the unitarity of the CKM mixing matrix.  At present, there is a 6.5 standard deviation discrepancy between the two most precise UCN bottle lifetime measurements that is not understood.  It is thus essential to resolve this disagreement through measurements using techniques with fundamentally different systematic uncertainties.  Since beam-type experiments are limited by measurements of the neutron flux, magnetic trapping techniques offer the best possibility for both resolving this discrepancy and improving the precision of the lifetime.\n\nDuring this grant period, we have completed and fully-commissioned the upgrade to our apparatus which allows us to trap ~20 times more neutrons due to a combination of a stronger magnetic trap and a larger measurement cell.  Initial data was collected and used to quantify systematic uncertaintaties associated with this experiment.\n\nOur highest priority was addressing the largest known source of systematic uncertainty, marginally trapped neutrons.  We developed detailed numerical simulations that provided accurate limits on the survival probabilities of marginally trapped neutrons under varied field ramping conditions using realistic neutron scattering potentials, detailed geometries, and field maps. Through a combination of analytic and numerical models, we believe that we understand the systematic uncertainty related to above-threshold neutrons and have determined conditions under which the probability of retaining any of these neutrons is negligible.\n\nOur helium is isotopically purified using the well-known heatflush technique developed by McClintock which uses the mass flow of the normal fluid component of superfluid 4He to flush away 3He atoms.  We have two efforts underway to measure the isotopic purity of the helium.  In collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, measurements of trace 3He impurities were performed at ATLAS.  Our previous results imply a background abundance of ~10-12.  These results should improve in our upcoming run.  In addition to the work at ATLAS, a group at CalTech has performed isotopic purity measurements of samples with a precision of 5 x 10-12.  We will test samples here in the future as well.  In addition,we have constructed a continuous flow purification apparatus for in-house production of isotopically pure helium. Having such a facility will eliminate possible contamination issues associated with gas storage.  With the multiple approaches and the proven purification technique, we are confident that contamination of 3He will not be a limiting factor.\n\nAdditional work related to background subtraction was performed, providing confidence that the decay signals observed originate not from imperfect background subtraction, but from trapped neutrons.  In the attached figure, we show a small subset of preliminary neutron trapping and non-trapping (background) data after all background cuts and the neutron decay signal after subtraction of trapping and non-trapping data runs.
