 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wildlife face ever-increasing threats from emerging pathogens, many of which also cause disease in humans.  Genetic diversity plays a central role in buffering populations against the effects of parasites and pathogens.  The ability to isolate genes related directly to disease susceptibility and understanding how those genes evolve is important for designing successful and cost-effective conservation programs.  The vast majority of such studies in wildlife have focused on the relationship between a single pathogen and one or two well-studied immune system genes.  This project goes beyond the single-pathogen single-gene approach by investigating the relationship between diversity in six immune system genes and the entire parasite community of black-tailed prairie dogs.  This research will also provide the first comprehensive survey of black-tailed prairie dog parasites on the Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research site, and will determine if black-tailed prairie dogs are a host for West Nile virus.  \r\n\r\nPrairie dogs are an important component of North American grasslands, but have declined throughout their range, primarily because of the introduced pathogen Yersinia pestis, which causes plague.  Given the social behavior of prairie dogs, they are an excellent model for studying transmission and evolution of resistance for disease like plague.  In addition to advancing the understanding of disease resistance, this project will generate important information for researchers and managers, and provide one graduate student and over 50 undergraduate students with training in laboratory and field research methods.",
