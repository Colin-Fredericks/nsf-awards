 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michigan State University (MSU) will establish a Center for Academic and Future Faculty Excellence (CAFFE). The purpose of the Center is to coordinate and integrate existing programmatic activities to train and prepare a U. S. workforce of future faculty for academic excellence and success in the tenure streams of colleges and universities.  The approach of this I3 proposal aims to coordinate the efforts of multiple offices and programs at Michigan State University to optimize the development, in graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral scientists and junior faculty, of skills, attitudes, values and behaviors essential for smooth transitions across critical educational stages, and for success in an academic careers. There are new and rapidly changing demands and expectations for new faculty. These demands and expectations include, among others, effective pedagogy, skills in the managing and supervision of technical personnel and support staff, grant writing, and the responsible conduct of research. The establishment of the CAFFE would be a landmark step in providing a venue for the preparation of young scholars in a fashion complementary to their disciplinary professional development and aligned with what they will face as they join the academic workforce. Our plan for the delivering of the curriculum of CAFFE is guided by the appreciation that at all stages considered here, professional development takes place in an intimate disciplinary environment. Thus our approach, in contrast to a central or universal prescription of workshops and other activities, will involve a collaboration of the leadership of CAFFE with those responsible for the mentoring and education of developing scholars. Our goal is for an integration of what CAFFE offers with individualized professional and disciplinary development plans. Our approach also acknowledges that the need for particular skills and information often arises at different stages of professional development and that many activities of CAFFE would include concurrent participation of students, post-docs and faculty; we see this feature as an opportunity to enhance the flow of information across different cohorts and as the foundation for inter-generational mentoring.\r\n\r\nCenter for Academic and Future Faculty Exchange (CAFFE) brings together NSF/EHR awards from the ADVANCE and AGEP programs, as well as other work, around the I3 integrative themes for broadening participation and critical educational junctures.",

The primary product of this I<sup>3 </sup>award was the creation of the Center for Academic and Future Faculty Excellence (CAFFE).&nbsp; The CAFFE introduced to Michigan State University (MSU) the practice of <strong>&ldquo;parallel mentoring&rdquo;</strong>, which refers to the concurrent attention to discipline specific doctoral education and to the development of professional knowledge and skills necessary for students, postdocs and junior faculty to be successful academic leaders. The CAFFE not only introduced novel professional development workshops and institutes, but consistent with its mission as an I<sup>3</sup> award, it brought to an accessible common site excellent opportunities for professional development offered by a variety of offices of the institution. The model of parallel mentoring and the integration of a comprehensive and recurrent set of professional development opportunities served as the foundation for an interactive website.

The educational value of IDPs is now broadly recognized and the CAFFE website as a tool for generating IDPs via parallel mentoring will continue with full institutional support.</p>\n<p>This I<sup>3</sup> award has also enhanced the recruitment and retention of students from groups traditionally underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics fields. This was done by integrating three separate initiatives into a comprehensive model directed by the leadership of the I<sup>3</sup> grant. First, the standing Summer Research Opportunity Program (SROP) was transferred to the Graduate School and during the period of the award, transformed from a service activity to an effective recruitment tool for our graduate programs. This was done by developing a selective process to match talented undergraduates from minority serving institutions with research-active faculty who have strong voices in the graduate admission process. Following the CAFFE model, the SROP initiative now supports parallel mentoring of the student participants by providing a strategic set of professional development activities that complement the discipline-specific training of the summer research component. Further, this set of professional development activities was made accessible to undergraduates engaged in summer research, but supported by various programs some of which are funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Second, I<sup>3</sup> resources made it possible to develop connections between SROP and a <strong>Learning Community</strong> of graduate students that represents the legacy of another NSF-funded initiative, the Michigan Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP). This Learning Community meets monthly, and as a result of I<sup>3</sup> support, now the community meetings are open in June and July to all the undergraduates engaged in summer research activities at MSU. During those summer meetings our graduate students engage in inter-cohort mentoring and coach the undergraduates about the best ways to prepare for graduate school.</p>\n<p>The I<sup>3</sup> support also established the practice of having annual trips that take AGEP community participants to Washington DC to visit the NSF and to meet with the Michigan Congressional Delegation in Capitol Hill. Here are two examples of what the participants had to say about the trip:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pick one specific component of the experience because the entire trip itinerary was memorable in its own way.

These adjunct faculty members and other faculty leaders from minority serving institutions are now invited periodically to attend summer meetings of the Learning Community, as well as to serve as panelist and/or moderators of events involving MSU students and postdocs. This initiative has helped in the recruiting of talented undergraduates for our summer research programs and has expanded the professional network of our AGEP Learning Community members. The visits by the adjunct faculty members will continue to have institutional funding past the period of I<sup>3</sup> support and the Graduate School is seeking funding opportunities to sustain the annual visits to campus by leaders of minority serving academic institutions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Antonio&nbsp;A&nbsp;Nunez</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0930182/0930182_10263206_1475344959413_photo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0930182/0930182_10263206_1475344959413_photo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Trip to the NSF\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0930182/0930182_10263206_1475344959413_photo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Trip to the NSF\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Members of the Michigan State University AGEP Learning Community travel annually to Washington DC to visit the National Science Foundation and meet with the Michigan Congressional Delegation in Capitol Hill</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michigan State University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Antonio&nbsp;A&nbsp;Nunez</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Trip to the NSF</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
