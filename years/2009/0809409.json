 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under terms of this Cooperative Agreement, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc. will manage and operate the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) and associated projects on behalf of the National Science Foundation and the national community of ground-based, optical/infrared astronomy researchers.  AURA will provide a national observatory that offers U.S. astronomers access to a complete and balanced suite of ground-based, optical and infrared observing facilities. In addition AURA will establish priorities and processes to create a superior national observing system and to enable new, cutting-edge facilities, aided by inventive, public-private partnerships.\r\n\r\nNOAO will provide forefront facilities and scientific instruments for researchers at Kitt Peak National Observatory and Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory based on the principle of scientific merit, as well as expert in-house support and data analysis tools.  At these observatories NOAO provides a range of assets that include four telescopes of 4-meter class.  NOAO also serves as the U. S. national gateway to the twin 8-meter telescopes of the Gemini Observatory and to many non-federal US observatories through the Telescope System Instrumentation Program. Scientists and engineers at NOAO are partnering with public-private consortia in the design and development of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and two Giant Segmented Mirror Telescope projects.  \r\n\r\nAt the highest level NOAO will enable a research portfolio designed to provide quantifiable tests of the grandest emerging astronomical theories, from the processes that govern planetary formation and stellar output to the accelerating Universe, cosmic inflation, and the nature of dark energy.   \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this program include providing access to astronomical research facilities to the entire community on the basis of intellectual merit, archiving and distribution of data to enable future investigations, and developing next generation astronomical instruments and facilities.  NOAO leads a broad program in education for public visitors to its facilities, undergraduates interested in astronomy, graduate students conducting dissertation research in astronomy, and postdoctoral researchers desiring access to its facilities. Under terms of this Cooperative Agreement NOAO will vigorously promote the advancement of under-represented minorities and persons with disabilities in astronomy and related sciences.",
