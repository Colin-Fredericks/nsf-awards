Sykes from the Department of Chemistry at Tufts University. Prof. Sykes and his students will exploit the unique properties of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM) to investigate molecular rotors and motors. The simplicity and tunability of their chosen thioether skeleton will allow for the systematic measurement and eventual control of key factors that currently prevent molecular machines from doing useful work: thermal fluctuations, lack of molecular ordering, dipolar coupling and nanoscale friction. Prof. Sykes will introduce several scanning probe experiments into the undergraduate laboratory that focus on key concepts of nanoscience. He will also host high school teachers at Tufts during the summer to develop live demonstrations for high school students. At the broadest level, short movies about Prof. Sykes research will be broadcast on YouTube TM to increase public awareness of his cutting edge research in the area of molecular machines. \r\n",
