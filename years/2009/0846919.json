 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Silicon Optomechanics - Harnessing Light Force in Integrated Silicon Photonics \r\n\r\nObjective: The objective of this proposal is to harness optical force on a silicon platform for building silicon optomechanics. Specifically, we will exploit waveguide gradient forces as the fundamental mechanism for operating optomechanical devices. We will also develop novel on-chip photonic interferometry for precision motion readout and investigate new classical and quantum optomechanics arising from strongly coupled optomechanical systems. Novel device applications enabled by this new device system will be explored. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Harnessing and controlling optical force on a chip will lead to the convergence of two important fields: nanophotonics and nanomechanics. It will also bring transformative advances in both photonics and nanoelectromechanical systems. Our approach has the potential to provide a new fundamental tool for silicon photonics, as well as new nanomechanical actuation and readout scheme for NEMS. \r\n\r\nBroader impact: Translating the seemingly small yet fundamentally important phenomenon into an engineering reality will significantly impact not only the sciences and engineering but also society. The application of optical forces, as described here, could provide a prime example for the application of fundamental science in today's highly-developed technology-driven world, and motivate anyone who is interested in studying nanoscale science and engineering.  The educational plan addresses new curriculum development in nanotechnology by creating hands-on lab modules. The knowledge gained through this project will be disseminated through a plurality of widely accepted multimedia platforms designed for outreach to the local high schools, the New Haven area community colleges, and further to the general public.",
