However, the low efficiency of feedstock pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification limits the commercial production of cellulose ethanol. Lignin, which accounts for 15-30% of biomass and binds cellulose together to form a recalcitrant matrix, is a key factor contributing to the low efficiency. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the changes of lignin during the bioconversion and the mechanisms of lignin-enzyme interactions. The structure of lignins in both feedstocks and pretreated materials and the structural changes of lignin during different pretreatments will be investigated. In addition, lignin model compounds will be used to elucidate the mechanisms of lignin reactions during the pretreatments and to determine the impacts of lignin on enzymes during saccharification. The integrated education plan aims to train more high-quality students for the emerging bioindustry. A new biorefining course will be developed for both undergraduate and graduate students. To attract and train students to the area of bioenergy, high school students and undergraduate students will be supported to conduct summer projects. Graduate students will be trained through an international collaboration with University of British Columbia, Canada, which will expose the students to the frontier research in this area. In addition, a bioenergy forum for students will be created, which will provide students a platform to follow the cutting-edge research and development in bioenergy; to meet experts from academia, government and industry; and to create network for their future education and career. \r\nBroader Impact: This integrated proposal has broad impacts on enhancing scientific and technical understanding, on promoting teaching, training and learning, and on society and industry. The outcomes of this research will enhance the scientific and technical understanding of lignin and provide guidelines to improve production efficiency of cellulose ethanol by optimizing pretreatment and saccharification technologies and developing novel enzymes. In addition, the fundamental understandings from the research will also benefit paper industry and forest products industry. The integrated education plan will involve students at different levels (K-12, undergraduate and graduate) in research, teaching, learning and professional development. Furthermore, this integrated project will enhance the collaboration in research and education among universities, government and industry. For example, the University of British Columbia, Canada, will be collaborating in the proposed research and graduate student training. Lt. Governor of Wisconsin has pledged supports to the proposed research and education plan. Lignol Innovation Inc and Novozymes are interested in the proposed research and are willing to collaborate.",
