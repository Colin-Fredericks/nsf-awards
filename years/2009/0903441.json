It includes research on how English Language Learners in beginning algebra classes solve math word problems with different text characteristics.  The results of this research inform the development of technology-based resources to support English Language Learners? ability to learn mathematics through instruction in English, including tutorials in math vocabulary and interactive assistance with forming equations from word problem text.  RAND-Education serves as the evaluator for formative and summative activities, guided by an advisory board of experts in mathematics education and English Learner education.",
