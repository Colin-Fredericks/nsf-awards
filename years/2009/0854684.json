These fuel cells have generated significant excitement in the bioenergy community because of their potential for powering diverse technologies, including waste water treatment, autonomous sensors for long-term operations in low accessibility regions, mobile robot/sensor platforms, and renewable energy systems. Unfortunately, current microbial fuel cells produce low amounts of power, a fact that has stymied widespread application of the technology. A better understanding of how microbes can generate electricity will significantly improve fuel cell performance.  In addition, new platforms that allow for microbial electricity production to be studied in a massively parallel fashion are essential to significantly advance the field. With these ideas in mind, a novel technology that can, in a massively parallel fashion, uncover how microbes generate electricity will be developed. In addition, a minority outreach and educational program that will train the next generation leaders in the bioenergy sciences will be pursued.  Taken together, these efforts will have far-reaching implications for the study of electricity generation by microbes, and the development of next generation microbial fuel cells.",
