 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to estimate motion of objects from video is a fundamental scientific problem that arises in many tasks: finding out how the human body moves, tracking vehicles movements on a highway or the motility of schools of fish.  Despite many advancements the problem remains hard because of sudden, often highly nonlinear changes and the high dimensionality of the object's configuration spaces.  Much prior work has focused on building complex physics-based models, in an \"analysis-by-synthesis\" paradigm dominated by expert's domain knowledge.  When such knowledge is lacking, the resulting models may produce inaccurate predictions.  \r\n\r\nTo address these issues, this project investigates a new paradigm of using limited amounts of carefully collected data to learn direct predictive models of high-dimensional motion. We approach the problem as that of the structured regression, a novel generalization of traditional statistical methods that specifically exploits the spatio-temporal structure of the data to avoid the need for \"analysis-by-synthesis\".  This research will result in a set of robust techniques and computational algorithms that support this new modeling framework.\r\n\r\nThe tools and techniques developed here will have wide applicability in many areas of technology and industry that rely on design of accurate prediction models in complex space-time domains, leading to more general and sustainable forecasting solutions. Through engagement of graduate and undergraduate students in key research activities, the project also provides advanced technical training vital for success of a new generation of computer scientists.\r\n",

Estimation of articulated 3D motion of the human figure or the human face, tracking movements of vehicles on a highway or the motion of schools of feeding fish are just some of the numerous applications in motion interpretation and recognition that could benefit from robust and accurate motion estimation methods.  However, despite significant progress in motion modeling, current approaches often yield motion estimates with inadequate accuracies, especially when faced with high-dimensional motion, such as that of the human body.\n\nThis project investigated principled mathematical and statistical approaches to high-dimensional motion modeling.  This key challenge was addressed by developing a new framework of structured regression models.  The proposed framework is able to leverage various natural constraints that exist in high dimensional motion, such as the notion of motion categories and motion intensities.

By imposing the ordinal constraints the CORF model is able to achieve a significantly higher generalization quality compared to the traditional CRF models on the tasks that naturally model the motion intensity.

By exploiting the structure of the domain, in particular the inclusion/exclusion/layout constraints based on target identity or arrangement, the project has developed a max-margin structured regression framework for tracking of multiple objects. \n\nBoth modeling contributions of this project rely on the fact that accurate training data is available, which can be used to estimate e.g., the CORF parameters.

The approach developed here, based on the notion of probabilistic dynamic canonical correlation models, is able to identify annotator consensus/disagreement even if the annotations exhibit different temporal patterns or delays, as is often the case when annotating human motion.\n\nTogether, the three development present new contributions to the domain of high-dimensional motion modeling.

Solving these problems may have profound impact on economy, biological sciences or understanding of social learning and collective cognition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted b..."
