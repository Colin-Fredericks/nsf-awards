 "awd_abstract_narration": "0846433\r\nBorca-Tasciuc\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nMagnetically heated nanoparticles are considered extensively in cancer hyperthermia research. However, current efforts are focused either on developing new magnetic nanoparticles or assessing their therapeutic effects, without a clear understanding of the physical mechanisms and key parameters that control heat generation and dissipation. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. Key parameters controlling heat generation and dissipation in nanoparticle suspensions subjected to magnetic heating will be identified. Among the focal points of the study are the molecular coatings applied to the nanoparticles, and their effect on heat generation rate and temperature rise. Theoretical models for power generation will be developed to account for effects previously neglected such as interactions between particles. Biological systems (cell cultures) will be investigated in order to assess the degree to which extracellular and cellular media may change the heating efficiency of nanoparticles. These studies will show how nanoparticle positioning within the cell (i.e. within the nucleus versus the lipid raft on the cell membrane) affects cell death rate. New systems, based on functionalized gold-based nanoparticles which exhibit superparamagnetic behavior, are investigated for hyperthermia applications. A novel concept of molecular heat pipes will be explored to determine the potential of engineering the heat transport in bioconjugated nanoparticle systems. \r\n\r\nBroader impact. This research will advance the field of magnetically-mediated cancer hyperthermia and may lead to novel biomedical procedures such as molecular surgery and nanoparticle based gene therapy. Moreover, a course focused on magnetic nanoparticles and their applications in medicine will be developed, employing an inquiry based learning methodology. A series of outreach activities, including international and research experiences for undergraduate students, summer research experiences for teachers, as well as presentations and hands on activities for high school students, will target increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.",
