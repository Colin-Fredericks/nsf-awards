 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a workshop for seven teams from graduate programs to (i) learn about effective initiatives to broaden participation by U.S. undergraduates in graduate study of mathematics and to improve outcomes for graduate students and (ii) draw up concrete plans to implement such practices in their home departments.  Anticipated improvements will occur in recruitment, admissions decisions, student persistence to completion of graduate degrees, and preparation for careers in professional mathematics.  The focus is on broadening access and enhancing success for students from American undergraduate programs, particularly women and members of underrepresented groups.  Nonetheless, recommended practices will be known to improve outcomes for all students.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is modeled on a successful workshop of the same name held in 2006.  Departments from the 2006 workshop have reported implementing changes based on that workshop and have provided preliminary evidence of improved outcomes for students.  It is one part of a multi-component effort to identify, document, and disseminate information on effective practices for increasing the size and quality of the mathematical workforce to meet the needs of the private sector and government as well as higher education.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
