 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multidisciplinary international effort, comprised of three institutions, Moscow State Steel and Alloys Institute (MISIS), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, and Rowan University, aims to investigate multiferroic manganites of the form RMnO3 (R a rare earth), magnetoelectric compounds possessing simultaneous long-range magnetic order and ferroelectricity.  Not much is understood about the underlying physics of magnetoelectrics. While there have been mostly phenomenological models put forth, there have been few attempts to correlate the magnetic and phonon excitations to the observed properties.  This work seeks to eliminate the sometimes apparently contradictory results reported on these materials by performing various spectroscopic, structural and magnetic measurements on a set of well characterized high quality crystals.\r\n\r\nWith this Materials World Network award, we seek to use the results on the magnetoelectric properties and electromagnon spectra of the RMnO3 compounds to develop materials with enhanced magnetoelectric coupling by substitution on the rare-earth site.  In addition to the obvious benefits related to the scientific advancement for the technological application of multiferroics, American undergraduate and Russian graduate students will be introduced to an international research environment and to new cultures, which will prepare them for other worldwide activities during their careers.\r\n\r\nThis project is cofunded by the DMR Condensed Matter Physics Program, the DMR Office of Special Programs, and by the Office of International Science and Engineering, Russia and Eurasia region.",
