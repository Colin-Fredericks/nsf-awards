 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\r\n(Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe University of California, Santa Barbara's (UCSB) Division of Mathematical, Life, and Physical Sciences, UCSB's Gevirtz Graduate School of Education (GGSE), three regional community colleges (Santa Barbara City College, Ventura Community College, and Alan Hancock College), and seven school districts in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties are collaborating to prepare exceptional secondary science and mathematics teachers for California's secondary schools. CalTeach at Santa Barbara (CTSB) is recruiting STEM majors into science and math  teaching through a new Minor in Science and Mathematics Education.  The project is increasing the overall number of science and mathematics credential candidates in UCSB's fifth year Teacher Education Program by 47% and building cohorts of students through shared activities so as to prepare and retain student-centered, reform-minded science and mathematics teachers. An estimated 75 scholarships ($10,000 each)  are being awarded over a five year period to STEM majors who have successfully completed their undergraduate degree and been accepted to the UCSB Teacher Education Program. Selection procedures favor students who are the first in their families to attend college, bilingual, and/or graduates of the undergraduate Minor in Science and Mathematics Education. Three scholarships each year are designated for community college transfer students. Scholarship recipients complete their student teaching in schools serving substantial numbers of students who are economically disadvantaged and/or English learners. They fulfill their teaching commitments in designated, high need partnership school districts while completing an enhanced beginning teacher induction program.   Evaluation research is determining how best to meet program objectives of recruitment, teacher preparation, and establishment of cohorts of exceptional science and mathematics teachers.",
