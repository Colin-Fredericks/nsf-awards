 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose the acquisition of a plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) system. The state-of-the-art crystal growth system will use plasma-generated active nitrogen to greatly reduce the presence of critical impurities. The system will benefit a large, interdisciplinary group of researchers including collaborators from academia and industry. The PAMBE system will become a focal point of our extensive laboratory, opening new frontiers for novel optoelectronic devices based on group-III-Nitride (III-N) semiconductors. It will benefit ongoing projects and anchor new and transformative research and education efforts based on InN, In-rich InGaN, and AlInN. We will develop intrinsic III-N materials with low concentrations of unwanted impurities, specifically carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Sources with low vapor pressure will facilitate maintenance of a pristine growth environment for intentional doping experiments. \r\nThe new system will open new areas of III-N materials research with numerous applications including: deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes, BioFETs for use in tag-free, portable DNA sensors,  heterostructure-based field effect transistors, and tandem photovoltaic cells. \r\nResearch in optoelectronic materials has tremendous potential benefit for our national economy such as development of efficient solid-state industrial and domestic lighting sources promises enormous energy savings, and applications in biological, chemical, and environmental sensing, addressing present and anticipated national security needs. The PAMBE apparatus will impact ongoing interdisciplinary research and will enhance our interactions with industry as well as other universities and colleges. Research, education, and training are an integrated to provide excellent technical, team, and leadership building opportunities for students. \r\n",
