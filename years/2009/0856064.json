Travis Waller \r\n0856064 Texas A &M University; Mladen Kezunovic\r\n     \r\nThe proposed Center for Transportation and Electricity Convergence in the Built Environment  will focus on developing comprehensive analytical solutions for managed deployment and use of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) in the Built Environment. The research efforts will be anchored by the University of Texas at Austin (lead institution) partnered with Texas A&M University. \r\n\r\nThe introduction of PHEVs appears ievitable as early as 2010 with large scale penetration 5-10 years away.  However, the temporal aspect of travel behavior, combined with spatial options for interfacing with the electricity grid, introduces a plethora of options for integrating the electric grid, roadway network, and the built environment through PHEVs. The proposed Center plans to identify the couplings and the dynamics of this meta-system enterprise, involving energy, transportation, consumer choice, and infrastructure development using advanced system-level modeling, optimization, and analysis techniques.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center will lay the intellectual groundwork for characterizing and managing the inevitable changes in energy, transportation, and the built environment that will occur with increased adoption of PHEVs and other cross-cutting innovative sustainable solutions.   Widespread deployment of PHEVs will have effects on numerous industries including electric utilities, automotive, manufacturing, transportation planning, air quality management, and construction of the built environment.  The industry participation will enhance the students' educational experience by providing a pipeline for talented engineers and scientist to industry.  The Center plans to attract a diverse group of researchers and students with highly interdisciplinary interests and training.",
