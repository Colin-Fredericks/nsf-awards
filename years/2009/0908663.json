The investigator\r\nstudies some mathematical models that occur in three specific\r\nareas: electromagnetism, solid mechanics, and fluid mechanics. \r\nIn the first project on electromagnetism, the investigator and\r\nhis collaborators establish an identification of the self-dual\r\nChern-Simons vortices, as well as study the electric and magnetic\r\neffects on the stability of the dually charged vortices.  The\r\nsecond project concerns the dynamics of gel swelling.  The\r\nmathematical construction of well-posedness of classical and weak\r\nsolutions is proven in the context of hyperbolic conservation\r\nlaws.  The third project involves the well-posedness and\r\nstability of various nonlinear dispersive equations arising from\r\nsolid and fluid mechanics.  Methods of mathematical analysis are\r\nthe primary tool employed in the investigations. \r\n\r\n     Physical phenomena are usually well modeled via nonlinear\r\npartial differential equations.  Such equations are exceedingly\r\ndifficult to study, both theoretically and numerically, yet their\r\nunderstanding is important to further progress of many areas of\r\nphysics and engineering.  One of the objectives of this project\r\nis to study the behavior of electrically and magnetically charged\r\nparticles in the classical field theory.  Another objective\r\nconcerns the study of soft condensed matter, which is relevant to\r\ndrug manufacturing and bacterial motility.  The third objective\r\nis to understand a new type of transonic wave arising in solid\r\nmechanics, which is different from the context of transonic flow\r\nin gas dynamics.  The fourth objective is to study water waves\r\nthat may occur in the ocean that are affected by the earth's\r\nrotation, and to understand how they can form tsunamis and how\r\nthey can become turbulent.  The results of this project\r\ncontribute to the identification of physical problems of great\r\nscientific importance that offer new opportunities for the\r\nintegration of applied analysis in research and in the training\r\nof graduate and undergraduate students. \r\n",
