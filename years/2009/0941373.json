 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two central questions facing numerous fields will be addressed by this\u00a0award:\u00a0 \"How does one reach rigorous quantitative conclusions when the\u00a0science involves complicated numerical models and large scale data\u00a0sets?\" and \"How can one use computational methods to point out new\u00a0insights into what are the most important features, parameters and\u00a0data?\". To this end, a generalized statistical and visualization\u00a0structure will be developed for the purpose of comparing and analyzing\u00a0large-scale computational models to large heterogenous data sets. The\u00a0codes, techniques, algorithms and methodologies applied to this\u00a0project will be applied to critical problems in four different fields:\u00a0 high-energy nuclear physics, astrophysics, meteorology and biology. By\u00a0devising a flexible open-source framework, the products of this award\u00a0will be extendable to numerous other problems in the natural or social\u00a0sciences involving sophisticated simulations and complicated data\u00a0structures.\r\n\r\nThe way in which simulations and data are analyzed will be\u00a0revolutionized by the capabilities developed by this work. Fundamental\u00a0model parameters related to each of the four problems, such as the\u00a0percentage of the dark matter in the universe or the viscosity of the\u00a0quark-gluon plasma, will be stated with rigorous uncertainties.\u00a0Methods will be developed and implemented for quantitatively stating\u00a0which data were most important for constraining parameters or\u00a0validating model assumptions. Furthermore, these same methodologies\u00a0will be applied to assess the value of additional data, making it\u00a0possible to quantitatively assess the potential of experimental\u00a0upgrades or additional statistics. Students and postdocs will be\u00a0trained in an emerging science centered around the analysis of complex\u00a0systems. In addition to their own scientific discipline, they will be\u00a0exposed to 21st century tools in statistics, computation and\u00a0visualization.",
