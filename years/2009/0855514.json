 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide funds to carry out a program of experiments to study beta decay processes in nuclei.  The goal of the experiments is, first, to test one particular aspect of the \"Standard Model\" of the weak and electromagnetic interactions, and second, to provide additional data on the decay of boron-8 which is an important source of high energy neutrinos from the sun.  The project involves design, construction and calibration of a spectrometer for the electrons emitted in beta decay, and the development of computer programs to simulate the behavior of the spectrometer and analyze the data.\r\n\r\nThe experiments will advance science, but have the additional goal of training talented physics students.  The students learn to work and think independently and gain a wide variety of practical problem solving skills.  These students eventually enter the workforce, frequently in areas of applied science, and this clearly has a broad and beneficial impact on society.  There are presently 5 students, one graduate student and 4 undergrads, associated with the project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      In our funding request to the National Science Foundation, we proposed to carry out a set of experiments on the decay of 14O, a radioactive isotope of oxygen.  When this nucleus decays it emits a positron (a positively charged electron) and a neutrino, which share the decay energy.  To carry out our experiments we first needed to design, build and calibrate a spectrometer with the capability of measuring the energy of the emitted positrons.  The spectrometer work is described in a paper published in the Reviews of Scientific Instruments.\n\n      With that instrument in place we could return to the main experiments.  The 14O nuclei only live for an average of about 70 seconds, and so to carry out the experiments (which run night and day for several consecutive days) we needed to continually produce new 14O's.  This was done with a beam of protons from an accelerator located in the Physics Department at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.  The 14O nuclei were incorporated into water molecules which were then transported through a complicated system of tubes, valves, cold traps and heaters (operated under control of a computer) to the spectrometer where there were frozen onto a thin aluminum foil.\n\n      Two different kinds of measurements were carried out.  In the first we measured the number of positrons emitted with various energies.  This gives us what is called the \"beta spectrum\".  A plot of this spectrum would show the relative number of positrons (also called beta particles) as a function of the positron energy -- remember that the decay energy can be shared in any way between the positron and a neutrino which we do not detect.  The interest in these measurements is that existing theories of the weak interaction allow one to predict the shape of the beta spectrum.  Furthermore, theorists who had analyzed previous measurements of this kind had concluded that the existing data were not consistent with one of basic theoretical postulates.  The postulate is referred to as the Conserved Vector Current hypothesis (CVC for short).  This hypothesis can only be understood by employing highly advanced concepts, but the important point is that it would be very disturbing if it were to be found that the CVC hypothesis is not correct.\n\n      After a long and careful analysis of our own measurements we were able to report that our results were completely consistent with CVC. \n\n      To describe the second set of measurements we need to backtrack a little.  As we said before, 14O decays by emitting a positron and neutrino.  Left behind  is the daughter nucleus, 14N, which can either be in its ground state or its first excited state. The goal of the second experiment is to measure the \"branching ratio\", which is simply the ratio of the number of ground state decays to the number of excited state decays.  It happens that about 0.5% of the decays lead to the ground state and 99.5% to the excited state.  \n\n      Decays of 14O to the 14N excited state, as well as analogous processes in similar nuclear systems,  are of special interest to theorists.  This is in part because the decays are \"pure\" (the exact meaning in the present context is not important)  and in part because the initial and final quantum states are virtually identical except for the replacement of a proton by a neutron.  Nuclei are made of neutrons and protons, and the neutrons and protons are made of quarks.  The upshot is that 14O excited state decays, as well as the analogous decays in similar systems, can be thought of as nothing more than the spontaneous conversion of an \"up\" quark into a \"down\" quark.  \n\n       The effort to learn about the \"up\" to \"down\" conversions is a large one which incorporates literally hundreds of measurements carried out by experimentalists around the world.  Our contribution was a greatly improved measurement of the branching ratio.  With this new measurement, quark results extracted from 14O are now in good agreement with those derived from measurements in other nuclear systems.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lynn D Knutson"
