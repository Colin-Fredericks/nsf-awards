The burn will be conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in August 2009. Because the burn is a planned event, pre- and post-burn measurements can be conducted on pre-determined sites.  The funding awarded by NSF, along with internal funds from DRI, will be used to collect a set of pre-fire measurements.  The area to be burned in the Gleason Fire has strongly-developed, coarse crumbled, soil structure in unburned areas.  However, where other controlled burns have been done nearby, this structure has collapsed into a structureless soil, rich in fine particles that are most likely prone to erosion. Pre-fire measurements will include soil morphology and structure, water infiltration, air permeability, and wind-shear required to induce aeolian transport of soil particles.  Hypotheses include:  1) the fire will destroy soil structure, increasing soil bulk density, and decreasing soil hydraulic conductivity and air permeability, a set of conditions that would increase the potential for soil erosion by water due to precipitation input; and, 2) the loss of soil structure will disaggregate soil material that would be more prone to suspension by wind at lower wind velocities, when compared to pre-burn conditions.  Most studies on post-fire effects lack a true comparison to pre-fire conditions. This research will allow changes in soil structure to be quantitatively described and linked to post-fire hydraulic and aeolian transport properties that strongly influence the susceptibility of post-fire soil erosion.  Although limited in scope, this research will provide the data needed for post-fire comparisons, and allow testing of some of the field and laboratory methods that the researchers will propose to use in a more comprehensive proposal to NSF on pre- and post-fire soil properties and erosion potential.  The follow-on proposal will include collection of post-fire data from the Gleason Fire.  \r\n",
