 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two methodologies have dominated in biological studies: Laboratory experiments at the subcellular levels, and experiments examining populations of cells in living organisms. This leaves a persistent and recurrent gap in our understanding of biological phenomena. It is not possible to adequately replicate in a test tube the full repertoire of environmental factors that are important in living organisms, and whole-animal studies currently are limited with regards to studying the structure and activities of individual cells with sufficient resolution and sensitivity, especially in a bioflow context. This award will fill this gap by developing a multiparameter photothermal cytometer for real-time study of individual cells in living organisms, in both static and flow conditions with molecular specificity, based upon intrinsic vibrational spectroscopic contrast. \r\n\r\nThe advanced technical platform with a spectrally tunable near-infrared nanosecond pulse laser will be built for non-invasive, rapid (millisecond scale) detection and imaging of single cells with high optical resolution, enhanced absorption sensitivity (four orders better than in convention absorption spectroscopy), and accurate cell positioning. The instrument can be applicable to studies of various living animal models, including mouse ear and mesentery or C. elegans. \r\n\r\nThe project outcomes encompass an almost unexplored area of biological research associated with the use of weakly fluorescent, light-absorbing cellular micro- and nanostructures as intrinsic cell-specific photothermal markers for the non-invasive real-time study in living organisms of various biological processes such as programmed cell death (apoptosis), metabolic activity, and the influence of environmental factors (e.g., oxidative stress) on homeostasis, immunity, and longevity. Long-term goals include enhancing the photothermal cytometer for use in three-dimensional imaging, developing photothermal multiphoton microscopy, and potentially integrating photothermal, fluorescence, and light scattering techniques. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary research involves mathematicians, physicists, electrical engineers, chemists and biologists, and will include developing  a training program and new coursework on advanced optical imaging, animal \r\nmodels, and cell study in vivo to benefit the education of undergraduate, graduate, and \r\npostgraduate students at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences  and University of Arkansas at Fayetteville at Little Rock. Students from different ethnic groups from University at Pine Bluff, and disabilities (through Arkansas School for the Deaf) will be mentored. \r\n",

Nevertheless, conventional in vitro approaches prevent cell study in static and flow condition in natural biological background.  A promising research focus is the development  in vivo cytometry, but existing tools are limited in sensitivity and require fluorescent tags that may alter cell properties, including motility and adhesion. Thus, to truly understand the complex biological phenomena at the single-cell level within the whole organism, will require technological progress towards in vivo high-sensitivity, high-resolution, noninvasive,   \"nontoxic\" approaches.\n\n       To address this problem, a multifunctional photothermal (PT)-based biological tool was developed which integrates a scanning PT cytometry (PTC), PT flow cytometry (PTFC), and confocal  PT microscopy (PTM) using a tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO), and high pulse repetition rate lasers with the fixed wavelengths.  To make this platform  universal, it was integrated with photoacoustic (PA), scattering and fluorescence detection methods.

No other existing instruments, particularly multiphoton-fluorescent, Raman or second-harmonic microscopy, have the potential to image intracellular structures of moving cells in vivo.\n       The capability of new instrument  were demonstrated for 1) spectral identification of multiple cellular chromophores and fluorophores including cytochrome  c, GFP, Mito-Tracker Red, and melanin;  2) label-free imaging of white and red blood cells in static condition and in flow; 3)  spectral identification of circulating necrotic and apoptotic cells targeted by dyes and multicolor NPs; 4) in vivo study of blood rheology; 5)  identification of sickle cells; 5) dynamic monitoring of RBC aggregation; 6) detection of circulating platelets using novel PT negative contrasts mod; 7) early detection of apoptosis, with three orders of magnitude better sensitivity than existing assays and detection of apoptoses arising from low-dose radiation and oxidative stress;  8) PT nano&shy;histochemistry using spectral PT burning techniques; 9)  complex genetic-PT imaging of NPs in plants;  and 10) in vivo PT plant flow cytometry.

Latter  will help to understand the nature of interactions between engineered nanomaterials and plants in order to better anticipate the impact of nano&shy;technology on the environment and agriculture.\nIn conclusion, thirty-nine publications resulted from this award, describing various PTC/PTFC schematics, modules, modes,  and their various applications.
