 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports travel awards for students attending the 2009 ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys). SenSys is a highly-selective, single-track conference focused on the cutting edge in technologies that involve wireless sensor network systems. The 2009 edition of the conference is being held in Berkeley, CA on November 4-6, 2009. As such, the field of sensor networks brings together researchers from a wide variety of fields -- computing disciplines such as operating systems, programming languages, architecture; engineering and science disciplines that are the 'real end users' of sensor networks. The intellectual merit of this project stems from the access to this rich cross-section of topics and researchers that come together at SenSys to the recipients of these travel awards. In addition to the regular technical program comprising of high quality presentations, SenSys also features a large number of technical demonstrations and posters, both from academia and industry. By lowering the financial bar for students attending the conference, this project has a broad impact by increasing the number and diversity of future sensor network professionals who are well-prepared and are in touch with the latest research and technology. The review process for student travel awards is particularly cognizant of various diversification factors including size of school, research maturity and gender.",
