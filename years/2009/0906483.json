Lafont\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to work on a series of\r\nprojects that incorporate techniques from geometry and topology,\r\nwith a view to applications to both of these fields. A major\r\ncomponent of this proposal focuses on making use of geometric\r\narguments to shed light on the algebraic K-theory of (integral\r\ngroup rings of ) various classes of groups. The PI's previous\r\nwork with Ortiz provided a complete algorithm to determind the\r\nlower algebraic K-theory for lattices in the isometry group of\r\nhyperbolic 3-space. The PI intends to further develop techniques\r\nfor computing the lower algebraic K-theory of various other\r\ngeometrically significant classes of groups. The importance of\r\nsuch explicit computations is twofold. First of all, it provides\r\na testing ground for conjectures, and a possible source of new\r\nconjectures. Secondly, because of the close relationship between\r\nalgebraic K-theory and high-dimensional topology, we expect our\r\ncomputations to shed light on the topology of high-dimensional\r\nmanifolds. The PI is also interested in better understanding how\r\nvarious metric properties constrain the topology of the\r\nunderlying space. There is a lot of freedom here, depending on\r\nwhat one means by a metric property, and what aspect of the\r\ntopology we choose to study. For instance, one can consider how\r\nRiemannian curvature influences the bounded cohomology of a\r\nspace. Or one can try to study how metric properties (e.g. the\r\nG-space axioms) can influence the local topology of a\r\nspace. Alternatively, one can try to study, within a fixed class\r\nof topological spaces (e.g. closed smooth manifolds), those\r\nsupporting various types of metric properties (e.g. Riemannian\r\nmetrics of non-positive curvature, as compared to locally CAT(0)\r\nmetrics). The PI intends to work on questions related to this\r\ncircle of ideas.\r\n\r\nGeometry is the study of properties of spaces equipped with some\r\nadditional structure, usually of a metric nature (i.e. allowing\r\none to measure distances in the space). In the field of topology,\r\none forgets about the precise underlying distance, and only\r\nretain the notion of points in the space being \"close\r\ntogether\". As such, topology is often referred to as \"rubber\r\ngeometry\": one can stretch and deform spaces without changing\r\ntheir underlying topology. In topology, manifolds are the spaces\r\nof most interest. These are spaces which, on the small scale,\r\nlook like Euclidean space, but on the large scale, can be\r\ncurved. A basic question lies in finding ways to detect when two\r\nmanifolds are different from each other. This is usually done by\r\nassociating certain invariants to manifolds: if the invariants\r\nare different, then the manifolds are different. One family of\r\ninvariants which is particularly useful in high-dimensional\r\ntopology are the algebraic K-theory invariants. In general, these\r\ninvariants are quite hard to compute. The PI plans to develop\r\nmethods for computing these invariants, in the special case where\r\nthe manifold has some nice underlying geometry. More generally,\r\nthe PI plans on studying how the presence of a geometric\r\nstructure constrains various topological properties (and vice\r\nversa).\r\n",
