 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Colorado State University Molecular Biosciences REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summer from 2009 through 2011. Ten students will be selected to participate in a 10-week program that exposes undergraduates to the broad range of research areas and approaches that constitute the modern discipline of biochemistry and molecular biology. Students will work with mentors from five departments. Students will be involved in their own research project where they learn how to formulate and test hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze results in the context of the hypothesis, and use state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation. Interactions with faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and professional research staff provide a mechanism for learning about the latest advances in biochemistry and molecular biology. Students receive a stipend, free housing in a university residence hall or apartment building, a meal allowance, and an allowance to defray travel to/from the site. At the end of the program, students present their research results orally and through a poster, and produce a final report in manuscript form. In addition to research, students are engaged in social activities such as white water rafting and hiking in Rocky Mountain National Park. Field trips to nearby government labs and biotech companies as well as workshops on GRE preparation and scientific careers are also planned. Students with limited opportunities for research and those from groups under-represented in science are especially encouraged to apply. For further information, students may visit http://www.bmb.colostate.edu/reu.cfm, or contact Marti Stokes at 970-491-5602 or reubiochem@colostate.edu, or the Program Director, Paul Laybourn, at 970-491-5100 or Paul.Laybourn@colostate.edu.",
