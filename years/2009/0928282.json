 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern cable-supported bridges, akin to automobiles, are being designed with streamlined deck cross-sections replacing more traditional truss and box sections. These sections, however, introduce complex aerodynamic features which result in a behavior that departs from the assumptions implied in conventional analysis and design practice. This is further complicated by the fact that there is no conclusive evidence concerning the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of atmospheric turbulence on the aerodynamics of bridges and the role of unusual gust structures experienced during gust fronts and hurricanes. Clearly, these critical issues, if unaddressed, would have strong bearing on planned and existing bridges in the future paths of landfalling hurricanes. Herein it is proposed to develop an advanced analysis framework that aids in seeking improved performance while enhancing safety and integrity of bridges in extreme wind environments. Both experimental and computational simulations will be conducted to capture the aerodynamic characteristics of streamlined deck sections. Collaborations with a distinguished group of bridge experts from Japan, China and Italy have been established for sharing of information and data. In parallel, synergistic collaborations with the design community would ensure immediate utilization of the developed body of knowledge in practice and design standards. The project would introduce transformative advances in the state-of-the-art of the bridge aerodynamics and in efficient tailoring and design of bridge decks.\r\n\r\nThe project involves professional development activities, wide dissemination of research results for practical applications, and educational initiatives that are likely to have lasting broader impacts. The bridge designers will be informed of the recent advances in bridge aerodynamics through a cyber-based virtual organization. Other sectors involving flexible structures such as large wind turbines and super tall buildings would also benefit from the analysis framework to be developed in this project. The proposed study promises to provide a strong intellectual foundation supported by well-trained students at the graduate, undergraduate and pre-college levels and well-informed designers equipped with advanced tools for the visionary design of cable-supported bridges and other wind sensitive structures. These activities are essential to maintain the American leadership in the burgeoning global market for innovative design solutions and construction of these important structures.\r\n",
