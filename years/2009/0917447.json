The budgeted allocation of $750 per person is for partial airfare or registration fee support. The special focus of the PSE 2009 is Sustainability, Energy and Engineering.  PSE 2009 is the tenth in the triennial series of international conferences on process systems engineering initiated in 1982.  The PSE conferences are the premier meetings for process systems engineering, encompassing the areas of process design, control and operations.  Previous venues for these meetings include Keystone, Colorado, USA (2000), Kunming, China (2003) and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany (2006).  The purpose of the meeting is to bring together the worldwide PSE community of researchers and practitioners who are involved in the creation and application of computing-based methodologies for planning, design, operation, control and maintenance of chemical, petrochemical and biological process industries. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe special focus of PSE 2009 is on the topic of how these PSE methods and tools can support sustainable resource systems and emerging technologies in the areas of green engineering, i.e., the environmentally conscious and energy efficient design and operation of these processes.\r\n",
