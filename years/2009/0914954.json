 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of numerical methods for large algebraic systems is\r\ncentral in the development of efficient codes for computational\r\nfluid dynamics, elasticity, and electromagnetics. \r\nMany other tasks in such codes parallelize relatively easily.\r\nAlgebraic system solvers therefore remain very important now that\r\nan increasing number of parallel and distributed computing systems, with\r\na substantial number of fast processors, each with a relatively large memory,\r\nare becoming widely available. A very desirable feature of domain\r\ndecomposition algorithms is that they respect the memory hierarchy of\r\nmodern parallel and distributed computing systems, which is essential\r\nfor approaching peak floating point performance. This is important\r\nsince the cost of communication often can dominate for large computer\r\nsystems. The domain decomposition methods are also relatively easy to implement \r\nand they have an increasingly solid theoretical basis, which shows that the\r\nrates of convergence of these preconditioned Krylov space methods are \r\nindependent of the number of subdomains and grows only very slowly with \r\nthe dimension of the subproblems allocated to individual processors. \r\nIn each iteration step, local problems representing the restriction of the \r\noriginal problem to a potentially large number of subregions are solved \r\nexactly or approximately. The subregions, which can be allocated to \r\nindividual processors of a parallel computer, form a decomposition of the \r\nentire domain of the problem. In addition, the inclusion of a coarse  \r\ncomponent often substantially increases the efficiency of the preconditioner\r\nand can dramatically reduce the CPU time. This project will combine \r\nmathematical analysis with the design and numerical testing of algorithms.\r\nEach class of applications, e.g., elasticity, incompressible fluid flow,\r\nand electromagnetics, requires special considerations and,\r\nin particular, the design of an appropriate coarse solver, for the problem \r\nat hand,  is crucially important. Among the applications to be considered \r\nare incompressible Navier Stokes equations, Reissner-Mindlin plates, \r\nMaxwell's equations, nonlinear elastic contact problems, and those arising \r\nin forced vibrations and acoustics. Work will also continue on developing \r\nanalytic tools, which also are applicable to very irregular subdomains \r\nsuch as those obtained from mesh partitioning software.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this work is to provide improved computational methods\r\nfor the engineering and scientific community. A special emphasis is on\r\nmethods that can be used effectively on modern parallel and distributed\r\ncomputer systems; these systems have many processors and fast networks\r\nfor the communication between the processors. In many design problems, such\r\nlarge scale computing resources are required in order to take complicated\r\ngeometry and rapidly varying displacements or velocities into account and\r\nstandard computing systems have often proved to be inadequate. Led by the\r\nUS national laboratories and the computer manufacturers, large scale parallel\r\ncomputing systems are being developed rapidly and these systems are by now\r\nalso available to practicing engineers, who, e.g., test building design\r\nunder the impact of earthquakes, prior to certification and construction, \r\nor machine parts under realistic operating conditions, prior to making \r\nprototypes. This work requires access to software systems and ultimately \r\nto reliable methods to approximate complicated scientific or engineering \r\nmodels. In many applications, accurate predictions often require massive \r\namounts of data to describe the geometry and material properties accurately\r\nenough. The design of methods to extract the solution of such problems \r\nrequires different algorithms for different applications such as the\r\ndesign of buildings, the propagation of electromagnetic waves, or \r\nfluid flow in oil fields. This project is focused on mathematical analysis\r\nof these issues and the design of improved methods. Experience of such \r\nefforts in the past clearly indicates that insight gained from such work \r\ncan greatly improve the efficiency and reliability of computational practice. \r\nThis work is a collaborative effort with leading developers of methods \r\nand software systems at the SANDIA National Laboratories at Albuquerque, NM, \r\nand at the University of Essen, Germany. \r\n",
