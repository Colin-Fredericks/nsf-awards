 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tuskegee University (TU) HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project (TIP) will infuse genomics into the undergraduate curriculum of the Biology Department. This TIP will provide highly interactive, inquiry-based approaches to acquaint students with the emerging field of genomics. To accomplish this goal, one introductory course and two advanced level genomics courses will be developed and newly designed genomics modules will be incorporated into existing courses including: Advanced Genetics, Advanced Biotechnology, Molecular and Cell Biology, Botany, Microbiology, and Research Methodology. In parallel, a series of complementary project laboratories will be developed to provide students hands-on, minds-on experience with genomics research and facilitate current research activities of faculty and students at TU. Students enrolled in these courses will be better prepared to enter the 21st century scientific workforce, particularly in the emerging fields of genomics. The teaching materials (including hypertexted laboratory manuals) developed at TU will be disseminated via open access courses, presentations, publications, and workshops for faculty members. The TU-TIP project will provide educational innovations for universities and colleges nationwide.",
