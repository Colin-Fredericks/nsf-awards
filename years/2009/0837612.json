 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54)\r\nThe use of sensors and instrumentation for monitoring civil engineering systems plays an increasingly important role as infrastructure ages and as sensor technologies improve in performance. Unfortunately, sensors are not a significant part of the civil engineering undergraduate curriculum. Through this project, investigators are installing sensors adjacent to an earth dam and on a building foundation for construction projects being undertaking on the campus. The installation of the sensors is being filmed so that future generations of students will be able to learn about issues and challenges in installation of sensors for infrastructure. Four learning modules are being developed and integrated into required and elective courses in the civil engineering curriculum: Sensor Fundamentals, Sensor Installation and Operation, Data Collection and Analysis, and Data Synthesis, Inversion, and Prediction. These modules introduce students to sensor technologies and to the synergies of real time monitoring of the built environment. Student learning from the modules is being rigorously evaluated and results are being used to inform enhancements to the modules.\r\n",
