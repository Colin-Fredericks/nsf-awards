It also proposes to solve the simpleness problem of the area\r\npreserving homeomorphism group of the two sphere (and the disc)\r\nby investigating the extension problem of Calabi homomorphisms\r\nand Entov-Polterovich's quasi-morphisms to the Hamiltonian\r\nhomeomorphism group. In addition, the PI proposes to apply the\r\nmachinery of Floer theory to symplectic topology of toric\r\nmanifolds and construct new quasi-morphisms on the Hamiltonian\r\ndiffeomorphism group and Entov-Polterovich's symplectic\r\nquasi-states on toric manifolds. The PI anticipates that the\r\nproposed research will not only provide solution to the\r\nhomological mirror symmetry of Fano toric A-model and\r\nLandau-Ginzburg B-model but also lead to deeper understanding of\r\nopen-closed Floer theory and its applications to dynamical\r\nsystems and symplectic topology.\r\n\r\nThe Hamiltonian formalism played a fundamental role not only for\r\nsolving problems in classical mechanics but also for transforming\r\nthe classical mechanics into quantum mechanics. It also plays an\r\nimportant role in deriving many basic physical equations in high\r\nenergy physics ranging from quantum field theory to modern string\r\ntheory. The natural space where the Hamiltonian formalism can be\r\nexercised is the symplectic manifold (or more generally the\r\nPoisson manifold). One of the most distinguished geometric\r\nobjects of study in symplectic manifold is the Lagrangian\r\nsubmanifold; For example, `the state of a particle with zero\r\nmomentum in space' forms a Lagrangian submanifold in `all\r\npossible states of a particle in space' which forms a symplectic\r\nmanifold. Understanding the interplay between geometry of\r\nLagrangian submanifolds and dynamics of Hamiltonian flows is the\r\ncore theme of symplectic topology.  The PI's proposed research\r\naims at extending the Hamiltonian dynamics to the level of\r\ncontinuous dynamics and solving various problems arising from\r\nHamiltonian dynamics and mirror symmetry.  It also aims at easing\r\nthe access of graduate students and researchers from other\r\nrelated fields into the study of Floer theory and mirror symmetry\r\nby writing a graduate level textbook on Floer homology and its\r\napplications to symplectic geometry.\r\n",
