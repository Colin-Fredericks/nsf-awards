 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support participant costs for two workshops on Distributed Infrastructure for Security Monitoring and Intelligence Extraction. The first is a five-day workshop held in India involving researchers invited from the United States and India held 9-13 January 2010 on the campus of Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India. The goal is to establish new collaborations between the United States and India in cutting-edge research and technology development and knowledge transfer focused on areas of real-time security surveillance and extraction of actionable intelligence for both critical physical infrastructure and their associated computing and communication components. The research is expected to be of direct benefit to both the United States and India and to result in techniques for better management of public safety and security resulting from natural disasters and terrorist events. The workshops will also help strengthen existing partnerships between the United States and India in\r\nrelated fields as well as promote new ones. A second, two day follow-up workshop will be held in Spring 2010 in the United States, probably in the Washington DC area. The net result of these workshops will be a large scale research proposal for which funding will be requested from appropriate agencies from both US and Indian sides.",
