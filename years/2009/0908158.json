 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cummings\r\nDMS-0908158\r\n\r\n     This project centers on developing new analytical models for\r\nnematic liquid crystals (NLCs) in two basic configurations.  The\r\nfirst concerns NLCs \"sandwiched\" between two solid boundaries,\r\nsubject to an applied electric field.  This geometry is directly\r\nrelevant to a number of liquid crystal display devices.  By\r\ninvestigating the response of the NLC layer to an external\r\nelectric field, the investigator and her colleage develop new\r\nmodels relevant to the design of bistable LCD devices.  Advances\r\nhere could lead to the development of new, easily-manufactured,\r\nenergy-saving technologies.  The second configuration considers\r\nfree-surface dynamics of NLC films and drops, relevant to\r\nnumerous manufacturing processes.  Mathematically, the problem is\r\ncomplicated by the need to model carefully the liquid crystal\r\nbehavior in the vicinity of any contact lines.  This, in addition\r\nto the known unstable behavior, leads to a very complex problem,\r\nabout which little is known theoretically.  Systematic asymptotic\r\nreduction of the complex Ericksen-Leslie equations for nematic\r\nmedia, to the appropriate thin-film geometry, is made.  The\r\nformulation includes the effects of finite anchoring strength of\r\nthe liquid crystal director field at the boundaries, and the\r\neffects of liquid-solid interaction energy (via a disjoining\r\npressure).  The theoretical investigations are augmented by an\r\nexperimental program, comprising simple table-top experiments\r\ncarried out by summer students at NJIT, and more sophisticated\r\ninvestigations carried out by an experimental collaborator, Peter\r\nPalffy-Muhoray, at Kent State University. \r\n\r\n     The project has two strands: A theoretical investigation\r\ninto optimal design of low-energy (so-called \"bistable\") Liquid\r\nCrystal Display (LCD) devices, for use in applications such as\r\ne-paper; and an investigation into the dynamics of nematic liquid\r\ncrystals spreading on surfaces, a process known to be unstable in\r\ncertain situations.  The development of a theoretical base for a\r\nworkable, easily-manufactured, low-energy LCD device would have\r\nundeniable economic and environmental impact if it proved\r\ncompetitive, in terms of cost or performance, with the small\r\nnumber of such low-energy LCD microtechnologies presently\r\navailable.  The investigations into free-surface spreading lead\r\nto a better understanding of coating processes and, particularly\r\nwith the inclusion of an electric field, offer potential for new\r\nways of controlling the evolution of spreading films in\r\nmanufacturing processes.  This project is carried out in\r\ncoordination with educational efforts that include invaluable\r\nresearch experiences for undergraduate students.",
