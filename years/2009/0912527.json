 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses a significant need facing video industry - how to monetize online video. There were over 11.5 billion online videos watched in USA only in July 2008. The online video consumption trend is increasing approximately 10% - to 13% monthly. The current approach to monetize online video is limited and does not scale. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to assess the feasibility of a new and unique approach to monetize online video through an Interactive video based \"Contextual\" and \"Dynamic\" Ad insertion technology platform. A new algorithm/methodology/framework will be designed and an alpha prototype of the Interactive video based dynamic Ad insertion technology will be proven feasible. \r\n\r\nThe key value proposition of this interactive video based contextual and dynamic Ad insertion technology is a new way to enhance end-user engagement with advanced business intelligence. The video publisher will have a new approach to monetize their online video assets with high scalability. The advertisers will have a unique tool to advertise and communicate about their products and services to target customers. The end users will have highly-engaging access to personalized and relevant information about a product or service. If proven successful, the technology would allow interactivity within the online video thus allowing end users quick call-to-action within the video in a novel way that will represent significant value for multiple stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).",
