These questions are addressed using a battery of brain imaging measures including brain structure (MRI,DTI), bloodflow changes (fMRI), and electrical responses (ERP).  Pre-post brain measures track changes over the course of a school year within two groups segregated by a \"school's cutoff date\" into young first graders and old kindergarteners.  This group contrast allows the impact of first grade instruction to be differentiated from maturation and school attendance. \r\n",
