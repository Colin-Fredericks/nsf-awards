 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project aims to understand how living and extinct carnivores evolved skulls and jaws powerful enough to consume the hardest parts of their prey, the bones. The evolutionary records of hyenas and dogs are used to document the evolution of teeth, jaws and skulls required for crushing bones. The approach used in this research project is a novel integration of four methods: (1) geometric analysis of the skull shapes of different types of hyenas and dogs, (2) 3-D computer modeling of stresses occurring in the skull during bone-cracking bites, (3) microscopic analysis of fine structures of hyena and dog teeth and (4) documentation of surface damage done to the teeth during bone-crushing by those living and extinct carnivores. The importance of this research to the field of ecology and evolutionary biology include an improvement in our understanding of the ecological roles of large bone-crushing carnivores and information to help better manage the natural food webs remaining on Earth through better management of top predators. The broader impacts of the research findings and methods employed in this project include engaging students and museum visitors in the excitement of the natural sciences through public outreach programs.  In addition, college students from different fields of study will collaborate in team projects.  Lastly, research findings on non-human systems will allow for improved design in human craniofacial surgery and dental replacement biomaterials.",
