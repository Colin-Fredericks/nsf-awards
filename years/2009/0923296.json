 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to the Department of Mathematics at University of Wisconsin Madison in collaboration with mathematics faculty at UW Eau Claire, UW Whitewater and the Madison Area Technical College (MATC) to implement a network of high performance computing environment for interdisciplinary research in the mathematical sciences and its applications to biological and basic medical sciences. This academic network will collaborate closely with pioneering American industrial partners (SUN Grid Network.com, nVIDIA and PBC Linear automation technologies) to provide a novel approach that enables a broader participation of students and faculty from the State of Wisconsin in advancing applications of distributed massively parallel GPU-based computation along with the Madison research groups in the computer sciences, genetics and mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe project outcomes include: applications of topology to accurately determine structure of large proteins, topological methods in fluid dynamics, mathematical modeling and computations to determine functions of genes in development of plant root systems. Further, novel algorithms will enable researchers to overcome current obstacles for visualization and analysis of very high dimensional massive data sets that are the hallmarks of the 21st century biotechnology in agronomy, drug discovery, and systems biology.",
