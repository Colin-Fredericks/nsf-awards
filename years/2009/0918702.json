 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Science Education and the Center for Children and Technology at the Education Development Center are developing and testing a prototype electronic teacher's guide for a 12-week genetics unit in the NSF-funded curriculum titled Foundation Science: Biology (0439443) to determine how it impacts high school teachers' learning and practice. The electronic guide, which is based on an existing print guide, has a flexible design so that it anticipates and meets the curriculum planning and support needs of teachers with different knowledge/skills profiles. The electronic guide provides teachers with just-in-time, point-of-use access to resources that help teachers plan, implement, and reflect on innovative reform-oriented instructional materials. \r\n\r\nCase-study research will investigate how use of the guide changes teachers' subject-matter knowledge, teachers' pedagogical content knowledge for science content and science inquiry, teachers' classroom practices, and student engagement. The results of this project will help to determine to what extent a flexible and modular electronic teacher guide can afffect teacher practice and to what extent it can enhance the ability of teachers to implement curricula effectively.",
