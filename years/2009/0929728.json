The project is designed to advance knowledge and understanding about key mathematical and scientific concepts in areas of energy such as batteries and fuel cells, nuclear energy and alternative energy sources like wind and solar. Students will participate in team oriented programming that exposes them to fundamental chemistry, physics and engineering concepts that enable energy generation and storage. The project offers a well-conceptualized, multi-layered set of experiences designed to ignite and sustain girls? interest in science, engineering, and leadership in the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RE&EE) industries. \r\n",
