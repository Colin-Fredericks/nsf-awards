 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit.  This proposal requests funding for acollaborative experimental and analytical study of global recycling of sulfur based on the isotopic fractionation between S-bearing gases, silicate melt, and condensed S phases (sulfate and sulfide). Scientists from three institutions are involved (American Museum of Natural History (C. Mandeville, lead PI), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (N. Shimizu, PI), and University of Rhode Island (K. Kelley, PI). The proposed research comprises two separate aspects. First, laboratory experiments will be carried out to determine mechanisms and magnitudes of S isotopic fractionations between coexisting phases as a function of pressure, temperature, chemical composition of silicate melt, fugacity of oxygen, and speciation of S in silicate melt and gas phase. S isotopic analysis will be made using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) techniques with the IMS 1280 ion microprobe at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. This new SIMS technique for sulfur isotopic measurements can now be applied to silicate glasses at the melt inclusion (10's of microns) scale thus allowing analysis of sulfur isotopes in trapped magma inclusions, evaluation of volcanic degassing, and assessment of the ultimate source of sulfur in arc magmas. In a second phase, S isotopic compositions will be determined for natural primitive magmas trapped as glass inclusions hosted by olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene; complementary volatile, lithophile and high field strength trace element abundances will be determined on the same glasses via laser ablation ICP-MS analysis at Rhode Island. This will be carried out for samples from Galunggung (Indonesia), Etna (Italy), and Augustine (Alaska), volcanoes so as to investigate S isotopic compositions of source mantle, effects of water and oxygen fugacity on S isotopic fractionation between silicate melt and S-bearing phases, and effects of degassing processes on S isotopic composition of silicate melts. Together, these research paths are expected to establish routine measurement of S isotope geochemistry as a powerful tracer for chemical fluxes across subduction zones and for assessment of sulfur recycling among Earth's major reservoirs (mantle, lithosphere (including crust), and coupled hydrosphere-atmosphere).\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  Understanding of volatile degassing is central to monitoring and forecasting volcanic eruptions. Also. improved understanding of sulfur isotope geochemistry is vital to volcanic hazard mitigation. The PIs will incorporate the scientific results into educational and outreach programs at their respective institutions. PI Kelley is an early-career female scientist, supported by the University of Rhode Island's NSF-funded ADVANCE program, which is aimed at nurturing the careers of female scientists. She will advise a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Oceanography (SURFO) student (Univ. of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography's NSF-funded REU program) under the umbrella of this project. PI Mandeville will advise two American Museum of Natural History REU students in years 2 and 3 of this project. The PI will participate as a lecturer in the Training Renewal for Urban Science Teaching (TRUST) program at AMNH which provides professional development opportunities for greater New York City high school Earth science teachers. A TRUST session will be administered by AMNH in each year of the project",

These three volcanoes were chosen in order to represent relatively dry and primitive arc basalt magmas (Galunggung, where relatively dry adiabatic decompression melting with little subducting slab input had been invoked based on earlier volatile studies of Sisson and Bronto, (1998), Kelley et al., (2005) that indicated H2O poor melt, and possibly reduced fO2), intermediate (Krakatau-Pre-1883 basalt based on earlier study results indicating 2-3 wt.% water in the melt, Mandeville data, unpublished), and Augustine Pleistocene basaltic base sure deposit clasts representing very \"wet\" volatile-rich and oxidized basaltic melt based on results of Plank et al 2007 that indicated up to 7.5 wt. % dissolved H2O in the melt, 6500 ppm S, and 6000 ppm Cl dissolved in the melt.  This study  examined how sulfur isotope ratios 34S/32S measured in melt inclusions correlated with other intrinsic geochemical characteristics of mafic arc magmas including dissolved volatiles, oxidation state, and trace element concentrations.  Based on the sulfur isotope ratios measured in melt  inclusions we also sought to indentify the most likely source of dissolved sulfur in these mafic arc magmas based on isotopic signatures of Earth\u00c6s major reservoirs.  Basaltic melt inclusions in olivine hosts were measured in order to obtain the least degassed material possible for characterization of intrinsic dissolved volatiles (H2O, CO2, S, Cl, F), oxidation state through micro-X-ray Absorbtion Near Edge Structure Spectrosopy (micro-XANES) measurements of both dissolved sulfur and iron speciation and  sulfur isotope ratios via secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) utilizing the ims 1280 ion microprobe at Woods Hole. \n\nPositive d34S values up to 17&permil; measured in high sulfur non-degassed melt inclusions indicate that for all of these arc volcanoes, 34S enriched sulfur has been added to the mantle melting source.  In addition, Augustine melt inclusions have the highest d34S values, highest dissolved H2O and sulfur and the oxidation state measurements we have made.\n\nThe second and critical focus of our research activities were to conduct high temperature and pressure sulfur isotopic fractionation experiments between andesitic and basaltic melt and exsolved vapor over a range of partial pressures of oxygen fugacities (think of fugacity as effective partial pressure of oxygen) in order to determine sulfur isotopic fractionation factors between vapor and melt that simulate what real basaltic and andesitic magmas do when rising through the Earth\u00c6s crust beneath arc volcanoes.  These experiments generated fundamental data on how the different isotopes of sulfur (34S and 32S) partition into the melt and vapor when a magma ascends from depth and forms vapor bubbles on its way to the surface because of volatiles coming out of the melt as pressure decreases (analogous to uncorking champagne).  For over 30 years, volcanologists and stable isotope geochemists have lacked real experimental data at true magmatic temperatures of 1050&deg; to 1250&deg;C on how the different isotopes of sulfur partition between magma and vapor in ascending magmas.  This limited our understanding of how sulfur behaves during formation of arc magmas and how potentially useful isotopic signatures might/or might not be modified as the magma degasses on ascent. The  fractionation data we have generated are the first of this kind in real andesitic and basaltic melts-vapor systems.  These data can now be used to model sulfur isotopic evolution and de..."
