The Co-Chairs for this workshop are Jun Li, Dean of the Research Institute of Information Technology and Vice Dean of the School of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, and Alex Pothen, Director of the Computer Research Institute, Director of the Combinatorial Scientific Computing and Petascale Simulations Institute at Purdue University. The program committee consists of Junwei Cao, and Xiaoge Wang from Tsinghua University and Barbara Fossum and Carol Song from Purdue University.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to address some of the major challenges presented\r\nby evolving cyberinfrastructure and to identify one or two areas of common interest where\r\njoint collaboration will bring together an international team to solve these challenges. The\r\nbroader impacts of this workshop are to engage with international colleagues to create a venue\r\nfor leveraging existing cyberinfrastructure investments beyond the United States. This workshop offers the opportunity for the community to create a global cyberinfrastructure enabling science and engineering between the U.S. and China.\r\n\r\nOne of the major challenges facing cyberinfrastructure is how to meet the needs of a rapidly changing and growing global society whose dependence on computing and information technology is growing exponentially. As we move closer to the end of the first decade of the 21st century it is essential that cyberinfrastructure evolve to be ready to meet the needs of all communities in all areas of research on a global level. To address the issues of building cyberinfrastructure for the next decade with a view to enabling global science.\r\n",
