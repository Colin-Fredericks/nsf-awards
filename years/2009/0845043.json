 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will carry out a laboratory research program aimed at better understanding and quantifying interactions of trace gases with ice and snow.  A quantitative physical understanding of these interactions is critical for predicting the effects of climate change on atmospheric composition, for the interpretation of ice core chemical records, and for modeling atmospheric chemistry.  Emphasis will be on several gases key to polar photochemistry: formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, nitrous acid, and peroxynitric acid.  The principal tools will be (1) a flow tube reactor with ice-coated walls coupled with chemical ionization mass spectrometry for quantification of trace gases, and (2) the surface-specific technique ellipsometry to probe quasi-liquid layers (QLL) and quasi-brine layers (QBL) at ice surfaces of various compositions.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts component of this project will include involvement of one post-doc, one graduate student, and a K-12 science educator.  Education/outreach will have three major thrusts: (1) \"Science of the Atmosphere\", a bilingual (English and Spanish) interactive web site designed to teach students, families and educators about air pollution, climate change, and other atmospheric science topics, (2) a research and curriculum development partnership with a New York City area K-12 science educator, and (3) laboratory activities with economically disadvantaged New York City public school students from groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering.",
