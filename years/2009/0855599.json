 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program explores fundamental physics and potential applications of controlled quantum systems at the interface of quantum optics and nano-science. The work involves the interplay between theory and experiment and involves potential applications within two broad areas. The first is the sensing and quantum manipulation of individual spins, and the second is quantum optical control using nano-photonic systems. Specifically, we are developing a novel technique for nanoscale magnetic sensing that makes use of coherently controlled, individual electronic spins associated with diamond impurities. Furthermore, this system is being used for quantum control of nano-mechanical motion of the magnetized tip associated with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include development of a new, interdisciplinary area of physical sciences. We are providing critical insights into the fundamental physics of controlled, complex quantum systems. New tools are being developed that make use of coherent quantum phenomena for unique applications ranging from information science to biology and medicine. Our collaborative program  provides exceptional opportunities for education and training in this new area involving the interface of several fields of fundamental physics, material science, and device engineering. We disseminate physics knowledge through teaching, international collaborations, review articles, lecture notes, workshops and summer schools. To enhance the appreciation and understanding of science, public talks will be combined with outreach efforts, such as visits to elementary schools.\r\n",
