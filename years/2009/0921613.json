Organized by Dr. Patricia A. Solis of the Association of American Geographers, the PASI cwill address the Integration of research on climate change and hazards in the Americas. The institute will 1) identify, engage, and integrate a new generation of scholars and practitioners with on-going activities of major organizations around the relationships between climate change and hazards, 2) interrelate advanced knowledge domains around links between climate change and hazards in the region using integrative capacities of geographic technologies; and 3) elaborate a collaborative research and educational agenda that spans across disciplines and sectors. \r\n\r\nThe activity will foster greater joint movement from data to knowledge to action, by consolidating advanced research, synergizing international geospatial collaboration around links between climate change and hazards, and fostering a region-wide community of scholars and practitioners. Expected outcomes in this PASI will be to transform climate change and hazards research by engaging a new generation of scholars/practitioners with international initiatives, and by integrating these perspectives into educational opportunities for various sciences and engineering disciplines. The PASI will also help the public better understand climate change and its potential hazards through the development of a website and wiki.",
