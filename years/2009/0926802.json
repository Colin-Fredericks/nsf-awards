 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living in seawater is challenging to marine animals such as sea snakes, which evolved from terrestrial ancestors and are widely distributed throughout much of the world's tropical ocean waters.  Sea snakes were previously thought to drink seawater and excrete the excess salts using salt glands.  However, recent research by the PI has shown that three species of \"sea kraits\" (a type of sea snake) actually dehydrate in seawater and must drink freshwater in order to remain in water balance.  Marine snakes must acquire freshwater by drinking from surface lenses that form on the sea during rainfall, or from freshwater springs or estuaries along coastlines.  The objectives of this research are to test whether 'true sea snakes' also require fresh water for normal water balance.  These are a second lineage containing the majority of sea snake species (50+).  The investigators will measure rates of dehydration in sea water and in air; observe, describe and document the drinking behaviors of sea snakes; and correlate the distribution of sea snake abundance with the local availability of fresh water.  The long-range goal is to correlate the known geographic distribution of sea snakes with historic and current patterns of rainfall in both time and space, using geospatial analysis.  Understanding the water requirements of sea snakes will improve the understanding of the geographical distribution of these animals, which is likely to change due to altering patterns of precipitation related to climate change.  These studies may also assist in the understanding of recent population declines and local extinctions of sea snakes, which are important top predators on coral reefs.  Sea snakes might be significant harbingers of climate change and could be possible indicators of the health of coral reefs, which are in serious ecological crisis.  The unexpected water requirements of sea snakes might also have important implications for understanding water balance in other important marine vertebrates such as sea turtles.  This project will foster international collaborations and create opportunities for training and exchange of graduate students between the United States, Costa Rica, and Australia.",

We use marine snakes (sea snakes) as our study model because these lineages display a combination of characteristics that are important for such a transition.  All marine reptiles, including sea snakes, possess salt-secreting glands that are accessory to the kidney and help to maintain salt and water (osmotic) balance.  These glands excrete high concentrations of salt with minimal losses of water and therefore help to rid the body of excess salts, which invade the animal from the sea, either across the skin and exposed mucous membranes (such as the mouth) or in food and accidental swallowing of sea water during feeding.  \n            Maintaining osmotic balance poses a significant physiological challenge to marine vertebrates, because seawater is several-fold more salty than animal body fluids and access to fresh water is extremely limited in marine environments.  Our studies have shown that several species of sea snakes require fresh water, or very slightly brackish water, for their survival.  This finding is contrary to previously held ideas that sea snakes drink seawater and then excrete the excess salts to make a positive gain of water.  None of the species of sea snakes that we have investigated drink seawater.  They all gradually dehydrate in seawater and require a source of fresh water to remain in water balance.  Fresh water (or very dilute seawater) is available from springs and coastal rivers, or from a layer of freshly diluted ocean water that forms temporarily on the surface of the sea during heavy rains.  \nThe various lineages of marine snakes vary significantly in their degree of emancipation from the terrestrial environment.  The lineages known as  \u00e6true sea snakes\u00c6 that we are investigating represent the group of snakes that are most specialized to survive in the ocean with limited availability of fresh water.  We find that the abundance and distribution of sea snakes is partly determined by the availability of fresh water, including rainfall.  Nonetheless, sea snakes are also characterized by having high tolerance of dehydration as well as adaptations that resist dehydration in seawater.  We have shown that some species of sea snakes living in regions having prolonged seasonal droughts spend much of their lives in a partially dehydrated state.  \nOur results further show that salinity is one of the more prominent physical factors which affect the oceanic distribution of the four lineages of marine snakes.  Additionally, our results suggest that the number of species of marine snakes in a given oceanic area is dependent on the average water salinity and, importantly, on the yearly variation of salinity in the area.  The variation of salinity reflects the influence of rainfall.  Finally, we show that species having very effective salt-gland function (high secretion rates of highly concentrated salts) tolerate higher levels of seawater salinity within their range and also are able to exploit a larger range of oceanic habitats.\n            Overall, this study highlights how some of the better marine-adapted vertebrates evolved to live in the ocean while having varying dependencies on sources of fresh water.  This is significant because sea snakes may well serve as harbingers of climatic changes that will influence pa..."
