This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project will prepare  a diverse group of new Ph.D.s to have a comprehensive perspective on the biorefining industry. IGERT graduate student trainees will form interdisciplinary core teams encompassing the technological, agricultural, and socioeconomic issues of an aspect of biorefining. Dissertation projects will be conducted with overlapping faculty supervisory committee membership, regular joint meetings, and dissertation chapter(s) and publications addressing the collaborative, integrated research issues and results. New learning opportunities are provided in the classroom, seminars, workshops, certificate programs, and field experiences. This learning will be mutually deepened for trainees and undergraduates through research mentorship opportunities. International education opportunities will be available with partners in Europe and Brazil. This project will result in new technologies and practices that will improve the sustainability of the conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals. As a result of this program, decisions regarding biorefining will be guided not only by technological and/or agricultural feasibility but also by the holistic impact on society. Graduates of this IGERT program will be uniquely prepared to have high-impact careers and to contribute to the biorefining industry through their personal appreciation of the diverse aspects of biorefining. IGERT trainees will have harvested biomass in the field hands-on, discussed and advanced technical and engineering issues, and pondered the impact of their actions on humanity and the environment.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.\r\n",

This will require the cross-disciplinary efforts of scientists and engineers with an appreciation for the complexity of the societal, technological, and scientific issues involved.  This NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) project entitled \"From Crops to Commuting: integrating social, technological, and agricultural aspects of renewable and sustainable biorefining\" (I-STAR)at Kansas State University has prepared a significant number of PhD graduates (termed IGERT Fellows) to have a comprehensive perspective on the biorefining industry.

IGERT Fellows have harvested biomass in the field hands-on, discussed and advanced technical and engineering issues, and pondered the impact of their actions on humanity and the environment.  Through involvement of many undergraduate researchers, the impact of the project has been vastly enlarged.\n\nHighlights from the research performed here will be briefly listed. \n\nA new technology for fertilizer production using solar energy was investigated.  Fundamental thermodynamic research was converted to an integrated techno-economic process evaluation and applied engineering continues to bring this approach to fruition. \n\nThe complex interactions o fertilization and nitrous oxide emissions from soil were investigated, and these results inform future modeling and projections for decision-making in regard to bioenergy or bio-based materials production.\n\nHighly valuable original data on the decision making of farmers in regard to producing crops for bio-energy or biomaterials on their land was obtained through a socio-economic study where a representative number of Kansas farmers were personally interviewed.  The previously assumed price ranges for biomass production for fuels and biomaterials have to be corrected based on these results since the sociological and economical factors driving the decisions of farmers were not sufficiently taken in account.\n\nAll of the highlighted results above were achieved through collaboration of interdisciplinary teams of students and faculty.  Annual conferences, weekly interdisciplinary meetings, and many personal collaborations were supported by this project and will have an enduring impact through the people that experienced these events, and through the connections that were made.  Many graduate and undergraduate students received awards and recognition for their achievements.\n\nIn summary, the IGERT I-STAR project enriched the human capital base for ..."
