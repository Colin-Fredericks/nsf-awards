However, the realization of new scientific insights from this data is limited by the difficulty of creating scalable applications due to the lack of easy-to-use programming models and tools. To address challenges in creating data intensive applications, the project will build an extensible language framework, backed by an expressive collection of high-performance libraries (I/O and analytic), to provide a development environment in which multiple domain-specific language extensions allow programmers and scientists to more easily and directly specify solutions to data-intensive problems as programs written in domain-adapted languages.  The project will build on recent attribute grammar research to build an extensible specification of C to host domain-specific language extensions which will also address the inadequate performance in storage, I/O and analysis capabilities in low-level language such as C. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed extensible language and library framework has the potential to be a transformative problem solving environment for programmers and scientists since it allows scalable and efficient solutions to data-intensive problems to be specified at a high-level of abstraction.  The resulting language framework and libraries will be freely available to researchers writing applications for climate and other applications involving spatio-temporal data.  This includes many applications in the physical sciences and engineering and thus it is expected that the framework will find use in other scientific domains as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
