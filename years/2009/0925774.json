 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project objective: The objective of this project is to conduct theoretical and experimental research on the dispersion properties of nanostructured resonance elements.  Fundamentally new types of dispersive devices using leaky-mode resonance effects in subwavelength photonic lattices will be designed, fabricated, and tested. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This project charts new directions in photonic device technology based on nanostructured subwavelength elements.  The proposed devices are unexploited in slow-light engineering.  This project will define their applicability.  Computations show that leaky-mode resonance devices compare favorably with leading concepts in the field.  Although based on totally different fundamentals, in structure and device density, the proposed concept is similar to photonic-crystal based micro-resonator chips whose fabrication is particularly challenging.  It appears that the proposed leaky-mode resonance delay lines can be fabricated more directly.  Additionally, the elements show flat transmission spectra across useful bands.  Detailed comparison requires fabrication and testing of prototype devices.  As very little is currently known about these effects in the context of slow light, this project constitutes basic research.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: If the research verifies the practicality of these concepts, this work can have a major impact in promoting new device technology.  Very compact optical delay lines, signal buffers in all-optical communication systems, and light-storage elements would become feasible.  Moreover, this project is aligned with a broad plan to develop research and education in photonic nanostructures at the University of Texas at Arlington.  It will strengthen research in photonic crystals and integrated photonic circuits and support efforts in building nanofabrication methods and infrastructure.  With the principal investigator?s recent appointment to the Texas Instruments Distinguished University Chair in Nanoelectronics, major funding for equipment and facilities was provided.  This project, which seeks mainly student salary support, would thus enhance the use of new, modern facilities.  Therefore, the proposed project provides excellent analytical and experimental experience for both graduate and undergraduate students.  There is special focus on recruiting female students as well as students belonging to populations that are underrepresented in science and engineering and converting them into new graduate students.  In addition, the principal investigator is Chief Technical Officer of Resonant Sensors Incorporated, a start-up company developing new sensor technology.  As part of his duties under the Texas Instruments Chair, he will teach a yearly course on entrepreneurship and business, open to all undergraduate and graduate students, to stimulate innovation and technology transfer.  The results of this research will be widely disseminated in journals and conferences.  As there is currently a heavy worldwide emphasis on the study of periodic layers and lattices, new publications and results, illustrating the interesting effects and applications realized in the leaky-mode regime, might stimulate additional research and technological progress.\r\n\r\n",
