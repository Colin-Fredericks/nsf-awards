 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Jenny McCahill of the University of California - Santa Barbara as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. McCahill will synthesize metal sub-nanoparticles from molecular precursors, and investigate the reactions of supported particles in catalytic reactions with alkanes.  McCahill will work in collaboration with scientists at University of California - Santa Barbara, and with collaborators at Argonne National Laboratory, the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT) and the Advanced Photon Source.  In her plan for broadening participation, Dr. McCahill will work with junior-high school level students and teachers, teaching them about new frontiers in the chemical sciences, including the catalytic applications of nanoscience, through hands-on activities.  She will collaborate in this activity with Robert Cota and Phyllis Brady of the Mathematics, Engineering and Science Achievement (MESA) program at UCSB.  Junior high schools selected will be ones in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties with a high population of Hispanic students.\r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. McCahill is aimed at developing new kinds of materials for catalysis.  Catalysts are important in industry, since they allow the synthesis of molecules and materials with desirable properties at reduced cost.  The ultimate aim of research like this is to develop better catalysts for industrial processes.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. McCahill are aimed at increasing the participation of young people from underrepresented groups in the sciences.\r\n",
