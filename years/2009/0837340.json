This is helping students to understand the complex and context-bounded nature of engineering problem-solving, to apply their scientific knowledge to design practices, to build justification and argumentation skills in the context of engineering design, and to evaluate and reflect upon their design process and products. The approach is based on the construct of personal epistemology, and it focuses on open-mindedness, justification, and argumentation skills and on reflective thinking since these factors are strongly related to students' innovative ability in solving engineering problems.   The evaluation effort is using an analysis of student writings and questionnaires to monitor improvements in students' ill-defined problem solving skills and their epistemic growth.  The investigators are disseminating their material and results through conference presentations, journal publications, postings on their institution's website and on the Case-Based e-Learning website.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of their material and results and the increased student awareness of societal issues in an engineering context.",
