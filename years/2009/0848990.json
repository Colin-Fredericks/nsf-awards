 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create and test a working semantic search platform using Search Maps to represent users' Search intent.  The effort will extend the ontology used in Phase I and build a complete system for generating high quality search results for typical searches. The recommendation architecture uses the similarity between Search Maps to introduce users to websites already discovered by others with similar Search Maps. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will enable a new type of semantic search called User-driven Search, creating a new Search-enabled layer on top of the World Wide Web. As new way for users to manage, express, and resolve their Searches anywhere on the Internet, Search Maps create a new metaphor for helping users get more value out of the World Wide Web, no matter where they go. Coordinating queries and Search results provides immediate value as an enhanced Search tracking service. Allowing users to seamlessly send their Search Map to any provider would allow users to shortcut the traditional search and navigation paradigm at any and every website they visit.  The implications for e-commerce and enterprise search are significant.",
