 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this GOALI award is to develop and evaluate methods to support natural human interaction with digital CAD models with a focus on simulating manual assembly tasks in an immersive virtual environment. A hybrid method is developed which combines voxel-based collision detection and haptic rendering with enforcement of geometric constraints. An intelligent algorithm to manage the tradeoffs between the voxel-based collision detection and the enforcement of geometric constraints is a key component of this research. Evaluation will include both controlled experiments with students and a protocol analysis of the impact of the system on John Deere employees. The affordance of physical assembly provided by the virtual environment and the potential impact this capability has on the work actions of John Deere engineers will be examined. The participation of the Deere employees is a key component of this research as the system's application to a real-world manufacturing context could not be assessed without the active participation and close collaboration of our industrial collaborators. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will have significant impact on engineering design and manufacturing.  It will open many doors for the use of virtual reality as a product prototyping tool. In the design process, for example, design for assembly relies on designing to accommodate an operator?s ability to use tools, position components, attach parts, and reorient assemblies. All of these actions rely on humans interacting naturally with product geometry. Faster, easier prototyping through natural interaction with CAD models is a key component for achieving better product designs at reduced cost. Design for maintenance and training will also be positively impacted by this research. The results of the research will be disseminated broadly through journal papers, conference presentations, and demonstrations at technical meetings. Outreach in the form of hands-on demonstrations and workshop activities are planned for K-12 students through collaborations with the Program for Women in Science and Engineering and the Society of Women Engineers student section. Women and underrepresented groups will be recruited as part of the research team through partnerships with an existing ISU NSF Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate program and an ISU NSF Research for Undergraduates Site program.",
