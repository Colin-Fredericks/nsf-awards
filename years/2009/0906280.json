The overall aim of the project is the development of a\r\ngeneral framework for studying nonlinear elliptic equations\r\nappearing in symplectic geometry.  Many of the problems in\r\nsymplectic geometry, like the Gromov-Witten theory and the\r\nSymplectic Field Theory, are based on the study of the moduli\r\nspaces of the first order nonlinear elliptic equations. These\r\nmuduli spaces exhibit lack of compactness, however, they have\r\nnontrivial compactification.  In the project, Wysocki jointly\r\nwith Hofer and Zehnder continues the development of a new general\r\nFredholm theory, which takes place in new smooth spaces called\r\npolyfolds. This general Fredholm theory has all the properties of\r\nthe classical Fredholm theory, but is more flexible and\r\napplicable to problems with lack of compactness. In the project,\r\nthe general Fredholm theory on polyfolds is applied to the\r\nGromow-Witten theory and to the Symplectic Field Theory. In\r\nanother part of the proposal, we use the theory of\r\npseudholomorphic curves and the theory of generating functions to\r\nstudy multiplicity of closed characteristics on weakly\r\ndynamically convex energy surfaces.\r\n\r\nSymplectic geometry has its origin in classical mechanics.  For\r\nexample, the motion of the planetary system can be described by a\r\nsystem of nonlinear differential equations called Hamiltonian\r\nsystems. The flow lines of Hamiltonian systems follow very\r\ncomplex patterns. Hence it is of importance to get better\r\nunderstanding of Hamiltonian flows on its energy surfaces. The\r\ndevelopment of the general Fredholm theory on polyfolds will put\r\nthe Symplectic Field Theory on solid analytical foundations. The\r\nmethods developed in this project should have applications to\r\nlarger classes of nonlinear partial differential equations of\r\nrelevance in differential geometry and physics.\r\n",
