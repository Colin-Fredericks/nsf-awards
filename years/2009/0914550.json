 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).   \r\n\r\nGeoCORPS is a partnership between the Yale Peabody Museum's after school program \"Evolutions\", Yale geoscience faculty, and the LSAMP program at the University of Connecticut. The aim of the GeoCORPS program is to provide a diverse group of Grades 9 - 12 students with a comprehensive pipeline that comprises multiple opportunities to explore the geosciences and geoscience careers together with access to the skills and support needed for college matriculation. Specific goals are: (1) Promote geoscience and general science literacy by expanding each student's geoscience and science knowledge base and empower them to consider critically relevant questions in these areas; (2) Create experiences that facilitate students' understanding of the importance of college preparation and their eventual transition to the college environment.    \r\n\r\nThis program combines meaningful geoscience research and learning experiences with the college and career-focused curriculum of an established after school program and the opportunity for employment training and experience. Project activities will include: (a) a curriculum unit centered around the exploration of STEM majors and careers with a specific focus on the geosciences that includes career research, interviews with college admissions staff, and field trips to colleges; (b) development of videos on an earth science standard for elementary school students and a museum exhibit; (c) paid geosciences internships for high school students and LSAMP students; (d) laboratory visits and behind-the-scenes collection tours at Yale and UConn;  (e) participation in a \"career ladder\" program in which students will learn to interpret the Museum's new geology gallery and host floor experiments for the public gradually working their way up to paid work; (f) mentoring by Yale and UConn LSAMP students. The program serves 40 high school students from the New Haven Public School system, their families and communities; Museum visitors; and 4 Yale students and 4 LSAMP students from UConn.",
