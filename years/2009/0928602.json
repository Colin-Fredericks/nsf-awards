 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to reduce the uncertainty of machining models through the use of wireless sensors embedded in the cutting tool.  The approach is to investigate methods for in-situ model calibration, performed with sufficient frequency, such that model accuracy is maintained within acceptable error bounds.  Methods based on cutting power, time domain force and torque signals, and frequency domain signals will be explored.  New sensor technology using wireless Bluetooth transmission of tool mounted sensors will be investigated to measure cutting torque and force.  Linearity, signal to noise ratios, and cross talk will be evaluated.  Time synchronization of the wireless sensor data with the machine process data will be necessary to perform accurate model calibrations.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will greatly improve the reliability of machine tools by giving them a self-knowledge of their process capabilities.  Methods for decreasing model uncertainty will improve the utility of physics based models for computer numerical control process planning leading to greater part quality and higher machining efficiency.  Machining strategies and cutting conditions (spindle speeds and feeds) can be chosen to appropriately reflect the current capabilities of the machine tool.  Wireless sensors will be developed which will be broadly used in both industry and academic research.  This project is consistent with the goals of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Integrated Manufacturing Initiative, a public/private consortium of industry, academic, and government partners designed to strengthen the nation's manufacturing community.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this research is to reduce the uncertainty of machining models through the use of a wireless cutting tool sensor for in-situ model calibration, performed with sufficient frequency, such that model accuracy is maintained within acceptable error bounds.  New sensor technology using wireless transmission of tool mounted sensors is investigated to measure cutting torque and force.  The basis for a real-time milling force control and tool wear monitoring system is also explored using an open architecture CNC machine.\n\nA wireless Smart Tool sensor has been created that can measure tangential and radial cutting force with precision and accuracy compariable to that of a Kistler bed dynamometer.  It is less intrusive than the Kistler but is bandwidth limited by the tools natural frequency.  Currently, it is only capable of sampling and transmitting one channel of data at any given time, and is limited to a single cutting tooth.\n\nWe have shown that a calibration method based on the cutting force profile can be used to obtain force estimates that are generally equal to and sometimes better than results obtained with an average force based method.  The advantage of the proposed method is that calibration can be performed under conditions in which the average chip thickness of the cutting process is invariant.\n\nThe force probability distribution function of model predicted peak milling forces are presented in this study for the purpose of process planning.  Distributions are found for aluminum 6061, stell 1018, stainless steel 304 and titanium grade 2.  Utilizing a normal distribution, three standard deviations away from the mean defines a force level greater than 99.8% of the forces encountered during actual machining.  For process planning, the cutting conditions should be set such that the estimated peak forces are 5-17% less than the maximum forces that would cause tool damage or excessive deflection.  This reflects the uncertainty of the force model.\n\nA significant number of tool wear tests have been performed on the CNC machine to investigate tool wear monitoring algorithms.  A new method to monitor end milling tool wear in real-time was created by tracking force model coefficients during the cutting process.  The behavior of these coefficients are shown to be independent from the cutting conditions and correlated with the wear state of the cutting tool.  A number of experiments with different workpiece materials are run to invetigate the feasibility of tool wear monitoring.  We show that this method can be used in real-time to track tool wear and detect the transition point from the gradual wear region to the failure region in which the rate of wear accelerates.\n\nThe broader impact of our work is the improvement of machine tool reliability through self-knowledge of their process capabilities.  Methods for decreasing model uncertainty will improve the utility of physics based models for CNC process planning and control, leading to greater part quality and higher machining efficiency.  Machining strategies and cutting conditions can be chosen/adjusted to appropriately reflect the current capablities of the machine tool.  Wireless sensors will help with on-line monitoring and control of the cutting process, with the hope of broad use in both industry and academic research.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barry K Fussell"
