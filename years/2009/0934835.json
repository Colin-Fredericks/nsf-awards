 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trinity University has a nationally recognized M.A.T. program that uses an apprenticeship model for teacher preparation that is firmly grounded in research. The program produces high-quality teachers and then nurtures them by partnering closely with area schools. The Noyce scholarship program is bringing a necessary financial aid component to this strong and growing program in math and science education at Trinity. With prior Noyce support, Trinity University's M.A.T. program doubled the number of STEM majors graduating with a combined BS/MAT and teacher certification. With support from this Phase 2 Noyce award, the M.A.T. program is awarding scholarships of $15,000 to 5-8 students per year, resulting in certification of 20 additional STEM teachers. The program is also awarding 4 summer internships per year to rising sophomores and juniors majoring in STEM and with an expressed interest in education. Internship options include helping faculty to develop materials for outreach activities in local San Antonio schools, tutoring in an Upward Bound program, and research apprenticeships with STEM faculty. Recruitment of students via web and print communication, recruitment events at the university and local colleges, and a new education course in \"Policy and Practice in Urban Education\" is bolstered by ongoing education of STEM advisors, career counselors and financial aid staff about the Noyce program. After submitting an application, letters of reference and undergoing several interviews, Noyce Scholars are selected based on GPA, intellectual and pedagogical potential as evidenced by references and interviews, and the candidate's ability to be an effective role model for students in San Antonio area schools. All Noyce Scholars are assigned both STEM faculty and Education faculty mentors. During the first three years of teaching, their STEM and Education faculty mentors continue to provide support, particularly through support groups and summer workshops for new teachers. A new induction support program also provides in-class coaching to science and math teachers. Expanded and extended evaluation efforts are focusing on such critical aspects of program implementation as recruitment, analysis of teacher quality and student achievement, and factors that affect Noyce scholars' retention as teachers, particularly in high needs schools. San Antonio's K-12 students already benefit intellectually from the quality and stability of Trinity's well-prepared teachers; the Robert Noyce program is expanding these benefits significantly in the area of the STEM disciplines. By increasing both the quantity and quality of math and science teachers in the San Antonio area, the Robert Noyce program at Trinity is having the following impacts: better STEM instruction for urban high-need K-12 schools with high (up to 90%) Hispanic enrollment; a reduced rate of out-of-field teaching in STEM disciplines (currently estimated to be as high as 40% in high-poverty schools); an improved retention rate for beginning science and math teachers; and an increase in the number of talented scientists and mathematicians who opt for careers in teaching. The need for the kind of high-quality teacher-leaders that Trinity produces is acute in San Antonio's high-need schools.",
