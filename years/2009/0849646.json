 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sex determination occurs during embryonic life and is the process by which the gonad initiates testis or ovary development. In mammals, the sex determination cascade is governed by a genetic switch. However, in most reptiles, this critical process is controlled by the incubation temperature of the egg and may be vulnerable to climate change. The link between temperature and testis or ovary developmental pathways has not yet been elucidated. To investigate the hypothesis that the cascade of signals downstream of genetic and environmental switches is the same across vertebrates, this lab will develop the methodology to culture and manipulate turtle gonads in vitro. These assays will advance our understanding of how temperature influences testis or ovary development in reptiles, which will be important for conservation of these species. An optimized protocol for gonad culture will be made freely available to other labs in the field. This project also affords outstanding teaching and outreach opportunities as undergraduate and high school students are commonly recruited to participate. The lab will continue to work with Durham's Project SEED program to give underprivileged and minority high school students a chance to be involved in this fascinating line of research.",
