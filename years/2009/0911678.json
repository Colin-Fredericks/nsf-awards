 "awd_abstract_narration": "In July 2009, the twenty-first international conference entitled\r\nFormal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC) will be held\r\nat the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation of the Johannes\r\nKepler University in Linz, Austria.  As in the past, there will be\r\nnine plenary speakers, about twenty-five contributed talks, and two\r\nposter/software demonstration sessions.  The continuing success of the\r\nannual FPSAC conferences stems in part from their considerable\r\ninterdisciplinary breadth---linking leading researchers in\r\ncombinatorial mathematics with strong researchers in allied fields\r\nsuch as pure and applied mathematics, computer science, physics, and\r\nbiology.  The span of this conference series is unique among\r\ninternational conferences with an emphasis on combinatorial\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs well as its breadth, a second distinguishing characteristic of\r\nFPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to recognize and encourage\r\noutstanding young scientists.  This is accomplished in part by\r\nchoosing at least one plenary speaker to be an ``emerging'' star and\r\nby ensuring that talented young researchers are well represented among\r\nthe speakers selected for contributed talks.  Another special feature\r\nof the FPSAC conferences is a continuing effort to emphasize\r\ninclusiveness among participants.  The conference seeks to draw\r\nsubstantial participation from groups which have been traditionally\r\nunder-represented in the mathematical sciences.  FPSAC 2009 will be an\r\nexcellent opportunity for these students and junior researchers to\r\nmake both domestic and international contacts that will be of great\r\nvalue in their developing careers. This grant support their\r\nattendence. Additionally, because of the variety of past locations\r\n(2008: Chile, 2007: China, for example), FPSAC draws a truly\r\ninternational crowd.",
