 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical. This project addresses synthesis/processing of graphene; a range of studies involving variation in growth parameters and detailed characterization of film properties will be conducted to identify and understand growth mechanisms. Initially, reactive gases will be introduced as a background environment during annealing. Hydrogen is expected to perform some etching (perhaps of defects) during the annealing, whereas oxygen may act to getter impurities and/or assist in the removal of silicon from the surface. Additionally, carbon-containing gases such as propylene will be used to assess their potential for deposition of graphene on SiC. The resulting films will be characterized by atomic force microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and Auger electron spectroscopy, with optical and electrical characterization to be performed by collaborating researchers at Sarnoff Corp., Argonne National Lab, MIT Lincoln Labs, and Notre Dame University. Complementary studies on the detailed structure of the graphene/SiC interface will be performed by scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Modeling of those results using first-principles theory will be performed by collaborators at Ohio University. \r\nNon-Technical. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science having technological relevance. Societal benefits of the proposed research are potentially very large since graphene is a strong candidate material for extending electronics capabilities beyond the limits of silicon technology. The project will also provide interdisciplinary training to graduate students in the nanotechnology field. Additionally, the PI presents annual lectures to middle and high school students on Nanotechnology, as well as teaching a course on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. The graphene-related research of this proposal will be used to enhance the content of these lectures, providing students with an example of a current research topic in Nanotechnology. The course includes a laboratory component, and development of a laboratory exercise dealing with graphene exfoliation and observation is planned. \r\n",
