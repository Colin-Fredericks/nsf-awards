The multi-university center is currently comprised of Virginia Tech (lead institute), University of Central Florida and University of Massachusetts-Amherst.  Carnegie Mellon University is slated to join as a full partner in 2009. The mission and vision of the NSF Center for e-Design is to serve as a national Center of Excellence in IT-enabled design and realization of manufactured products. \r\n\r\nThe University of Central Florida's (UCF) participation is vital to the overall success of the Center.  Continued research efforts at UCF will contribute to the development of a set of coordinated tools and practices that can support conceptual and detailed design requirements specification, as well as the development of a conceptual modeler that can be used to support iterative conceptual design.  The research efforts at UCF fully align with the Center?s long-term goal of serving as a Center for Excellence in IT-enabled conceptualization, design and realization of engineered products and systems.   \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center's renewal will enable UCF to continue its key research and leadership role in the Center, as well as contribute significantly to the successful development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students.  Benefits to students will include integration of resulting work into coursework and engineering curricula, as well as internship opportunities.  The center will provide a unique experience to students who can interact and collaborate with industrial researchers and engineers.  Research and educational findings will continue to be disseminated nationally and will have a significant impact on US industry as a whole.\r\n",
