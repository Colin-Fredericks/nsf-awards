 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this investigation, Dr. Robert Fesen and a graduate student will study the nearby supernova remnant Cassiopeia A.  This object was produced by the explosion of a massive star following the collapse of its inner core, and its proximity allows detailed study of gas velocities and the abundances of many chemical elements.  The main part of the work is the analysis of a large number of spectra obtained at the MDM Observatory near Tucson, Arizona.  The velocities derived from the spectra will be compared to the latest theoretical models of how gas is excited by shocks.  The goal is to create a complete map of all the ejecta, including both parts of the high velocity jets.  \r\n\r\nThe project will also assemble multiwavelength maps of Cassiopeia A for analysis by this and other research groups.  The study of this object is expected to have many important implications for the general phenomenon of core-collapse supernovae.  The bulk of the data will constitute the Ph.D. dissertation of the student.  The PI and his team will continue their extensive outreach activities to the public and to school groups.  \r\n",
