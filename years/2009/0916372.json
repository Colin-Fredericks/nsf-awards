 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers the unification of two view of language: that\r\nfrom natural language processing and that from linguistic typology.\r\nOur view is that typological information is both useful for solving\r\nreal-world natural language processing thats and automatically\r\nderivable from language data.  This research first explores how to use\r\ntypological knowledge to improve performance on problems such as\r\ndependency parsing and machine translation for low density langauges.\r\nIntuitively, our statistical models waste time exploring a hypothesis\r\nspace that is too big: the space of realistic grammars is much smaller\r\nthan the space of all grammars.  The second part of this research\r\nconsiders the automatic acquisition and boostrapping of typological\r\nknowledge from raw text.  The outcome of this research is: (a)\r\nimproved statistical models for hard natural language processing\r\nproblems; and (b) a larger library of typological universals that have\r\nbeen derived automatically from data.  Our outcomes are empirically\r\nevaluated on the raw language processing tasks and in terms of the\r\nquality of the universal implications mined from data, but comparing\r\nthem with known repositories of universals.  \r\n\r\nOur results will impact the fields of natural language processing and linguistics.  From the research side, this research will find applications in a wider variety of problems than the ones we intend to study; in particular, the use of linguistic universals in natural language processing technology\r\nwill fundamentally change the way multilinguality is addressed in this\r\nfield.  From a linguistics perspective, the goal of this project is to\r\nshed new light on linguistic universals.  This should impact not only\r\nthe area of typology, but also the study and preservation of\r\nendangered languages.  By automatically identifying typological\r\nfeatures and implications from data, the process of documenting\r\nendangered languages could be made more efficient: leading to a\r\nsmaller loss of knowledge of these languages.",
