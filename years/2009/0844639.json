WTEC and its predecessors have conducted over 60 such technology assessments since 1989. The objectives include seeking technologies to transfer to the U.S., evaluating the position of U.S. science and technology with respect to leading competitors, and seeking opportunities for international cooperation in research. \r\n\r\nThe project provides for four or more additional international studies and reporting of the results, plus one or more workshops in area related to international technology assessments. \r\n\r\nResults will be disseminated at workshops including copies of visual aids distributed in hardcopy and posted on the Web, final reports from each study tour of academic quality in hardcopy, CD, and Web media, plus at least one synthesis report on cross-cutting findings. A blog on international S&T policy will be published to report progress.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGeneral\n\nThis project provided information on research in other countries to help Americans stay Number One in science. Under this coop agreement, WTEC conducted 17 studies on many scientific fields. All included study tours to the world's leading labs. All produced reports now at http://wtec.org. All included public workshops  Most included videos now at http://tvworldwide.com. Papers by the WTEC staff provide overall findings and solutions.\n\nFindings\n\nWTEC findings have alerted the public to challenges to our science leadership. When the program started in 1990, the U.S. led in most fields of science. Over the years, WTEC has found that this leadership has declined. Now WTEC found that many fields are led by other countries. All science adds to man's welfare.  However, American research matters most for our jobs and our defense. By learning from our competitors, WTEC has found that we will be more prosperous and safer if we do more research here.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe WTEC studies were done by some of America's top scientists and engineers who used NSF's gold standard peer-review methods, including site visits to the world's best labs.  WTEC provides cross-cutting analysis of the results, and identifies solutions.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nWTEC studies helped support solutions like focused national projects, including the nanotechnology, materials, and BRAIN initiatives.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/24/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert D Shelton"
