They rely on harvesting heat by circulating\r\nwater through artificially stimulated fracture systems in deep\r\nhot dry rocks.  This project provides a predictive understanding\r\nof the mechanisms commonly used to generate these systems:\r\npressure- and temperature-driven fracture.  The modeling and\r\nanalysis are based on a variational fracture formulation, which\r\nhas been developed over the last ten years or so and has strong\r\nmathematical and mechanical foundations.  The investigator\r\nextends this formulation to dynamic fractures and improves its\r\nimplementation on parallel supercomputers.  He extends its scope\r\nby studying and implementing two approaches to the penalization\r\nof material interpenetration along crack lips.  He develops\r\nvariational models for the pressure- and temperature-driven\r\nfracture problems, approximates them using the idea of\r\nGamma-convergence, implements the regularized models on parallel\r\nsupercomputers, and conducts large scale realistic validation\r\nexperiments that are compared with existing engineering\r\nliterature.   This project is a first step in a nascent\r\nmulti-disciplinary initiative fostered through the Center for\r\nComputation and Technology at LSU, involving mathematicians,\r\ncomputational scientists, and engineers.  It supports the\r\nparticipation of two undergraduates and one graduate student per\r\nyear. \r\n\r\n     As the Nation strives to reduce its carbon footprint,\r\nprotect its economy from fluctuating oil prices, and increase its\r\nenergy independence, Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) represent\r\na virtually untapped, clean, renewable, economically viable and\r\nwidely available source of energy.  They rely on harvesting heat\r\nby circulating water through artificially stimulated, highly\r\nconnected fracture systems in deep hot dry rocks.  A recent\r\nMIT-led interdisciplinary assessment panel commissioned by the\r\nDepartment of Energy estimates that even without major technical\r\nbreakthroughs EGS could cover 20% of the estimated US electricity\r\nneeds by 2050, in an economically viable way and with only\r\nmarginal carbon emission and land use.  A major technical issue\r\nidentified in this report is the creation of sufficiently\r\nconnected fracture systems.  The investigator develops a\r\npredictive understanding of two mechanisms commonly used to\r\ngenerate these systems: pressure- and temperature-driven\r\nfracture, based on a mechanically faithful and mathematically\r\nsound variational formulation of fracture developed over the last\r\ndecade.  This model is extended to account for the specifics of\r\nEGS, then implemented on parallel supercomputers.  Large scale\r\nnumerical simulations are performed using the cyberinfrastructure\r\nprovided by the TeraGrid, to allow EGS designers to devise\r\nstimulation patterns maximizing the efficiency and sustainability\r\nof new systems.  This project is a first step in a nascent\r\nmulti-disciplinary initiative fostered through the Center for\r\nComputation and Technology at LSU, involving mathematicians,\r\ncomputational scientists, and engineers.  It supports each year\r\nthe participation of two undergraduates and one graduate student.",
