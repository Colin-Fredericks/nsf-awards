 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation of how molecules, the smallest particles of a substance, respond to very intense pulses of laser light. This is done to reveal the structure of molecules, and to understand how to actively force important molecules through processes that nature would normally not allow. The investigations will make use of a unique device, in which the number of molecules and the intensity of the light are precisely controlled. This innovative approach will allow the study of molecules in a reliable, exact, and accurate way --- beyond anything seen before in this field.\r\n\r\nThe molecules that are investigated are important building blocks of larger molecules. Such molecules are found, for instance, in the pharmaceutical industry, in biology, in environmental research, and also in outer space. On the human resources level, this project gives students in various phases of their education unique opportunities to work in a modern and professional research lab. They will work with state-of-the-art and highly specialized scientific equipment. Promoting scientific research, this gives students first hand experience which can help them decide whether a career in science or technology would be right for them.",
