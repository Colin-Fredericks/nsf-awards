 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nExperimental structure determination remains beyond the experience of most undergraduate students in spite of the central role X-ray crystallography plays in the understanding of materials and biomolecules. Rapid advances in instrumentation and computing power have created equipment that is both rugged enough to allow operation by the non-expert and powerful enough to collect data in a time scale compatible with a teaching environment. Few models exist for the incorporation of crystallographic data and techniques at all levels of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The key goals of this project are to: (1) develop a new model for integration of structural methods into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, (2) assess student engagement and learning when working with experimental structural data, (3) establish a local PUI user group to broaden the incorporation of X-ray diffraction methods and resources into the undergraduate curriculum, and (4) create interactive web-based materials for teaching crystallographic symmetry.\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project is creating a model for integration of structural methods into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Assessment is occurring at the local, regional and international level while each component of the project addresses the need for high quality resources for teaching structural methods. Connections with the STaRBURSTT CyberInstrumentation Consortium are being used to build on previous NSF-supported projects for the incorporation of X-ray structural methods into the undergraduate curriculum. The project builds upon the PI's previous NSF-CCLI project NSF-0536710, \"Visual-Spatial Learning: Development of an Interactive Web-Based Symmetry Tutorial,\" and makes use of the expertise of faculty in synthetic inorganic chemistry and lipid biochemistry.\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project is impacting students and faculty (1) locally through curricular development and implementation, (2) regionally through a PUI user group, (3) nationally through dissemination of the curricular products and their assessment, and (4) internationally through the development of web-based resources for teaching symmetry in crystallography. Faculty and students are being trained in aspects of crystal growth, X-ray data collection, and X-ray data analysis through laboratory exercises, courses, and workshops. The creation of a cyber-enabled shared use facility dedicated to undergraduate education is providing much needed infrastructure for teaching and undergraduate research in the central Ohio area. Finally, the details of the curricular development project and its evaluation will be disseminated through presentations at national meetings and publication in a chemical education journal.\r\n",
