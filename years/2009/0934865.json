 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two cohorts, each consisting of ten junior mathematics and science majors, are receiving three-year scholarships while they complete both undergraduate and masters degrees.  Annual scholarships of $10,600 and $14,000 are awarded during the undergraduate and graduate years respectively.  During the five year program the scholars fulfill the New York State teaching certification requirements.  The scholars' education is enhanced by intense field experiences in schools as well as internships in some of the informal learning institutions in New York City with a focus on science and mathematics.  The scholarship program builds on the work already begun through the Teacher Academy - a program that recruits and educates undergraduates using a cohort model to become STEM majors and secondary teachers.\r\n\r\nThe scholars clinical experiences and fulfillment of their service obligations primarily occur in the Brooklyn Public Schools.",
