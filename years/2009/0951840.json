 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to provide travel support for the Midwest Topology Seminar, a regional algebraic topology conference that has met approximately three times a year for more than forty years. This conference series brings together topologists from across the Midwest and from across the various subfields of topology, providing a forum for new results and trends in the field.  In the lifetime of the seminar, algebraic topology has developed links with geometric topology, algebraic geometry, number theory and physics.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this grant is to provide travel funding for graduate students and active researchers so that they may attend the Midwest Topology Seminar.  By inviting speakers from outside the region, and by providing a forum for Midwestern researchers to speak about their new results as soon as they occur, the Seminar allows regional topologists and geometers to stay abreast of the latest work in the field. The frequency with which the Seminar meets gives it an important role in both research and graduate education, since it allows teaching and collaboration among researchers and graduate students in the entire Midwest.  It is open to everyone who wishes to attend and to any Midwestern institution carrying out topological research.\r\n",
