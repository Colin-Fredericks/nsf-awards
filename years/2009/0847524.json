Such problems are fundamental in complex analysis and\r\ncomplex geometry, in tight relation to partial differential\r\nequations, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. The\r\nrecent progress and influx of new ideas from Ricci flow,\r\npluripotential theory and the minimal model program in algebraic\r\ngeometry have unravelled a deep, rich and unifying structure.\r\nThe PI will investigate the limiting behavior of the Kahler-Ricci\r\nflow and its connection to the classification theory for\r\nalgebraic varieties, inspired by Perelman's breakthrough in\r\nHamilton's program to resolve the geometrization conjecture by\r\nRicci flow. In particular, the PI aims to study the relation\r\nbetween the formation of finite time singularities of the\r\nKahler-Ricci flow and the algebraic surgery in the minimal model\r\nprogram in algebraic geometry. The PI also intends to continue\r\nhis study on canonical metrics of Einstein type on algebraic\r\nvarieties and understand the analytic and geometric aspects of\r\nthe singularities of such special metrics. The PI also plans to\r\nstudy the uniform approximation problem of the Monge-Ampere\r\ngeodesics in infinite dimensional symmetric space by those in the\r\nfinite dimensional Bergman spaces.  The precise understanding of\r\nthis problem will give new insight into Yau's conjecture on the\r\nrelation between Kahler-Einstein metrics and certain stability in\r\nthe sense of geometric invariant theory. The outcome of the\r\nproposed research will develop new tools and give profound\r\ninsights and understanding of geometry and the structure of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nProblems in the proposal arise naturally from our attempts to\r\nunderstand nonlinear differential equations from geometry and\r\nphysics. The solutions to these problems will have strong impact\r\non other fields of sciences such as physics and cosmology in the\r\ndeep understanding of our universe. The method of analyzing\r\nsingularities of nonlinear equations will have wide applications\r\nin physics, engineering and economics. Furthermore, the PI plans\r\nto disseminate the exciting research at the interface of geometry\r\nand analysis to a broad audience through lectures and\r\nworkshops. The proposed project will bring in research and\r\nteaching innovation in mathematics from various disciplines and\r\nhave an immediate beneficial effect on undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents at Rutgers as well as in the regional mathematical\r\ncommunity. The PI will also organize and participate in the\r\nintegrated research/education programs and activities that will\r\npromote the education level of the nation.\r\n",
