 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) at the University of California Santa Barbara will install a new compact storage system to house its historically significant and biologically important algae and plant collections.  The collections include some of the oldest algal material from the central California coast and a rich diversity of plants from threatened and unique habitats.  The specimens will be transferred from the existing 60-year-old cases into the new storage system, which will provide enhanced accessibility and organization.  During the transfer, each specimen will be examined for damage, new labels will be prepared, and misidentified specimens will be corrected.\r\n\r\nThe new compact storage system and curation will have important impacts on research, teaching and outreach programs at the university and in the broader community. Scientists worldwide and the large environmental consulting community on the central coast that uses CCBER's resources will benefit from the increased accessibility and organization.  CCBER will also train graduate and undergraduate students in specimen preparation, curation, and the use of the collections as well as engaging local elementary students in activities focused on the plant and algae specimens.",

We had over twenty students apply for the internship the first quarter!  Under the direction of CCBER staff and faculty, the students mounted specimens and assisted with curation of the collections.\n\nWe received a Research Experience for Undergraduates Supplement (REU) as part of our NSF grant.  The REU student worked under the guidance of the PI and project staff to learn about and work on the curation and conservation of plant specimens and to provide a leadership role for the Kids in Nature (KIN) environmental education program.\n\n Since beginning this project, over 1200 K-12 students, faculty, consultants, community members, undergraduate and graduate students have used the collections due to the increased accessibility and organization of the herbarium specimens.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer Thorsch"
