 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project DESERT (Developing Expertise in Science Education, Research, and Technology) supports cohorts of academically promising, financially needy, underrepresented students majoring in biological or environmental sciences. Students benefit from cohort classes, a Learning Community, a natural history field trip, and scientific meetings. Faculty mentors and a Science Academic Coordinator provide individualized academic planning. Academic coaches help students succeed, especially in chemistry and mathematics. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Project DESERT adds to the body of knowledge on effective advisement, retention, and support for underrepresented populations, particularly Hispanics. It is improving student retention, enhancing students' general self efficacy, increasing the number of declared majors in science by 100%, and improving efficiency of course taking for degree completion among cohort students. It is deepening the knowledge of science among underrepresented students through a mentored learning community, cohort interactions, research like experiences, and scientific field trips. Longitudinal learning and value added assessment using the Community College Learning Assessment is comparing cohort to non-cohort students with regard to development of critical thinking, analytic reasoning, problem solving and written communication.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Project DESERT responds to an urgent community and national need for a scientifically literate, technically competent workforce. It is enhancing the diversity of the scientific community through its focus on underrepresented populations. It is strengthening partnerships among industry, state and federal agencies, the college, and universities and thereby increasing the number of students prepared for scientifically technical jobs and/or upper division studies. Research is being conducted to determine and address forces that keep students from declaring majors in biology or environmental science.  \r\n\r\n",
