 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent models suggest that the middle crust beneath the high Tibetan \r\nPlateau flows southward toward India because of the difference in \r\ntopography between Tibet and India; the models further suggest that this \r\nextruding material emerges at Earths surface in the high-erosion area \r\nof the Himalaya. These models make specific predictions about how the \r\nflow varies in magnitude and direction with depth. This project uses \r\nstructural geology and geochronology to test these predictions to see \r\nwhether the models are correct, and if they are not, how the models \r\nmight be refined. This is an important test to conduct because the \r\nIndia?Asia collision is Earths largest ongoing continent collision and \r\nserves as an important lens for viewing older continental collisions that \r\nhappened throughout Earths history.\r\n\r\nResearchers Jeff Lee of Central Washington University, Bradley Hacker\r\n from the University of California Santa Barbara, and their students will \r\ninvestigate the spatial and temporal distribution of kinematics, \r\nvorticity, finite strain, and deformation temperature in strongly \r\ndeformed middle crustal rocks exposed in the North Himalayan gneiss \r\ndomes, southern Tibet, using structural petrology, finite-strain \r\nanalysis, electron-backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and metamorphic \r\nmonazite geochronology. This research is motivated by recently \r\nformulated thermal, mechanical channel flow/extrusion models that \r\npostulate that the middle crust exposed in the high Himalaya and \r\nsouthern Tibet was a low-viscosity, ductile material, bounded above and \r\nbelow by coeval normal- and thrust-sense shear zones, respectively, that \r\nflowed and extruded to the south. Flow within a channel can range from \r\npure Couette flow to Poiseuille flow, or be a combination of the two. \r\nThe investigators and their students will document the deformation and \r\ntiming during ductile flow to provide a comprehensive spatial, thermal, \r\nand temporal history of deformation and flow in middle crustal rocks \r\nin southern Tibet. These studies, combined with similar published and \r\nongoing studies in the high Himalaya, will provide an unprecedented \r\nview of middle crustal flow parallel to the transport direction over \r\na distance of 50 to 100 km.",
