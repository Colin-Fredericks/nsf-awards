 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of computational systems that support group decisions, allocate resources to distributed tasks, or mediate social interactions is fundamentally different from the corresponding design problem serving individual or centralized users.  When multiple parties, or agents, are involved, the designer's objectives are complicated by the fact that the interests of these parties are rarely, if ever, perfectly aligned. The field of mechanism design offers a theoretical framework that directly addresses the issue of incentives as it relates to the design of multiagent systems.  However, this purely analytical approach carries with it inherent practical limitations. The investigators introduce a new approach, empirical mechanism design (EMD), whose premise is to extend the basic foundation of mechanism design with empirical methods such as simulation and statistical analysis. These extensions promise to dramatically expand the scope of mechanism design beyond the small-scale, stylized, or idealized domains to which it has been predominantly limited to date.\r\n\r\nThe project will investigate several concrete EMD problems, within the general theme of market design. Improved market design has significant implications for the public and private sectors.  In public policy, market-based approaches are likely to play a major role in, for example, instituting measures to cope with climate change, banking reform and regulation, and adoption of new energy sources.  In the commercial domain, new markets for advertising placement, computational services, and other goods will also entail significant mechanism design efforts.  Regardless of the sector, design outcomes bear on important social objectives including efficiency, transparency, and stability (e.g., of financial relationships). An empirical basis for evaluating candidate mechanisms will complement existing theoretical perspectives, enriching the tools available to designers and other stakeholders.",

This collaborative project produced a variety of technical and methodological advances in empirical mechanism design, through investigation of several applications.  This report highlights two of them.\n\n\nThe first application area is sponsored search advertising, which has developed over the last decade or so into a major industry.  Advertising funds most content of the Internet, and ads in search engines are a major component.  To study strategic issues in sponsored search advertising, we developed a research competition based on an search advertising bidding scenario.

International TAC/AA tournaments were held annually from 2009-2013, yielding numerous advances and facilitating cross-fertilization of bidding strategy ideas across researchers.  The TAC/AA software is freely available, and has been employed in class projects at several universities.\n\n\nThe second highlighted outcome is a major advance in strategies for bidding in simultaneous auctions.  Dealing with simultaneous markets is a central problem in automated trading (e.g., in finance or e-commerce), which comes up whenever the buyer or seller's value for a good depends on other goods traded.
