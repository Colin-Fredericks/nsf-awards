The workshop effort is being guided by an organizing committee and involves representatives from many of the leading programs along with evaluation experts from academia, the federal government, and the broader research community.  A pre-workshop web-based survey is being used to capture the existing vision and goals, learning outcomes, evaluation methods and data.  The workshop agenda includes efforts to identify and refine thematic groupings of learning outcomes and explore evaluation strategies for each grouping and efforts to develop an online forum to establish a continuing virtual community.  Material from the workshop is being posted on a website and presented ASEE conference and publications.",
