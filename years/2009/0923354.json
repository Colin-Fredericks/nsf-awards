Fargo\r\n\r\n\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary  \r\nThis project from North Dakota State University aims for acquisition of a remotely operable analytical field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, along with specimen preparation equipment. These instruments for shared use will support state-of-the-art imaging and microanalysis, as well as research training, classroom education, and outreach. The NDSU Electron Microscopy Center is a multidisciplinary multi-user facility. The current SEMs at the center are not FE instruments and thus have limited application in several material systems.  A FE instrument will allow high resolution imaging at lower voltages suitable for such material systems. Versatile high-resolution SEM imaging and microanalysis are essential to support current research in areas including medicinal chemistry, nanomaterials, nanocomposites, polymeric coatings, biomaterials, tissue engineering, environmental engineering, and also biological materials such as soft and hard tissues. Remote operation will benefit the largest possible number of scientists and potential scientists. The proposed equipment will also be a much-needed resource for NDSU's new PhD program in Materials and Nanotechnology. The FE SEM will also support local and regional industries. The FE SEM will provide hands-on experience to broaden opportunities for research, training, and outreach for faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates from NDSU and other area colleges, and K-12 teachers and students. The proposed instrumentation will strengthen participation in North Dakota?s EPSCoR NATURE (Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Education) initiative, an effort with the state?s five tribal colleges designed to increase interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics among Native American high-school students. \r\n\r\nLayman Summary\r\nThe proposed equipment for high-resolution field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) will promote growth and integration of education, research, and technological industry in novel areas of materials and biological research. The new FE-SEM will be a necessary addition to the suite of electron microscopes at NDSU electron microscopy center. The current requested instrument will provide high resolution at lower voltages and thus enhancing imaging and microanalysis research in soft materials (polymers and polymeric nanocomposites) and biological nanomaterials (soft tissues etc.) research with minimal beam damage to the samples. Extensive educational impact will be realized with installation of this equipment, at NDSU and the region, to researchers, students and remote accessibility and operation to K-12 students, Native American college and school students etc. Extensive integration and synergy with existing outreach and educational programs at NDSU will be realized. These programs will benefit from the remote accessibility and operation of this instrumentation.",
