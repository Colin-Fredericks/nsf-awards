 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maryland Public Television (MPT), in partnership with the Math Forum at Drexel University and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), is establishing an elementary math pathway as part of the National STEM Education Distributed Learning program (NSDL). The primary target audience for MathPath is elementary classroom teachers and specialists, including coaches and supervisors. Additional audiences include higher educators involved in teacher preparation and parents. The overarching goal of MathPath is: 1) to make high-quality digital mathematics content available to the target audience; and 2) to contextualize the resources so that educators can easily incorporate them into effective math instruction. To accomplish these goals, MPT is: 1) forming and strengthening collaborative relationships; 2) identifying content for inclusion in MathPath; 3) specifying requirements for the MathPath website; 4) developing, testing and refining the MathPath website; 5) developing MathPath professional development resources; 6) launching, promoting, and supporting the MathPath website; and 7) evaluating the implementation and outcomes of the MathPath project. \r\nIntellectual Merit: It is well recognized that the elementary grades are critical in building a strong foundation of mathematical knowledge that will lead to students' success in algebra and beyond. At the same time, it has become clear that many teachers who provide this instruction have weak math content knowledge and pedagogy. A well-designed NSDL Pathway can help increase the likelihood that elementary educators have the knowledge and instructional resources they need to teach math effectively and ensure the success of all students, including minority and other at-risk students. Using the capabilities of Web 2.0 provide the means for not only offering content but for involving users in a learning community built around a collection of high-quality resources. MathPath users are taking advantage of an interactive and participatory environment using such tools as blogs, wikis, podcasting, and digital video.\r\nBroader Impacts: To address the high level of concern about improving elementary math instruction, there is increasing interest in developing and certifying elementary math specialists. While formal recognition and certification of elementary math specialists is just now emerging, there are many educators who currently have the interest and are responsible for ensuring high-quality mathematics instruction for elementary students. This includes classroom teachers who only teach math, lead or resource teachers who spend most of their time coaching and mentoring classroom teachers, and district elementary math coordinators and supervisors. These are people who are likely to seek out quality resources and to share them with colleagues.  MathPath is filling an important position in the NSDL by aggregating high-quality content and providing the information and professional development that elementary educators need to use digital math content effectively. While there are numerous sources of content on the Web, there is no one trusted source for both digital content and opportunities to learn in the area of elementary mathematics education.",

In this transformative period, educators teach fewer concepts and \"go deeper\" in the subject.  As one educator we interviewed put it, the focus now is on mathematics, not arithmetic.

In a 2-year long series of case studies with math supervisors, specialists and coaches, the evaluation team documented the intellectual merit and broader impact of the Mathlanding project.  As one interview subject described it, the refocusing of mathematics instruction \"required a paradigm shift&mdash;you go from a skill in isolation to deeper thinking.\"  It was seen by the specialists interviewed as moving away from a workbook and a worksheet for teaching math, to making it engaging and conceptual based.  The textbook no longer served as the centerpiece of math instruction in many elementary schools.

As one math coach saw it, \"Teachers are interested, excited, afraid, and frustrated.

To further meet the needs of today\u00c6s educators, all content is aligned to both the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and the NCTM Content and Process Standards.
