The primary results from the workshop will be the definition of one or more open multidisciplinary competitions to identify and demonstrate practical, effective approaches to improving the overall level of information assurance for the public and private sectors in specific application domains. \r\nSince these kind of competitions are new to the field of computer security, it is necessary to hold a workshop to energize the community and to define just what would constitute effective competitions.\r\n",
