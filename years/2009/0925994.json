 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop magnetically-responsive, low-melting-point metal alloys (consisting of magnetic particles in a metal matrix) that can be manipulated remotely using a magnetic field. These materials will enable the movement of metal into vertical geometries and hard-to-reach locations to create three-dimensional small-scale assemblies. With a systematic study, this program will provide an understanding of reliable methods for synthesis and the effect of dispersions on the mechanical and electrical properties as well as the wetting and viscosity behavior. Lastly, this work will also investigate various 3D geometries that can be generated with these materials and explore magnetic-induction heating conditions best suited for these alloys.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide an opportunity to rapidly fabricate three-dimensional metallic structures. These alloys will display enhanced mechanical strength, by dispersion hardening, for strong interconnects and allow direct heating by magnetic induction. Such materials will benefit the fabrication and packaging of small-scaled devices. In addition to this research pursuit, this program will also seek opportunities to mentor and train future scientists and will make an effort to get schoolchildren engaged in science, with a fun science lecture series called, Science Saturdays (www.sciencesaturdays.org).\r\n",
