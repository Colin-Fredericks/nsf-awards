 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging Do-It-Yourself database-driven web application\r\nprojoect aims to (1) enable non-programmers to rapidly build custom\r\ndata management and workflow applications and (2) to promote\r\na novel pattern of interaction between application owners and\r\nprogrammers. Their beneficiaries are organizations, in need of long tail\r\nweb applications, that cannot afford the time and money needed to\r\nengage into the conventional code development process.\r\n\r\nDo-It-Yourself platforms must maximize two metrics that present\r\nan inherent trade-off: the simplicity of specification and the\r\napplication scope, which characterizes the class of applications\r\nthat can be built using the platform?s specification mechanism.\r\nThe proposal introduces two scopes with interesting trade-off\r\nfeatures. Namely, in the \"All-SQL\" scope and the (more limited)\r\n\"forms-driven workflows\" scope each application page consists\r\nof a report (modeled by a nested query) and forms and actions in the\r\nreport's context, leading to updates. The limitations have practically\r\nminor effects on the scope but they enable simple specification and\r\nautomatic optimizations, studied in the proposal, such as:\r\n1. automatic creation of reports by choosing between the candidates\r\nusing information theoretic criteria relying on constraints captured in\r\nthe limited models.\r\n2. summarization of applications as workflow specifications by\r\nanalyzing the dependencies between updates and queries. Vice versa,\r\nthe proposal shows how simple workflow primitives translate to queries\r\n(reports) and updates (forms and actions).\r\nThe proposal also provides an unlimited model of web applications,\r\nwhere programmers introduce code components and interface them\r\nwith the \"limited\" part via queries and updates.\r\n\r\nThe proposed models of database-driven web applications will impact\r\nthe education of both Computer Science (CS) and non-CS students\r\nthat need to comprehend web applications at a high conceptual level.\r\nFor further information see the project web page at\r\nhttp://www.db.ucsd.edu/forward",
