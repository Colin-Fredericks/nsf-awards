 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical explanation\r\nA well-accepted paradigm explains the architecture of structurally dominated continental rifts (that is, regions of the continents that are stretching or have been stretched, by extension on earthquake-faults) in terms of crustal thickness and heat flow. No equivalent paradigm explains the evolution of magmatically dominated rifts (stretched provinces in which volcanoes and their underlying igneous intrusions force the amount of extension), largely because we lack the observational data-sets to test numerical models.  Understanding the formation and evolution of such rift basins is societally important because they contain much of Earth?s hydrocarbon reserve.  NSF?s Geophysics program through this project is teaming with NSF?s MARGINS and Earthscope-Science programs to provide a detailed set of such observations for a rift in which the key features in the crust and upper mantle are buried beneath a deep basin, the Salton Trough in southernmost California. The Salton Trough is located across the southern end of the San Andreas transform system that has high risk of producing a devastating earthquake, and all new information obtained in this project will become a part of the community Southern California velocity model that is the basis for assessing strong ground motion and earthquake hazard throughout that area\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nThe Salton Trough is a magma-dominated rift linking the Gulf of California to the San Andreas fault system.  Because the rift is buried beneath a thick pile of Colorado River sediments, surprisingly little is currently known about the total volume of intrusion into the crust and the magma distribution within and beyond the rift margins.  We are determining these distributions and volumes with velocity measurements in the lower lithosphere. Wavespeeds are largely controlled within the crust by composition, and within the uppermost mantle by temperature (and fluid content). Lithology of the lower crust is best determined by combining P-wave velocities that are most reliably obtained from controlled-source refraction profiles with S-wave velocities that are typically better constrained by the joint surface-wave/receiver-function inversions that we are carrying out.  We are deploying 40 passive seismometers across the Salton Trough, at nominal 5-km spacing, collinear with the NSF(MARGINS-Earthscope)-USGS controlled-source seismic profile.  The NSF-USGS refraction/reflection profile is providing structural constraints, including Moho travel-time, and a vastly improved P-wave velocity model. Previous surface-wave studies carried out using permanent broadband stations across southernmost California will provide the phase-velocities for joint inversions with new receiver functions calculated from the data acquired here.  Additional structural constraints (based on the P-wave reflection and refraction profiling) can be imposed on the joint inversions to obtain one of the best-determined Vp-Vs-lithologic profiles across a magmatic rift.  The combination of dense receiver functions and well-determined velocity profiles allow a new test of whether the plate-bounding (San Andreas) strike-slip faults offset the Moho or disappear into a ductile middle crust.\r\n\r\nThe Salton Trough is the northernmost part of the Gulf of California extensional province that rifted the North American continent and transferred Baja California and the Peninsular Ranges to the Pacific plate. Despite similar total extension along the province, very different extensional structures have been produced, from seafloor spreading in the southern Gulf to 14-20 km thick continental or transitional crust in the northern Gulf and Salton Trough.  The new profile across the Salton Trough provide a comparative section to those recently determined across the Gulf, to enhance our knowledge of early ocean rifting and its propagation into a continent, and to understand the causes of along-strike variation in magmatic activity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor two years we operated a dense line of seismometers deployed across southernmost California, from San Diego to the Colorado River, listening to earthquakes from around the world.  We used our recordings, plus many older archived recordings, to create a spectacular three-dimensional map of the seismic wavespeed (the speed of sound through rock) of southern California that tells us what sort of rocks are present beneath our feet.  Our new mapping is precise enough that we can tell that the San Andreas fault is dipping to the north-east, rather than being vertical as conventionally portrayed (Figure 1) &ndash; this affects the way seismic waves will radiate from the fault during the next \"Big One\", and hence the expected destruction patterns in Los Angeles.  The rocks with higher wave speed southwest of the San Andreas fault are part of the \"Peninsula Range Batholith\", an ancient volcanic chain formed offshore California that collided with and was pushed underneath the California coast.  Our maps of wave speed show that the same structures are present in the southern Sierra Nevada and in the coastal ranges behind San Diego.  We can tell that beneath Imperial Valley and Salton Sea there is a small amount (perhaps 5%) of partial melt - magma - at about 15 miles depth, in the crust, and also at about 30 miles depth, in the upper mantle (the normally rigid tectonic plate that forms the outer shell of the earth).  This magma is the heat source for the growing geothermal industry in southernmost California; and will also be the cause of the next volcanic eruption (the youngest volcano by Salton Sea is only 2500 yrs old).  The magma in the mantle exists from beneath the San Andreas fault to beneath the Elsinore fault, 50 miles southwest, marking a region in which the Pacfic tectonic plate is pulling south-east, away from the North American crust, leaving a void that is continuously filled with upwelling magma to make new crust and mantle lithosphere.  The melt zone greatly weakens the mantle beneath the Imperial Valley, but stops abruptly at the Elsinore fault, and so concentrates shearing at depth only on the northeast side of the Elsinore fault.  Many rocks are anisotropic, that is the speed of sound waves is different in different directions (for example through a melt zone in which all the melt is aligned in narrow cracks that are all pointing in the same direction).   We found a very abrupt change in the anisotropy right at the Elsinore fault that we believes corresponds to a dramatic change in strength in the upper mantle.  Such lateral changes in strength are not normally included in fault models, and their existence across the Elsinore fault may explain why in this area, uniquely in California, the  rate of motion on the faults measured by geologists from offset rock types is much higher than the rate of motion (and number of earthquakes) predicted in earthquake hazard assessments.  The fault shearing at this boundary in the mantle beneath the Elsinore fault means that the Elsinore fault, not the San Andreas fault, may be becoming the effective plate boundary between the Pacific and the North American plates.\n\n\nThus our study has created new understanding about the geometry and earthquake cycle on the San Andreas fault system; while also training numerous students - from the Stanford PhD student who will join the hydrocarbon industry to explore for new resources, to minority and female undergraduates from both SF State (local to Stanford) and from Imperial Valley College (the community college closest to our line of seismographs).  \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Simon L Klemperer"
