 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in machine translation of human languages has made substantial progress recently, and surface patterns gleaned automatically from online bilingual texts work remarkably well for some language pairs.  However, for many language pairs, the output of even the best systems is garbled, ungrammatical, and difficult to interpret.  Chinese-to-English systems need particular improvement, despite the importance of this language pair, while English-to-Chinese translation, equally important for communication between individuals, is rarely studied. This project develops methods for automatically learning correspondences between Chinese and English at a semantic rather than surface level, allowing machine translation to benefit from recent work in semantic analysis of text and natural language  \r\ngeneration.   One part of this work determines what types of semantic  \r\nanalysis of source language sentences can best inform a translation system, focusing on analyzing dropped arguments, co-reference links, and discourse relations between clauses.  These linguistic phenomena must generally be made more explicit when translating from Chinese to English.  A second part of the work integrates natural language generation into statistical machine translation, leveraging generation technology to determine sentence boundaries, ordering of constituents, and production of function words that translation systems tend to get wrong.  A third part develops and compares algorithms for training and decoding machine translation models defined on semantic representations.  All of this research exploits newly-developed linguistic resources for semantic analysis of both Chinese and English.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate benefits of improved machine translation technology are easier access to information and easier communication between individuals.  This in turn leads to increased opportunities for trade, as well as better understanding between cultures.  This project's systems for both Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese are developed with the expectation that the approaches will be applied to other language pairs in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSTAGES (Statistical Translation And GEneration using Semantics) was a joint machine translation project that involved Brandeis University, Columbia University, the Information Science Institute at the University of Southern California, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the University of Rochester.  Our new approach to MT, combining semantic analysis, new forms of statistical MT and language generation, was aimed at handling fundamental differences in how Chinese and English encode information.  These include differences in event descriptions (predicate-argument structures), realization of tense, grammatical function words, constituent ordering (particularly when long distance dependencies are involved), and discourse relations.  ISI and Rochester  investigated novel architectures and representations for statistical machine translation.  Brandeis and Colorado investigated richer representations for semantic and pragmatic information for Chinese and English, respectively.  Columbia focused on fusing the input from the statistical MT systems and the semantic analysis of the source and target language sentences to produce a coherent, faithful and grammatical translation.  We made significant progress on the incorporation of semantic information into the machine translation process, both with respect to individual machine translation systems and with respect to post-processing and fusing of the output of multiple systems into a more accurate, more coherent target translation. With respect to future goals for semantics-based statistical machine translation, especially with respect to Chinese to English translation, the following results from our project are worth taking into consideration.\n\n1.The direct contributions of semantics:\n\na) In tree-to-string MT experiments, incorporating semantic role information in the form of features produces a small improvement in BLEU scores and a significant improvement in human evaluation of the MT output.\n\nb)  Automatically derived selectional preferences based on LDA topic models providesignificantly more benefit to nominal predicates than verbal predicates, perhaps because the syntactic cues are less reliable for nominal predicates.\n\n2.The importance of the detection of semantics-based structural relations and their utility:\n\na)    Basing structural alignment between Chinese and English parallel corpora on PropBank predicate argument structures instead of syntactic structure more than doubles the number of sub-structures that can be aligned. This confirms the greater cross-linguistic similarity of more abstract semantic representations, as opposed to syntactic structure. Aligned predicate argument structures also provide a useful basis for detecting cross-language semantic similarity.\n\nb)    For tree to string translation, translation rules that include the entire predicate-argument structure of a verb outperform rules that separate arguments of individual predicates.\n\nc)     In both re-decoding-based and paraphrase based combination frameworks, a hierarchical phrase-based combination model can yield significant improvements over non-hierarchical phrase-based combination model.\n\n3.Identifying and recovering dropped pronouns on the Chinese side is beneficial:\n\na)    Automatic dropped pronoun specification (automatic determination of the location and type of a dropped pronoun) helps improve machine translation quality. The improvement is more significant on instant message texts where there are more dropped pronouns than newswire text.\n\nb)    Chinese empty categories such as dropped pronouns can be recovered with better accuracy in a dependency representation where the head as well the following word token is used as identifying information.\n\nFinally, the progress gained from including semantic representations inspired the collaborators to investigate an even richer, full-sentence abstract representation, which is called Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR).  By building on the existing predicate-argument structures provided by PropBank, and adding discourse connectives, additional semantic relations for noun modifiers and elaborate named entity relations, a single sentence can be represented as a directed acyclic graph.  One of our project publications (LREC 2014) quickly established the similarity of Chinese and English AMRs (and Czech) for translations.  This result supported the inclusion of AMRs as a major theme for the NSF funded 2014 Frederick Jelinek Memorial Workshop on Meaning Representations in Language and Speech Processing held at Charles University in Prague, The Czech Republic during the month of July in 2014. AMRs have had a rapid rise in popularity, and are now a key component of the DARPA DEFT program and the DARPA CwC program, as well as featuring in a 2016 Semeval task, and a proposed 2017 Semeval task.  All in all, the students and faculty engaged in this research produced 4 journal papers, 17 8-10-page peer-reviewed, highly competitive conference papers that are considered journal equivalent, and 18 additional conference and workshop papers.  8 dissertations were either partially funded or fully funded by this grant.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Martha S Palmer"
