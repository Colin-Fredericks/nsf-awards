 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to investigate representations of p-adic reductive groups (mainly general\r\nlinear groups) and Galois groups which are (simultaneously) realized by the cohomology\r\nof deformation spaces of p-divisible groups. The proposed research naturally falls into two\r\nprojects, according to the type of cohomology theory that is considered. The \frst project\r\nis concerned with the de Rham cohomology of the p-adic symmetric spaces de\fned by\r\nDrinfeld. These can be considered as the special \fbers of formal schemes, and these formal\r\nschemes represent deformation functors for certain p-divisible formal groups (with extra\r\nstructures). It was shown by P. Schneider and U. Stuhler that the (compactly supported)\r\nde Rham cohomology groups of these spaces realize generalized Steinberg representations\r\n(of general linear groups). Torsion points on the universal formal group give rise to etale\r\ncoverings of the symmetric spaces, and global arguments (relying on the use of Shimura\r\nvarieties) show that their cohomology groups realize supercuspidal representations. Be-\r\ncause these spaces are Stein spaces, their cohomology groups can be computed by means\r\nof rigid-analytic di\u000berential forms. Using the relation to di\u000berential forms, the project\r\naims at constructing lattices in these supercuspidal representations which then give rise\r\nto Banach space representations. Furthermore, the PI seeks to relate these Banach space\r\nrepresentations to certain families of potentially crystalline Galois representations, at least\r\nwhen the spaces are one-dimensional (in which case the Galois representations are of di-\r\nmension two), and when the covering is 'tame'. The second project is concerned with the\r\netale l-adic cohomology of deformation spaces of one-dimensional formal groups. These\r\ncohomology groups are known to realize the local Langlands correspondence between n-\r\ndimensional Weil group representations and representations of the p-adic GL(n). Again,\r\nthe only known proofs for this fact, due to M. Harris and R. Taylor (respectively P. Boyer\r\nin the equal characteristic case) depend on global arguments. The PI proposes to investi-\r\ngate the equality between epsilon constants of representations which correspond to each\r\nother, in the case when the base \feld is of positive characteristic, by using local methods\r\nfrom rigid-analytic geometry. For the Galois representation a formula due to G. Laumon\r\ndescribes the epsilon constant in terms of a local Fourier transform, and this Fourier\r\ntransform in turn has a rigid-analytic description. Analyzing this description the PI seeks\r\nto relate Laumon's formula to a formula of Bushnell and Frohlich for the corresponding\r\nrepresentation of GL(n).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal is about investigating solutions of algebraic equations with special emphasis\r\non methods involving congruences with respect to a \fxed prime number p. For instance,\r\neven though a polynomial in general may have no roots which are rational numbers, there\r\nmay well be integers which are roots up to multiples of (arbitrary) high powers of p. This\r\ncan be considered as an approximate solution with respect to p, and these approximate\r\nsolutions give rise to a solution which is no longer an ordinary number, but a so-called p-\r\nadic number. The arithmetic of p-adic numbers is considerably easier than the arithmetic\r\nof rational numbers, yet complex enough to reveal lots of information about algebraic\r\nequations (with rational coefficients). Moreover, it is possible to do analysis with p-adic\r\nnumbers. The local Langlands correspondence describes the arithmetic of p-adic numbers\r\nin terms of actions of certain groups of matrices on linear spaces. These linear spaces are\r\nderived from non-linear or 'curved' spaces by 'taking homology', which is a process of\r\nconverting geometric information into linear spaces. The curved spaces in turn, which\r\nare like surfaces in spaces of p-adic numbers, are accessible to analytic methods, with\r\nfunctions depending on p-adic numbers as arguments. The PI proposes to use these\r\navailable analytic methods to investigate the curved spaces (and subsequently the linear\r\nspaces they give rise to) with the goal of getting a better understanding of the local\r\nLanglands correspondence and extending it beyond its classical domain.",
