 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are living in an increasingly inter-connected world that requires the successful employment of quantitative skills in real-world applications. The sciences encompass a broad spectrum of academic fields, with most sub-disciplines having mathematical and statistical analysis as an integral component of their process. Students majoring in mathematics are well served to broaden their perspective by engaging in interdisciplinary studies. And, conversely, students majoring in the sciences should be encouraged to obtain a strong training in mathematics. Because the demand for quantitatively skilled scientists with interdisciplinary training will increase in upcoming years, UNCG developed an interdisciplinary quantitative REU site. \r\n\t\r\nThe objectives of our REU are to 1) provide interdisciplinary undergraduate research experiences (URE) for students and 2) to advance the research programs of our faculty mentors.  Each year, eight (8) students will investigate problems at the intersection of mathematics and the sciences. The interaction of diverse faculty members and students will lead to innovative mathematical solutions for scientific investigations and a rigorous sense of realism in the mathematical models. We are committed to recruiting and training a diverse group of participants, improving their critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, and communication skills.  We expect that participants in our REU program will present their work at local, regional, and national STEM meetings and anticipate our research will lead to faculty and undergraduate student co-authored peer-reviewed manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
