 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CRI planning grant uses the theory of conceptual metaphor to plan\r\nthe creation of an on-line metaphor resource that covers multiple\r\ntypes of language and corpora. Metaphor is pervasive in human language\r\nand thought and is crucial for both linguistic expression and human\r\nreasoning. Conventionalized as well as novel metaphorical expressions\r\ncan be routinely encountered in everyday life conversations, in\r\nnewspapers, and in many other text types including scientific,\r\ntechnical, and literary writing.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this planning effort is to resolve issues related to\r\ncorpus selection and preparation, and to incorporate community wide\r\nevaluative feedback in the iterative design and implementation of\r\nmetaphor annotations. Towards the end of the planning work, there will\r\nbe a workshop to evaluate the approach, to build support for the\r\ncorpus creation enterprise, and to establish a user community. This\r\ncorpus selection and metaphor annotation effort is also being\r\ncoordinated with the companion SGER effort underway (NSF IIS grant\r\n0843275) that is exploring issues related to scalable metaphor\r\nmodeling and inference.\r\n\r\nThe multi-layer annotations will include conceptual relations and\r\nmetaphor domains, linguistic expressions and frame annotations of the\r\nrelevant lexical targets, and syntactic relations that obtain in the\r\nannotated target text. The result will be the design of a\r\ncomprehensive, richly annotated resource of metaphoric languge.The\r\ncombination of this work, along with parallel efforts in semantic\r\nanalysis and inference should permit the development and testing of\r\nlarge-scale systems capable of figurative language processing within a\r\nfew years.\r\n\r\n",
