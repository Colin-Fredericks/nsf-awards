 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \r\n(Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at California State University, Stanislaus (CSU Stanislaus) is increasing the number of university students preparing to teach science and mathematics in a six-county service area including California's Northern San Joaquin Valley and adjacent foothills, one of the fastest growing regions of California. The goals of the project are to increase the number of STEM students and professionals pursuing careers in 7th -12th grade mathematics and science education through scholarships and stipends; to develop cohorts and directed experiences that make them better prepared for these roles; and to provide them with resources and a cohort support system that increases retention and success in the workplace. An interdisciplinary team of faculty from the Colleges of Natural Sciences and Education provides an enhanced academic experience for the Noyce Scholars to prepare them in both content understanding and pedagogy. Students participate in early field experiences and service learning projects in high need schools. Nineteen undergraduate STEM majors and 15 STEM professionals (career-changers) are supported through Noyce scholarships and stipends leading to 34 new science and mathematics teachers. The Northern San Joaquin Valley region is characterized by limited economic attainment and low educational achievement. The improvement of the region's economic and educational situation hinges on sufficient numbers of qualified math and science teachers. The project includes several partnerships in the area, including the Stanislaus County Office of Education, the Lodi Unified, Merced City, Modesto City, and Stockton Unified school districts, as well as several higher education institutions including the regional community colleges (Columbia College, Merced College, Modesto Junior College, and San Joaquin Delta College) and the University of California Merced.  The CSU Stanislaus Teacher Credential Program recruits a high percentage of cultural minority students and focuses on preparing teachers to work with diverse student populations. This program also recruits more than 90% of its students from the local region and over 90% of them accept teaching jobs in the area, enabling the project to recruit the top future Teachers from the Valley, for the Valley.",
