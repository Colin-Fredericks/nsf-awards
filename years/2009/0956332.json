 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to identify paradigm shifting high impact research and education themes for systems and control that could lead to transformative impacts on energy, biology and cognitive sciences in the next decade. New tools and theories will further advance knowledge and understanding of control system and its application to an expanded range of systems and applications. This workshop is an opportunity to formulate new directions for basic control systems design/research issues that do not fit into the by now well-known methods of controller design.  Experts in the thematic areas of energy, biology and cognitive sciences will be invited to speak about the research challenges and the needs in their respective area that can be addressed by new tools and theories that are not being developed by the control research community today.  Working groups will be organized and charged to develop specific details in research needs.  A final report of the workshop will be composed to summarize the outcome of the workshop discussion.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is designed to have a broad impact in engineering and science areas where systems and control theory and approach are an integral part. Specifically, the workshop will encourage collaboration between control system researchers and researchers in energy, biology and cognitive science area and foster cross-fertilization and interdisciplinary research. The workshop will encourage the participation of young and underrepresented groups of researchers to enhance the diversity of representation and their involvement in scientific activities. The summary report will provide research and education guideline for control system development for the next decade.",
