 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calderer\r\nDMS-0909165\r\n\r\n     This project deals with modeling and analysis of\r\nferroelectric liquid crystals and hydrogels, with the goal of\r\nstudying switching and hysteresis of devices made of such\r\nmaterials.  The project on liquid crystals focuses on newly\r\ndiscovered bent core ferroelectric phases that are capable of\r\nsustaining polarization fields of just one order of magnitude\r\nbelow that of traditional solid ferroelectric compounds.  The\r\ngoal of the work on hydrogels is to model a cyclic membrane\r\nappropriate for application to the design of pulsating drug\r\ndelivery devices.  Such types of elastic membranes are also very\r\nrelevant to the study of fuel cells and filtrating devices.  Both\r\nproblems share distinctive phenomenology and mathematical issues,\r\nsuch as presenting a first order phase transition behavior\r\nbetween two distinguished states.  In ferroelectric liquid\r\ncrystals, they correspond to the oppositely polarized states with\r\ndistinct optical properties; a main goal is to optimize the\r\nswitching speed between them.  Understanding and controlling\r\nhysteresis may help achieve optimal switching.  This also\r\nrequires a good understanding of the rheology of bent core liquid\r\ncrystal flow.  Mathematical issues involve non-convexity,\r\nmetastability, and coupling of Maxwell's equations with fluid\r\nflow and elasticity.  Overall, ferroelectricity is an area of\r\nliquid crystals rich in phenomenology, modeling, and mathematical\r\nchallenges that remain largely unexplored. \r\n\r\n     It is often the case that seemingly disparate problems of\r\nscience and technology have common mathematical underpinnings. \r\nIn this project, the investigator addresses two of these\r\nproblems, with applications in pharmacology and fuel cells as\r\nwell as in optical devices, such as video and high speed Internet\r\nswitching.  The underlying idea is the modeling and mathematical\r\nstudy of \"switching,\" with the goal of designing faster and more\r\nefficient devices.  In pharmaceutical applications, a switch\r\nconnects the two relevant states: release and non-release of the\r\ndrug to be administered.  A goal of the investigator is to model\r\na cyclic drug delivery membrane.  Such periodically releasing\r\ndevices are believed to be especially relevant in hormone\r\ntherapies, where matching the natural body hormone cycle is\r\nperhaps as important as the replacement hormone itself.  In\r\nproton exchange membrane fuel cells, positive hydrogen ions\r\nproduced at the anode travel through the membrane, separating\r\nfrom the fuel and yielding electrons.  A ferroelectric switch\r\nconnects optically distinct states.  In these examples, energy\r\nloss is a common feature of switching dynamics, together with\r\ncycle lengthening in periodic devices.  This phenomenon, known as\r\nhysteresis, occurs in many mechanical and magnetic systems.  The\r\ninvestigator harnesses the mathematical knowledge of hysteresis\r\nin other fields as an approach to understanding pharmacological\r\nand liquid crystal devices.  Mentoring of graduate and\r\nundergraduate students as well as other educational activities is\r\nintertwined and integrated with the research aspects of the work.",
