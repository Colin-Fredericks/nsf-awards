 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth's interior radiates approximately 46 terawatts (TW, 1012 J s-1) of heat (total combined production of nuclear power today is about 1 TW of energy).  The Earth's thermal energy comes from the cooling of the planet, minor contributions from tidal friction and inner core growth, and significantly from the decay of radioactive elements. The exact proportional contribution of these heat supplies is unknown.  Plate tectonics is the primary manifestation of heat transport within the Earth today. Large tectonic plates are produced at mid-ocean ridges and transported across the surface of the globe to deep ocean trenches, where they plunge into the Earth's interior sending cold slabs into the interior and cooling the planet.  In order to better understand the dynamic processes that occur both within the solid Earth as well as on the planet's surface, we must develop a comprehensive model of Earth composition and structure that is internally consistent with observations from the fields of geology, geochemistry, geophysics and particle physics. The abundance and distribution of naturally-occurring radioactive elements is integral to the understanding of Earth dynamics, as radiogenic heat provides a key source of energy that serves to drive mantle convection, plate tectonics and the evolution of the entire planet.  \r\n\r\n            The primary objectives of the proposed research are to: (1) understand the nature and three-dimensional distribution of naturally-occurring radioactive elements in the Earth, particularly potassium, thorium and uranium, which produce >99% of all radiogenic heat in the Earth; (2) develop an internally consistent model of the Earth, including the thermal constitution and evolution of the planet; and, (3) build Earth models that can be tested against data from newly developed antineutrino detectors.  (Antineutrinos are neutral nuclear particles produce during beta-decay of radioactive elements.) The proposed work plan involves dynamic modeling to determine the geometry, distribution and chemical composition of the Earth's major reservoirs, namely the continental crust, mantle and metallic core.  Model results will be interpreted in conjunction with antineutrino data in order to develop a comprehensive, three-dimensional model of Earth composition and structure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Earth\u00c6s engine is powered by two sources of energy: primordial kinetic energy inherited from Earth\u00c6s accretion and the separation of its metallic core and thermal energy generated during radioactive decay.  For the last 150 years, since Lord Kelvin\u00c6s estimate of the young age of the Earth, geologists and physicists have struggle to understand what is the amount of primordial versus nuclear fuel left in the Earth\u00c6s reserves and for how long will plate tectonics, mantle convection, and the geodynamo continue to operate given these reserves.  These geologic processes help to regulate the Earth\u00c6s internal temperature and provide a magnetic shield (magnetosphere) that greatly reduces the surface flux of harmful cosmic rays.  Thus, a fundamental goal of our project was to determine the amount of radioactive power is left in the Earth.\n\n \n\nRecently, particle physicists have measured the Earth\u00c6s geo-neutrino flux, which are anti-neutrino particles that are generated during beta-minus decays of U and Th inside the Earth.  To understand and use the geo-neutrino signal collected by large underground neutrino detectors geologists need to map out the global concentration and distribution of Th and U inside the Earth. Accordingly, we developed a detailed geological model of the Th and U distribution within the Earth, including that in oceanic and continental crusts and different proposal models of the modern day mantle.  Important to our model development was to understand and test what would be the geo-neutrino signal for different competing models of mantle structure and composition. Seismologists have identified two distinctive, deep structures in the mantle that rise up to about 1500 kilometers off of the core-mantle boundary.  These structures may represent up to about 10% the mass of the mantle and contain a significant fraction of the mantle\u00c6s geological inventory of Th and U. \n\n \n\nBased on new isotopic and chemical observations of geological and meteoritic samples over the last decade geologists have re-examined their concepts of the composition of the Earth.  Consequently, the competing Earth models present a range of compositions that allow up to a factor of 3 difference in the amount of radioactive power in the Earth.  After quantifying the concentration and distribution of Th and U in the crust, both oceanic and continental, there is up to a factor of 30 difference in the residual amount of radioactive power in mantle.  Thus, we found that these different compositional models of the Earth end up with markedly distinctive geo-neutrino signals from these deep structures and that with an appropriate detector we could produce a neutrinographic imaging of the Earth\u00c6s mantle (see figure).  The findings from this study set the stage for testing competing compositional models of the Earth, identifying the nature of deep Earth structures through a combination of seismic and neutrinographic imaging, and determining the amount of radioactive power is left in the Earth.\n\n \n\nOur research program provided hands-on experience for a graduate student, as well as several undergraduate students in doing cutting-edge science. We also communicated our findings to the general public, K-12 educators and members of the US intelligence community.
