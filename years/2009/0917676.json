 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of mobility strategies for\r\nRobotic Sensor Networks (RSNs) which are networks of robots equipped\r\nwith communication, computation and sensing capabilities.  For RSN\r\ntechnology to be utilized in critical applications such as emergency\r\nresponse and environmental monitoring, mobility algorithms for\r\noperation in dynamic and complex environments are needed.\r\n\r\nIn this project, three novel mobility problems which arise in many RSN\r\napplications are introduced. These problems are general enough to\r\ncapture the interplay between communication, sensing and\r\nmobility. Yet, they can be succinctly formulated as geometric\r\noptimization problems. This work will focus on solving these mobility\r\nproblems which will yield provably correct solutions for numerous RSN\r\napplications. In addition, bounds on the performance of a given RSN in\r\nfundamental problems such as tracking, collaborative sensing and\r\nestimation will be established.\r\n\r\nThe output of this research will be a significant step toward enabling\r\nthe use of fully autonomous RSNs for crucial applications in emergency\r\nresponse, energy and environmental monitoring, and health care\r\nautomation.  Sensing and actuation play important roles in the\r\nevolution of information technology. The project will contribute to\r\nthis evolution through the development of novel distributed sensing\r\nand control algorithms.\r\n",
