 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Dakota REU Site, a partnership of the North Dakota Association of Tribal Colleges (NDATC) and the University of North Dakota (UND), will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009 through 2013. Ten students will be selected each summer to work on neuroscience projects under the mentorship of UND faculty. Students from Tribal and rural colleges will be recruited to participate in the program. All students will be paired with faculty mentors and will conduct their research at the University of North Dakota. The primary objectives of the program are to (1) foster academic and social independence, (2) promote an interest in research and science careers, and (3) encourage professional development for student participants. Students will initially receive one week of training in cell, molecular and imaging techniques, and then develop their own research project under the mentorship of faculty. Students will attend weekly professional development sessions that will include instructions in oral and written presentations, data analysis, and proper research conduct. Students will be expected to present their findings at an end-of-session Symposium, which will prepare them for professional scientific presentations at a regional or national meeting. Salary, travel, room and board will be provided for all students. Childcare funding is available from UND, if needed. The hope is that participating American Indian and rural students will choose to pursue graduate degrees in the sciences and return to their communities to help strengthen science education, research and literacy. Applications and other relevant information are available at http://www.und.nodak.edu/instruct/spyle, or from Drs. Bennett (bbennett@ndatc.org), Van Doze (vdoze@medicine.nodak.edu) and Sally Pyle (sally.pyle@und.nodak.edu).",
