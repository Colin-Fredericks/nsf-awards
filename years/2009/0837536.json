 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Takeshi Inomata, Jessica Munson will direct archaeological excavations at the ancient Maya site of Anonal located in the Department of Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala.  This research examines the ways in which monumental buildings mediated the emergence and negotiation of political authority at Anonal from the Middle Preclassic through the end of the Classic period (ca. 900 B.C. - A.D. 900).\r\n  \r\nArchaeological excavations at Anonal will investigate the architectural history of this site to understand the emerging role of Maya elites and commemoration practices within this community.  Maya temples, such as the temple complex at Anonal, commonly represent the result of multiple construction episodes and incorporate architectural elements that date back to much earlier times.  Such long construction histories imply some connection with a known past.  Long-term use and renovation of Anonal's temple building provides an excellent context to examine the origins of monumental construction in Maya society, as well as related changes in political organization beginning in the Preclassic period.  Through intensive excavation this research will document detailed architectural histories, and analyze patterns of use, reconstruction, and abandonment at Anonal's temple complex.  Excavations will focus on monumental buildings in order to examine the duration, intensity, and methods of construction associated with these structures over long periods of time.  Micromorphological and radiocarbon data from intensive stratigraphic excavations will make unique contributions towards understanding the frequency of construction, the use of different construction materials and techniques, as well as the chronological sequence of these building episodes.\t\r\n\r\nBuilt environments reflect particular forms of social organization and actively shape people's perception of their surroundings by contributing a sense of place to the people that use them.  Alterations to these social landscapes concomitantly affect the creation and transformation of social memories, as well as signify changes in social and political order.  Archaeological research on the cultural construction of monumental architecture suggests that these buildings mediated the organization and negotiation of political power and commemoration in ancient Maya society.  Legitimization strategies by elite leaders often invoke the past as a means to establish ancestral connections and assert political authority.  By examining the construction history and use of Anonal's temple complex, this research will contribute understanding to the origins of Maya monumental architecture and associated changes in political organization.  \r\n\r\nThis research project also has immediate impacts for cultural patrimony regarding the conservation of endangered sites and heritage education.  Excavation of Anonal's temple complex will promote stabilization and conservation of threatened structures for future generations.  This project will also establish collaborative partnerships with Guatemalan archaeology students and local Qeqchi Maya communities engaged in sustainable cultural tourism projects.  Students will be trained in archaeological field methods and participate in laboratory analyses.  Local Qeqchi Maya people will also participate in the excavation program and learn about their cultural landscape.  This knowledge will promote stewardship of archaeological resources directed by indigenous communities.",
