 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\n0854316\r\nOyama\r\n\r\nThe NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports work by Professors S. Ted Oyama and Luke E. Achenie at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University to develop advanced membranes for CO2/CH4 separation.  The studies will be carried out in a collaborative manner by the two Principal Investigators to address experimental aspects of the preparation and characterization of the membranes, and theoretical aspects of the mechanisms of synthesis and permeation. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research on CO2/CH4 separation is of importance for natural gas utilization.  Many gas sources have CH4 contaminated with CO2 and need treatment.  The development of an improved process for clean gas production will benefit consumers directly and could lead to new technologies for energy distribution from new sources such as coal-bed and shale-oil gas and microbial fermentation. This is timely bearing in mind the heightened interest in green technologies. Some of the proposed concepts such as the use of ultrathin graded layers on hollow fibers, can be used to improve other membrane technology in which much good work is being done, but which is beyond the scope of this project.  Examples include supported Pd and zeolite membranes.\r\n\r\nThe training of students not only in the important area of membrane technology, but also in advanced scientific methodology.  Membrane reaction engineering is unique in requiring mastery of a wide diversity of knowledge, including physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, spectroscopy, quantum mechanics, computer programming, and engineering.  Research in this area requires integration of skills, and leads to higher-level thinking.  \r\n\r\nFourth, we have a commitment to the education of underrepresented groups like women, minorities, and handicapped individuals.  We actively recruit members of our research teams from these groups.  Currently the combined laboratories of the two lead researchers are composed of 8 members, half of whom are women and one is handicapped. Great efforts are also underway to involve undergraduate students in the research and helping to enhance the teaching environment in local community schools.  \r\n\r\nThere will be close interactions and mutual exchange of information from the experimental and theoretical sides to help in the development of improved membranes and to increase understanding of the molecular processes involved. In summary our proposed project will have significant impact in several areas of importance to society and contribute to the \"green\" revolution.",
