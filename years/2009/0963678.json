 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Materials World Network award by the Biomaterials program and Office of  Special Programs in the Division of Materials Research to University of North Carolina Charlotte is to synthesize and characterize monodisperse metallic and bimetallic nanoparticles, and to use the nanoparticles for biosensing applications. This award is also cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.  Monodisperse metal particles within the 1 - 4 nm size regime display discrete electronic orbital levels, which will be studied by both optical and electrochemical techniques.  With this award, Prof Obare with collaborators from Tunisia at the University of 7 November and the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology will investigate the influence of alloying silver nanoparticles on their optical and electrochemical properties. A fundamental understanding of the new properties that arise from these studies may provide an opto-electrochemical detection method for bacteria that cause food and water borne diseases in both the United States and in Tunisia. Proper functionalization of the nanoparticles will allow for selective and specific interactions between the nanoparticles and the bacteria. \r\n\r\nConventional methods for the detection of most pathogens are often costly and time consuming. Therefore, there is a significant need for rapid detection of bacteria directly from both food and patient samples. Rapid methods based on nanoscale materials will lead to major advances in the field. Obare?s research group in the United States will collaborate with a team of scientists from the University of 7 November and the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology in Tunisia will address an interdisciplinary research area in which insights governing the optical and electrochemical properties of metals on the nanoscale will rationally be used to develop sensitive detection methods for pathogens. In addition to engaging graduate and undergraduate students in the proposed research activities, the PI holds a one-week nanoscience Camp for high school and middle school students. This collaboration will provide the nanoscience Camp participants to join researchers live in Tunisia, via video conferencing, and learn how international joint research projects utilize nanoparticles to address important problems common to the United States and Tunisia.",
