 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe focus of this grant goes towards supporting our continuing research program at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) using electromagnetic probes to study hadronic matter at the very fundamental and basic levels.  Our group has taken crucial roles in three separate experiments that test the nature of particle interactions which falls under the rubric of the \"Standard Model\". One experiment, Qweak, uses the parity-violating property of the weak interaction to measure a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model known as the Weinberg (or mixing) angle to within a relative error of 0.3%. This angle is related to the ratio of two particle masses, the W and Z bosons, and varies as a function of the momentum transfered to the scattering target. A precise measurement from this experiment, when combined with other experiments, will place strong constraints on proposed extensions to our present version of the Standard Model. In another experiment, a member of our group leads the pion lifetime measurements undertaken in Jefferson Lab's Hall B which seeks to probe the mechanism through which a neutrally charged pion can decay into two photons. In this experiment, neutral pions will be photoproduced from the Coulomb field of nuclei via the Primakoff effect, and will be detected in a highly segmented calorimeter. The experiment measures a fundamental quantity which can be calculated in the context of chiral perturbation theory and represents one of the few stringent experimental tests of QCD that can be made in the confinement scale regime. Our group also conducts experiments to extract polarization observables from vector meson photoproduction with linearly-polarized photons in the g8b (proton) and g13a/b (deuteron) datasets, which is the subject of three ISU PhD theses. Recent CLAS results on the extraction of single- and double-polarization observables in photo- and electroproduction show their high sensitivity to small production amplitudes, which is key in extracting excited baryon state by affording an understanding of the underlying symmetry of the quark degrees of freedom in the nucleon, the nature of the parity exchange between the incident photon and the target nucleon, and the mechanism of associated strangeness production in electromagnetic reactions. As a natural extension to the JLab baryon resonance studies component at JLab, we expect to expand our research to the Beijing Electron Positron Collider, where we will extract excited baryons states decaying through charmed mesons at the Beijing Electron Spectrometer (BES). We seek to coordinate this research with BES by analyzing the decay of the J/psi into baryon-antibaryon channels, where we expect a complementary means for probing nucleon resonances (N*) in the mass region up to 2 GeV. Our group is planning to construct a set of six drift chambers to be used as the region 1 particle tracking system in Jefferson Lab's Hall B. This group's research program at JLab, the accelerator facilities at ISU, and continuous detector construction projects in the groups Laboratory for Detector Science, combine in an active program to provide a breadth of experiences in an educational environment which can be used to effectively train the next generation of scientists.\r\n",
