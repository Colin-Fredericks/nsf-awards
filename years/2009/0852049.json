 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tuskegee University REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Eight students will be selected each year to participate in a 10-week research program in the area of integrative biosciences. Students who are rising juniors or seniors are eligible to apply. Students who do not have research programs at their institutions or from underrepresented minority groups are especially encouraged to apply. Participants can select from a number of research projects on plant genomics, biocomplexity in the environment, computational biology and bioinformatics, animal sciences and cell/molecular biology. Aside from an intensive mentored research experience in integrative biosciences research, which is defined as involving the integration of two or more science disciplines, students will be able to participate in an orientation session, an ?Introduction to Research? course, an Ethics in Science component, a Research Certification and Safety Training program, a GRE preparation workshop, and seminars in professional development skills. A field trip will also occur during the course of the program.  At the completion of the summer, the participants will write and present a report of their research projects. Research stipends, housing and travel will be provided.  Additional information is available at www.tuskegee.edu/our/, or by contacting the Program Director, Dr. Olga Bolden-Tiller at 334-727-8403 or obtiller@tuskegee.edu or the Director of the Office of Undergraduate Research, Sharee Small at 334-727-8295 or smalls@tuskegee.edu.\r\n\r\n",
