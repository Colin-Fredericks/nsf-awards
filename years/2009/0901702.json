The approach taken will be to optimize performance and sensitivity of the detector by modeling, analyzing and testing the different heat flux pathways from the active element of the detector.  Furthermore, the modeling and testing will be performed to enable violent mechanical shocks and a wide range of thermal and chemical operating environments.\r\n\r\nIn the push for novel gas sensors and detection mechanisms, little effort has been put into enhancing thermal conductivity detectors, one of the oldest gas sensors.  However, thermal conductivity detectors are uniquely suited for miniaturization, since they are sensitive to the concentration of substances within a mixture, not the total mass of a sample, a limitation of flame ionization detectors and mass spectrometers.  Therefore, miniaturization of gas chromatographic systems employing thermal conductivity detectors can maintain functional sensitivity while processing smaller sample masses, while simultaneously reducing power consumption and increasing mechanical robustness. \r\n\r\nThe development of a highly sensitive, yet simple and robust detector, integrated into a miniaturized system will enable applied gas chromatography to make an impact on fields ranging from point of care health services and homeland security, to industry process control and geological exploration.  Educationally, this program will impact a diverse student population through merging micro/nanosystems and engineering education research to train the next generation of scientific/engineering leaders.\r\n",
