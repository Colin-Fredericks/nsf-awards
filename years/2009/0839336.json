 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project tests the feasibility of using a highly innovative polarized multi-wavelength light extinction spectroscopy approach for on-line non-destructive characterization of coated nanoparticles and nanoparticle agglomerates. From extinction measurements and a database which contains numerically generated extinction values for different sizes of coated spherical particles and their agglomerates shapes, the size and thickness distribution of coated particles (or size distribution of their agglomerates in terms of distribution of number of primary spheres and fractal dimension) is determined. Currently available commercial instruments cannot accurately characterize coated spherical particles and agglomerates. Techniques such as electron microscopy involve time consuming sample preparation and sample handling which alters sample morphology. The capability provided by our proposed technology is extremely important in several applications relevant to targeted functionality. The proposed instrument will help in developing tailored coated nanoparticles for new applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nNanoparticles technology is well advanced and positioned to impact industries related to pharmaceuticals, medical diagnostics, and biomaterials. If successful the proposed instrument will enable new levels of quality in the manufacturing of coated and agglomerated nanoparticles. Global market for nanoparticles in biomedical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic applications are worth $ 204.6 million in 2007 (Bcc research report, nano17D). This is expected to increase to over $ 684.4 million by 2012, a CAGR of 32.0 %. The proposed product will be a valuable characterization tool for many of these industries and the technology, with its unique application potential, will pave the way for new enabling technologies.\r\n",
