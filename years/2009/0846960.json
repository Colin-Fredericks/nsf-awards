 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this reseasrch is to develop an innovative real-time acoustic resonant mass sensing platform in liquid environments. The approach is based on a new sensitive and real-time mass sensor, which will be characterized with various biomasses and coatings over various sensing diaphragms. Furthermore, the biomass testing will be extended to a real medical application. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the proposed research include: 1) increase in the detection capacity of the FBAR by orders of magnitude by maintaining high Q in the liquid; 2) utilization of a sensing diaphragm to implement the novel concept of effective mass loading in the liquid by separating liquid damping effect from the operating frequency of the sensor; 3) improvement of Q by reducing energy loss; 4) reliable adaptability in wide range of operating temperatures; and 5) utilization of the ultra sensitive liquid mass sensor for disease diagnostic screening applications. \r\n\r\nSuch rapid, simple and cost effective liquid mass sensors have the potential to transform the field of early disease detection and to make significant impact on various clinical and healthcare applications. As another broader impact, a new educational effort with interactive pedagogical approach will be implemented with an emphasis on reliability issues of micro-devices and systems. The education program will focus on increasing participation of underrepresented minorities, providing high school students with early exposure to (and career development opportunities in) micro/nanotechnology.",

During the funding period, we studied the use of piezoelectric resonators for biosensing limited by the damping they suffer in viscoelastic media. When acoustic resonant sensors operate in vacuum or gaseous environments, their energy is mostly confined within the piezoelectric layer due to the large acoustic impedance mismatch with the surroundings. On the other hand, when the sensor surface contacts liquid, much of the acoustic wave energy is dissipated. For a high quality factor resonance, which corresponds to improved mass resolution, the acoustic energy must be well trapped in the piezoelectric layer. We demonstrated a method to reduce the damping effect in liquid using a vacuum-gapped isolation layer. The method was applied to both QCR and FBAR and its effect on quality factor and sensitivity has been studied. Further we studied nonlinear resonance as a way to move beyond the limitations of sensing in the linear regime. We demonstrated nonlinear mass sensing behaviors of quartz crystal resonators and experimental evidences of nonlinear coupling between eigenmodes. The coupled modes are internally resonant and create regions of multistability in the frequency response beyond the usual bistability.
