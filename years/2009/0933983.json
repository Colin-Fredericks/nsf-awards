 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Mathematical Society (The Society) proposes to administer a program for selecting approximately 115 U.S. mathematicians for whom travel awards of about $2,750 each will be provided to attend the International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad, India, August 19-27, 2010 (ICM 2010).  The Society requests a grant from the National Science Foundation in the amount of $323,150 ($316,250 for travel awards and $6,900 for administration of the program).\r\n\r\nThe International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) is held once every four years, and is one of the most significant gatherings of the world?s leading mathematicians, where major developments in mathematical research, across sub-disciplines, is discussed.  Attendance by U.S. mathematicians at this meeting is important for the scientific health of the nation because U.S. mathematicians discuss, learn and share in mathematical research that is going on all over the world.  The Society has administered similar travel grant programs for previous ICM gatherings, beginning with ICM-90 in Kyoto, Japan and most recently for ICM-06 in Madrid, Spain.  The program ensures that there is strong attendance by U.S. mathematicians, promoting contact with mathematical scientists from other parts of the world, which is important not only for the education of future mathematicians, but also for the long-term vitality of mathematical research in the United States.  In addition, efforts will be made to ensure that early career mathematicians, women and minorities receive full consideration to support their attendance.\r\n",
