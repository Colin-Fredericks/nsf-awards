 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant number of attacks on Web browsers and Web applications\r\nare successful through the use of malicious inputs.\r\nFor instance,  attacks on web browser extensions target browsers by\r\nexploiting vulnerable extensions (add-ons) by supplying malicious input. \r\nMalicious inputs  exercise unintended behaviors leading to attacks that\r\ncompromise confidentiality, integrity and\r\navailability of web-based systems. This project systematically\r\nexamines the role that user inputs play in web browsers and \r\napplications, and develops techniques to prevent these attacks by \r\nconfining their influence. The challenge is to develop sound and \r\nprecise  automated analysis mechanisms for web based platforms \r\nsuch as JavaScript. Research from the areas of static and dynamic analysis, \r\ninformation flow tracking and learning program behaviors\r\nwill be used to develop robust, efficient and highly precise  techniques.\r\n\r\nPapers from the project  will be distributed in popular online\r\nresources for Web security for the widest possible dissemination and\r\nfurther enhancement. Furthermore, the PIs will transition results from\r\nthis research to Web development and standards communities. \r\nThe results of this project will be integrated into the new and\r\nexisting courses in the undergraduate and graduate curricula at the\r\nUniversity of Illinois campuses at Chicago and Urbana Champaign. \r\nThese courses will train a growing workforce of software engineers\r\nwho will be more security-aware and apply these principles for\r\nlaying a platform for a more secure Web. This project will also directly\r\ncontribute to the research training  of three Ph.D. students\r\nsupervised by the PIs. This project will also support the  involvement\r\nof the PIs in outreach activities  aimed at K-12 teacher training and\r\nminority groups, and contributions by designing programs that create\r\nawareness and interest in computer science.\r\n",
