 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot project funded by the Science, Technology & Society program and the Nanotechnology Exploratory Research program introduces new courses that integrate technological and societal issues to community colleges in California.  These interdisciplinary courses address different technical and social issues associated with nanoscience and emerging technologies.  They build on the innovative pedagogy and instructional resources developed for a general education course on the interplay of science, technology and society introduced at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2007.  This new project involves curriculum enhancement, pilot testing and course evaluation, professional development for community college faculty, and opportunities for tomorrow's educators to gain experience in course development and innovative teaching.\r\n\r\nThe distinctiveness of these courses is that they are built around a single technology theme (e.g. surveillance technologies, green technologies) that highlights nanotechnology in its social and technical context in concert with alternate technologies.  In addition, the modules rigorously address the science and technical content as well as the historical and societal aspects of current technology through the inclusion of hands-on science and social science laboratory activities.\r\n\r\nThis project also addresses effective practices for curriculum development and instruction at the community college, especially in introductory science courses that are open to a wide range of students.  This focus is highlighted during a faculty workshop that integrates teaching strategies with course content and laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\nThis project introduces a new brand of course that potentially increases the number of community college students engaged in interdisciplinary curriculum that addresses the intersection of science, technology and society.  Given the high percentage of students from underrepresented groups in the California community college sector, it also engages substantial numbers of talented students who currently do not choose to pursue further courses and careers in science and engineering. The project also updates many faculty (both science and social science) in community colleges about the latest developments in nanotechnology, especially with respect to societal impacts and concerns.  It introduces graduate researchers to this field, broadening their understanding of how the research they do fits into a larger societal context while giving them teaching and mentoring experience.",
