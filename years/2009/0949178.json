 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks NSF support for a Indo-U.S. Workshop on Parallelism and the\r\nFuture of High-Performance Computing that will take place on January 7 and 8, 2010, just before the PPoPP and HPCA Symposia, in Bangalore. Funds are requested to partially cover travel expenses for up to 20 senior US-based researchers and 20 students. In addition to the proposed US participants the workshop attendees will include prominent Indian researchers listed in the proposal. Most of the U.S. workshop team members will be invited speakers and panelists.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this workshop is to initiate interactions between Indian students, senior researchers, and developers and their US counterparts in the area of parallel programming and computing in order to improve mutual understanding and create opportunities for collaborations. The proposed workshop is expected to result in innovative research directions, due to the participation of the experts in the field. Research ideas resulting from the discussions can have far reaching impact in the way HPC systems are used worldwide.  In the future, international collaborations might produce joint research proposal(s) to funding agencies in India and/or the U.S.",
