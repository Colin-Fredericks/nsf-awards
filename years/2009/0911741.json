 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information Science and Systems (31)\r\n\r\n\r\n As a National Security Agency designated Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education, the Center for Cyberspace Research (CCR) produces highly qualified cyber-professionals through its graduate educational program and research. The center has the unique ability to develop cyber-professionals with a thorough understanding of the special requirements of both Government and Department of Defense (DoD) cyber-operations. Performance from the original SFS grant has been outstanding: 100% internship placement rate, 100% on-time or early completion rate, and a 100% post-graduation placement rate. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal has several facets: (1) the program is distinctive for its focus on offensive and defensive cyber-operations; (2) there is an emphasis on both theory and application; (3) there is an emphasis on technical solutions to cyberspace issues in our curriculum and research; (4) the center possesses a unique capability to conduct classified research; and (5) the curriculum and research is focused on both government computer and network operations as well as civilian critical infrastructures. Students learn state-of-the-art cyber-technology as well as how to investigate and solve difficult problems in the area. The curriculum is regularly updated to stay abreast of the latest technical advancements. \r\n\r\nAccess to secure research facilities enables students to work on exciting and challenging research topics in cyberspace. These topics and facilities coupled with close ties to the Air Force and government research agencies provide a strong research and educational experience. Students work closely with faculty to defend national information systems and networks against exploitation while exploiting the weaknesses of adversaries. \r\n\r\nGraduates are placed in positions that foster growth within the government through mentoring. Their unique educational experience gives them immediately useful knowledge into both best practices as well as vulnerabilities of information infrastructure. \r\n\r\nProgram graduates have a broad impact on the Federal, State, and local cyber-workforce. There is broad dissemination of research results. In 2008, CCR published 74 journal and conference papers based on student research. \r\n\r\nThis project is engaged in a collaborative effort with faculty at a neighboring community college and at an HBCU. Undergraduate students at these institutions are mentored as part of a summer intern program as they work on cyber-related projects.",
