Five workshops will be held in conjunction with the 9thASME-ISHMT Heat and Mass Transfer Conference at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, January 4?6th, 2010.  This conference is the premier venue for disseminating research findings for India's thermal sciences and engineering community.  The American Society of Mechanical Engineers co-sponsors this event to enhance interactions between Indian and US thermal science researchers.  \r\n\r\nThe interactive workshops in five topical areas are recognized as emerging areas with significant current research thrust in both countries.  These are: Thermal Design and Management in Electronics, Thermal Transport in Biological Systems, Development of Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Process Heat Based Energy Resources, Recent Advances in Fuel Cell Engineering, and Gas Turbine Cooling and Heat Transfer.  They are designed to promote discussion about the next-generation of thermal challenges and to seed new bilateral research collaborations in areas of mutual interest.  For the US participants this is an opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of the current research thrusts, expertise and facilities in India.   \r\n\r\nThe US delegation includes 8 senior scientists, 4 postdoctoral researchers, and 3 graduate students.  The workshops, which target fundamental areas in heat and mass transfer, are expected to enhance US-India cooperation on future thermal technologies, share information and build institutional bridges, and promote educational and cross-cultural experiences for all participants.  US delegates include women and members from under-represented groups who are early-career faculty, graduate students, or senior researchers.  The report on the workshops and conference will be disseminated through a website so that heat transfer researchers worldwide will be able to access this information.  In U.S., the results of the India conference and workshops will be reported to a larger audience at the next major Heat Transfer Conference held in the U.S.  Funding for this workshop is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.   \r\n",
