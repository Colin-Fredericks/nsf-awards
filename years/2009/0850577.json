 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Williams College SMALL REU program, for nine weeks each summer, about 23 undergraduates will work in groups of about four on original research with about 6 faculty, for the summers 2009-2013.  Topics of research include stick knots, topology of particle collisions, multivariable continued fractions, completions of local rings, random matrix theory, manifolds with density and isoperimetric problems, class groups of global fields, ergodic theory, and eigenvalue distribution of various classes of random matrices.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this REU is to introduce undergraduates to the excitement and challenge of doing original research in mathematics.  In the process, students naturally learn lots of background and are encouraged to present as well as publish their work, all invaluable for graduate school. The variety of mathematical activities provides a rich intellectual environment.  Our nation needs a wider appreciation and understanding of mathematics, and cannot afford to leave anyone out.  We have increased the numbers of women and minorities participating in the program over the last five years, and we are continuing to look for new and better ways to encourage applications from women, minorities, first generation college students, and other underrepresented groups.  The PI for this proposal is a woman and the co-PI is Hispanic.  Students, faculty and the broader mathematics community will benefit from the presentation and publication of original research. Students will develop a lifetime network of peers and many of them will pursue graduate studies, partially because of their REU experience.",
