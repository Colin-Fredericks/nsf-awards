Nanocomposite bulk thermoelectric materials can be fabricated quickly and inexpensively, and in a form that is compatible with existing thermoelectric device configurations. Unfortunately, existing theory of thermoelectricity is not able to \r\npredict correctly the thermoelectric properties of such structures, and often hundreds of samples might need to be grown and measured, in the quest to identify optimum nanostructures in terms of high efficiency and low cost.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This proposal aims to develop a capability to predict the relevant properties of thermoelectric nanocomposite materials. A nonequilibrium Green?s function technique will be developed to account for the natural coupling of scattering of phonons and electrons, as well as other quantum effects. Issues such as crystal orientation and strain will be accounted for to determine their effects on the bulk thermoelectric properties. Model predictions will be compared with measurements of thermoelectric properties of synthesized nanocomposites to optimize the nanoscale features of the material, the material composition, the doping concentration(s), and the material processing parameters to improve the efficiency of such inexpensive thermoelectric materials.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Development of highly efficient, inexpensive thermoelectric materials is a key to reduce both energy consumption and harmful emissions on a large scale. The research will be integrated into new graduate courses to be developed at Oklahoma State-Tulsa. Undergraduate students will be involved in the research. Recruitment of students from underrepresented groups in conjunction with the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance will be pursued. Participation in an educational program at the Tulsa Children?s Museum for K12 students will occur.",
