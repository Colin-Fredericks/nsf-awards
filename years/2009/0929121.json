This meeting, organized under the leadership of Dr. Paul Ho, Director, Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA), will provide a venue for fostering communication and collaboration between U.S. scientists and Academia Sinica staff in millimeter-wave astronomy and, in particular, for the soon-to-be commissioned Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).\r\n\r\nThe June meeting aims to cover a range of scientific and technical topics related to millimeter-wave astronomy, with an eye towards key science to be done with ALMA, on which ASIAA is a partner. Specific topics to be covered include the solar system, galactic low-mass and high-mass star formation, outflows/Jets, proto-planetary disks/debris disks, evolved stars, nearby galaxies, galactic center, AGNs and ultra luminous galaxies, high-redshift galaxies, astrochemistry, and instrumentation. Such a rich discussion of contemporary scientific topics provides a unique opportunity for the exploration of new ideas and scientific collaborations. Concrete strategies for mentoring students and early career researchers in millimeter-wave astronomy, and timescales for the implementation of these strategies will be a major part of the concluding discussions.\r\n",
