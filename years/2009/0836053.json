 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe Akamai Workforce Initiative (AWI) is an interdisciplinary project that partners the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy, the Center for Adaptive Optics, and the University of Hawaii - Maui Community College.  The AWI will support the training and retention of a diverse student population in electro-optics through an inquiry-based, equitable, culturally relevant, and resourcefully taught curriculum that is designed to meet workforce needs in astronomy, remote sensing, and other technology industries in Maui and the state. The AWI will improve current scientists' and engineers' skills in contemporary education, and will use their new teaching skills to advance Maui's students into the technology workforce. The AWI will immediately build an innovative curriculum-development infrastructure on Maui, an electro-optics certificate program at Maui Community College, and a service-learning recruitment and retainment effort, while also establishing the foundation for further statewide and four-year electro-optics programs.  \r\n\r\nThe AWI will include (1) a novel curriculum that will integrate culture, inquiry processes, skills, and equity together with modern electro-optics content, all chosen to meet workforce needs; (2) unique training in inquiry-based teaching, curriculum design, and diversity considerations for a generation of Hawaii's scientists and engineers; (3) support for public- and private-sector research of national importance in astronomy and remote sensing through a strategically designed, local program; (4) a team that is qualified and experienced in the unique mix of content, processes, and partnerships required.  Ultimately the AWI will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM-related fields including women, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders.  It will also benefit society as a whole by enhancing the infrastructure for research and education in Hawaii by partnering and integrating education, research, industry, and community interests.",
