The program builds upon lessons learned in a prior CSEMS award. The project is planning to use a variety of innovative strategies to support students.  For example an online management system is combined with advising Action Plans to allow for careful student monitoring.   Scholarship recipients are also to be provided with leadership knowledge and experiences and graduate with a leadership certificate.  Recipients are to complete a career development seminar and be supported to obtain internships.  The project is to award 20 new scholarships annually for a total of 80 students over four years.",
