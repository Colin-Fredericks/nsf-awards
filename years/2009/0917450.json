 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Minnesota is partnering with several nature centers in the Midwest to transform citizen \"technicians\" into citizen \"scientists.\" The Driven to Discover project will use existing citizen science programs with strong educational components to engage 12-14 year old youth and their adult mentors in authentic research.  The goal of the project is to develop a training model for adults who work with youth in a variety of informal education settings to involve them in authentic scientific inquiry via citizen science rather than just data collection activities. \r\n\r\nIn the proof-of-concept phase, teams consisting of 4-H youth, adult leaders, and several scientists are conducting participatory action research to understand what factors lead youth to full engagement in ecological research. In phase two, project personnel are training 4-H educators, naturalists, and teachers how to engage youth and their adult leaders in other 4-H programs and other informal education programs to conduct ecological research with scientists in advisory roles. Phase one involves approximately 10 adults and 70 youth, whereas phase two involves approximately 40 adults and 300 youth. A front-end study defined the project's target audiences and partners. Formative evaluation study will monitor interactions among members of the research teams and summative evaluation will measure impacts on participants' knowledge, skills development, attitudes, and behavior. \r\n\r\nProject deliverables include youth-generated ecological research findings, web-based program implementation materials, an annual conference, and a model for engaging youth groups in informal settings in authentic scientific inquiry.  The model is expected to impact more than six million youth nationwide.",

Programs with the most potential for long-term sustainability were school/teacher associated programs, community centers (e.g., 4-H), and natural resource education centers. Other key elements included youth recruitment abilities, youth retention abilities, and adult leader retention. Successful recruiting programs established connections to youth interested in science through linkages such as home-schooling networks, environmental centers, informal education programs linke..."
