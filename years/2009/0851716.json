The students will learn about three cross-disciplinary research themes that form the foundation of research in this area.  These include: 1) Novel Bioactive Architectures; 2) Cell/Protein interactions at Interfaces; and 3) Integration into Therapeutic and Diagnostic Devices. The specific objectives of this program include: 1) providing the students with interdisciplinary mentoring and research training; 2) stimulating the students' interests in Ph.D. careers in science and engineering through seminars, field trips, and interactions with both graduate students and faculty; and 3) developing the students' independence and confidence through participation in research, journal clubs, in-house presentations and scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nStudents will be recruited from various undergraduate disciplines including engineering, biology, chemistry and physics. The PI will make special efforts to attract women and minorities to this program.\r\n\r\n?This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.?\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall objective of this project was to provide a novel multidisciplinary research and education experience for rising junior and senior undergraduates in the area of Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices.  The University of Kentucky currently has a National Science Foundation IGERT program in this area, therefore, the REU students not only had the opportunity to interact with REU faculty but  also interacted with IGERT graduate trainees through research, special seminars, and other technical and social activities.  Specific objectives of the program included 1) providing the students with true interdisciplinary mentoring and research training through their participation in a research project related to Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices 2) stimulating the students\u00c6 interests in Ph.D. careers in science and engineering through seminars, field trips and interactions with both graduate students and faculty, and 3) developing the students\u00c6 independence and confidence through participation in research, journal clubs, in house presentations and scientific meetings.  During the 3 years of funding, a total of 42 undergraduate students participated in 10 weeks of research in summers of 2009, 2010 and 2011.  our REU program attracted students from a large number of institutions (19) across the United States, five of which were schools that did not offer graduate programs in science and engineering.    Another five of these schools offered graduate programs but were not classified as \"very high research\" by the Carnegie Foundation.  Two of these institutions (Tuskegee and Spelman) are HBCUs and University of Puerto Rico is known for its large population of underrepresented groups.  In all three years of the Program, we were able to recruit high quality students (Avg GPA 3.70).  The percentage of women and minorities participating in the program ranged from 47 &ndash; 59% and 17% - 20%, respectively.  The program was very successul in encouraging these students to pursue Ph.D. degrees following the completion of their BS degree.  Of the students participating in 2009, 50% are currently attending graduate school.  Of the students participating in 2010 and 2011, 53.3% are either currently attending graduate school or plan to following graduation with their BS degrees.  All of the students participants attended a national or regional professional meeting and presented their research either as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation.   Over 70 presentations have resulted from the research performed and 11 manuscripts have been submitted or are published based in peer-reviewed journals.  Eight additional manuscripts are currently in preparation.   Assessment of the Program at the end of each summer has indicated that the students found the program to be beneficial and would recommend other students to attend.  The Program has been renewed so the program will continue for another 3 years.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kimberly W Anderson"
