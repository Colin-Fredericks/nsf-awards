 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant award addresses the subject of cosmology using contemporary film technology. A screen play and film prototype will take viewers from the historical Big Bang phenomena to contemporary thinking on dark energy and matter. STEM disciplines incorporated within this project are mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and geology, in addition to astronomy. \r\n\r\nAn additional significant issue in this award will be the effort to form a network of dome and planetarium theaters. Such an organization could facilitate promotion and evaluation of this project and future projects. In the future, the network will be positioned to assess the differences in educational impact from large format flat screen, large format dome screen and planetarium dome presentations. \r\n\r\nCollaborations on this project include The Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, the Mathematics Science Research Institute, and advisors George Smoot and Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Barbara Flagg is the project evaluator.\r\n \r\nSpecific needs for the planning grant are to: \r\n\r\n1. gather formative evaluation on audience parameters; \r\n2. develop a short prototype film and a first draft of the screen play; \r\n3. complete the advisory team;\r\n4. translate the deliverables into Spanish language; \r\n5. evaluate and bid the computer animation facilities; and \r\n5. identify a network of dome and planetarium theaters for their evaluation.\r\n",
