 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project aims to: (1) study resources and strategies for teachers that will facilitate participation of 3rd grade Latino English Language Learners (ELLs) in the mathematics classrooms; (2) develop related teacher professional development (PD) materials; and (3) integrate research and teaching activities. The basic research question is: How can 3rd grade teachers facilitate better mathematics instruction for ELLs? The PI will conduct a longitudinal study with teachers over three years in nine third-grade classrooms involving 20 Latino ELLs in each classroom. Data (district-administered assessments, one-on-one formal interviews, classroom artifacts, brief conversations with children following the videotaped lessons) will be collected from multiple sources including the use of head-mounted cameras to videotape classroom social processes. Also, existing research base and data from the nine classrooms will be used to develop, test, and publish PD materials for pre-service and practicing elementary teachers. The integrated education activities will have a direct impact on the design of University of Missouri Teacher Development Program, Masters Programs, TESOL Certification Program, and Mathematics Education Doctoral Program as well as local schools. The proposed project is qualitative. Teachers will also participate in a three-year professional development on ELL strategies and use classroom activities in the fall semester that are designed to assist 3rd grade Latinos acquire mathematical competence on various aspects of the number sense strand of the mathematics curriculum. All the relevant instruments will be collected and analyzed. Findings from the proposed research and integrated research/education activities will expand the knowledge base in the fields of elementary mathematics education and multilingual education. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research and education activities will inform our understanding of effective strategies in mathematics classrooms that will influence learning processes and ultimately student outcomes relevant to Latino ELLs and potentially other groups of underrepresented students. Findings from the project will promote effective teaching and learning of mathematics at the elementary level and will be broadly disseminated to students, teachers, teacher educators, and education researchers throughout the U.S. The PI will create a vehicle (i.e., PD materials) for U.S. elementary teachers to discuss critical issues related to engaging a group of students that have typically been non-participants in mathematics classrooms and potentially facilitate more effective participation for this growing population.",

This NSF CAREER award, &ldquo;built a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership&rdquo; as the recipient was promoted to Associate Professor, Professor, Associate Dean, and Dean during the lifespan of the award. The PI co-authored 12 publications, delivered 13 presentations at national conferences, and designed and tested 17 three-hour professional development sessions as a result of this award. She also demonstrated leadership by chairing the NCTM Research Committee for two years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This three-year longitudinal intervention study followed four elementary teachers in two school districts. Both districts were predominantly white, with one district in a rural community. The study was framed using a conceptual model based on the ideas of Cohen, Raudenbush, and Ball (2003) who posit that &ldquo;teachers and learners must operate in several domains: they must hold and use knowledge, coordinate instruction, mobilize incentives for performance, and manage environments&rdquo; (p. 124). Organization, coordination, and use of resources influence classroom social processes which in turn influence student outcomes. If students do not engage and participate effectively in the classroom architecture, then their learning is hindered. Therefore, it is important to identify what hinders participation of Latina/os in mathematics classrooms and address it. It is also critical to equip teachers with strategies that facilitate participation of Latina/o emergent bilingual learners (LEBL).</p>\n<p>The data sources for this study included video and audio records of 250 mathematics lessons; field notes; audio records of weekly planning and debriefing meetings with teachers; interviews with teachers, participating LEBLs and their parents; school records; standardized test results; pre and post-mathematics tests conducted one-on-one in English and Spanish; and student class work.</p>\n<p>We used a unique method (i.e., student head-mounted cameras (see Figure 1)) to capture the classroom interactions of participants based on a proof-of-concept study conducted in 2005.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&nbsp;See attached photos.</span><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Figure 1.

The intervention with teachers focused on four components: (a) support the development of mathematics; (b) support the development of language; (c) enhance mathematical tasks; and (d) establish, facilitate, and maintain productive classroom interactions.&nbsp; We filmed two math lessons in each teacher&rsquo;s classroom and then reviewed the data. The PI met with each teacher to debrief the lessons and review video segments.

The videos filmed by the LEBLs became professional development tools that focused the teacher on important aspects of instruction and the specific strengths of individual students (e.g., mathematical, linguistic, and social competencies). One teacher stated, &ldquo;Watching videos through the head cameras has given me a perspective that I have never had as a teacher.&nbsp; I see the classroom as they do, and can implement changes to benefit their learning as a quiet observer of their mathematical thinking.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>All four teachers demonstrated enhancements in their knowledge, teaching practice, and dispositions related to teaching LEBLs. </strong></p>\n<p>Facilitating LEBLs&rsquo; participation and success in mathematics classrooms requires the development of academic (e.g., mathematics knowledge, norms, and practices), communicative (e.g., using language to demonstrate understanding, seek information through questioning), <em>and</em> social competencies (e.g., interacting with others in context-appropriate ways). LEBLs can often be positioned inequitably in peer-to-peer and whole-class discussions, which makes it more difficult for them to gain access to academic debate and discussion (Pinnow &amp; Chval, 2015). Inequitable positioning constrains students&rsquo; access to learning opportunities necessary for developing advanced mathematical and linguistic abilities. As a result, teachers must (a) establish an environment where students respect one another and value partnerships, (b) apply appropriate partner selection criteria, (c) identify subtle cues that indicate inequity, and (d) select appropriate strategies to intervene when necessary.</p>\n<p>Video data from the study provides evidence of the impact of the teacher&rsquo;s actions on LEBLs&rsquo; development as effective participants in the classroom. For example, analysis of video data from Courtney&rsquo;s classroom revealed the change in Miguel&rsquo;s participation over time. Prior to the intervention, Miguel&rsquo;s whole-class participation was infrequent and his contributions to whole-class discussions were limited in quality and quantity. Two months after the intervention began, Miguel had already demonstrated significant growth. Improvements on the mathematics post-tests in both English and Spanish also demonstrated the growth in student achievement for all the student participants.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kathryn&nbsp;B&nbsp;Chval</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0844556/0844556_10026883_1475081058010_P6100115--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0844556/0844556_10026883_1475081058010_P6100115--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Head Camera (Hat)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0844556/0844556_10026883_1475081058010_P6100115--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Head Camera (Hat)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Luke Chval modeling video camera used in the study</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kathryn Chval</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kathryn&nbsp;B&nbsp;Chval</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Head Camera (Hat)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0844556/0844556_10026883_1475081126188_P6100107--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0844556/0844556_10026883_1475081126188_P6100107--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student Head Camera (Glasses)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0844556/0844556_10026883_1475081126188_P6100107--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student Head Camera (Glasses)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Luke Chval modeling video camera used in the study</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kathryn Chval</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kathryn&nbsp;B&nbsp;Chval</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student Head Camera (Glasses)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
