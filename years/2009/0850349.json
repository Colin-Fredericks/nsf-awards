 "awd_abstract_narration": "This S-STEM scholars program awards scholarships to academically talented, but financially needy students seeking baccaulareate degrees in information technology and engineering disciplines.   This project builds on the success of other student centered programs funded by the National Science Foundation.  The Success Programs for Retention in Information Technology and Engineering (SPRITE) targets first generation students from underrepresented groups and provides scholarships that enable students to reduce their extracurricular work hours, thus liberating time for additional study.    Students selected to be SPRITE Scholars are eligible for comprehensive support services including faculty mentoring, tutoring and financial and career planning.   The SPRITE program features an on-line Professional Development Milestones program that students use throughout their academic career to assist with educational and career decisions.   This project awards approximately forty-five scholarships over the life of the grant.",
