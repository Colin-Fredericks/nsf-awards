 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective\r\nWe propose to design and build a suite of multichannel nonlinear-optical signal-processing devices (2R regenerator for phase-shift-keying transmission formats, switch/gate, and wavelength converter) based on nonlinear-optical loop mirror (NOLM), in which the key and novel component enabling the simultaneous processing of multiple wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) channels is a group-delay-managed (GDM) nonlinear medium. Such a GDM-medium differs from conventional dispersion-managed media in that its dispersion map is not only spatially, but also spectrally periodic, which eliminates nonlinear inter-channel interaction by ensuring large dispersive walk-off among different WDM channels, while preserving the integrity of each channel's pulses. \r\nThe project consists of three key efforts: \r\na)\tdevelopment and testing of multi-functional multichannel nonlinear-optical signal processor based on GDM-medium-enabled NOLM; \r\nb)\tdesign/fabrication of ultra-low-loss GDM-medium implementing novel multiport periodic-group-delay-device on a chip; \r\nc)\ttheoretical modeling of GDM-based NOLM. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe proposed first realization of devices that utilize large intra-channel optical nonlinearity while suppressing the inter-channel nonlinearity will overturn the accepted paradigms of all-optical processing, making transformative impact on optical communications, networking, and computing.\r\n\r\nBroader impact\r\nThis project will dramatically reduce complexity and cost of nonlinear-optical signal processing systems, expediting the roll-out of all-optical networking and increasing the bandwidth availability. The reduced, compared to electronic processing, power consumption will contribute to better environment. The compatibility of this approach with silicon and chalcogenide-glass waveguides makes it potentially beneficial for board-to-board and chip-to-chip networking. \r\n\r\nThis funding will support three graduate students who will get synergetic experience in optical communications systems, device fabrication, and applied mathematics.",
