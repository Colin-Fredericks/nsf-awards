 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome various stiff scales in computational simulations, this research team will  develop a  fully implicit solver based on a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) approach with an appropriate  preconditioner for FLASH, a multiphysics code framework used widely in the astrophysics community.  FLASH provides a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) parallel simulation grid  and explicit solvers based on Eulerian hydrodynamics as well as N-body astrophysics. It was originally  developed for simulations of Type Ia supernovae and related phenomena. Although FLASH  has been successfully applied to a range of problems allowing different length scales using its AMR  technology, its explicit scheme is of limited use for problems that are stiff in time. This weakness  occurs because explicit compressible solvers are extremely inefficient for resolving disparate time  scales in the stiff system. The main goal in this project is to develop a time accurate JFNK-based  implicit solver and combine it with the current second-order accurate unsplit explicit MHD solver  in FLASH. We will use the combined hybrid (explit/implicit) solver to perform cutting-edge simulations  addressing the heating of the solar corona problem whose nonlinear physics is dominated  by a stiff system of equations.   \r\n\r\nThis development will fully leverage the existing professional  management of the FLASH code, and its wide user base, to reach the computational physics community.  FLASH is an astrophysics community code available online without cost.",
