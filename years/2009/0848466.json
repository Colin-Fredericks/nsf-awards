Benstead from the University of Alabama will initiate an international stream ecosystem project with partners, Gisli Gislason at the University of Iceland and Jon Olafsson at the Institute of Freshwater Fisheries in Reykjavik. The U.S. team?s strengths in quantitative food web analysis and ecological stoichiometry complement the Icelandic partners? deep knowledge of steam and river fauna, climate issues, and landscapes in Iceland.  Their goal is to refine logistics and develop plans for observing selected field sites in the unique geothermal environments of Iceland for a three-year study of how temperature and nutrient concentrations affect freshwater ecosystems. \r\n\r\nResults from the intended long-term collaboration are expected to improve our fundamental understanding of the complex and interactive effects of major drivers of ecological change in mid-to-high latitude freshwater systems. If successful, we should gain new, objective information about how physiological changes at the organism level affect emergent community and ecosystem level properties.  Results may help inform policies and improve management of eutrophication, with implications for the future provision of freshwater and societal use.    \r\n\r\nThis research visit fulfills the program objective of advancing basic knowledge of fresh water ecology by enabling experts in the United States and Europe to share research resources and plan beneficial projects in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  Broader impacts include the training of U.S. graduate students by providing an early career introduction to collaborative field work in Iceland, which is one of the few places in the world where the components of this research are achievable within a relatively small geographic area.",
