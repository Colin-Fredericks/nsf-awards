Undergraduate students will be part of a research team which will include faculty, graduate Ph.D. candidates, post-doctoral research associates and technicians.  In addition to the research experiences, the students will participate in group meetings, seminars, and tours of industry facilities.  Ethics training is an integral part of this program.  Activities in ethics will be organized in coordination with the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions (CSEP) which was established in 1976.  CSEP is one of the nation's leading ethics centers, and is internationally recognized for its work on ethics in science and engineering. At the end of the program the participants will make formal presentations of their work at the IEEC Vehicle Power and Propulsion annual meeting.\r\n\r\nAs the US continues to rely more and more upon vehicular transportation, the looming problems of fuel supply and pollution become more imminent.  An immediate solution to this problem is essential, and the most promising solution lies in HEV and PHEV technologies. Automotive industries and research laboratories nationwide are pursuing electric and hybrid vehicle research seriously and the automotive industry is going through major reconstruction. This program will train and educate students in an effort to address the emerging workforce and educational needs of the U.S. automotive industry. The PI will place special emphasis on recruitment of underrepresented minorities for the program.\r\n\r\n ?This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.?\r\n",
