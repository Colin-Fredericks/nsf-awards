 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work asks, \"Why do some traits persist apparently unchanged for long periods of evolutionary time?\" One possibility is that this is due to exquisite conservation of individual genetic programs that direct development. However, evidence indicates that in many cases individual developmental regulators have functionally diverged even between fairly closely related species. An alternative explanation is that changes may accumulate without causing morphological differences if they compensate or \"buffer\" each other. This proposal will dissect specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the evolution of compensatory changes in the case of a single gene between two model worms, C. elegans and C. briggsae, and test the generality of the findings using a number of co-expressed genes in a variety of related nematodes. Since regulatory evolution is thought to be an important driving force of morphological evolution, this work will be of interest to a broad community of Evo-Devo researchers. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nDr. Ruvinsky incorporates findings of this work into his teaching of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Chicago as well as to science teachers of Chicago Public Schools. Research in Dr. Ruvinsky's laboratory will involve undergraduate and graduate students who will be trained in experimental and computational approaches central to this proposal. The PI and other members of the laboratory will present their findings at a variety of scientific meetings.",
