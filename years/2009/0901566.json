The\r\napproach is based on shockwaves from redox reactions of nanothermites. The shockwaves are\r\nused to deliver genes and/or drugs into cells with high transfection efficiency and cell survival.\r\nFurthermore, organosilicate nanoparticles synthesized on site will be utilized as an effective and\r\ntargeted delivery vehicle via the shockwave.\r\nIntellectual Merit. The proposed miniaturized systems will cover the large impulse range\r\nnecessary for permeabilization of a variety of cells and tissues with different mechanical\r\nproperties and/or environments. Unlike physical gene delivery methods which rely on bulky and\r\nexpensive instrumentation or chemical delivery methods that exhibit low transfection efficiency,\r\nthe proposed MEMS-based shockwave generator -- alone or in combination with nanoparticles -\r\n- will produce shockwave interactions and drug delivery at the single cell level, providing\r\nunprecedented control over cell transfection processes.\r\nBroader Impacts. The proposed research is expected to transform the study and understanding\r\nof biological processes in health and disease, and enable novel diagnostics and interventions.\r\nEducational objectives include recruitment of students from regional college programs, including\r\nthose with predominantly Black and Hispanic enrollment and a summer ?Nano Camp? for high\r\nschool students. Undergraduate and graduate students, particularly from rural areas of Missouri\r\nwill be trained to develop leadership, ownership, mentoring, career skills and entrepreneurship to\r\nprepare them for the 21st century work force.",
