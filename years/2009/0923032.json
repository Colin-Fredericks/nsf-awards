As a part of an effort to strengthen the base of knowledge in the United States in this area, the Materials Science and Engineering Program at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), is developing a new Masters degree in ?Materials for Energy Efficiency?.  This degree will emphasize both course work and extensive hands-on materials preparation and characterization in thermoelectric materials, fuel cells and emerging battery technologies, photo-electrochemical hydrogen generation materials, hydrogen storage materials and other energy related systems.  As a central part of this effort we are seeking to acquire a physical properties measurement system to enable the determination of thermal transport (Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity), heat capacity, and electron transport (AC/DC Resistivity and Hall Effect) properties of materials.  Optical access by light pipes and fiber optic cables will enable the study of photovoltaic systems and photo-electrochemical hydrogen generation materials.  Measurements over the temperature range of  2 K to 400 K will be possible.  The availability of high magnetic fields will enable the isolation of the spin contribution to thermal properties.   An integrated helium recovery system will enable very low operating cost and facilitate its continuous use and accessibility by students and researchers.  NJIT will provide all support facilities needed to operate this instrument.  Stationing the instrument in the NJIT York Materials Characterization Facility makes it accessible to students and researchers at NJIT.  The instrument will also be utilized in a transition metal oxide preparation and characterization workshop for Newark area high school students. \r\n\r\nLayman Summary: There is a critical need to develop new and novel materials for energy storage and energy conversion and recovery.  In order to tap the energy generated by the sun, highly efficient energy conversion materials need to be developed.  To enable low weight energy storage, better battery systems are needed.   To recover waste heat from electronics and internal combustion systems, new more efficient thermoelectric materials must be developed.  These issues point to the essential role for education and research in the area of materials for energy efficiency.  The Materials Science and Engineering Program at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), is developing a new Masters degree in ?Materials for Energy Efficiency? to fulfill this need. As a central part of this effort, we are seeking to acquire a comprehensive properties measurement system for research and education in this area. Specifically, we propose to acquire an instrument to characterize and to optimize the properties of materials used in fuel cells and emerging battery technologies, light induced hydrogen generation from water using solar energy, hydrogen storage, thermoelectrics and other energy related systems.  The instrument will also be utilized in a transition metal oxide preparation and characterization workshop for Newark area high school students. This will serve to develop scientific literacy and to directly influence students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in science.",
