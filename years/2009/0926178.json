 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: Engineering the Morphology and\r\nMicrostructure of Group III-V Compound Semiconducting\r\nNanowires\r\nInstitution: University of California-Los Angeles\r\nAbstract Date: 08/03/09\r\nThe goal of this interdisciplinary collaborative research effort between UCLA and Brown\r\nUniversity is to quantitatively understand the mechanisms governing the growth of\r\ngroup III-V compound semiconducting nanowire heterostructures and hence develop\r\nstrategies to tailor their morphology, crystallinity, and chemistry. Semiconducting\r\nnanowires have recently gained considerable attention owing to their potential for\r\napplications in optoelectronics, nanoelectronics, sensors, energy harvesting, and\r\nenergy storage. However, growth of desired multi-component nanowire heterostructures\r\nis difficult due to kinetic instabilities occurring during growth. To address this issue, the\r\nproposed research will combine in situ (as well as ex situ) studies of nanowire growth as\r\na function of temperature, time, flux, and catalyst composition with\r\ntheoretical/computational modeling. Simulated morphologies and structures will then be\r\ncompared with experimental observations to quantitatively describe the morphological,\r\nstructural, and compositional evolution during the growth of nanowires.\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide a holistic understanding of the\r\nnanowire heterostructure formation and help develop technologies for the fabrication of\r\nadvanced functional materials with desired properties. The proposed experimental and\r\ncomputational methods are general and applicable to investigate (and predict)\r\nnanostructure growth in other material systems as well as other synthesis (eg., solution\r\nphase) methods. The results will be disseminated to enhance the understanding of the\r\nnanowire growth mechanisms. Videos of in situ observations and growth simulations will\r\nbe posted on the Web to promote interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology among\r\nthe public. Graduate and engineering undergraduate students will benefit through\r\nclassroom instruction and involvement in the research. High-school students will be\r\nengaged to provide them firsthand research experience that will encourage them to\r\npursue higher education in engineering\r\n",
