The PI's goal is to utilize chemical biology concepts to enable basic virology and therapeutic applications. The PI's university and high school education programs are taking advantage of modern teaching principles to bring chemical biology principles to the forefront. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  \r\n\r\nThe outlined research program will build upon the fundamental strength of Stony Brook's chemical biology research and educational programs. The PI plans the development of new core curriculum as well as an aggressive outreach program, both of which are designed to bring underrepresented students into science and give them the tools to turn their interests into a career.",
