The funds were used to pay for salaries and fringe benefits of our marine technicians, for calibration of instrumentation such as the sensors on our CTD/Carousel , for spare parts and supplies (such as parts for our coring gear or water sampling bottles), and for travel to the annual UNOLS RVTec meeting.

Minor, OCE 0825600 \u00e6Collaborative Research: How important is \"old\" carbon in Lake Superior? A radiocarbon investigation\u00c6\n\n \n\nThe Austin project (OCE-0825633) sought to better understand the fact that Lake Superior water temperature is rising at a faster rate than regional air temperature by gaining insights into ice formation and ice duration on Lake Superior and lake ice\u00c6s impact on the lake\u00c6s thermal structure and carbon flux.  The Colman project (OCE-0623607) sought to better understand the onset of the Younger Dryas cold event which may shed some light on the impact of any future alteration in the ocean\u00c6s thermohaline circulation that may result from climate change.  Finlay\u00c6s project (OCE-0927512) sought to better understand the increase in nitrate in Great Lakes waters and allow researchers to gauge any impact that increased nitrate will have on Great Lakes biota.  Katsev\u00c6s project (OCE-0961720) reconstructed historical trends in primary productivity and nutrient inputs in Lake Superior by characterizing the sediment geochemistry of oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, organic carbon and iron.  Minor\u00c6s project (OCE 0825600) studied the various forms of carbon in the lake to estimate how much carbon is sequestered in lacustrine sediment versus how much carbon is emitted to the atmosphere as CO2\n\n \n\nThe R/V Blue Heron is open to all researchers and educators and technical support for cruises is paid by each user.  In addition to facilitating research projects on the Great Lakes as illustrated by the NSF projects mentioned above, the R/V Blue Heron has numerous educational or \u00e6class cruises\u00c6 as well as outreach cruises during the year (12 during 2011), enabling undergraduate and graduate students to participate in work on a research vessel with equipment typically used on larger, ocean going, research vessels.  Also, undergraduate and graduate students participate on almost every R/V Blue Heron cruise as research assistants.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/05/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard D Ricketts"
