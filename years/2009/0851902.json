 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The Virginia Tech REU Site will provide a research program for undergraduates during the summers of 2009-2011. Ten students will be selected each year to participate in an intensive 10-week research program in microbiology. The program will introduce participants to projects using genome-based technologies as well as focused approaches in analyzing a wide range of microbiological phenomena. Recruitment will emphasize the inclusion of members from underrepresented groups, and those at institutions where opportunities for research are limited. The program will include i) a student-led independent research project; ii) discussion sessions and seminars given by faculty members and external speakers; iii) career sessions on gaining admission to a Ph.D. program and pursuing graduate studies productively; iv) visits to companies and laboratories that utilize or study microbiological processes; and vi) presentation of research results by each student in a poster and/or seminar format at a campus-wide research symposium. During the 2nd and 3rd year of the program, two high school teachers will participate in all activities and interact with the REU participants. In addition, the teachers will develop focused projects applicable for introducing the students to microbiological phenomena in the classroom. The program provides a stipend, travel to and from the site, and room and board. Additional information is available from the Program Director, Dr. Biswarup Mukhopadhyay (e-mail: biswarup@vt.edu, phone: 540 231 8015) or online at http://microbiologyreu-ret.vbi.vt.edu/.",
