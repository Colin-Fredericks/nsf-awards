 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative research project is to investigate the material substrate-processing interfacial conditions in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown diamond films on cobalt-cemented tungsten-carbide (WC-Co) tools. Coating delamination is the major life-limiting factor to diamond-coated WC-Co cutting tools. Interface engineering, by means of surface treatments and interlayer, and optimum nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) deposition are the key solutions to achieve high-quality diamond coatings for dry machining. This collaborative research will focus on the fundamental mechanisms of interface fabrications, properties and functions to enhance the substrate/coating performance over the life of the cutting tools, and will form joint tasks of modeling, characterization, and optimization of surface conditioning, interlayer interfacial preparations, and subsequent deposition processes. Validation of enhancements to interfacial performance will be demonstrated through machining analysis and wear characterization. In addition, environmental process monitoring, in both coating and dry machining with diamond coated tools, will be conducted with data collected for life-cycle inventory and environmental impact analysis.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will lead to breakthrough of diamond coated tools whose performance is comparable to or better than costly polycrystalline diamond tools. Engineering of interlayer and NCD coating optimization, with material characterizations and performance analysis, will further mature the diamond coated tooling technology for industrial applications. This research will also advance knowledge of interface science, critical to coating system functions, especially in harsh tribological services. The findings gained on interface characteristics and behavior modeling will also offer knowledge transformable to other coating system studies. The proposed program will also synergize universities-industry partnership by providing opportunities for faculty and students to conduct research and gain experiences with production processes in an industrial setting. The collaborations will offer opportunity to students working with industrial colleagues and use of their state-of-the-art equipment facilities.",
