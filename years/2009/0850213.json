 "awd_abstract_narration": "This S-STEM project broadens the participation of underrepresented minorities and women by providing financial and academic support leading to 17 students obtaining their Bachelors degrees in Computer Science. Scholarships are awarded to 9 freshman and to 4 community college students transferring in as juniors, with four more community college students when the first 4 graduate.\r\nA network of mature organizations with proven track records provides academic support for underrepresented minority and female CS Scholar students. These organizations offer tutoring, career guidance, scholarships, access to internships, and university research opportunities for CS Scholars. CS Scholars benefit from a special summer preview orientation, regular cadre activities to foster a group identity, and a CS Scholars lounge of their own adjacent to the CS labs. CS Scholars are paid to return on visits to the high schools from which they came, serving as role models.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: CS occupations are vitally important and include occupations with rapidly increasing demand. While the population in the US is becoming more ethnically and racially diverse, computer science is becoming less diverse, with fewer women. To meet the demand for skilled CS workers, it is essential that we as a nation reverse this trend.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: CS Scholars increase by 17 the number of African Americans, Hispanics, and women in CS. While being mentored by existing upper-level CS undergraduate students, CS Scholars serve as role models to approximately 1,000 high schools students per year. School visits and presentations are part of existing collaborations with area high schools and community colleges. CS Scholars are encouraged to participate in existing research programs. Four CS Scholars are given the opportunity to travel to national conferences.",

Cumulative grade point averages across all the semesters for the cadre of CS Scholars was 3.15 / 4.0\n\nOf the total supported students, twelve CS Scholars are female (44%), nine are Latino (33%), five African-American (19%) and two Native American (7%).   Twenty-two of the students (81%) are female and/or part of a racial group underrepresented in Computing.   Approximately half (13/27 = 48%) started at UIC as Freshman, with 14 (52%) coming in as transfer students and the remaining five being existing students supported only for one or two semesters near the end of the grant funding cycle.\n\nOne lesson learned in this project is that technology is no substitute for human interaction, particularly when it comes to nurturing at-risk students through successfully completing a CS major, when they often lack family and home community supports.
