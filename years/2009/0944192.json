The workshop will bring together researchers, scientists, and engineers who are interested in micro and nano systems for panel discussions on how to prioritize research in this area.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis workshop will cover emerging research themes relevant to micro and nano systems interests in the ECCS division, including four topics to be addressed in break-out sessions: environmental monitoring; infrastructure monitoring and homeland security; health care; and energy/power.  The Transducers 2009 Conference also covers these topics, and includes many papers supported by ENG and ECCS awards.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe workshop and conference will involve a range of participants from industrial representatives to academic researchers and students.  Representatives of other government agencies have also been invited as observers.\r\n",
