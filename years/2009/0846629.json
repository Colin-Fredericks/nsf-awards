 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to acquire in depth, scientific understanding of the relationships between microstructure, processing and properties for macroscale materials produced from model cylindrical nanomaterial dispersions.  Cylindrical nanomaterials are a particularly exciting new class of materials because they can be produced from many chemical elements; this enables a wide range of potential properties and applications. It has never before been possible to investigate systems with such large rod lengths, wide range of length to diameter ratios, high rigidity, and potential for large long-range interactions.  The potential liquid crystalline phase behavior of the cylindrical nanomaterial dispersions will be investigated as a function of temperature, nanomaterial dimensions, and solvent interactions. Changes in dispersion morphology and alignment in response to shear will also be explored.  This information will be used to optimize the bottom-up assembly of solid macroscopic films and fibers comprised of cylindrical nanomaterial building blocks. The research plan includes collaboration with Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Bourdeaux France.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide a basis for controlling the alignment and distribution of cylindrical nanomaterials during the production of advanced macroscopic materials. Potential applications include macroelectronic devices, sensors, electro-optical devices, and antimicrobial coatings. The interdisciplinary education of undergraduate and graduate researchers is an integral part of achieving the research goals.  As part of this CAREER plan, the PI will develop fun and rewarding experiences that encourage students to choose and persist in science and engineering majors. These activities include mentoring undergraduate researchers and facilitating the educational and career development of students from underrepresented groups.  In addition, nanotechnology outreach activities will be incorporated into science camps for middle school students.  \r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Materials Processing & Manufacturing Program, of the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation Division and by the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
