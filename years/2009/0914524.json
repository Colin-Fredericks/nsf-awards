 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most algorithmic research in optimization has focused on models\r\nconsisting of a single objective together with a number of\r\nconstraints, all defined precisely and deterministically, where an\r\nexact solution is required. This paradigm is inadequate in many\r\napplications. First, there is often uncertainty in the model and data;\r\nthis is being dealt with by a recent upsurge of work in stochastic and\r\nrobust optimization. Second, users often require a simple approximate\r\nsolution rather than a more complicated exact solution. When the\r\nproblem is formulated in the appropriate space, simplicity is often\r\nmanifested as sparsity - the vector of variables has relatively few\r\nnonzeros. Inclusion of nonsmooth regularization terms in the\r\nformulation can steer the model toward sparse solutions. This proposal\r\nfocuses chiefly on algorithms and theory for sparse and regularized\r\noptimization, and on application of the methods to such important\r\nareas as compressed sensing, machine learning, computational\r\nstatistics, and image processing. The project also takes a\r\nhigher-level view, cross-fertilizing algorithmic ideas across\r\ndifferent application areas, and devising and analyzing algorithms in\r\ngeneral settings that encompass many specific applications. \r\n\r\n\r\nOptimization methods can be used to solve a great variety of practical\r\nproblems, such as design of cancer treatment plans, removing noise and\r\nblur from images and videos, identifying genomic and environmental\r\nrisk factors for diseases, and reconstructing pictures, signals, and\r\nother data sets from limited random samples. Precise mathematical\r\nformulations of these optimization problems are available, and exact\r\nsolutions can often be obtained, but what is needed in many cases is a\r\nsimple, approximate solution that is easy to compute, understand, and\r\napply.  To take one example: Many images can be stored by taking a\r\nsmall number of random combinations of the pixels that make up the\r\nimage. The optimization algorithm that reconstructs the original\r\npicture from the samples should look for the simplest picture that is\r\nroughly consistent with the random observations; this image is likely\r\nto appear more natural than complicated images that give an exact\r\nmatch to the data. This project investigates how the mathematical\r\nstatements of problems like this one, and the mathematical methods\r\nthat solve them, can be modified to produce simple solutions.",
