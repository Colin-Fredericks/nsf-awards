 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuals who engage in creative, innovative, entrepreneurial behavior are highly prized in American society. Entrepreneurial activity is essential for a robust economy. An emerging body of literature suggests that social influences affect individuals' creative and innovative behavior by inducing a specific mindset or regulatory focus. A promotion-focus mindset characterized by an emphasis on growth, development, achievement is associated with entrepreneurial behavior. Notably, organizations play a role in shaping this mindset in individuals.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this research project is to explore the impact of religious communities (churches, synagogues, temples, mosques) on individuals' regulatory mindsets and entrepreneurial behavior. The research team will test whether specific values and practices within religious communities are conducive to heightened entrepreneurial activity. This project includes a national survey of working adults as well as in-depth case studies of eight religious communities.  The results of have potential to enhance both theory and practice. They will advance interdisciplinary theory related to explaining entrepreneurial mindsets and behavior. In addition, they will provide the basis for practical, research-based prescriptions for mobilizing religious communities to promote entrepreneurial behaviors that are essential for a thriving economy.",
