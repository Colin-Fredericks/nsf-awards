 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to offer a fundamental study of video communications over dynamic ad hoc networks.  The approach is to exploit recent advances in multiple description coding, multi-path routing, packet scheduling, and per-node power control across the layers of the protocol stack.  Specifically, there are three main thrusts in the research activities: (1) cross-layer modeling and theoretical study; (2) design of distributed algorithms and protocols; and (3) testbed prototyping and validation.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project includes the following components.  First, there is limited research pursuing a holistic consideration of video transport under the impact of multiple lower layers. Such efforts, however, are necessary to optimize video performance. This research will thus offer new cross-layer video optimization models and theoretical results. Second, the efforts on the development of distributed algorithms and protocols will offer not only practical operational algorithms, but algorithms that can approach the theoretical limits.  Finally, the efforts on testbed prototyping will offer deeper insights into the challenges associated with video communications over ad hoc networks as well as valuable feedback to the theoretical and algorithmic research.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include: (1) the development of new educational materials to bridge the gap between software applications, networking, and wireless communication, and (2) research experience for undergraduates and special opportunities for underrepresented minority students.",
