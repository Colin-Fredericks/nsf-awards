 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complex fluids are abundant in many industrial applications, e.g., emulsions and foams, and commonly found in biology, e.g., blood and synovial fluid. These materials exhibit rich dynamic macroscopic behavior that stems from the interplay between microstructure distortion by external forcing (flow) and microstructure relaxation by intrinsic mechanisms as in polymer recoiling or cell shape relaxation. Understanding the microscale physics remains a major open research problem. The non-equilibrium dynamics of soft- and bio-materials is arguably one of the biggest questions in biophysics. The international summer school 'Complex- and Bio-Fluids' will provide a forum for discussion about the challenges and approaches in modeling flows of soft materials. Moreover, it will foster interactions between different disciplines (physics, engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, biology and medical science) as well as different generations (expert senior scientists and students). This award will provide travel support for the future expert senior scientists.",
