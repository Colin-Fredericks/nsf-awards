 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to develop a practical catalytic method for CH functionalization by means of carbenoid-induced CH insertion.  This project covers the design of new chiral catalysts and the application of unusual carbenoid transformations into useful synthetic methods.  Studies will also be conducted to further define the scope of rhodium-carbenoid induced CH functionalization with emphasis on refining the controlling elements for regioselective CH functionalization and broadening the range of donor/acceptor carbenoids that can be used in this chemistry.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Huw M.L Davies of the Department of Chemistry at SUNY at Buffalo.  Dr. Davies will focus his work on the development of methodologies for metal catalyzed asymmetric transformations.   The use of donor/acceptor-substituted carbenoids to increase the scope of C-H insertion chemistry will be highlighted by this research.  The project has potential broader impact for the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries and the work provides an excellent venue for the training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nPowerful new synthetic methods can become enabling technologies with broad impact in fields beyond organic chemistry.  In order to develop truly new synthetic methods, it is necessary to discover new types of reactivity, which can become the foundation of the new methodology. This project has been directed towards developing new methods for synthesis. A central feature of the program is the control of the three dimensional architecture of complex molecules by using highly efficient catalyst.  Under the most optimum conditions one equivalent of the catalyst is sufficient to catalyze the formation of over 1,000,000 equivalents of the product.   Furthermore as the new methodologies are entirely different from the conventional strategies for synthesis, they make available new classes of compounds that were previously inaccessible.\n\nDuring the last funding period the results of this program have been broadly disseminated, resulting in seven invited book chapters, three invited reviews, two invited highlights and 14 papers published, accepted or submitted. Furthermore the methodology is being widely recognized.  Several specialist reports and textbooks describing the major new advances occurring in organic synthesis have prominently referenced the new methods developed in this program.  The methodology has broad application outside of chemistry and is the enabling technology behind research programs on medication development for neuropathic pain, drug addiction and cancer treatment.\n\nThe research is conducted in an environment that is highly conducive for personal growth and collaborative interaction.  The research group consists primarily of post doctoral and graduate student researchers but offers numerous mentoring opportunities to undergraduate and high-school students.  Over the last 18 months, ten undergraduate and two high school students have conducted research with the group.  The group targets promising students from under-represented groups to become engaged in research.  Over the last granting period one African American male and one Hispanic female have successfully completed their Ph. D\u00c6s and one Hispanic male has successfully completed his masters degree.  The group has been very engaged in introducing chemistry research to high school students, and both professor and students have visited high schools and have hosted groups of high school students in science enrichment programs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Huw M Davies"
