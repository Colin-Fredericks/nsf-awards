 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synthetic biology is an emerging field lying at the interface of engineering,  science and mathematics. It is concerned with the design, construction and analysis of novel biological systems, with the ultimate goal of enabling beneficial applications in health, materials and energy. One approach to synthetic biology begins with understanding basic components and systematically increasing complexity, one step at a time, first understanding simpler networks before integrating that knowledge into understanding the functioning of more complex ones. A key element of this approach is the development of mathematical models that can be used in analysing and predicting the dynamic behavior of fundamental components, as well as in understanding how components interact when combined in a more complex system.\r\n\r\nThe PI, Dr. Ruth Williams,  a Professor in the Mathematics Department at the University of California, San Diego, has extensive experience with mathematical analysis and control of complex stochastic network models arising in non-biological applications such as manufacturing, computer science and telecommunications. Under the IGMS grant, the PI will spend a year visiting the Systems Biodynamics Lab in the Bioengineering Department at UCSD. Her hosts will be the leaders of the lab, Drs. Jeff Hasty and  Lev Tsimring. Being physically based in the Systems Biodynamics Lab will allow the PI to interact on a day-to-day basis with researchers there. Especially important in this regard will be the opportunity to interact with those performing experiments, so that mathematical models and associated analyses can be informed by the results of experiments and conversely the design of experiments can be informed by the analysis of mathematical models. The IGMS grant will enable the PI to acquire the new knowledge and experience to  expand her research to applications in synthetic biology. In particular, it will enable her to participate in interdisciplinary  research in synthetic biology, to mentor undergraduate and graduate students in synthetic biology, and to direct mathematics Ph.D. students on projects with applications in synthetic biology.",
