 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Strategic Plan to Enhance STEM Education and Research at AAMU\" is an innovative, comprehensive, and focused approach to strengthening STEM education at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU). We will implement the STEM Education and Research program by enhancing the quality of education, mentoring students to improve graduation rates of STEM undergraduates, improving the Fundamental Engineering Exam passing rates for engineering graduates, increasing the recruitment and retention of STEM students, expanding research opportunities for faculty and students, enhancing existing STEM curricula for undergraduate STEM students, and providing professional development for STEM faculty.\r\nTo achieve our goals, we propose to develop a tutoring program for engineering students to strengthen students' basic skills in STEM areas and prepare them for the Professional Engineering License exam, develop a STEM-SI Peer Tutoring (Supplemental Instruction) program, develop a Summer Bridge Program to prepare incoming STEM students, develop a Summer Sophomore Mathematics Program for STEM Gatekeeper courses, enhance STEM curricula by creating a series of advanced interdisciplinary courses, expand undergraduate research in all STEM related disciplines, organize a set of faculty development workshops on the integration of cyberinfrastucture resources such as video podcasts and facebook groups, and provide STEM related seminars with prominent scholars from institutions of higher education and industry.\r\nWe are aiming for a reduction of attrition in lower level undergraduate gate-keeping courses, an increase in the number of under-represented minority students matriculating in and graduating from STEM fields, an increase in student participation in interactive discovery based undergraduate research, and an increase in the passing rate of the Professional Engineering License exam.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe STEP-UP Program had four goals:\n\nGoal 1. Enhancing the quality of education and mentoring to improve graduation rates of STEM undergraduates and improving the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam passing rates for engineering graduates.\n\nGoal 2. Increasing the recruitment, retention, and transition of STEM students from secondary to post-graduate studies and industry. \n\nGoal 3. Enhancing existing undergraduate STEM curricula and expanding undergraduate research opportunities.\n\nGoal 4. Providing professional development for STEM faculty in teaching and learning methodologies applicable to 21st century pedagogies. \n\nThese goals were satisfied by implementing the following activities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Supplemental Instruction: In collaboration with AAMU's Tutorial Assistance Network (TAN) program, HBCU-UP offered SI peer tutoring in STEM gate-keeping courses. Students who participated in the SI tutorial program had an average improvement of one letter grade higher than students who were non- participants. \n\n2. Fundamentals of Engineering: HBCU-UP project offered additional tutorial to prepare engineering majors to successfully pass the FE exam. For example, in Fall 2012, two of five participating students passed the FE Exam. In Spring 2013, three of four students passed the Exam. For these two terms the success rate was 40% and 75% respectively. In other years there was a similar success rate. \n\n3. Sophomore Math Program: AAMU's STEM sophomores were tutored in math courses that had high failure rates by mathematics faculty. For students who completed the program, the success rate of participants students in passing mathematics course was 100%, however several students dropped out.\n\n4. Summer Bridge Program: A six-week long non-residential summer program was offered to 30 local high school sophomores and juniors to encourage them to become STEM majors in their post-secondary education. The program introduced the students to various aspects of being a professional scientist or engineer: Professional Writing, Mathematics, Computer Modeling and Visualization, Physics, Civil Engineering.\n\n5. STEM Faculty Development: Several faculty enhancement workshops designed to assist STEM faculty in effective pedagogies and use of technology-enhanced instruction were offered in collaboration with AAMU's Center of Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL). A large fraction of AAMU's STEM faculty members participated in workshops and/or seminars offered by the HBCU-UP project in collaboration with CETL. \n\n6. Curriculum Development: HBCU-UP has developed and offered several new interdisciplinary science and engineering courses across the STEM departments. One new Physics course ,Scientific Computing and Visualization (PHY 310, developed by Co-PI, Dr. Marius Schamschula) was officially added to the AAMU Undergraduate Catalog. \n\n7. Student Research: An undergraduate student research program was offered to mentor and guide students in conducting research in their respective STEM discipline during academic year. HBCU-UP student researchers made presentations in various national (including the ERN Conference), regional, and local STEM conferences. They won a number of presentation and travel awards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marius Schamschula"
