 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras is the host site for the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate Program for academic years 209-2011. A seventh cohort of 12 students will be supported during the first two years of graduate studies in a STEM field at  UPR, bringing the total number of BD fellowship recipients to 82 since the start of the program in 2003.\r\n \r\nFellows will participate in the Support Program that was successfully implemented with the six previous Cohorts, to enhance their academic preparation. A tracking system, designed by PR-LSAMP and in use, will document participant progress, including completion of degree and entering into the workforce, including the professoriate. \r\n\r\nThe BD Program is designed to: 1) prepare the next generation of scientists for careers in research and/or university teaching in Puerto Rico or the Mainland US and, 2) increase the nation?s pool of well-prepared, competent scientists with diverse views. Increasing the pool of STEM faculty members with Ph.D. degrees in Puerto Rico?s undergraduate institutions will have a long-term impact, particularly when taking into consideration the cumulative effect of graduates? life careers in academia and the thousands of students whose learning will be impacted.\r\n\r\n",
