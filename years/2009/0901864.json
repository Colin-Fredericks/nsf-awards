 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to investigate mechanical energy scavenging by electrospun piezoelectric nanofibers.  The approach of this project is to orderly deposit piezoelectric nanofibers using the near-field-electrospinning process.  These nanofibers, when deposited and arranged in the right manner and put into the right places, could convert mechanical energy into electricity.  Specifically, a self-powering system that harvests its operating energy directly from the environment is an attractive proposition for sensing, personal electronics and security technologies.\r\nThis proposed in-situ stretching and poling process by the near-field-electrospinning for the production of orderly deposited piezoelectric nanofibers is the key innovation of the project.  Placement, polarity and direction of these nanofibers are well-controlled to enable nanopower energy generation applications.  This project will investigate process protocols of electrospun piezoelectric nanofibers, including viscosity, conductivity, surface tension of the polymer solution, applied electrical field, tip diameter of the spinneret, the size of the droplet, and ambient parameters including temperature, humidity and air velocity to have optimized deposition and piezoelectric energy conversion efficiency with a large area energy harvester demonstration as the goal.\r\n\tThe demonstration of electrospun nanofibers as possible power generators could have a profound impact in various application areas, including energy harvesting, strain sensing, and actuation sources.  It will benefit the general Microelectromechanical Systems community to inspire new device development.  The synergy of research and education interaction and integration between manufacturing, material sciences and mechanical energy conversion will be an engine for the multidisciplinary fusion in research/education expertise for the next-generation scientists and engineers.\r\n",
