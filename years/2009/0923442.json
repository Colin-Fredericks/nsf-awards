El Paso\r\n\t\tEl Paso, TX 79968-0587\r\nTitle:  \t\tMRI/Acq.: Acq. of the Cyber-ShARE Collaborative Visualization System\r\n\r\nProject Proposed:\r\nThis project, acquiring a collaborative visualization system referred to as the Cyber-ShARE Collaborative Visualization System (C2ViS) to present high-resolution displays of scientific datasets for exploratory monitoring, supports interdisciplinary research and enables development of new visualization techniques for analyzing and integrating large datasets from the geosciences, environmental sciences, computational sciences, material sciences, biomedical engineering, and other domains. The tile-display 32-monitor system will be driven by 32 workstations interconnected by a high-speed network controlled by a single computer acting as a head node. With an overall 131 megapixels display resolution, images using the full resolution of the tiled-system are physically sent to each machine via open-source software. Supporting a variety of exploratory applications, C2ViS also supports both local and virtual organizations and serves as a resource for city and county government entities, as well as regional school districts.\r\nApplications include the visualization of tomography models of the subsurface of the Earth, spatial surface datasets from geosciences and environmental science communities, and 3-D solid models for advanced material fabrication, tissue engineering, and biomodeling. In addition, the system will extend Cyber-ShARE?s ability to support interdisciplinary projects, including those related to knowledge representation, trust management, and visualization of scientific data and results, CI-based geological model and data fusion for integration of whole-Earth models, and characterization of ecological and environmental phenomena through sensor network and data stream organization.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project contributes to engage young faculty and attract quality researchers to this minority-serving institution. A high-resolution system allows researchers to view data from different perspectives and abstraction levels, enhancing analysis, exploration, and discovery. Furthermore, the system will be used for outreach and education programs to attract students to STEM fields. Middle high schools brought in for summer workshops students will be excited and motivated by interacting with complex graphical models.",
