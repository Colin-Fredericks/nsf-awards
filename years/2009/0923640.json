 "awd_abstract_narration": "The centromere is the domain of a chromosome that governs the segregation and transmission of the chromosome from generation to generation.  It has been well demonstrated in several model species that the establishment and maintenance of the centromere in its location on a chromosome is determined by epigenetic modifications of centromeric DNA and/or centromeric proteins.  Epigenetic modifications change the behavior of DNA without actually changing the DNA sequence itself.  Although vitally important for centromere function, little is known about which epigenetic modifications are critical and whether any are specific to the complex of DNA, RNA and protein that makes up centromeric chromatin.  Using rice as a model and approaches that include chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing, this project will reveal the location of epigenetic marks, such as cytosine DNA methylation and histone modifications, associated with centromeric chromatin.  The information generated from this project will also provide information about the potential levels of transcription associated with centromeric DNA compared with DNA located outside the centromere region. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: The personnel of this project will be involved in teaching an annual Plant Cytogenetics Training Workshop for the plant genome research community.  This workshop provides hands-on training in several molecular cytogenetic techniques.  This project will also provide summer research training for minority undergraduate students along with area high school students.  The results of this project will have an impact on future technology development that can be used to improve agricultural practices.\r\n",
