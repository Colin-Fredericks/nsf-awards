 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many emerging quantum information technologies require access to some form of quantum entanglement in order to operate.  Understanding what is needed and what is possible to achieve with these technologies is frustrated by the large number of types of multiparticle entanglement that could be produced.  The role of multiparticle quantum entanglement as a resource and the proliferation of entanglement types with increasing particle numbers motivate a program of classification.  A good classification scheme provides a framework for understanding properties of and relationships among quantum states, puts interesting states in a context, and introduces concepts that allow explanation and interpretation of new findings.  The goal of this research is to produce such a classification scheme.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide a framework and a language in which to articulate the needs and resources of quantum information processing tasks, and will therefore be of use to researchers trying to make these tasks a reality.  A second broader impact of this project is direct influence on the scientific careers of promising young students.  Undergraduates will participate as research assistants who will carry out computational experiments, write computer code to generate examples and test hypotheses, and prove special cases of broad conjectures.  Engagement in research teaches the process of intellectual inquiry and discovery in a way that classroom work alone cannot achieve.  This project will strengthen the research environment at Lebanon Valley College by supporting students in research activities including presentations at scientific meetings and publications in scientific journals.",
