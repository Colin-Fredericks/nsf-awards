 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop innovative mathematics to\r\ncompare, optimize and visualize phylogenetic, or evolutionary,\r\ntrees.  We will analyze, via a combination of theoretical\r\nadvances and computational experimentation, the metric space of\r\ntrees.  Our efforts will focus on better understanding of and\r\nimproving algorithms for calculating biologically relevant tree\r\nmetrics.  We will focus on the interaction between these metrics\r\nand the canonical, but NP-hard, optimization criteria favored by\r\nbiologists.  Computationally expensive searches are currently\r\nused to estimate the optimum and can survey only a tiny fraction\r\nof treespace.  Deeper understanding of treespace will improve\r\nsearches and sampling methods by suggesting better starting\r\npoints, identifying clustering of local optima and suggesting\r\nlocations of global optima.\r\n\r\nPhylogenies, or evolutionary histories, play a central role in\r\nmodern biology, illustrating the interrelationships between\r\nspecies, and also aiding the prediction of structural,\r\nphysiological, and biochemical properties that can lead to the\r\ndiscovery of new drugs and vaccines. The reconstruction of the\r\nunderlying evolutionary history from a set of morphological\r\ncharacters or biomolecular sequences is difficult since the\r\noptimality criteria favored by biologists are hard to compute,\r\nand the space of possible answers is huge. Due to this, clever\r\nsearching techniques and heuristics are used to estimate the\r\noptimal tree. To improve these important, and computationally\r\nintensive, methods, we propose to step back and rigorously\r\nexamine the underlying space of trees, along with different\r\noptimality criteria (often called the ?landscape? of trees), and\r\nprovide a detailed understanding of the space of trees to improve\r\nphylogenetic tree reconstruction.",
