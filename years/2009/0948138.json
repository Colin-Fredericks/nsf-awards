Wolf, University of Virginia\r\nProject Summary:\r\nThis project is focused on the development of novel tunnel barriers and electrodes for\r\nmagnetic tunnel junctions that will be utilized in a new type of magnetic memory called\r\nSpin Torque Transfer Random Access Memory or STT-RAM. Although there is a\r\nworldwide rush to develop this new memory technology, there are some fundamental\r\nchallenges that need to be overcome. In particular, finding materials that allow the\r\njunction to be switched with low currents and also have very long term thermal stability.\r\nThe goal of this EAGER proposal is to very quickly demonstrate novel solutions to these\r\nchallenges and provide a rapid path to accelerate the development of this technology just\r\nas the novel toggle switching did for the more conventional Magnetic Random Access\r\nMemory or MRAM that has been recently commercialized. A very unique approach is\r\ndesigned to solve this problem based on developing novel oxides that have exemplary\r\nproperties that will enable tunnel junctions utilizing these materials to satisfy the\r\nrequirements of very low power switching and excellent thermal stability (10 year\r\nretention of data). In this project the exploration has three paths that could produce a\r\nrobust and scalable STT-RAM: (1) new tunnel barriers; (2) better ferromagnetic\r\nelectrodes; (3) new material with perpendicular magnetization.\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis proposal addresses the development of novel oxide and other materials and\r\nstructures that are highly complex and show strong electronic correlations and emergent\r\nbehavior. Understanding these materials and their emergent behavior has a clear\r\nintellectual payoff beyond just revolutionizing the STT-RAM state of the art.\r\nFurthermore, these materials are being prepared using new deposition methods: Biased\r\nTarget Reactive Ion Beam Deposition and Pulsed Electron Beam Deposition that provide\r\nunprecedented control of the growth of highly ordered and smooth ultra thin films. The\r\ndemonstration of the development of these films using these unique tools that enable\r\nrapid exploration of broad composition space and evaluation of novel properties provides\r\nsolutions to a set of important research and technological challenges. This project has a\r\nhigh degree of Intellectual Merit and will provide a series of interesting publications in\r\naddition to translational technological solutions.\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nIf successful, the results of this project will be immediately incorporated into this new\r\ngeneration of random access, non-volatile memory which can, in principle be a Universal\r\nmemory that replaces SRAM, DRAM and FLASH. UVa?s participation with the\r\nSemiconductor Industry both the large companies as well as a major startup company\r\nalmost guarantees that any breakthroughs will be quickly adopted. The solid state\r\nmemory industry has a market of over $100 Billion.",
