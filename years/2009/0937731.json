 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cross-Linked Models (XLM) project links learning resources to and from the Open Source Physics (OSP) Collection within the comPADRE NSDL Pathway by engaging students, teachers, and the general public in physics, computational physics, and computer modeling.   This goal is achieved by modifying existing models or creating new models that are indexed and cross-referenced to journal articles, by publishing descriptions of new simulations in the American Journal of Physics and The Physics Teacher, by incorporating OSP items into American Physical Society education and outreach projects, by establishing relations (comPADRE cross references) between OSP Collection items and other comPADRE collections, and by linking OSP Collection items to entries in Creative Commons friendly websites, such as Wikipedia. \r\nThe XLM project impacts education nationwide by strengthening the ties between the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teacher's professional societies and the comPADRE NSDL Pathway.  Although the development of new simulations is an outcome of the XLM grant, OSP developers will continue to create new materials.  The primary purpose of the XLM is to add context and value to resources and to make this material more useful for digital library users.",
