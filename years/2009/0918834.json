 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers and developers at WestEd are developing, field-testing, and evaluating ten online professional development modules anchored in research-based teaching principles and achievement-boosting mathematics materials.  The modules provide interactive learning opportunities featuring real classroom video demonstrations, simulations, and scaffolded implementation.  The professional development module development builds on the Math Pathways and Pitfalls (MPP) instructional modules for middle school students developed with NSF support. The professional development provided through the use of these modules is web-based (rather than face-to-face), is provided in chunks during the school year and immediately applied in the classroom (rather than summer professional development and school year application), and explicitly models ways to apply key teaching principles to regular mathematics lessons (rather than expecting teachers to extract and apply principles spontaneously).\r\n\r\nThe project studies the impact of the modules on teaching practice with an experimental design that involves 20 treatment teachers and 20 control teachers.  Data are gathered from teacher questionnaires, classroom observations, and post-observation interviews.\r\n",
