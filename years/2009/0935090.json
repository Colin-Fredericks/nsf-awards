Using data mining and social networking techniques, this project will identify emerging research topics and improve theoretical understanding of collaborative networks. This effort will make a significant impact on the engineering education research community by discovering how to develop a novel knowledge management system that can aid both researchers and faculty who wish to apply research results in the classroom. This could accelerate both the pace of engineering education research and also the rate at which research results are put into practice. Results of this work will benefit other emerging multidisciplinary areas in engineering and contribute to better preparation of engineers to fill engineering jobs.\r\n",
