 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nTEAM-Math (Transforming East Alabama Mathematics) represents a partnership among Auburn University, fourteen school districts in eastern Alabama (Alexander City, Auburn City, Barbara County, Bullock County, Chambers County, Elmore County, Lanett City, Lee County, Macon County, Opelika City, Phenix City, Russell County, Tallassee City, and Tallapoosa County), and the non-profit East Alabama Council of Teachers of Mathematics (EACTM). The partners are working together to develop and retain twenty-two Master Teaching Fellows who will be elementary mathematics specialists able to lead efforts to improve mathematics instruction in their schools and districts. The Fellows are participating in courses and professional development activities that are designed to meet the certification requirements for an elementary master teacher specialist. Not only are the Fellows learning about mathematics content and pedagogy, but they are also learning about teacher leadership and are applying their leadership skills to projects in their high needs school districts. The project is being rigorously assessed to determine the impact of the program on the Fellows' content knowledge, instructional practices, and attitudes about teaching and learning and ultimately the impact of the program on the attitudes and achievement of the students they teach.",
