 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Molly Swanson is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). Dr. Swanson will research the mysteries of dark energy and neutrino mass using the upcoming galaxy surveys of the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Differences in fundamental physics lead to changes in the large-scale clustering of matter, so one can use the universe as a particle physics laboratory by measuring this clustering with surveys cataloging large numbers of galaxies. However, galaxy formation physics also impacts the clustering, which leads to systematic uncertainties in measuring dark energy and neutrino properties. This project will develop a detailed understanding of these uncertainties and apply them to the upcoming generation of galaxy surveys. The methods used will be as follows: first, build theoretical models encoding galaxy formation physics and test them by comparing to current surveys and simulations. Next, use these models to compute the uncertainties expected from future galaxy surveys. Finally, develop analysis methods to apply to future survey data that will optimize the physics results. The primary objective is an analytical framework to account for galaxy formation physics when extracting information about dark energy and neutrinos from survey data.\r\n\r\nDr. Swanson will also develop and teach an enrichment course in cosmology for Boston area high-school students through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Educational Studies Program. She will collaborate with the CfA Science Education Department to develop and assess the curriculum for the course, which will focus on helping students break down commonly-held misconceptions about astonomy and cosmology using inquiry-based techniques, observational projects using the MicroObservatory online telescopes, and computer simulations and visualizations. Dr. Swanson will make the curriculum materials publicly available online as modules for physics and astronomy teachers at high schools and colleges worldwide and also as an interactive online course for anyone who is curious about the nature of our universe.",
