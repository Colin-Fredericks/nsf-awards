 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe ultimate objective of this project is to determine the acceleration mechanism responsible for strong increases of radiation belt electron fluxes during geomagnetic storms. The project will calculate Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) wave power from ground-based magnetometer and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radar data for specific time intervals during which relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt underwent significant flux enhancements and there was strong ULF wave power. This will allow for the test two theories of ULF radial diffusion, one that relies on field line resonance frequencies and another that does not.    \r\n\r\nThis is a 2-year postdoc-led project that will support the development of an independent research career for a young scientist at Virginia Tech. The understanding developed through this research will also benefit the National Space Weather program by improving our understanding of the near-Earth radiation environment during storms.",
