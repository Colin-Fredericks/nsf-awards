 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a novel technique for producing freestanding GaN wafers and substrates. High-quality freestanding GaN substrates are important for fabrication of high-performance light emitters, such as blue laser diodes, UV LEDs, and UV detectors that have many indispensable applications from data storage/data communication, to water/air purification, to detection/analysis of chemical and biological agents for homeland security applications. Despite the research efforts in the last decade, affordable freestanding GaN wafers and substrates of large diameters (2inches) have not been available commercially. This project will demonstrate a novel approach to growth of GaN thick films and fabrication of freestanding GaN wafers.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be commercially available freestanding GaN wafers and substrates of large diameters; at an affordable price, the commercialization potential will be great. This project will enable development and commercialization of high performance III-nitride-based light emitters and detectors.\r\n\r\n\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"",
