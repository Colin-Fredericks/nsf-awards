 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nPeter Rossky of the University of Texas, Austin, is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on quantum mechanical simulation of chemical dynamics in condensed phases. The research focuses on three project areas 1) the study of anionic water clusters, i.e. a water cluster with an extra electron; 2) the further development of an approximate method to include quantum effects in molecular dynamics simulations; 3) the study of the electronic and nuclear dynamics of conjugated organic polymers.\r\n\r\nThe techniques developed by the PI and his research group are enhancing the ability of molecular modeling to be used as a tool in critical areas such as advanced materials design, pharmeceutical discovery and nanoscale enginering. The study of anionic clusters promises to increase our understanding of important atmospheric processes, while the applications to organic polymers provides insights needed to develop new photovoltaic materials.",
