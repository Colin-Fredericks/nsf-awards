 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software Engineering (34)\r\n\r\nThis project supports running a one-day workshop for leading software engineering educators. This workshop, held at the 2009 ACM SIGCSE conference, brings together academicians interested in software engineering education (SEE) to share integration experiences, aid in solving integration issues, and provide direction on how to use SE2004 effectively. The participants in the workshop have been chosen for their interest in SEE as well as representing a wide variety of institutions across the country. The venue of the 2009 ACM SIGCSE conference was chosen due to the high potential that workshop participants will already be attending SIGCSE. The goal of the workshop is to build this new community of SE educators and carry it forward by supporting the continued sharing of SE2004 experiences.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of creating this SEE community rests on the promotion and application of SE2004 in practice. While the construction of SE2004 was performed by academicians who were most experienced in the area of SEE, few partial implementations actually exist. Both the IEEE-CS and the ACM have endorsed these curriculum recommendations and the existence of this community provides direction and support in attempts to follow them. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of forming such a community are self-evident in that all the institutions involved in this community learn from the experiences of others when integrating SE2004 topics/courses in their curriculum. Specifically, this community allows other institutions to benefit from successful integration as well as to avoid known mistakes. To this end, the community continues long after the workshop through web support for the purpose of disseminating institutions' individual experiences.",
