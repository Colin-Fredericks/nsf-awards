 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor Michael M. Haley and colleague Victoria J. DeRose from the University of Oregon Eugene will purchase a new console and cyber-enable an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer that will be able to collect data at field of 35 GHz (Q-band) as well as at 9 GHz (X-band). The upgraded spectrometer will be located in the shared instrument facility in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon, Eugene. The enhanced spectrometer will include a modern interface, Linux-based operating system, high-sensitivity X-band bridge and cavity, and a new Q-band cavity. Research will be impacted in the fields of nanoclusters and main group supramolecular chemistry as well as RNA structure and function not only at the University of Oregon but also at neighboring colleges through the establishment of web-based EPR training activities that will include an introduction to EPR spectroscopy and examples of different paramagnetic systems.\r\n\r\nAn EPR spectrometer yields information on the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes and identities of free radicals, short-lived species that are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, from chemistry to materials and biological chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
