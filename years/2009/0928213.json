 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT HRD 0928213\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University (NCA&T) is incorporating Superpave Technology into the undergraduate civil engineering curriculum. Currently, the Superpave Binder system has been adopted by all of the 52 State Highway Agencies including those of Alaska and Hawaii. Since 2001, the North Carolina Department of Transportation has required all asphalt mixes be designed using the Superpave method. However, due to a lack of equipment, NC A&T State University has been teaching an outdated method (Marshall Design) instead of the Superpave method.\r\n\r\nThis project is acquiring Superpave asphalt binder test equipment, including a Dynamic Shear Rheometer, a Bending Beam Rheometer and a Direct Tension Test Device. The addition of this equipment is improving the quality of undergraduate education, including development of learning skills through laboratory experience. The use of this instrumentation is enhancing students? understanding about Superpave technology and pavement design and increasing students? competitiveness to pursue graduate study in the field of transportation. \r\n\r\nThese improvements are supporting North Carolina A&T State University in its effort to meet the highest educational standards. The improved curriculum places students in a more competitive position for employment and careers in the field of transportation and allows NCA&T to produce knowledgeable and effective engineers for the local, state, and national job markets.\r\n",
