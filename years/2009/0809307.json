 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the unifying concepts of space (and astrophysical) plasma science is that of explosive energy conversions (EPCs).  This project is a systematic attempt to uncover a universal process underlying the occurrence of EPCs through a comparative study of its most well known examples: coronal mass ejections and magnetospheric substorms.  One potential candidate for such a universal process is the loss of equilibrium between repulsive and attractive forces operating on a magnetic bubble.  A tail-like configuration forms, creating a \"champagne-glass\" magnetic structure.  The investigation will use three different, global, MHD simulation models available at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) to simulate substorms and test whether the loss of equilibrium signature is present.  If the signature is present then the simulations will be used to determine how the evolution of the magnetosphere under suitable solar wind conditions leads to the emergence of the loss of equilibrium.  The use of three different and independent MHD codes will be used to test the robustness of the result.\r\n\r\nA second goal is coupled with the basic research effort.  The simulation results will be used to construct a comprehensive set of unit lessons in basic solar-terrestrial physics.  The lessons will be routinely updated through growth and user feedback and will be accessible interactively through the CCMC web site.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n This grant has supported research into universal processes in space physics and research into treating Earth\u00c6s magnetosphere as a system. \n\nSheaths as Universal Processes \n\nSheaths form around obstacles that the solar wind impacts - planets and coronal mass ejections (CME). We have shown by means of MHD simulations that for the same speed relative to the solar wind, CME-sheaths are thinner (relative to their characteristic dimension) compared to magnetosheaths, and more plow-like (i.e., the solar wind piles up in front instead of flowing around).  The differences result from CMEs expanding as they move, unlike planets.  The result is relevant to space weather forecasting.\n\nUniversal Processes behind CMEs and Substorms \n\nCMEs and substorms are similar in that both involve a sudden conversion of magnetic energy into the motion of plasma-filled magnetic containers.  The substorm community holds that the proximate cause of this motion is a sudden onset of rapid magnetic reconnection, which involves microscale processes.  The CME community identifies the proximate cause to be disequilibrium of an incipient CME, causing it to rise.  The rising CME leaves an electric current sheet in its wake that inevitably becomes thin enough for some microscale instability to trigger rapid reconnection.  In this scenario, once disequilibrium occurs, reconnection is guaranteed to follow, the specific micro-instability that turns on is unimportant since any such instability will do the job.  In both cases, once reconnection starts, the plasma rapidly accelerates, but in the substorm case the pre-reconnection evolution is not described a loss of equilibrium, whereas in the CME case it is, and reconnection follows. \n\nThe point of departure for our study is that the CME scenario has a better chance of being a universal process since it does not depend on triggering a microscale instability, the threshold for which would depend on particular plasma physical conditions, and so would be less likely to be universal.  Accordingly, we looked for a disequilibrium signature in the output of two global magnetospheric numerical simulations that produce substorm-like events.  Indeed we found a sequence of events resembling the CME scenario in that relatively rapid motion preceded reconnection.    \n\nMagnetosphere as a System - The Dungey-Axford Magnetosphere\n\nThis work follows on that the magnetosphere can be thought of as comprising two distinct magnetosphere types, Chapman-Ferraro (C-F) and Dungey-Axford (D-A), that normally operate at the same time.  This has complicated the analysis of magnetospheric structure and behavior interfering in attempts to fit observations made locally into a coherent picture of the global magnetosphere conceived of as a single thing that changes the relative sizes and strengths of its parts in response to changes in the solar wind instead of a picture of two different but co-extensive magnetospheres that change their relative degrees of dominance. \n\nThe C-F mode dominates over the D-A mode most of the time because of the statistical distributions of the values that characterize solar wind parameters at 1 AU. Because of this, the C-F magnetosphere has become the default picture in terms of which thinking about magnetospheric problems is framed.  Now global numerical simulations allow us to isolate the D-A magnetosphere and see it as a new, non-C-F kind of global magnetosphere with its own distinctive properties.  Our work on the D-A magnetosphere documented nine of these properties, too many to describe, but one that runs counter to expectations is that the direction of the force that the solar wind imparts to the geomagnetic dipole is toward the sun instead of away from the sun as is the C-F case.  This finding is grossly counter-intuitive (but well understood).\n\nMagnetosphere as a System - Two Modes of Magnetospheric Convection\n\nThe two modes refer to the global circulation of magnetic flux from the dayside of the magnetosphere t..."
