 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Miguel Garcia-Garibay at the University of California- Los Angeles, who will seek to gain a deeper understanding of chemical reactivity in crystalline solids by taking advantage of absolute kinetic measurements. At the same time, he proposes steps towards ambitious green chemistry synthetic applications involving challenging natural products of the pyrrolidinoindoline alkaloid family. In the second part of this proposal, studies aimed at a deeper understanding of a very exciting quantum chain decarbonylation reaction recently established with crystals of diphenylcyclopropenone are described. Professor Garcia-Garibay will investigate the scope of this reaction to include structures that unveil highly emissive, linearly conjugated chromophores. In the third part of this proposal, while studying the scope and steric limits of the reaction, enantioselective syntheses and classic resolution strategies to prepare optically pure compounds will be explored. \r\n\r\nDetailed understanding and prediction of chemical reactivity in the solid state will address many on-going problems, which includes the undesirable decomposition of pharmaceuticals, the degradation and aging of structural solids, and the fatigue of solid state devices. In addition to challenges arising from this work being at the frontiers of current reactivity theories, reactions in solids have attracted a great deal of interest during the last few years due to their potential in the development of Green Chemistry strategies to reduce the use of harmful solvents. The PI has been successful in attracting women and minority students to his research group by maintaining a highly supportive and creative environment that has fostered many careers in science education. The impact of this research extends beyond UCLA though collaborations with colleagues from neighboring institutions, including Mount St. Mary University (a women's college), Loyola Marymount University (an undergraduate institution), and Cal State Los Angeles (a comprehensive university with a MS program in Chemistry), all of which have a high enrollments of Hispanic and African American students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany complex molecules inspired from natural products are essential for the treatment of disease and for the preparation of valuable consumer products. However, complex chemical structures often pose a challenge to the environment because they are obtained in small amounts with undesired side products in processes that require multiple steps using toxic reagents followed by extensive purification.  Vast quantities of volatile organic solvents used in most unit operations are also toxic and difficult to contain.  To address this problem, solutions will come both from the selection of environmentally friendly synthetic processes and from the development of new chemical strategies.  This project has made substantial progress towards a new paradigm in green chemical synthesis that involves the development of chemical reaction in neat crystalline solids.   \n\nWe were able to make substantial contributions towards a better understanding of light-induced (photochemical) reactions in crystalline solids by making use of current chemical knowledge to select molecules that are known to react in solution or in the gas phase when exposed to UV light.  Using very small crystals suspended in water we solved some of most challenging aspects of doing reactions in the solid state, which are associated with the fact that light is trapped in very thin layers and is subject to complex optical effects, which make the quantitative analysis of absorbed and transmitted light difficult. \n\nWe have targeted the synthesis of compounds with adjacent stereogenic quaternary carbon centers as a green chemistry methodology that uses no volatile organic solvents, no toxic reagents, and using only light as a chemical activator.   While structures with adjacent stereogenic quaternary carbon centers are among the most difficult to obtain by conventional methods, they are easy to prepare using the chemistry developed in this project, which takes advantage of the stereospecific light-induced loss of CO from crystalline ketones.  We have shown that these reactions can be carried out in relatively large scales.\n\nWe have also documented that range of structures that are amenable to react in the solid state and we have documented the mechanisms of those reactions at the atomic and molecular level, including the use of electron paramagnetic resonance to analyze the radicals that form when bonds are broken in the solid state.  Measuring the fate of energy absorbed by molecules in crystals has always been very challenging.   However, we have shown that the kinetics of excited states can be determined using common methods when crystals are prepared as nanocrystalline suspension.   One particularly promising discovery is based on a relatively rare chemical process, known as a \"quantum chain\", where a single light particle can cause multiple chemical reactions.   Using rigorous kinetics measurements and ultrafast lasers we were able to get a very deep insight into these unusual but promising reactions.   \n\nStudents and post-docs participating in this project became experts in organic synthesis, organic photochemistry, transient spectroscopy, single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction measurements and interpretation, solid state NMR, thermal analysis, and computational methods.  Our research team has been very diverse in a supportive environment that fosters intellectual development and creativity.  Educating seven graduate students, four undergraduates and five postdoctoral fellows who participated in various aspects of the projects sponsored by this grant, and who contributed with outreach activities with local community colleges and nearby undergraduate institutions, is another very significant outcome.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miguel A Garcia-Garibay"
