Research shows that a majority of students from minority groups underrepresented in science and engineering who enroll in college are under-prepared for success in mathematics and science. The need to enroll in remedial courses serves as a strong deterrent to the selection of mathematics or a science discipline as an undergraduate major. Minority-serving Institutions (MSIs) play a significant role in both addressing this under-preparedness as well as in the production of mathematics and science teacher education graduates who enter the teaching workforce. These teachers play a major role in determining the quality of instruction in predominantly minority school systems.\n\n \n\nA significant component of the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-69), the NSF Math and Science Partnership (MSP) Program is a major research and development effort that supports innovative partnerships to improve K-12 student achievement in mathematics and science. MSP projects are expected to raise the achievement levels of all students and significantly reduce achievement gaps in the mathematics and science performance of diverse student populations. With NSF support, QEM conducted MSP information and proposal development workshops for institutional teams of MSIs with accredited teacher education programs and their K-12 partners interested in submitting MSP proposals to NSF. Under the current project, QEM conducted three annual MSP workshops. \n\n \n\nQualifications of the Organization\n\nUnder the leadership of President Shirley McBay, the QEM Network was established in 1990 as a non-profit organization in Washington, DC, dedicated to improving education for minorities throughout the nation. QEM works with minority and non-minority individuals, organizations, and institutions to help coordinate and energize efforts to improve the education of minorities, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).

Enhancing these skills is important for the scholarly productivity of STEM faculty as well as K-12 teachers and administrators. \n\n \n\nAt the conclusion of each of the workshops, participants were asked to complete a Workshop Evaluation Questionnaire to rate the usefulness of the sessions and whether the workshop met their expectations. Consistently, participants completing the Evaluation Questionnaires rated the Workshops overall as excellent or very good; and reported that the workshop met t..."
