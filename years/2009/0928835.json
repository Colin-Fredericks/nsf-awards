 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel concept for the mitigation of blast and impact effects on people and structures with new materials that modify the transmission of stress waves in a controlled or tailored manner is proposed. The concept is to develop new materials by strategically reinforcing cellular solids (e.g., foams) at the micro-scale level by the controlled deposition of nanometer-thick coatings. Homogeneous and particulate-reinforced nano-layers will be deposited by the layer-by-layer assembly method to develop complex multiscale multilayer hybrid reinforcements with molecular-level control of its composition and microstructure. Material and structural component testing will be done to evaluate nano-scale morphology and mechanical properties under pseudo-static and high-rate loads. Multiscale computational models will be developed to study stress waves propagation through complex materials and to serve as design tools.\r\n\r\nThe research will lead to breakthrough knowledge for designing blast/impact absorbing materials in which their deformation and failure is tailored to guide the propagation of stress waves and thus control and optimize energy dissipation. It will also provide new insight to the problem of three-dimensional stress-wave propagation in complex materials. The concept has the potential of revolutionizing the design of automobiles, aircraft, body armor and protective devices for civil infrastructure. Two graduate students will be trained towards a Ph.D. degree under the multidisciplinary basis of the research. The project will be integrated with a new Residential Experience Program for undergraduate engineering students at MSU by developing a Theme Community in ?materials and security.? Summer research opportunities will be offered to traditionally under-represented undergraduate students.\r\n",
