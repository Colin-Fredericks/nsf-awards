 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focusing on manipulating ultracold Rydberg atoms in spatially localized ensembles. The unique properties of such atoms make it possible for a blockade mechanism to extend over the entire sample, allowing for interesting quantum effects to be observed. The approach to this problem allows high quality quantum manipulations while accounting for key issues that arise from the complexity of the atoms. In particular, care is taken to make samples of appropriate geometry with sufficiently large Rydberg-Rydberg interactions to allow the blockade mechanism to work. To this end, resonant microwave fields induce oscillating dipole moments in the atoms. The blockades are identified by looking at the quantum statistics of phase-matched four-wave mixing light generated under blockade conditions. In a second experiment, the dephasing of collective Rabi flopping is studied in the regime of weak to poor blockade. It is predicted that dephasing will be prominent under conditions of poor blockade, but will disappear at strong blockade levels.\r\n\r\nThis project is committed to significant undergraduate involvement and has a history of its undergraduate students continuing on to graduate school in AMO physics. The PI has integrated concepts from the research project into undergraduate courses from which he recruits undergraduate researchers. The training of graduate students is a particularly important broader outcome of this project.",
