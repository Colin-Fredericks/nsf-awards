 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms that live in sulfide-rich environments harbor symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria that, in the presence of oxygen, oxidize sulfide and fix carbon dioxide.  The biological molecule responsible for delivering hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and oxygen to these bacteria is the heme protein hemoglobin (Hb). Hb protects these organisms from H2S toxicity and helps maintain their symbiotic relationship with the endosymbiont species.  Hemoglobins from these invertebrate organisms show variability in the distal chemical structure and stereochemistry.  While cytoplasmic hemoglobins bind and transport their respective ligands via the heme active site, extracellular hemoglobins deliver H2S and O2 simultaneously, delivering H2S using sulfhydryl or organometallic Zn clusters outside the heme chromophore.  It is hypothesized that a single amino acid (glutamine or histidine at position E7) is responsible for the difference in H2S toxicity and heme reactivity. The results of this project would provide a deeper understanding of the unique routes for hydrogen sulfide transport and the decreased hydrogen sulfide toxicity in particular organisms. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS \r\nThis interdisciplinary research project will be used as teaching tool to mentor graduate and undergraduate students, as well as to increase their knowledge and communication skills through scientific presentations to pre-college students and teachers via visits to local schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA diverse variability of hemoglobins are present in the invertebrate organisms living in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, deep-sea cold seeps, inter- and sub tidal muds, and sea grass beds.  These unique biological communities are exposed to high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and they harbor symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria which, in the presence of oxygen (O2), oxidize sulfide and fix CO2.  Thus, the functions of these hemoglobins (Hb\u00c6s) have been related to the binding and transportation of H2S and O2 to the endosymbiont species. For example, the mollusk Lucina pectinata has three highly concentrated cytoplasmic hemoglobins: the sulfide-reactive (HbI) and two oxygen carrier (HbII and HbIII) hemoglobin.\n\nHowever, several vertebrate and invertebrate five coordinated hemeproteins, with distal histidine like myoglobin and hemoglobin, in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, produce a modification the heme pyrrole B upon sulfur insertion, existing as heme thiochlorin type structure, originating the sulfhemeproteins species (Figure 1).  This sulfheme modification has the direct effect of decrease myoglobin and hemoglobin functionality.  Remarkably, human catalases and peroxidases also have His at their active site and they generate these sulfheme derivatives.  Site directed mutagenesis of the hemoglobin I from Lucina pectinata shows that: (i) non-polar aliphatic groups like glycine, alanine, valine and isoleucine, (ii) polar uncharged groups like glutamine and asparagine, (iii) aromatic group like phenylalanine and tyrosine, and (iv) positively charged groups like lysine and arginine, are not involved in the synthesis of the sulfheme species.\n\nTherefore the first outcome of the projects has been the discovery of the unique role and requirement that only Histidine in the distal position is capable, in the presence of oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, of generating sulfheme proteins.  This is a clear and robust example of how a single amino acid, like distal histidine, with the proper orientation, can influence and modify the chemistry and functionality of the hemeproteins.\n\nThe second outcome of the project indicates the H2S activation by heme superoxide and heme compound 0 derivatives. The formation of the sulfheme derivative requires the presence of a: (a) proton donor from the HSR species; (b) HisE7 residue in the heme distal site with an adequate orientation form an active ternary complex; and (c) the intermediate involving the HisE7, the hydro peroxo {HemeFe(III)-OOH}, and H2S species. Homolysis of the moiety generates oxoheme ferryl compound II and HS&bull; radical. The HS&bull; attacks the ferryl compound II, producing the final sulfheme derivative.\n\nSince the heme-superoxide complex and heme compound 0 derivatives activates H2S to generate the consequent HS radical specie and hemeferryl compound II derivatives, hydrogen sulfide avoids the formation of oxoferryl heme species compound I and limits the further generation protein radicals and ROS species.  This finding opens a window to further explore H2S as an antioxidant agent and unravels the arena for H2S activation by other proteins as well as the chemistry and biology of peroxidases and catalases in the presence H2S and H2O2.\n\nConsequently, the broader impacts to society are inherent to: (1) learn, that a single amino acid substitution i.e. GlnE7 by HisE7, in the hemoglobins from invertebrate or vertebrate organisms expose to hydrogen sulfide rich environments, in the presence of O2 or H2O2 lead to unique transformative changes associated to the hemeprotein that indeed modifies H2S transport, toxicity and survival of the species.
