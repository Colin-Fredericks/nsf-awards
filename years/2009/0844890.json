 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to develop theoretical foundations for robustly-stable and high-fidelity shared haptic collaboration among geographically-distributed multiple users over the Internet.  For this, the project utilizes: 1) distributed architecture for real-time responsiveness of each user?s haptic feedback regardless of Internet?s latency; and 2) passivity (of total distributed architecture) as a means for robust-stability of haptic interaction with a wide-range of heterogeneous human users.   More specifically, the project focuses and investigates the following three key research tasks: 1) discrete-time passive haptic simulation algorithms for consistent/scalable deployment of the shared virtual environment, particularly among (computationally) heterogeneous users; 2) haptically-convincing physics-based passive hierarchical model reduction frameworks to mitigate communication/computing burdens, particularly when the shared virtual environment is of large-scale; and 3) high-performance passive local replica synchronization frameworks over the Internet for crisp/stable shared haptic experience, and fundamental performance limitation given communication imperfectness.\r\n\r\nBy providing systematic and theoretical frameworks, this project will significantly advance the current state of the art, which is largely heuristic, ad-hoc and qualitative.  This project is also expected to produce new results/perspectives/frameworks for general haptics/telerobotics as well as for adjacent research fields.  \r\n\r\nThe theoretical foundations laid by this project will make many powerful applications closer to reality (e.g. virtual collaborative surgical training, pre-manufacturing product evaluation, virtual collaborative sculpting, haptically-enabled networked games, etc).  Perhaps more importantly, this project may fundamentally change how we interact with each other in the cyberspace.  \r\n\r\nEducation/dissemination activities of this project will include: development of new hands-on and research-level robotics courses; student advising/mentoring, particularly for minority students; haptics summer camp for K-12, particularly for female students; seminars in local high schools and public demonstrations; project web site, international collaboration, and book writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Internet continues to expand into our lives everyday, from incredible fact finding tools to social communications with other people all over the world.  Now the Internet of Things is becoming a new reality where human Internet interactions may involve more than just information exchange.  This research is about the ingredients that would go into a new form of Internet interaction where multiple users could experience and share haptic (touch/feel) interactions with a common object of interest.  Such interaction fundamentally requires dynamic and bilateral data exchange between all of the participants that is physically consistent with the haptic response properties (shape, surface texture, softness, etc.) of the common object &ndash; what any one person \"feels\" is dependent on the physcial interactions provided by the other persons.  It is envisioned that this type of Internet-based haptics collaboration would open new opportunites for international and national collaboration in medicine, science, and engineering in research, development, and training.\n\nIn addition to the complexities of dynamic force interaction, operation over the Internet introduces other challenges resulting from the time delays associated with sending signals from one physical location to another through the myriad of cables and transmitters around the world.  These delays can be on the order of seconds.  The communications networks that form the Internet occaisionally are not able to transmit data due to information traffic flow log jams and hardware faults, resulting in random information exchange dropout periods.  A major focus of this research has been the development of signal processing and control schemes that can allow the proposed haptic collaboration in the face of these Internet complexities with acceptable levels of performance, stability and reliability.\n\nThere are two theoretical aspects of this research that have resulted in fundamentally new ideas, the \"passive set position modulation (PSPM) framework\" and the a \"consensus based peer-to-peer control architecture.\"  The passive set position modulation framework add to the tools necessary to achieve stable operations and was tested and verified in a simplified experiment.  The peer-to-peer architechture provides one approach to acheiving a multi-user haptic collaboration.  Experiments with the peer-to-peer control architecture verified the general feasibility of the approach.  These contributions are important steps toward multi-user haptic collaboration over the Internet, but many challenges remain for future work to address.  \n\nA novel passivity controller based on PSPM,  was implemented on a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) whole arm manipulator (WAM) based master/slave system to study how well this particular passivity approach would work with an actual mulit-degree of freedom teleoperator.
