 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThis three year REU site program at Drexel University will focus on research and education in five overlapping areas of ongoing study: 1) Analysis and Mitigation of Natural and Anthropogenic Hazards; 2) Environmental Quality and Sustainability; 3) Urban Infrastructure Management; 4) Disaster and Emergency Preparedness; and 5) Application of Sustainable Technologies for Urban Engineering.  The majority of the students will participate in a 10-week intensive research experience; however, one co-op student per year will continue his/her research experience on a full time basis for an additional 16 weeks. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the program is to improve students' research and creative abilities, thus this REU experience will encourage development of key skills that will serve the participants throughout their careers.  Such key skills include the following: 1) identifying a research problem and performing a critical review of literature; 2) designing and implementing a research plan and timeline; 3) conducting research, including learning new methods, analysis procedures and/or skills; and 4) disseminating research results in both written and oral forms. The development of these skills will increase student confidence, improve critical thinking and problem solving abilities, and enhance both verbal and communication skills.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the research experience, students will be engaged in a series of enrichment activities that will enable them to better understand their topical work in its broader societal, ethical, and political context and provide them with a rich urban experience.  These enrichment activities include an ethics component, a seminar series on Urban Engineering, meetings and field trips, Philadelphia walking tours and book discussions, and group interactions and networking.  Social activities will be an integral part of the students' experience with the goal of building friendships and collegiality between the students and faculty mentors.\r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will be targeted to participants from underrepresented groups, as well as individuals who do not have access to advanced research facilities at their home institutions.  The REU program aims to increase the participation of women and minorities in engineering, to raise the awareness of the complex challenges associated with engineering and managing the urban environment, and to encourage students to pursue careers serving the urban community after completion of their studies.\r\n\r\nThe results of the research and education activities from the REU site will be disseminated as follows: 1) on the Engineering Cities website (http://www.drexel.edu/coe/cae/REU/index.htm); 2) presented in relevant conference sessions and educationally oriented publications (e.g., Journal of Engineering Education, Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice); and 3) through presentations by REU participants at their home institutions in a class or seminar forum.",
