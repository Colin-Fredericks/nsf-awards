 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, interactions between ultracold Rydberg atoms will be explored. Ultracold rubidium atoms, at temperatures less than one thousandth of a degree above absolute zero, will be prepared using laser cooling techniques. These atoms will then be transferred to highly-excited Rydberg states with lasers. Such states are unusual in that the electron lives very far from the nucleus, making them very fragile and easily perturbed by other atoms, even when the atoms are far apart. Various manifestations of these strong interactions between Rydberg atoms will be investigated. Specifically, the formation of very large molecules comprised of Rydberg atoms will be explored. Also, novel ion-pair states, where one atom steals the electron from its partner, will be probed. Finally, various exchange processes, where the interacting atoms trade their states of excitation, will be studied.\r\n\r\nIn performing this research, students and postdocs will receive valuable professional training in laser-based atomic and molecular physics, ultimately enhancing the high-tech workforce. Results of the research will be disseminated through journal publications and conference presentations, thereby informing the scientific community of our findings. Regarding scientific impact, very large Rydberg molecules are an exotic form of matter, exhibiting novel types of binding. Also, interactions between Rydberg atoms are the key mechanism in a number of possible schemes for quantum information processing. Finally, ultracold Rydberg atoms are closely related to cold plasmas, which have been used to form cold antihydrogen atoms in Rydberg states.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
