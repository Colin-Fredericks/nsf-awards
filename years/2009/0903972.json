 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies new forms of imaging by exploiting the quantum entanglement of light. This is done by producing new spatial modes of light that are common to two beams of light but not to any one individually. Since spatial modes are the building blocks of images this research promises the development of new types of images that are common to light photons traveling in different directions. These images may be of higher resolution than the ones carried by the individual photons.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is that it advances our understanding of quantum information and imaging by involving only undergraduate researchers working with a faculty mentor. The students will be exposed to a vanguard technology early on in their studies at the same time that this technology is being developed. This program has been very successful in involving women and ethnic minorities. Other impacts include the development of new materials and laboratories for a modern way to teach quantum mechanics, which prepares students to the rising field of quantum information.",
