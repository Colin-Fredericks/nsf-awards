 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number:    \t\tECCS-0844274\r\nProposal Title: \tSGER: Reactive Solar Concentrators\r\nPI Name:\t\t\tFord, Joseph E.\t\t \r\nPI Institution:\t\tUniversity of California-San Diego\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nObjective: The PI has developed a new approach to concentrating solar light, by using fixed sheets of material which could be put up on a rooftop, and which send light to the edges of the material, where high efficiency solar cells can be used to convert the light to electricity.  The \"material\" is really a solid state structure made up of microlenses which can track the angle of the sun by use of optical effects instead of the more cumbersome physical tracking systems used today in conventional concentrating solar power. Preliminary calculations look favorable. The task now is to begin validating the concept, by evaluating and implementing alternative ways of realizing it.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: From an engineering viewpoint, developing a new family of technology is a fundamental achievement of great merit. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The primary benefit of this project, if successful, would be to rooftop solar power. Studies of rooftop solar power claim that the roofs in the US could supply about 60% of peak electricity demand, and about 25% of total 24-hour demand, assuming today?s 10-15% efficient solar cells. Multilayer or \"tandem\" solar cells have gotten to efficiencies in the 35-50% range, but are expensive to make and to install over large areas. Flexible thin film solar cells are much more affordable a key factor driving their deployment in the market but are struggling to get to 10% in the future. If this new type of technology leads to flexible, affordable easily-deployed sheets which double the electricity one can get from rooftops, the benefits could be enormous. At best, it could let us meet half the nation?s needs in a carbon-free manner, at a price that would support its actual deployment. Considerable R&D will be needed to evaluate this important but risky hope.",
