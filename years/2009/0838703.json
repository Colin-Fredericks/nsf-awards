Kirby, Peter Teichner\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment\r\nAct of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe principal investigators (Robion Kirby and Peter Teichner),\r\nwith the cooperation of the other senior personnel (Professors\r\nIan Agol, Robert Bryant, Michael Hutchings, Vaughan Jones, John\r\nLott, Constantin Teleman, and Alan Weinstein), propose to\r\nestablish a research training group of undergraduates, graduate\r\nstudents, postdoctoral fellows, and senior faculty at the UC\r\nBerkeley mathematics department in the areas of geometry,\r\ntopology and operator algebras.  The objectives are to improve\r\nthe recruitment of undergraduates into graduate studies in\r\nmathematics, and the training of graduate students and\r\npostdoctoral fellows, by establishing a strong, coherent\r\ninterdisciplinary group in the above areas.  These areas are\r\ncoherent in that they have at their center problems and methods\r\nfrom mathematical physics, such as the count of pseudoholomorphic\r\ncurves to calculate Seiberg-Witten and Heegaard-Floer invariants\r\nof 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, or the use of Ricci flow for\r\nunderstanding smooth manifolds, or the use of mathematical\r\nnotions of quantum field theories to describe interesting\r\nalgebraic topology, like elliptic cohomology.\r\n\r\nA major difficulty for young people entering research in\r\nmathematics today is the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of\r\nthe subject and the range of technical tools required.\r\nTraditional seminar formats are becoming less effective at\r\ntraining.  We will work with the existing strong programs of the\r\nmathematics department to create a series of new and restructured\r\nactivities, ranging from the undergraduate level to advanced\r\nresearch.  These will include undergraduate research seminars\r\nduring the school year led by graduate students under the\r\nsupervision of senior faculty, undergraduate and graduate summer\r\nworkshops, elementary level graduate student seminars, a hot\r\ntopic seminar, and a weekly joint research seminar in which\r\neach research talk is preceded by a background lecture.\r\n\r\nThe areas of geometry, topology and operator algebras covered in\r\nthis proposal are central to mathematics and mathematical\r\nphysics.  UC Berkeley has an exceptional group of faculty in this\r\narea, and a long history of successfully training graduate and\r\nundergraduate students.  However, these subjects have grown more\r\nand more interdisciplinary requiring graduate students to know\r\nmuch more than in the past, and more guidance is required of\r\nsenior mathematicians.  To improve the training of graduate\r\nstudents and postdocs, they should also improve the quality of\r\nresearch that they produce.  The cross-group interaction will\r\nfacilitate a number of interdisciplinary research projects that\r\nwe intend to pursue, including: Elliptic cohomology and quantum\r\nfield theory, K-theory and topological field theories,\r\nSemi-infinite aspect of elliptic cohomology, and Four-dimensional\r\nfield theories.\r\n",
