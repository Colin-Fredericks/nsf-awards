However, there is as yet no self-consistent black hole model that adequately explains the energy source.  This project will use the physics of general relativistic super-massive Kerr black holes in Monte Carlo computer simulations of Penrose processes to extract energy and momentum from the ergosphere of the rotating black hole.  The energies extracted are in fact comparable to the observed X-rays and gamma-rays, and the inferred electron-positron pairs, in the spectra of quasars and other AGNs.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the project will investigate in detail (1) the large vortical geodesic orbits of escaping elementary particles in the form of polar jets, due to intrinsic collimation by a rotating black hole; and (2) the expected self-induced magnetic field associated with the jets of escaping particle plasma.  The objective is to show that super-massive Kerr black holes can indeed explain the energy source of AGNs.  Then, scaled-down black holes will be used to model galactic microquasars.  Next, similar scaled-down black holes going through periods of being active and then inactive, will be used to model gamma-ray bursters.  The overall objective is to devise a unified model showing AGNs, microquasars, and gamma-ray bursters powered by black holes of different masses and/or accretion disk properties.  This will have an impact across extragalactic astronomy, high energy and relativistic astrophysics, and the study of stellar evolution.\r\n",
