Applications of particle bombardment include surface cleaning, surface smoothing, implantation of dopants in semiconductors, focused ion beam milling for integrated circuit repair and TEM sample preparation, reactive ion etching, erosion of the moons of Saturn, and the analytical technique of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The intriguing recent advance in the SIMS arena is the use of cluster beams that have expanded the applications to molecular depth profiling and 3D-imaging.  The initial results show that 3D-images with hundreds of nm lateral by 10 nm depth resolution can be obtained, a level of resolution with molecular specificity unobtainable in other techniques.  Tremendous efforts have been expended developing the methodology and calibrating the ability to model energetic particle bombardment of solids.  The computer simulations clearly show that the types of motions associated with energetic particle bombardment vary from a collision cascade or sophisticated game of billiards when an atomic projectile strikes the surface to a concerted motion, like a single bead experiencing frictional forces, when a buckyball impacts the surface.  Complementary with the goal of providing qualitative understanding of the dynamics with the computer simulations, models and concepts were developed that help the SIMS community understand the basic physics and interpret data from a variety of experiments.\n\n \n\nA strength of the program is the broad-based collaboration with scientists around the world.  Long standing computational collaborators include faculty members and groups from Jagiellonian University, Poland; Catholique University, Belgium; College of Charleston, SC; Kyoto University, Japan; and University of Surrey, UK and experimental collaborators from Penn State; University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany; and University of Manchester, UK.  As part of the collaborations, several of the research groups (Poland, Belgium, College of Charleston, Surrey and Duisburg-Essen) use the simulation code developed over the years with NSF funding.  All of these scientists have visited Penn State for extended periods during the past two years, and some have brought their students with them.  This rich cultural exchange is extremely beneficial for everyone involved, especially the students, who get different perspectives of science and life from the collaborators.  Students supported on the project presented their results at international conferences.  Two undergraduate students from College of Charleston visited Penn State as part of the collaboration.  For three summers, a high school student worked in the group.  His work resulted in a publication in a physical chemistry journal and formed the basis for his applications to the Siemens Competition and Intel Science Talent Search.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/09/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara J Garrison"
