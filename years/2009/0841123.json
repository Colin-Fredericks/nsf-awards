 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dormancy plays an important role in regulating developmental processes in plant buds and seeds and has evolved as a mechanism for survival during harsh environmental conditions. For example, economically important perennials of the agricultural, horticultural, and forestry sector, as well as troublesome perennial weeds, establish new shoot growth from over-wintering, dormant buds each new growing season. Whereas annual weeds tend to persist in agricultural systems because seed dormancy scatters germination over time making control by conventional methods difficult; lack of seed dormancy occasionally causes pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) problems in crop production. When plant buds and seeds fail to maintain proper control of dormancy, frost damage, poor weed control, low germination rates, PHS, and ultimately, low crop yields are often the result. This has been estimated to economically impact to US agriculture conservatively at more than 500 million dollars. However, recent discoveries related to plant dormancy processes, many of which have not yet been published, provide new opportunities to foster collaborations between scientists in academia and industry, and agricultural practitioners working on related problems. The 4th International Plant dormancy Symposium provides a venue to bring together world renowned academic, industrial, and agricultural experts in the field of plant dormancy to present their most recent findings. The outcome of this symposium is expected to inspire new approaches to control plant dormancy, foster collaborations, and reduce redundancy of research efforts. Additionally, special incentives to encourage young scientists and scientists from under-represented groups will bring new thoughts and ideas into the field of plant dormancy research and enhance future efforts through mentorship and collaboration. Finally, participation of industry and agricultural stakeholders should assist in developing new ideas into products for American agriculture, and help better direct academic research.",
