 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDatabases are typically used as a subsystem in a larger system that\r\ncontains Web servers, application servers, and network-attached\r\nstorage servers. Such complex systems experience some form of change\r\nall the time, e.g., an update to a Java module in the application\r\nserver, a statistics update in the database, or a RAID rebuild in a\r\nstorage volume. Such changes in different subsystems can cause an\r\noverall performance degradation whose cause is hard to diagnose. The\r\ndiagnosis task is all the more daunting because enterprise\r\nenvironments have isolated administration teams and tools for each\r\nsubsystem.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing an integrated tool called DIADS that\r\nautomates complex administrative tasks like problem diagnosis, what-if\r\nanalysis, orchestrating disaster recovery, and online tuning when a\r\ndatabase is used as a subsystem in a larger system. DIADS contains two\r\ntechnical innovations. Problem diagnosis involves reconstructing\r\nsystem behavior at various points of time using historic and current\r\nmonitoring data collected from the system. However, the amount and\r\nquality of monitoring data available from production systems is\r\nconstrained by the need to keep monitoring overhead low. DIADS uses an\r\nabstraction called Annotated Plan Graph to represent and reason about\r\ndatabase behavior in the context of a larger system. Annotated Plan\r\nGraphs are generated from light-weight monitoring data.\r\n\r\nThe other innovation in DIADS is a suite of workflows for\r\nadministrative tasks that combine machine-learning techniques with\r\ndomain knowledge from system experts. For example, for problem\r\ndiagnosis, the machine-learning part of the workflow provides core\r\ntechniques to handle large and noisy streams of monitoring data, while\r\nthe domain-knowledge part acts as checks-and-balances to guide the\r\ndiagnosis in the right direction. This unique design enables DIADS to\r\nfunction effectively even in the presence of multiple concurrent\r\nproblems as well as noisy monitoring data prevalent in production\r\nenvironments. DIADS is being prototyped for research and educational\r\npurposes in a datacenter setting with PostgreSQL databases and an\r\nenterprise-level storage area network. \r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page at \r\nhttp://www.cs.duke.edu/~shivnath/diads.html\r\n",
