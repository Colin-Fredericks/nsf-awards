Research in GSP\r\ntypically involve the discovery of reliable molecular markers for\r\ndisease diagnosis and prognosis, using pattern recognition or machine\r\nlearning approaches. Such approaches rely on the accuracy of error\r\nestimation for classification and prediction. This is particularly\r\ncritical due to the small sample sizes that are common in GSP\r\napplications. Novel robust small-sample error estimation methodologies\r\nin GSP are needed in order to enable reproducible scientific discovery\r\nthat leads to genuine medical advancement.\r\n\r\nThis research has as its goal solving significant computational and\r\nstatistical problems that exist in small-sample error estimation.\r\nAmong the open problems that will be addressed are (1) to obtain exact\r\nand approximate representations of the joint sampling distribution of\r\nthe estimated and true errors for linear continuous classifiers, which\r\nwill lead to better-performing error estimators and practical tools to\r\nassess significance of results; (2) to study error estimation for\r\ndiscrete classifiers, including the binary coefficient of\r\ndetermination (CoD), using both analytical and complete enumeration\r\napproaches; (3) to develop the methodology of bolstered error\r\nestimation, addressing the application in high-dimensional spaces and\r\nwith adaptive kernels, with an emphasis on feature selection; (4) to\r\napply these error estimation techniques to the problem of biomarker\r\ndiscovery for diagnosis and prognosis in cancer and infectious\r\ndiseases, in partnership with medical collaborators at Translational\r\nGenomics (TGen), the Johns Hopkins Medical School, and the Oswaldo\r\nCruz Foundation, Brazil (FIOCRUZ).\r\n",
