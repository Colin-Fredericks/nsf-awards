 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to conduct experimental and analytical studies to develop test data, validated numerical model, performance-based design guidelines, and practical solutions for fire-safe design of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)-strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams. The proposed numerical model will be able to account for nonlinear material characteristics at high temperature, different fire scenarios, different FRP and insulation characteristics, system-level structural behavior and different failure limit states. The model will be validated using the test data obtained through a set of fire resistant experiments on FRP-strengthened RC beams. The proposed model will improve fundamental understanding of the FRP-strengthened RC beams under fire and external loading. The verified numerical model will be utilized in a series of parametric studies to formulate rational and cost-effective guidelines and practical solutions for fire design of FRP-strengthened RC beams.  Deliverables include database of fire resistance experiments, calibrated analytical tools and approaches, practical solutions for enhancing fire performance of FRP-strengthened RC beams, and documentation and dissemination of research results. \r\n\r\nThis research will provide designers with fire safety guidelines and solutions for their use in the new designs as well as in repair and strengthening of deteriorating infrastructure using high performance FRP materials. The developed tools and solutions will enable engineers to demonstrate robust design of structures for fire, which is now high on the agenda of building owners, occupiers, developers, and society-at-large. The wide dissemination of the research results and data to researchers, practitioners and students is planned for quick implementation of the design guidelines in practice. The project will also train graduate students as the future generation of engineers for economic design of buildings and civil infrastructure systems to enhance their fire safety.\r\n\r\n",
