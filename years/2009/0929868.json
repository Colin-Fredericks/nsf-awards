 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-day workshop in Washington, DC in Spring, 2009, to discuss ideas for supporting research networks of mathematical scientists. The mathematical sciences are becoming increasingly collaborative, interdisciplinary, and interactive. A program of research networks could provide a novel and effective way to supplement to current funding strategies of individual investigator awards and large institutes. \r\n\r\nA broadly representative group of about 35 participants will consider the benefits and potential pitfalls, and provide DMS with an report of its deliberations. A program of research networks would create new ways for mathematical scientists across a broad spectrum of organizations to interact, make possible collaborations that current programs cannot support, and provide researchers who merit support (but who, through lack of NSF funds, have not received an individual investigator award) with significant resources. Research Networks would form a very cost-effective way for the DMS to further the broad goals of the NSF.",
