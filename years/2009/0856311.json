The need for safety, security, and rescue technologies has accelerated in the aftermath of 9/11 and a new research community is forming, as witnessed by the first IEEE Workshop on Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics in February 2003.  \r\n\r\nThe Center will be built upon the knowledge and expertise of multi-disciplinary researchers in computer science, engineering, industrial organization, psychology, public health, and marine sciences at the University of South Florida (the lead institution) and the University of Minnesota.\r\n",
