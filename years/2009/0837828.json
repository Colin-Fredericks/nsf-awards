 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Chemical (54)\r\nOne of the fundamental courses in chemical engineering programs across the nation focuses on understanding material and energy balances. In this course, students typically struggle to make the transition between written materials, process flow diagrams, and finally mathematical formulations. Through this project, a software tool is being developed that scaffolds the translation of written energy balance problems to visual form and the subsequent translation of visual chemical process diagrams to sets of written equations to be solved. While several tools for solving energy balance problems exist, these are primarily aimed at a professional audience and are not always suitable for inclusion in an introductory undergraduate course. Commercial tools typically have a steep learning curve and are not appropriate for enhancing student learning and understanding. The software is being rigorously evaluated in terms of improved student learning as well as usability factors.\r\n",
