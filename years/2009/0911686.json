 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nIn this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Kenneth Janda and Dr. Wytze Van der Veer of the University of California at Irvine will employ fluorescence pump-probe and multi-photon ionization mass spectrometry (MPI-TOF) to measure the electronic and vibrational spectra of clusters containing water and bromine. Analysis of the data will yield bond energies and more subtle properties of the interaction between water and bromine. X-ray diffraction and Raman measurements on solid phase (or solid solution) clathrate hydrate crystals will also be performed. Computational methods will be employed to test whether the model interaction potentials determined from the cluster studies are sufficient to understand the condensed phase hydrate systems. Theoretical work will be done in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh, and the State University of Morelos, Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhile the proposed research focuses on water-bromine systems, the findings will advance our understanding of clathrate-hydrate systems in general, including CO2 and methane hydrates which are directly relevant to energy and climate change issues. In addition to research activities, Professor Janda and his team will create materials to introduce gas hydrates into the K-12 and Liberal Arts curriculum by developing an inexpensive apparatus for the preparation of propane hydrate. This will allow instructors in high schools and small colleges to promote the understanding of clathrate hydrates, which will enable students to understand their role in the nation's energy supply and their effect on climate change.\r\n",
