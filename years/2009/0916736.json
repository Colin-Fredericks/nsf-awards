 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing numbers of real-world application domains are generating data that is\r\ninherently noisy, incomplete, and probabilistic in nature.  Examples of such\r\ndata include measurement data collected by sensor networks, observation data in\r\nthe context of social networks, scientific and biomedical data, and data\r\ncollected by various online cyber-sources. The data uncertainties may be a\r\nresult of the fundamental limitations of the underlying measurement\r\ninfrastructures, the inherent ambiguity in the domain, or they may be a\r\nside-effect of the rich probabilistic modeling typically performed to extract\r\nhigh-level events from sensor and cyber data.  Similarly, when attempting to\r\nintegrate heterogeneous data sources (\"data integration\") or extracting\r\nstructured information from text (\"information extraction\"), the results are\r\napproximate and uncertain at best.  However, there is currently a lack of data\r\nmanagement tools that can reason about large volumes of uncertain data, and\r\nhence the information about the uncertainty is often either discarded or\r\nreasoned about only superficially.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we are building a complete probabilistic data management\r\nsystem, called PrDB, that can manage, store, and process large-scale\r\nrepositories of uncertain data.  PrDB unifies ideas from \"large-scale structured\r\ngraphical models\" like probabilistic relational models (PRMs), developed in the\r\nmachine learning literature, and \"probabilistic query processing\", studied in\r\nthe database literature. PrDB framework is based on the notion of \"shared\r\nfactors\", which not only allows us to express and manipulate uncertainties at\r\nvarious levels of abstractions, but also supports capturing rich correlations\r\namong the uncertain data. PrDB supports a declarative SQL-like language for\r\nspecifying uncertain data and the correlations among them. PrDB also supports\r\nexact and approximate evaluation of a wide range of queries including inference\r\nqueries, SQL queries, and decision-support queries.\r\n\r\nThe cross-disciplinary research undertaken during this project will enable us to\r\nsimultaneously address the challenges in the areas of probabilistic databases\r\nand machine learning, and allow us to transfer the key technologies developed\r\nbetween those areas, thus advancing the research in both areas. It will enable\r\nthe development of a significant and high-impact new class of real-world\r\napplications, in a variety of domains including health informatics, social media\r\nmanagement, World Wide Web, and scientific databases. The PrDB system source\r\ncode, and the datasets generated during the project, will be released using an\r\nappropriate open source license, at the project web site:\r\nhttp://www.cs.umd.edu/db/PrDB.html",
