 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Shine (Shaping High-quality Integrated Nebraska Education) focuses on Problem-Based Learning (PBL) professional development activities for secondary and college faculty in collaboration with business and industry professionals.  Over a three-year period, 72 STEM faculty members participate in nineteen days of professional development activities in applied science and mathematics skills, PBL, and student recruitment. Cohort teams of educators work with designated business mentors for at least one complete year as they develop/adapt replicable PBL teaching resources as a result of their experiences. Faculty from Central Community College and its project partners assist the educators with integrating the PBL resources into their curricula.    Additionally, up to 200 seventh to twelfth grade students of the Project SHINE instructors are participating in gender-specific STEM Camps by providing support for young females and minority males in studying math and science.  Almost 5,000 Nebraska middle and high school students are benefiting from Project Shine's professional development program, increasing participation and success for these students in entering high demand technical careers throughout Nebraska.  One of the dissemination paths for this project is the electronic library of nearly 200 PBL resource materials.  This e-library is housed at Mechatronics Education Center (MEC) website (www.mechatronics-mec.org).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCentral Community College (CCC) initiated Project SHINE, a statewide educator professional development project, to help address the shortage of skilled technicians.  The idea was to train educators about the needs of energy, biofuels, food-processing and manufacturing in order to help inspire the future workforce. The Project SHINE concept originated from a combination of factors &ndash; Nebraska\u00c6s low unemployment (the second lowest in the country during the grant period); the disproportionate number of workers nearing retirement age; the current and future workforce demands of Nebraska industries; the encouragement of community leaders; and CCC\u00c6s proven experience developing successful collaborative programs such as its Mechatronics Education Center.  The National Science Foundation-sponsored project was also supported by CCC, private business, and the National Fluid Power Association.  The goal of Project SHINE was to engage secondary and college educators in mentor relationships with business professionals, thus increasing their knowledge of advanced manufacturing and ultimately enhancing student interest and participation in high demand technical careers.  In July 2012, this unique design was featured by the President\u00c6s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in a Report to the President on Capturing Domestic Competitive Advantage in Advanced Manufacturing.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the project focused on CCC leveraging its extensive list of existing education, state government, and business partnerships to immerse secondary and college faculty in collaborative professional development experiences with industry.  The broader impacts of the project included the development, presentation, and national dissemination of problem-based learning (PBL) resources by a group of educators, a majority of which were female, and the use of a standardized, state-funded online assessment resource for students of the participant educators.\n\nIn the first three years, cohorts of participants comprised of 55 secondary and community college educators from 33 different rural and urban academic institutions throughout Nebraska were competitively selected to be part of year-long mentoring relationships with 23 different businesses in 16 Nebraska communities.  Participant educators were immersed in energy, biofuels, food-processing, and advanced manufacturing environments.  This was combined with hands-on applications of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) at CCC where the educators worked with industrial equipment such as mills, lathes, and presses to fabricate catapults and fluid power arms.  Following these experiences, educators developed well-vetted, interactive lessons aligned to national STEM standards that can be used with a variety of curriculums.  Over the three cohorts, 207 high-quality PBL lessons have been developed and reside in the CCC and, project partner, University of Nebraska at Omaha\u00c6s cyberinfrastructure systems.  The modular interactive lessons have been introduced in classrooms of more than 2,000 secondary and community college students.\n\nTo measure the efficacy of the project on teaching and learning, CCC partnered with the Nebraska Departments of Education, Labor, and Economic Development to implement different aspects of Project SHINE.  One aspect was Nebraska Career Connections, a website designed by Kuder Inc. and supported by NDE and NDOL.  Students participated in more than 6,900 Kuder career interest and skills surveys.  An annualized aggregation of career interest surveys showed students\u00c6 strong interests in both the Manufacturing and STEM career clusters &ndash; both clusters were in the top five of the 16 national career clusters.  Additionally, 187 ninth and tenth grade students from across the state participated in four, week-long gender specific residential student academic camps and a three-day student academic day camp. The camps introduced students to problem-solving, team build..."
