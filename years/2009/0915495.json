 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\nWith the advances of modern computer architectures, interconnects are playing an ever increasingly important role for providing an effective communication medium. Advanced optical switching technologies, such as optical packet switching and wavelength-division-multiplexing, provide a platform to exploit the huge capacity of optical fiber to meet the increasing needs. This research proposes a new switching paradigm - optical cut-through with electronic packet buffering, and systematically investigates the fundamental and challenging issues in the optical interconnect under this switching scheme, with the objective of designing cost-effective, ultra-low latency and pragmatic interconnects for future high-performance computing and communications systems. \r\n\r\nA unique feature of the proposed interconnect is that those packets that do not cause contention can pass the interconnect directly in optical form and experience minimum delay, while only those that cause contention are buffered. This research proposes to combine optical packet switching with electronic buffering, such that the interconnect will enjoy both fast switching and large buffering capacity. This research will (1) design the switching fabric and packet scheduling algorithms, (2) design practical Forward Error Control (FEC) for the interconnect, and (3) conduct extensive performance evaluations by means of simulation and emulation tools and analytical models. The outcome of this project will have a significant impact on fundamental design principles and infrastructures for the development of future high-performance computing and communications systems. The PIs will integrate graduate and undergraduate students into the project and promote the participation of female and minority students. The findings will be disseminated to the research community by way of conferences, journals, and web site access. \r\n \r\n \r\n",
