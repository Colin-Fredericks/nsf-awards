Member organizations that provide servers, server software, and data center services would benefit from a direct technology transfer; and their customers in turn would thereby benefit indirectly, from the improved application performance that would result from acquisition of software and services.  The successful completion of this work will, therefore, aid companies and universities by allowing them to be able to tap into this powerful tool and not have to invent and deploy the same solution for their own organizations to utilize. \r\n",
