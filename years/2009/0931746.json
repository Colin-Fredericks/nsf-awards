 "awd_abstract_narration": "CPS:Small:Control Design for CyberPhysical Systems Using Slow Computing\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop principles and tools for the\r\ndesign of control systems using highly distributed, but slow, computational\r\nelements.  The approach of this research is to build an architecture that\r\nuses highly parallelized, simple computational elements incorporating\r\nnonlinearities, time delay and asynchronous computation as integral design\r\nelements.  Tools for the design of non-deterministic protocols will be\r\ndeveloped and demonstrated using an existing multi-vehicle testbed at\r\nCaltech.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for using \"slow computing\" is to develop new feedback control\r\narchitectures for applications where computational power is extremely\r\nlimited.  Examples of such systems are those where the energy usage of the\r\nsystem must remain small, either due to the source of power available\r\n(e.g. batteries or solar cells) or the physical size of the device\r\n(e.g. microscale and nanoscale robots).  A longer term application area is\r\nin the design of control systems using novel computing substrates, such as\r\nbiological circuits.  A critical element in both cases is the tight coupling\r\nbetween the dynamics of the underlying process and the temporal properties\r\nof the algorithm that is controlling it.\r\n\r\nThe implementation plan for this project involves students from multiple\r\ndisciplines (including bioengineering, computer science, electrical\r\nengineering and mechanical engineering) as well as at multiple experience\r\nlevels (sophomores through PhD students) working together on a set of\r\ninterlinked research problems. The project is centered in the Control and\r\nDynamical Systems department at Caltech, which has a strong record of\r\nrecruiting women and underrepresented minority students into its programs.\r\n",
