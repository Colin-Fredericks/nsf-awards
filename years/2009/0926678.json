 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers in the Departments of Biological and Mathematical Sciences are creating an interdisciplinary curricular and research experience in mathematical biology for undergraduates. Students with an initial introductory background in mathematics (including calculus) and biology are taking further coursework in biomathematics, including new courses with interdisciplinary modules. They also join a multidisciplinary group of faculty and students collaborating on a series of core research projects in population biology, water transport in plants, biomechanics and locomotion, or genetic responses to environmental cues, and give formal oral or poster presentations based on their findings at an annual one-day conference of graduate and undergraduate students. A seminar series entitled \"Mathematics and Biology - An Interface for the 21st Century\" is exposing both students and faculty to the work of prominent researchers in mathematical biology. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of these activities lies in their helping to expose undergraduate students to a more unified perspective of biology and mathematics. Students start out as primarily biology or mathematics students, but the interaction with faculty and students from both fields and their collaborating on research subsequently forms a fertile environment to encourage the interest and ability of students to work at this interface of fields. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the project is its contribution to the development of scientific infrastructure for the future. In order for future scientists to conquer the challenges at the interface between mathematics and biology, the project aims to influence their development at an early stage - before, for example, they have become the traditional biologist who does not have the background to even consider applying mathematics to their research. In keeping with this goal, flexible program entry points allow for early participation of students with less background in mathematics or biology, and research projects are designed to be accessible and compelling to students relatively new to the research experience. This project represents a start at modifying the early development of students and directing a number of them into a growing realm where they have familiarity with both mathematics and biology and can begin to contribute to this important interface.\r\n\r\nThis project is partially supported by funds from the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",
