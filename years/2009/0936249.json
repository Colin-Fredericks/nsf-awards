 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a program to develop computer materials for math education in conjunction with the Math Emporium at Virginia Tech. The Math Emporium is the centerpiece of Virginia Tech's transformation of its introductory math curriculum through the use of technology.\r\n\r\nThe first component of the project is an evaluation of a task-oriented course that is offered in conjunction with the Math Emporium. The course has enrolled nearly 9,000 students over the past five years; roughly half these students were enrolled in traditional sections of the course, while the other half were enrolled in computer-tested sections using task-oriented courseware. The evaluation will study compare the performance of the two groups in later courses.\r\n\r\nThe second component of the project is for the development of components for a next-generation test system for which the content is not tied to the particular test engine or distribution system. These two projects are a vital step toward providing a more productive learning environment that fully leverages the advantages of available technology.",
