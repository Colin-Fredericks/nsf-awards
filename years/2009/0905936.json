 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although ethnic minority adolescents face many daunting challenges during their\r\ntransition to adulthood, many draw on unique cultural strengths to survive and thrive. Racial\r\nsocialization, the process by which parents and other socialization agents give adolescents\r\nrace-related messages, is one of the most important of these cultural strengths. The main aim\r\nof this Social and Behavioral Sciences Minority Post-Doctoral Fellowship research and\r\ntraining activity is to increase understanding of processes associated with the transmission\r\nand receipt of racial socialization messages. The prospective project would draw on the\r\nresources of New York University's Center for Research on Culture, Development and\r\nEducation (CRCDE, currently funded by a grant from National Science Foundation). The\r\ncenter's diverse collection of scholars and focus on mixed methods will allow for the\r\nexploration of both quantitative and qualitative data in the study of the racial socialization\r\nprocess.\r\nOne of the largest unresolved questions about racial socialization concerns how\r\nparent?s messages are communicated to and received by adolescents. Racial socialization\r\nstudies have largely used either parent or child reports of racial socialization, a practice that\r\nprecludes analysis of the relation between parent and child reports of racial socialization or a\r\nthorough examination of the reasons behind successful communication of messages.\r\nThese discrepancies between parent and child reports of racial socialization are\r\nnoteworthy and merit further investigation for at least three reasons. First, an understanding\r\nof the discrepancies can be used to help parents to talk to their children about race in ways\r\nthat enhance youths' identity and self-esteem. Ineffective communication about race and\r\nethnicity on the part of parents may undermine the protective functions such communication\r\nis intended to serve. Second, advancement in this literature may help\r\nmental health professionals and community leaders to further refine interventions and social\r\nprograms that help parents to talk to their children about race in productive ways. This\r\nresearch will lead to evidence-based interventions and programs that improve mental health\r\nand academic outcomes for ethnic minority adolescents. Third,\r\nexplaining the gap will link the racial socialization literature with a broader socialization\r\nliterature that has already grappled with discrepancies between parent and child reports of\r\nsocialization.\r\nAn initial goal of the proposed research is to explore how parent and adolescent\r\nreports differ on three aspects of racial socialization: messages stressing group differences\r\nand racial bias; messages that teach children about their culture; and messages stressing\r\ndistrust between racial groups. The proposed research will also examine how racial\r\nsocialization is affected by the broader context of parenting, including parenting style and\r\nfamily functioning. Finally, the project seeks to broaden understanding of the racial\r\nsocialization process by examining the full range of contexts in which race socialization\r\noccurs. Increasing knowledge of the race socialization process will inform interventions that\r\npromote healthy conversations about race between parents and children.\r\nDuring the time at the CRDCE, the fellow will collaborate with an interdisciplinary\r\nteam of scholars, including many minority researchers. The proposed activity consists of\r\nresearch projects, seminars, and coursework that will enhance the fellow?s understanding of\r\necological and developmental influences on the race socialization process. The fellow will\r\nalso enhance his knowledge of research methods by taking courses and consulting with\r\nscholars on qualitative, mixed, and observational methods. The fellowship will also allow for\r\nthe potential fellow to work on at least three first authored publications and to work on other\r\npapers at the center. The fellow's time at the center will provide increased preparation for a\r\ntenure track position at a research university.",
