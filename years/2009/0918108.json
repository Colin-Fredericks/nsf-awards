 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nCosmological data have established that most of the energy density of the Universe is made of two mysterious components, dark energy and dark matter. The most promising candidate for dark matter is a new weakly interacting particle with a mass near the electroweak scale, suggesting a tantalizing connection with electroweak symmetry breaking. The PI intends to investigate this connection by developing and exploring models beyond the Standard Model with unusual particle dark matter candidates, and calculating the astrophysical detection prospects as well as their novel collider signals. Remarkable dark matter detection experiments are now underway which have already provided unprecedented clues to the properties of dark matter. Very recent results, including the reconfirmation of the DAMA annual modulation, the PAMELA positron ratio excess, and others, are strongly suggestive of electroweak scale candidates with unusual properties. Simultaneously, the start of the large hadron collider this year will revolutionize our knowledge of the electroweak scale. The PI intends to exploit these opportunities to actively participate in uncovering the nature and identity of dark matter. As to broader implacts, the PI plans a series of integrated outreach programs afforded by the strong public appeal of the physics of the Universe to broaden the impact of this proposal. The PI has begun a working relationship with South Eugene High School with plans to expand students' opportunities for research through advising their Senior Research Project. The PI is proposing a new public lecture series that will bring forefront researchers to Oregon. Using the University of Oregon's recently enlarged Portland facility, the public outreach effort would be directed at Oregon's largest population center and combined with new opportunities to have leading researchers visit with undergraduates at traditional liberal arts colleges such as Reed College.\r\nThis program allows opportunities for undergraduates of wide backgrounds to be inquisitive and become excited by research as well as developing ideas for senior thesis research projects.",
