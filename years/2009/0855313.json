 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). In the near future, our understanding of the universe will be greatly enhanced through the direct detection of gravitational waves (dynamic ripples in space-time) generated from the most violent events in the universe such as the collision of two black holes.  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) operates with exceptional sensitivity to detect perturbations from these distant astrophysical events.  The University of Florida LIGO group will carry out research and development for LIGO in four main areas. First, work will be done on improving the performance of the Enhanced LIGO detectors and on devising ways to insure the high-performance operation of mission-critical optical components when the Advanced LIGO interferometers come online.  Second, new methods for searching the sky for localized gravitational wave emissions form massive black holes and bright gamma ray bursts will be developed.  Third, looking further into the future, methods to enhance heat transfer for cooling heavy mirrors to be used in future gravitational wave detectors will be developed and tested. Finally, manpower contributions to the LIGO science runs, LIGO data analysis, and data monitoring software will continue to be made.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts from this research include the development of a scientifically trained work force spanning from undergraduate students through Ph. D. level scientists which will be trained in a diverse set of scientific skills from spanning from lasers and optics to electronics and feedback control systems to sophisticated software and algorithm development.  This work will positively impact the national and international scientific infrastructure through the University of Florida LIGO group's direct participation in research and operations at the LIGO Observatories. Finally, this research will have technological impacts that go beyond gravitational wave astronomy. High-average-power optical devices developed by this program have commercial applications to the laser and optics industries.",
