 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support participation in workshops associated with the international Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) Open Science Meeting (OSM) in June 2009, Victoria, BC.  The OSM will culminate the integration and synthesis activities of the international GLOBEC program by providing a new mechanistic understanding of the functioning of the marine ecosystem, in order to develop predictive capabilities, and propose a framework for the management of marine ecosystems in the era of global change.  Selection of individuals to participate in the workshops will be based on 1) Career stage, with priority given to early career scientists, 2) contribution to the workshops and OSM in terms of abstract submission for an oral or poster presentation and potential for contributed manuscript and 3) applicant gender and ethnic background.  Selected applicants will be from U.S. Institutions.  The synthesis, integration and modeling activities will provide new insights into marine population variability and climate change. This in turn will provide a basis for the development of new research initiatives and programs focused on marine food webs and their interaction with biogeochemical cycling (e.g., IMBER) and climate variability",
