A broad spectrum of important topics in modern intermetallics covered:\r\n?\tSynthesis of intermetallics for energy (e.g. hydrogen storage and thermoelectrics) and magnetic applications, along with novel synthetic approaches and strategies (including synthesis of nanoparticles, and use of flux, microwave synthesis, metathesis, etc).\r\n?\tInnovative chemical strategies and understanding of intermetallics (including intermetallic nanomaterials, new chemical bonding paradigms) \r\n?\tNew characterization techniques and novel physical properties of intermetallics are also presented.\r\nChemists interested in the synthetic design of intermetallics will also have the opportunity to learn about the potential physical properties of new materials at different length scales (from nanoscale to bulk phases).  Theoretical chemists will be exposed to state-of-the-art synthetic design capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis proposal funds a symposium with three oral sessions and one poster session entitled ?Synthesis and Applications of Intermetallic Compounds? at the 238th American Chemical Society National Meeting, to be held in Washington DC from August 16-20, 2009.  The symposium will focus on synthesis, chemistry, and applications of intermetallics that directly impact a wide range of areas, including energy-related and alternative energy applications, such as superconductivity, thermoelectrics, and materials with novel mechanical properties.  The potential impacts of this symposium are the interactions of high profile scientists with junior faculty and students.  In this symposium, over half of the speakers are women and underrepresented minorities.  In addition, many students and postdocs of the invited speakers are presenting their work in a poster session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
