 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Education Foundation of the Connecticut Business & Industry Association (CBIA)is partnering with the Connecticut Science Center, Connecticut College of Technology, EASTCONN (a Regional Education Service Center), and CBIA member companies on an ITEST strategies project to encourage and prepare 9th and 10th grade minority and low-income, first-generation college students for enrollment in Advanced Placement courses in math, science and English in Project Opening Doors (POD) schools in Connecticut. POD, Connecticut's National Math and Science Initiative, is designed to increase enrollment of underserved and minority students in 11th and 12th grade AP classes and improve their educational performance, success in post-secondary education, and eventual employment in science and technology based companies. The ITEST project is a pre-AP initiative designed to excite and motivate students in the sciences and technology and prepare them for the rigor of AP coursework in POD project schools. \r\n\r\nOver the three-year grant period, 1,020 9th and 10th grade students and 30 teachers from eight to ten POD schools participate in exciting cyberlearning activities designed to stimulate student interest in AP STEM subjects. Activities include the year-long the \"How Cool is This? Cyber-Challenge,\" with companies including Pfizer, United Technologies, General Electric, and Northeast Utilities, providing thought-provoking, relevant challenges to student industry teams. The teams, made up of 9th and 10th grade students from different schools, collaborate virtually to solve their challenge using 2.0 tools including online conferencing and chat tools (Bridgit, Skype, ooVoo) email, wikis, collaborative documents and other related emerging technologies. The Cyber-Challenge culminates with student industry teams presenting their solutions in a multi-media format to peers and industry representatives in the Connecticut Science Center's IMAX Theater. Finished projects are posted on the program's social networking website.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, teams take part in a variety of supplemental activities to underscore the relevance of STEM courses, including college programs such as Engineering Challenge, State Scholars presentations by industry representatives, and field trips to companies. Accompanying teacher professional development includes industry externships and training on 2.0 tools needed to oversee student progress and bolster their technology skills.\r\n\r\nAn external evaluator will assess student interest in STEM subjects and perceptions of STEM careers using pre- and post-test surveys for each activity; program staff will track student enrollment in AP courses. The project advisory board includes industry representatives, educators, and education experts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Opening Doors: An AP mathematics and science strategy to prepare under-represented students for college success and STEM careers complements the Project Opening Doors (POD) initiative begun by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA) Education Foundation through funding from the National Math and Science Institute (NMSI).  Its purpose was to inspire students to take advanced placement courses in STEM and English in grades 11-12 by engaging them in 9-10th grade team-based science and math activities, using social media and technology to solve real-world problems.  In addition to creating interest and engagement in STEM, the grant gives students a greater understanding of STEM careers and the professional skills needed in the workplace, while improving self-efficacy.\n\nThe Cyber-Challenge program created opportunities for 9th and 10th grade students from three Connecticut urban high schools (East Hartford, New Britain, Wilby High Schools) to engage in STEM industry-based experiences over two years.  Ninth grade students formed teams to solve industry problems presented by the grant's corporate partners (Pfizer, Northeast Utilities, UTC Aerospace Systems, General Electric Energy), while learning about new technologies and social media (Wiki).  They also participated in teambuilding workshops, classroom laboratories conducted by industry partners, and events at the Connecticut Science Center.  At yearend, students presented their findings to industry judges at the Connecticut Science Center through presentations using sophisticated technologies.  Cyber-Challenge tenth-grade students participated in workshops, industry-led laboratories and field trips to enhance their understanding of and interest in STEM careers.\n\nCBIA's Education Foundation's goal was to increase ninth and tenth grade minority and low-income students' interest and success in taking AP STEM subjects as well as to give them exposure to working professionals in STEM fields.\n\nThe project's goal of increasing AP participation was challenging, given the lack of rigorous STEM preparation most of these students had prior to entering high school.  Nevertheless, the contextual learning created by the grant's activities encouraged students who otherwise wouldn't engage in STEM to be more confident and interested in STEM course work and careers.  In addition, all three schools had access to student and faculty support through POD.\n\nOther support given to the Cyber-Challenge students enrolling in AP classes included:\n\n-  A four week summer program at New Britain High School strengthened their study skills and helped them develop the confidence to take AP;\n\n-  Wilby High School purchased study guides for faculty to help students prepare for AP exams;\n\n-  An East Hartford faculty member provided academic support for students enrolled in the AP math summer program.\n\nCyber-Challenge teachers participated in a two-week summer industry externship programs.  The externships gave teachers a greater understanding of how science and math are used in the workplace as well as the skills needed for the workplace.  The externship also allowed teachers to create a stronger connection with the grant's industry partners, who assisted Cyber-Challenge students as they worked on their projects and presentations.\n\nThe Cyber-Challenge's overall success is measured by the extent to which it influenced 9th and 10th grade participants to enroll in Advance Placement classes.  The urban ITEST population brings with it many barriers to academic risk-taking; it is important to note that the project served 948 urban students, the majority of whom were under-represented minorities.  Of the 948 students, 196 enrolled in AP classes throughout the grant.  There was a direct correlation between the increased self-efficacy and interest in STEM expressed in student evaluations and the increased student enrollment in Advanced Placement courses.  Noteworthy is the increase in tenth grade st..."
