 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Seston Contributions to metabolism Across Longitudinal Ecosystems (SCALE)--Dynamics of Organic Particles in River Networks\r\n\r\nStreams and rivers continually transport microscopic organic particles that originate from sources such as forests, upland soils, and streambed algae. These particles are important because they (1) carry food-energy from headwaters to larger streams and rivers, (2) transport pollutants through river systems, and (3) transfer organic carbon from terrestrial to marine ecosystems.  This research asks three fundamental questions about particulate organic carbon in transport: is it biodegradable, how far downstream does it travel, and to what extent does it support life in larger streams and rivers? To answer these questions, we have assembled a research team with expertise in stream ecology, organic geochemistry, hydrologic engineering, and mathematical modeling that will perform chemical and biological characterizations of the particles, identify the important hydrodynamic processes controlling suspension and deposition, and construct a mathematical model that simulates the generation, transport, and decomposition of particles as they move downstream.  \r\n\r\nStroud Water Research Center Education staff will develop curricula for middle- and high school classrooms which introduce modeling within the larger framework of aquatic sciences. The educators will work with researchers to develop the curricula and models, which range from conceptual diagrams to mathematical simulations. Because this research will emphasize the role of headwaters in subsidizing larger streams and rivers, the result should help guide policy regarding the protection of upstream ecosystems.  Research results will be summarized for local watershed associations for dissemination to the public, and shared with national conservation organizations that provide technical information to legislative aides.   \r\n\r\n",
