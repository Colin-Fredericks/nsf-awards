Unlike most of the work done so far in the field that focuses on how order arises from given local interparticle interactions, this research will study the inverse problem of finding what local interactions are required for the building blocks to self-assemble into a given structure.  Using this approach, new strategies will be developed to find particle interactions that are capable of generating specific crystal structures through self-assembly.   The role of elastic and amphiphatic surfaces in mediating particle self-assembly and the role of particle aggregation in determining the mechanical and elastic properties of soft interfaces will also be studied.  The ability to design particle interactions in a systematic fashion to target desired crystals, and the prospect of manipulating the mechanical properties of microscopic elastic sheets, will be results of great practical importance. The results of this research will help open the way to rational design of structures with novel optical, mechanical and functional properties. \r\n\r\nThe educational aspects of this CAREER award are multifaceted. One major goal is to increase participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences and specifically in chemistry by improving K-12 curriculum activities in nearby Harlem high schools. The PI also plans to  develop multi-platform interactive educational software, in the particular form of video games, that will be made freely available to middle and high schools nation wide. This approach is based on the premise that active learning and interactivity will be the key to motivate and inspire the next generation of scientists. This outreach program builds on the framework of the Center for Technology, Innovation, and Community Engagement at Columbia University, and complements the ongoing efforts of the Chemistry Department and the University to reach the Harlem community.\r\n\r\nNONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis CAREER award supports a combined research and education program to develop theoretical and computational methods that can predict how molecular building blocks will self-assemble into three-dimensional materials structures.  This approach could apply to many materials systems, some representative examples include: aggregation of proteins into functional biomachines on the scale of large molecules, formation of protein coats of viruses, packing of large molecules to form biological membranes, and assembly of nanometer scale particles to make photonic crystals, crystals engineered for specific optical properties, such as transmitting particular colors of light and blocking others.  The major research objectives include the development of numerical tools to examine how particles need to interact with each other in order to self-assemble into a desired complex crystal structure, the study of how elastic surfaces or membranes can assist particle self-assembly, and the study of how particle clustering on soft interfaces can be used to determine the mechanical and elastic properties of materials used as templates.  The results of this research could help open the way to rational design of structures with novel optical, mechanical and functional properties.  This program will build on the strong commitment of Columbia University to the field of nanotechnology. \r\n\r\nThe educational aspects of this CAREER award are multifaceted.
