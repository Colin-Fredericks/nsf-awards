 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Suri S. Iyer at the University of Cincinnati who will synthesize ligands that exhibit antibody-like selectivity, are robust, inexpensive, amenable to scale up and require no refrigeration. Glycans possess these desirable properties and they are unique recognition molecules that modulate essential communication processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. However, synthetic glycoconjugates because of selectivity and sensitivity issues cannot be used for practical applications. A better understanding of the binding event at the molecular level will help to fill the gap in knowledge that has prevented the use of synthetic glycans in diagnostics and therapeutics. Consequently, the PI proposes to identify the molecular determinants (such as structure, multivalency and mode of presentation) of glycan-receptor interactions by developing a library of chemically defined glycans and assaying them with different strains of toxins and pathogens using a variety of biophysical techniques. The overall goal of the proposal is to understand how modifications in structure, valency and architecture modulate glycan-receptor recognition events. The successful outcome of this project will advance knowledge in the area of glycoscience and pathogen detection. It is expected that researchers will use the knowledge gained to rationally design ligands to modulate glycan mediated biochemical processes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activities will broaden the participation of underrepresented high school students by providing them with an opportunity to work in a research laboratory. Professor Iyer will provide an active and structured learning environment and will provide students with valuable training in multiple disciplines that include glycoscience, biophysical measurements and microbiology. In addition, a summer workshop for K-12 science teachers to promote training and exposure to emerging interdisciplinary areas will be included. It is expected that these K-12 teachers will be able expose students to these topics at an early age. The PI will continue to disseminate his research on glycoscience, biodetection, and nanoscience through publications, reviews, presentations, and visits to local schools and rotary clubs.\r\n",
