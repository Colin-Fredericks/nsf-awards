 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a framework for the development\r\nand deployment of next-generation medical systems consisting of integrated and\r\ncooperating medical devices.  The approach is to design and implement an\r\nopen-source medical device coordination framework and a model-based component\r\noriented programming methodology for the device coordination, supported by a\r\nformal framework for reasoning about device behaviors and clinical workflows.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the formal foundations of the\r\nframework that will enable rapid development, verification, and certification\r\nof medical systems and their device components, as well as the clinical\r\nscenarios they implement.  The model-based approach will supply evidence for\r\nthe regulatory approval process, while run-time monitoring components embedded\r\ninto the system will enable \"black box\" recording capabilities for the forensic\r\nanalysis of system failures.  The open-source distribution of tools supporting\r\nthe framework will enhance its adoption and technology transfer.\r\n\r\nA rigorous framework for integrating and coordinating multiple medical devices\r\nwill enhance the implementation of complicated clinical scenarios and reduce\r\nmedical errors in the cases that involve such scenarios.  Furthermore, it will\r\nspeed up and simplify the process of regulatory approval for coordination-enabled medical devices, while the formal reasoning framework will improve the confidence in the design process and in the approval decisions.\r\n\r\nOverall, the framework will help reduce costs and improve the quality of the\r\nhealth care.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMedical devices historically have been monolithic units -- developed, validated, and approved by regulatory authorities as stand-alone entities.  Modern medical devices increasingly incorporate connectivity mechanisms that offer the potential to integrate devices via network/middleware technology into larger systems of cooperating devices.  Initial integration efforts in industry focus on streaming device data into electronic health records and integrating information from multiple devices into single customizable displays.  However, there are numerous clinical motivations for moving beyond this to consider frameworks that coordinate the actions of groups of cooperating devices to realize \"closed loop\" scenarios, automate clinical workflows by controlling networked devices as they perform cooperative tasks, and even automatically construct and execute patient treatments.\n\nMany challenges exist that are preventing this vision of systems of coordinated medical devices from being realized. To provide a research foundation for addressing these challenges, in this project, Kansas State University and University of Pennsylvania researchers have developed an open source Medical Device Coordination Framework (MDCF).  The MDCF includes: (a) publish-subscribe (pub/sub) middleware for integrating medical devices and EHRs, and (b) a model-based development environment that could be used to quickly implement medical device coordination applications (apps) &ndash; enabling a \"systems of systems\" paradigm for medical devices as described above.  The MDCF conforms to the ASTM 2761 \"Integrated Clinical Environment\" (ICE) architecture and was the first open-source implementation of ICE.\n\nThe primary contributions of this work included developing appropriate architectural principles and interoperability techniques needed to develop safe systems of systems of medical devices.   Since the MDCF team first illustrated the applicability of publish subscribe middleware in this domain, a number of other industrial teams prototyping ICE systems have also embraced publish-subscribe (pub-sub) approaches.  However, in constrast to other commercially available pub-sub middleware, the MDCF's MIDAS middleware makes novel use of Open Flow network switch technology to provide dynamic schedulability analysis, hard real-time guarantees, fine-grained message and stream access control, and isolation policies -- using off-the-shelf networking infrastructure. \n\nWith strong collaborations with clinicians, industry, and FDA engineers, the MDCF team was able to provide demonstrations at a number of high-profile venues including Healthcare Information and Management Systems Solutions (HIMSS) conference, Medical Device Connectivity conference, Cerner Health Conference, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health.   For these demonstrations, MDCF researchers were able to demonstrate novel medical apps including smart alarms and safety interlocks for closed-loop control of patient-controlled analgesic infusion pumps.  The technical results of these collaborations were reported on in papers co-authored by FDA engineers and clinical/industrial collaborators.\n\nBesides supporting innovations with software-based clinical applications, the infrastructure above enabled a new paradigm of medical devices that we refer to as \"medical platform-oriented devices\" (MPODs): minimalistic devices constructed with sensors/actuators as their primary components with computational and user interface functionality off-loaded to the MDCF app components.  These components provide capabilities that may have been unsuitable for direct microprocessor implementation, promote the use of parallel analyses (e.g., for parameter verification), and enable the construction of reconfigurable apps.  To demonstrate this approach, a product-line of reconfigurable, component-based software apps was developed to provide medical devices that utilize photoplethysmograms (PPGs) -- the ..."
