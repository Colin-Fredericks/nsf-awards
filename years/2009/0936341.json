Project Activities and Findings:\n\na)  Research \n\nOperational funding for R/V Atlantic Explorer Oceanographic Technical Services has supported scientific research, marine education and technology development that improve scientific knowledge of societal relevant environmental issues. \n\nTechnical services provided include:\n\nCommunication and Coordination: Pre-cruise Planning\nMaintenance, Repair, Storage and Calibration of shared use instrumentation and equipment\nHardware and Software Development: Ongoing improvements of vessel capabilities and recurrent training for technicians\nData Archiving:  Back up of all data and submission of data through Rolling Deck to Depository (R2R) Program which makes all data available to scientists worldwide\nCruise Mobilization and De-mobilization Logistics\nAt Sea: Science Equipment Deployments, Instrumentation Support, Computer and Network Maintenance, Navigation and Communications Equipment Support\n\n\nMany of the major research projects that use the R/V Atlantic Explorer are oceanographic time-series efforts (http://www.bios.edu/research/time_series.html).

The ship is an ideal platform for conducting mooring operations and is strategically located for supporting mooring work throughout the central Atlantic region.\n\nThese major time-series programs have spawned numerous ancillary research projects and process-oriented studies in the past and this number looks to grow substantially in the future. \n\nThis  has increased the increased the importance of excellent Marine Technical Services Support.\n\n b) Education \n\nThe R/V Atlantic Explorer operations are important contributors to education, training and public outreach.  Given the proximity of Hydrostation \"S\" and BATS to Bermuda, these cruises serve an important educational role in training future generations of potential oceanographers. At a time when fewer and fewer new scientists are going to sea, the importance of recruiting these new scientists and providing sea-going training experience is critical. \n\nThe R/V Atlantic Explorer also contains the only classroom in the UNOLS fleet that has been designed primarily for undergraduate education.\n\nII.  Justification and Cost\n\n NSF Award OCE-0936341 in the amount of $1,068,054 (cumulative amount) has supported the day to day Oceanographic Technical Services Program of the R/V Atlantic Explorer. \n\nThe R/V Atlantic Explorer is..."
