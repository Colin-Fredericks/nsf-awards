Sheppard.\r\n\r\nThe SERET program, an integrated center of excellence at Stanford University, will focus on the multi-disciplinary nature of engineering by placing a total of 25 STEM teachers in grades 6-14 in one of nine engineering departments and 49 independent labs, centers and institutes on campus for an 8 week summer hands-on research experience.  This summer program will be followed up by development of engineering-based lessons to help students bridge to real-world experiences by showing how concrete and applicable engineering concepts connect what is learned in school to what goes on in the outside world.",
