The community provideseverything from operating system components to compilers and advanced math libraries. As an international community, however, there are only loosely coordinated activities and plans for\r\ndevelopment. The new rapidly changing technologies in multicore, power consumption, GPGPUs, and memory architectures creates an opportunity for the community to work together and build an international program to design, build, and deliver the software so critical the science goals of these\r\ninstitutions. To help plan how the international community could build a partnership to provide the next generation of HPC software to support scientific discovery, a series of workshops are being planned. Funding under this proposal would provide travel and support for the first workshop in the series.\r\nGoals for this first meeting include:\r\n\u00b7 Assess the short-term, medium-term and long-term needs of applications for peta/exascale systems\r\n\u00b7 Explore how laboratories, universities, and vendors can work together on coordinated HPC software\r\n\u00b7 Understand existing R&D plans addressing new programming models and tools addressing extreme scale, multicore, heterogeneity and performance\r\n\u00b7 Start development of a roadmap for software on extreme-scale systems",
