 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nA major goal of neuroscience is to understand the dynamics of neural circuits.  In most circuits, ignorance of intrinsic neural properties and synaptic organization limits our ability to understand the performance.  This project exploits new discoveries of the synaptic organization of a circuit that coordinates limb movements during locomotion.   An integrated program of experimental neurophysiology and mathematical theory will be used to explain how dynamics emerge from the interactions of intrinsic neuronal properties, synaptic dynamics, and synaptic organization.  Using coupled-oscillator theory to guide neurophysiological experiments, and experimental results to constrain development of new models, a model of the circuit will be constructed and used to explore how intrinsic properties of different neurons and synaptic connectivity combine to produce the stable differences in phase of limb movements that are essential for effective locomotion.  This modeling work will search for general principles governing dynamics in coordinating circuits.  Because these circuits are central to many neural systems, the results should be applicable to many different systems.  Many components of this project lend themselves well to undergraduate research.  Undergraduate students will be heavily involved in summer research programs and Senior Honors Thesis projects.  To augment their introduction to research, an advanced undergraduate course will focus on weekly research seminars by speakers who are successful members of underrepresented groups, followed by lunch and discussion with the speaker.  To hone their presentation and communication skills, students will be encouraged to present their work in the departmental mathematical biology seminar series.  Students will also be recruited from UC Davis REU programs that support students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds or from under-represented groups.",
