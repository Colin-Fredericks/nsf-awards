 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal reasoning about concurrent programs is usually done at a\r\nhigh-level with strong assumptions such as built-in thread primitives\r\n(e.g., locks) and simplified memory models (e.g., sequential\r\nconsistency). Existing formal techniques (including Hoare logic and\r\ntype system) have consistently ignored important issues such as\r\nrelaxed memory models, hardware interrupts, implementation of\r\nsynchronization primitives, and support for software transactional\r\nmemory and privatization. This severely limits their applicability.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on extending and adapting existing formal\r\ntechniques so that they can also support realistic low-level\r\nconcurrent programs running on modern multicore and multiprocessor\r\nmachines. The PI is developing a new operational approach for\r\nreasoning about programs running under relaxed memory models;\r\ndesigning new program logics for certifying both weak and strong\r\nmemory operations (including the memory-fence and compare-and-swap\r\ninstructions); and showing how to scale his approach to real-world\r\nthread implementation and to machines with relaxed memory models.  If\r\nsuccessful, this research will help improve the reliability of\r\nconcurrent software components, which form the backbone of many\r\ncritical systems in the world. It will also facilitate the\r\ncommunity-wide effort for finding new programming models for safe and\r\nscalable multicore computing.",
