 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a process which integrates high performance thin film silicon circuitry with compound semiconductor devices, and to use this process to demonstrate an active matrix light emitting diode capable of projecting a video\r\nbrightness image.   The approach is to start with high quality\r\ncompound semiconductor wafers, and then deposit and recrystallize the silicon circuitry using low temperature deposition and a laser annealing process known as sequential lateral solidification.  This process produces thin film silicon transistors with high mobility and minimal thermal load to the substrate.\r\n\r\nCompound semiconductor materials are favored for a number of optoelectronic applications including photodetectors for visible, IR, and UV; light emitting diodes; and lasers. The materials used in these applications, however, generally do not form transistors and cannot be used for switching or local ampli&#64257;cation. The approach presented in this proposal reverses the usual heteroepitaxy strategy, in which compound semiconductors are grown on a silicon wafer, and instead fabricates silicon devices on a compound semiconductor wafer.  This allows integration of high quality compound semiconductor materials with silicon circuitry for switching and amplification, avoiding the limitations of other approaches.\r\n\r\nThe technology developed has a range of applications including energy efficient displays, lithography, hyperspectral detection, communication systems, and miniature biological sensors.  In addition to training a graduate student, the program will mentor a high school student and an undergraduate working on the project.  Light emitting diode wafer materials will be used for high school demonstrations and a course on display devices.",
