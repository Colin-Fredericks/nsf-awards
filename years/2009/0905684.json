Flanagan)\r\n\r\nNext-Generation Infrastructure for Trustworthy Web Applications\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nMany services traditionally performed by stand-alone programs running on desktop computers are being migrated to ?Web 2.0? applications, remote services that reside ?in the cloud? and are that accessed through a browser.  This migration process offers a unique opportunity to re-engineer the way that software is constructed, adding some extra capabilities that reduce the vulnerability of the global information infrastructure to problems such as viruses, cyber-attacks, loss of privacy, and integrity violations. \r\n\r\nWith this goal in mind, this project designs and implements a next-generation infrastructure for trustworthy web applications.  It evolves the existing Web 2.0 technologies into a more trustworthy ?Web 2.Sec? version by introducing information-labeling and strong information-flow controls pervasively at the service provider, at the user?s end, and on all paths in between.\r\n\r\nA key feature of the new Web 2.Sec architecture is that all application programs are executed on top of a virtual machine (VM) rather than directly on physical hardware.  Hence the VM retains full control over the data at all times, allowing it to enforce information-&#64258;ow policies that guarantee con&#64257;dentiality and integrity.  Even a malicious or faulty program running on top of the Web 2.Sec VM cannot cause any action that would violate these policies.\r\n\r\nA strong educational component involving both graduate and undergraduate students rounds off the project.\r\n",
