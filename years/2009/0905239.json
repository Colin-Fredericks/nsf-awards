 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study is to develop a communication interface that \r\nwill enable older people to effectively communicate with robotic \r\nassistants, allowing them in this way to remain living safely in their \r\nhomes. The proposed communication interface will be: (1) multimodal, \r\nthat is supporting spoken, gestural and physical interactions, as all \r\nthese typically occur simultaneously when people communicate with one \r\nanother, and (2) adaptive so that the robotic assistant will adjust to \r\nthe older person rather than the older person to the robotic \r\nassistant. The combination of speech, gestures and physical \r\ninteractions (haptics) has received only limited attention, but it \r\nwill be critical for successful deployment of assistive robots for \r\nmany elderly individuals. The transformative component of this \r\nresearch is to view haptics as one of the drivers of the dialogue \r\nbetween the user and the robot, and to study its relation to speech \r\nand gestures through language processing methods. To adapt to each \r\nuser, the interpretation of the speech, gestures and haptic signals \r\nwill be performed by means of RISq (Recognition by Indexing and \r\nSequencing), a novel, adaptive and reliable recognition \r\nmethodology. Finally, a formal and modular control design methodology \r\nwill be developed, that guarantees that the robot responds safely and \r\nreliably to the interpretation of the user intent provided by dialogue \r\nprocessing. \r\n\r\nRobot assistive technology holds immense promise for the \r\nfuture. Supporting the independent functioning of older people so that \r\nthey can safely remain living in the community is of paramount \r\nimportance, especially since the world's population is aging at an \r\never increasing pace. However, one of the main obstacles to the \r\nwidespread use of robot assistants is the lack of interfaces that are \r\neasy to use for the elderly and allow the robot to be used in complex \r\nreal-world environments such as a typical apartment. The proposed \r\nresearch aims to develop new tools that will enable robot developers \r\nto fill this void. The research could also have significant \r\nimplications for the delivery of institutionally based health \r\ncare. The deployment of robots to assist nursing personnel in \r\nhospitals and long-term care facilities, as well as at home, has \r\nenormous implications for improved health outcomes and quality of life \r\nfor older patients while minimizing costs of care. Furthermore, the \r\nreduction of the nursing workload by such robot assistants promises to \r\nalleviate the critical shortage of nursing personnel in the USA that \r\nis only expected to worsen.",
