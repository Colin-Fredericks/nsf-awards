 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe project investigates statistical software analysis, which infers\r\nrelationships among program components by using statistical properties\r\nderived from multiple program executions.\r\n\r\nTo motivate statistical techniques, it is useful to draw analogies to\r\nstatic analysis methods. Static analysis is about inferring\r\ndependencies between program components: If a value is changed in one\r\ncomponent, how does that affect a value in a different component?\r\nStatic analysis tends to work best for properties that are local,\r\nmeaning the pieces of the program we are trying to relate are not\r\nseparated by a great deal of other computation. The statistical analog\r\nof dependencies is correlation. Instead of proving definitively via\r\nstatic reasoning the presence or absence of dependencies, we can\r\nobserve at run-time that some properties of two components have high\r\nor low correlation. Importantly, correlation is not affected by\r\nsyntactic or even dynamic locality: if two components have a\r\ncorrelation, regardless of how much time or computation passes between\r\nthe execution of one component and the execution of the other, this\r\ncorrelation can be detected if the appropriate statistical question is\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nThe initial focus is on using cross-correlation, which which computes\r\nthe maximum correlation between two sequences of observations, to\r\nformalize statistical correlation between software components that\r\nhave a direction in time. This idea gives rise to a natural graph that\r\ncaptures the strength and direction of statistical influence one\r\ncomponent has upon another; these graphs are analogous to traditional\r\ndependency graphs, but have unique and useful properties.\r\n",
