 "awd_abstract_narration": "Instinctive computing is a computational simulation of biological and cognitive instincts.\r\nInstincts profoundly influence how we see, feel, appear, think, and act. If as society we want a computer to be genuinely secure, intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, and even to have primitive instincts. In this crosscut workshop, the PI will explore transformational developments in this area, including\r\nthe building blocks for instinctive computing systems and potential applications such as security, privacy, human-computer interaction, next generation networks, and product design. The funding will cover the costs for invited outstanding students to present their prototypes and to interact with leading researchers in this area. This workshop will have broader impacts on many disciplines including philosophy, robotics, computer science, cognition science, computer networks, security, information privacy, cybernetics and electrical and computer engineering. It transforms isolated applications into an academic field. It serves as an incubator for young students to explore new approaches from diverse fields. The Program Committee will encourage outstanding undergraduates, especially women and minority students, to participate in the workshop.\r\n",
