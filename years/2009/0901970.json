 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent development of terahertz (THz) technology based on optical light has resulted in rapid growth and real world applications.  Prototype terahertz imaging systems have been installed in airports and post offices for security inspections.  Industries from ship building to forestry are applying THz light for process monitoring.  Biomolecular and biomedical research now experiment with terahertz technology.  To ensure U.S. leadership in this rapidly moving field, it is essential that current science and engineering students become fluent in the technology.  The Optical Terahertz Science and Technology Workshop 2009 will achieve this through: a day of tutorials by specialists; three days of research presentations by world renowned investigators; and student poster presentations to be critiqued by leaders in the field.  Undergraduate education will be impacted through a workshop on incorporating THz research into undergraduate teaching.  The resulting modules will inspire undergraduates to participate in research that will give them the hands-on skills to pursue high tech careers and contribute to innovation in the U.S. economy.  Three NSF divisions have contributed to supporting the attendance by graduate students and post docs at this workshop: the Division of Materials Research, the Division of Chemistry, and the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems.",
