 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research provides important insights into the role of local governments in technology development, implementation and diffusion.  A substantial share of ARRA funding is directed to local governments to address specific and applied local problems such as implementation of renewable energy and alternative fuels, energy conservation, new transportation technologies, and expansion of smart grid energy transmission systems.   Although an extensive literature exists on the factors that contribute to the successful transfer of technologies from federal government or university partnerships with private companies, far less research exists which examines the role of local governments in these collaborations. The unprecedented ARRA strategy of directing substantial technology funding to local governments, rather than directly to firms, institutes and universities, can be used to shed new light on a relatively unknown area of the science of science and technology policy.  \r\n\r\nThe success of the approach is likely to depend on the extent to which local governments have the internal capacity to manage energy programs and the extent to which formal and informal collaborative relationships emerge. This research examines what factors lead to the development of those partnerships and collaborative relationships necessary to develop, promote, and implement new energy technologies.  It also examines how information and technological innovations are transmitted and diffused among a system of local governments.  The PI bases the analysis on a transaction cost explanation of institutional collective action.   \r\n\r\nBetter understanding of the way in which science investments spur the creation of policy networks and other forms of cross-sector collaborations may have significant and far-reaching consequences for the functioning of local government. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:\r\nThe project takes advantage of a unique opportunity to gather baseline data that can be used to assess the impact of science investments on collaboration and innovation.  These data provide an important foundation for future inquiry on the transmission of technical knowledge among local governments and other actors.  The insights associated with the investigation of the role of local collaborative networks within local governments in stimulating collaboration can be used to inform policy design at the local state and federal levels.  In addition, the research trains post doctoral and graduate students in the research process and prepares them to contribute to the science of science policy in the future.",
