 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop planar transmission-line metamaterials integrated with active quantum-cascade gain material for novel terahertz photonic and electronic devices. The approach is to use terahertz quantum-cascade laser metal-metal waveguide (similar to microstrip transmission line) that is fabricated using a wafer-bonding process as a platform for the implementation of transmission-line metamaterials. Research will proceed via (i) a comprehensive program of metamaterial electromagnetic design and modeling, microfabrication, experimental characterization, and (ii) design of advanced quantum-cascade gain material and its growth by molecular beam epitaxy by the industrial collaborator.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is the development of active terahertz planar metamaterials that provide photonic gain from stimulated emission to balance losses, and the demonstration of novel active metamaterial devices, such as zero-index lasers, sub-wavelength lasers, and phased array terahertz emitters. The terahertz spectral range is ideally situated to allow integration of metamaterial and gain concepts from both electronic and photonic frequencies.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact is the development of terahertz technology for eventual applications in sensing, imaging, communications, and spectroscopy applications, and the transfer of this technology to the industrial partner to support its programs in high-speed electronics for defense and space science. Outreach to underrepresented groups will occur by working with UCLA's Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity program to recruit undergraduate students for research. Educational exchange will occur via students directly interacting with industry, and industrial employees performing research at UCLA. The PI will develop a graduate course \"Terahertz Technology\" that will be informed by this research.",
