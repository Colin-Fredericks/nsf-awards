The cross-departmental, interdisciplinary research program addresses the need for new concepts in low cost, portable sensing devices that can protect against environmental hazards and toxic chemical-biological agents.  The research will investigate nanofabricated tunnel junctions and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) for solid state sensor devices.  The advantages of this work over existing concepts include: (1) sensitivity down to the single molecule level, (2) all solid state construction that allows integration into complex hybrid systems, (3) a device design that is conducive to low cost manufacturing, and (4) spectral identification of unknown molecular agents.  The research will investigate a novel combination of nanofabrication techniques with atomic layer chemistry to engineer 1-2 nm spaced metal-molecule-metal tunnel junctions that will be doped with model compounds and investigated with IETS for spectral identification.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the research program are the underlying science of molecular devices, including the understanding of molecule-electrode chemical interactions and charge transport through single molecule devices.  In particular, there is a need for experimental data to connect physical properties and electrical measurements in single molecule tunnel junctions.  IETS provides a probe of molecular structure in nanofabricated junctions that will advance the science and engineering of molecule-based devices.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research program are significant for future technologies based on molecular devices that enable low cost, ubiquitous sensors that protect the public from environmental hazards and toxic chemical-biological agents.  In addition, the research program will interact with the general public through a multimedia presentation to demonstrate a concrete example of nanotechnology.  \r\n\r\n",
