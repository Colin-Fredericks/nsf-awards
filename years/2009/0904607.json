The goal of this project is to study the variability to infer details of the structure of the inside of the observed stars. This tool, referred to as asteroseismology, is a unique method to probe a star's internal structure from measurements of its discrete oscillation spectrum. Asteroseismology was originally developed for studying the sun, but advances in space-based observations are allowing its application to other stars.",
