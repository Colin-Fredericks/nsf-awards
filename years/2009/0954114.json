The conference continues, and expands in a new direction, work begun at a CBMS Forum held in October 2008 on the National Mathematics Advisory Panel Report.  The current forum focuses on mathematics content and assessment and is closely related to the initiative by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) to develop a set of Common Core State Standards for school mathematics. The conference is intended to provide an opportunity for policy makers and the broad mathematics education community to provide input into the standards development process.  CBMS will produce a white paper on the key issues.",
