 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor V. Ramamurthy of the University of Miami will focus on the supramolecular photochemistry of a special class of supermolecules namely guest@host complexes. In the context of excited state chemistry, of the various organic hosts thus far examined, the octa acid (OA), a synthetic cavitand host, which forms a capsular structure that shields the hydrophobic guest organic molecule from the aqueous exterior, shows considerable potential. To establish OA as a useful reaction medium, the PI proposes to carry out experiments that seek answers to questions on the following topics: (a) Features controlling the stoichiometry of guest-to-OA complexes in water, (b) The dynamics of the OA capsule, (c) Controlled opening of the capsule, (d) The intra-capsular dynamics of the guest molecules, (e) Possible communication (electron, energy, and spin transfer) between encapsulated guest and free molecules present in water, (f) Selective orientation and conformational pre-organization of the guest within the OA capsule, (g) Influence products distribution through controlling the free space within the capsule. Topics (a) to (g) relate to the understanding of OA as a reaction medium and associated dynamics of the guest@host complex while (h) and (i) deal directly with the PI's primary interest of controlling photoreactions in restricted spaces. The long-range scientific goal is to develop, on the basis of well-established rules of molecular organic photochemistry and supramolecular chemistry, a model to predict the photobehavior of organic molecules in restricted spaces. \r\n\r\n The research proposed by Professor Ramamurthy will help train graduate students on several aspects of modern organic chemistry, physical organic chemistry and photochemistry. In addition to providing excellent training for the students associated with the project, Professor Ramamurthy has long been involved in fostering international collaborations, disseminating scientific information through edited books and guest edited journal special issues (in addition to refereed publications), giving invited talks at national, international conferences and universities and organizing national and international scientific conferences. He also serves the scientific community as a Senior Editor of Langmuir, an ACS journal. The PI has used his expertise in photochemistry to collaborate on writing two textbooks, (1) Principles of Modern Photochemistry: An Introduction and (2) Modern Molecular Organic Photochemistry with N. J. Turro, and J. C. Scaiano. In addition, the PI is currently developing a course titled \"Being a Scientist\" that includes topics such as scientific temper, ethics in science, mentor-student relationship, choosing scientific problems, writing, submitting and reviewing journal articles and grant proposals, developing oral and written communication skills, quality and quantity in scientific research, influence of citation index and impact factor, and the role of a scientist in society.",
