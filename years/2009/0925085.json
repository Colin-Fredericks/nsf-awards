 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives of the proposed research is to develop and demonstrate a design methodology for integrating advanced holographic spectral filtering, concentrating, and light trapping properties in holographic components that increase the efficiency and energy collection properties of thin film photovoltaic systems. Another objective is to realize candidate holograms film layers on flexible substrates that can be laminated with either standard photovoltaic module components or in non-traditional conformal geometries. This approach does not add complexity to the thin film PV cell structure. Instead the hologram is used as a design option to improve the performance of thin film PV cells. \r\nIntellectual Merit consists of advancing the state of non-imaging holographic element design to realize low cost planar concentrators and light trapping techniques. Holographic element design methodologies will be integrated with thin film photovoltaic cell properties to improve thin film PV cell efficiency. \r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed work addresses one of the most important issues of our time ?reducing the cost of renewable solar energy. If successful the proposed work will impact the cost of photovoltaic energy in the near future (5-10 years) when it is most needed to mitigate global warming.\r\nThe realization of low cost PV systems will also allow electrical energy to be available in rural and remote areas not served by a power grid. This will allow lighting, irrigation, and desalination in many underserved communities bringing more opportunity to third world populations. \r\nThe proposed work offers students the opportunity to participate in a range of photovoltaic energy problems. This will provide them with the necessary background to transition to industry or to pursue academic careers in solar energy related fields. \r\n",
