The study employs an innovative research design by bringing state of the art techniques in model building and visualization into design tools that are exceptionally robust but also easy to use by undergraduate students.  The results will be disseminated through professional networks and Purdue's Global Hub.  The goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering through developing tools to enhance understanding of environmental sustainability.  These techniques are expected to increase students' interest in engineering and will enhance the number who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.",
