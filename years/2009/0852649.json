However,\r\nwith the increasing popularity of cryptographic protocols the\r\ntraditional means of inspecting packet contents to enforce security\r\npolicies is no longer a viable approach as message contents are\r\nconcealed by encryption. This project encompasses the first major\r\ncomponent of a principled investigation into the feasibility of\r\nprotocol identification based solely on those features that remain\r\nintact after encryption---namely, the packet size, inter-arrival and\r\ndirection. More specifically, this work attempts to provide a better\r\nunderstanding of the limits of protocol recognition based on a\r\nthorough statistical analysis and information theoretic assessment of\r\nthe available features in protocol behaviors observed in the\r\nwild. Specifically, this project advances the current state of the art\r\nand contributes to the scientific community by building efficient\r\nmixture models for detecting protocols with multi-modal behaviors,\r\ndesigning practical tools for visualizing behavioral motifs in TCP\r\nsequences, providing new information-theoretic decision policies for\r\nassigning protocol class labels to these sequences, and imparting new\r\nnotions for assessing realistic masquerading attacks and the\r\nappropriate defenses.\r\n",
