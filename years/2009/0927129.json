 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this BRIGE award is to enhance the performance of relief distribution networks. To achieve this goal, three research objectives are targeted: 1- Characterize and understand the resources, the rules and the processes that govern the design and operations of relief distribution networks. 2- Explore robust modeling and solution approaches that account for uncertainty in the problem of prepositioning emergency supplies. 3- Investigate the use of dynamic-stochastic optimization for an effective real-time distribution of emergency supplies. A key element in tackling the prepositioning problem is to account for uncertainty while integrating long-term and tactical decisions. This ultimately leads to large scale problems. Thus, a two stage stochastic programming model will be developed. Then, a scenario-based approach that combines a meta-heuristic based on tabu search will be developed. For the real-time distribution problem, a rolling-time horizon approach that integrates neighborhood search procedures and fast on-line strategies will be adopted.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will contribute to the improvement of both pre-disaster preparedness and post-disaster responsiveness. This will help save lives and mitigate population suffering in case of disasters. The proposed modeling and solution approaches can also be used to tackle other dynamic disruption-prone systems such as the deployment of troops and equipment in a battlefield or commercial disruption-prone supply chains. The award will also broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. Minority undergraduate STEM students will be introduced to research in decision sciences and system engineering. In addition, seminars will be organized to promote the interaction of students with positive role-models. Finally, outreach activities will be conducted to encourage middle and high school students to pursue higher education in the fields of system engineering and decision sciences. \r\n",
