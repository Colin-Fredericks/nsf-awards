 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe project is targeting an opportunity to build on the very recent development of a qualitatively new approach to the problem of three body recombination at thermal energies. Special attention will be made to develop theoretical and computational techniques to study and control elementary processes taking place during combustion of coal and, in a longer time frame, simple hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nThree body collisions play an important role in processes occurring at thermal and ultracold temperatures. New robust theoretical and numerical techniques for calculation of rate coefficients for three body collisions at thermal energies will be developed and applied to several processes important for fundamental science (primordial three body recombination of hydrogen) and applied science (coal combustion). This project will primarily deal with three body collisions of neutral atoms at thermal and low energies (chemical reactions). However, a further development for charged particles is envisaged at a later stage. Principal points of the present project are the following: \r\n\r\n(1) Development of techniques for determination of three body rate coefficients at thermal energies. The main effort will be made on the reaction of three body recombination, A+B+C > AB(v,j)+C. The idea is to develop exact (mostly numerical) and theoretical (with minimum numerical calculations) techniques and test them on relatively simple systems. \r\n\r\n(2) Methods: (a) Numerical solution of the three body Schr\u00f6dinger equation, using hyperspherical coordinates with a recently developed efficient technique for  the eigenchannel R matrix with slow variable discretization; (b) A simple theoretical two step model for three body recombination: A+B>AB*, AB*+C > AB (v,j)+C + energy. Another type of coordinates, Eckart coordinates, will be employed to solve the three body Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The Eckart coordinates combine certain advantages of the well established alternatives: hyperspherical and Jacobi coordinates.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nA number of broader impacts should emerge from the successful completion of the research in this project: (1) the cross disciplinary importance of the developed methods  (in physics, chemistry, astrophysics, plasma physics, combustion chemistry, and in the control of combustion); (2) the training of talented graduate students who will have the tools needed to tackle state-of-the-art problems in this subject area.",

This study is important because plasma is widely used in different areas of technology and science (thermonuclear fusion reactors, thin-film deposition, medical applications, industrial air cleaning, atmospheric and space science, and others). We have also studied the process of formation of hydrogen molecule in collisions of three hydrogen atoms. The rate of the process determines the rate at which interstellar atomic clouds form molecular clouds and, eventually, form stars. The solution of this problem would also help to solve one of remaining problems in the Universe evolution: the duration of the so-called Dark Age of the Universe. \n \nEducation\n The educational and research components are closely related to each other because the grant supported a PhD student and (partially) several master students, who have been working on the research problems discussed above and, at the same time, were learning and acquiring experience in research and teaching. For example, an important educational part of the students' activity was the experience with analyzing the obtained results, preparing the results to be presented to the scientific community. This includes presentations at national conferences and publications in the professional literature: 5 of 14 publications supported by this grant are based on the results obtained by the students; the students have co-authored the publications.
