 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop integrated disposable microfluidic systems for fluorescence-based assays for point-of-care diagnostics and point-of-use environmental applications.  The approach will be to combine microfluidic chips with the excitation light and detector using organic light emitters and organic photovoltaics into a single compact and economical medical assay tool. Integrated filtering which is necessary for fluorescence will be done using polarization rather than spectral filtering.  The integrated device will be independent of wavelength and is expected to be used with multiple fluorescent dyes for simultaneous detection.  This will miniaturize and integrate the analysis and sample manipulation capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this work are in the integration of organic photonics and biomedical microfluidics to realize an economical device with integrated microfluidics, organic excitation sources, and organic detectors, for compact, disposable, and quantitative fluorescence based assays.  These systems would replace laboratory-based analysis using fixed, specialized microscopes, by substituting compact, stand-alone devices using inexpensive light emitters and detectors made from small-molecule organics and polymers.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts include the widespread availability of economical quantitative analysis system for detection of low levels of analytes on-site with applications to medical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and homeland defense.  Undergraduate students from under-represented groups will be recruited through our universities Rowe Center for Women and the Emerging Ethnic Engineers program and funded through the REU program.  Material developed will be incorporated into our ongoing course on ?Biosensors and BioMEMS? which focuses on microfluidic sensors and systems for biomedical and environmental applications.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report: Integrated Optical Microfluidic Chips for On-Site Fluorescence-Based Assays\n\n \n\nThere is a compelling technical need to make diagnostic and detection tools portable, flexible, and cost-effective.  Many bio applications use optical fluorescence detection, and approach that relies on fluorophores (organic molecules) which glow in a particular color when exposed to light of a different color (sometimes in response to environmental conditions like oxygen concentration). Typical analysis methods involve putting the sample to be analyzed under a fluorescence microscope and measuring the optical signal of the relevant color.  The disadvantage to this fluorescence analysis is that a microscope and bulk optics are needed, even if the sample being manipulated &ndash; like cells - is microscopic in size. Microfluidics is a new family of technology that allows manipulation of small droplets of fluid, but it has been challenging to integrating optical analysis into microfluidics.  In this project, we demonstrated a robust method to use polarization filtering in microfluidics to integrate fluorescence analysis.\n\nThe original broader intellectual merit envisioned for this proposal was to \"demonstrate an array of devices, capable of testing for concentrations of multiple pathogens.\"  Throughout this project, several practical alternatives to the need for a fluorescence microscope have been demonstrated in many contexts. Prototype system have been demonstrated that put in fluorescence systems into microfluidic, \u00e6deck-of-cards\u00c6 form factor, and lead the way towards complete and integrated microfluidic lab on a chip tests systems.\n\nA general microfluidic microfluorescence system, about the size of a deck of cards, was constructed using polarization filter and organic emitters and detectors.  The system can detect fluorescent dye at concentrations as low as 10-7 M, which is a useful range for many biological  applications.  A similar system detected dyed cancer cell concentrations as low as of 105/mL. \n\nBecause the polarization filtering is color independent, these devices had a capability that existing commercial devices did not have; they could detector more than one color at the same time.  Using modulation techniques, devices were realized that could detect and quantify the concentration of two different dyes at the same time, each to the 10-7M concentration level.  The same technique was used to measure the concentration of O2 and CO2 using fluorescent gas sensitive films as the detector element.  This device could replace slower and less response gas sensors with optical sensing.  In these devices, inexpensive LEDs and Si detectors replaced organic light sources and detectors.\n\nFinally, in an effort to use both spatial and color information, a CMOS camera was integrated with polarization filtering and used to image mixtures of dyed polystyrene particles.  The results indicated that polarization filtering was quite effective with red, green, and blue particles, and one excitation light source (a broadband white LED).  The different particles could be easily identified.  This is just one step below using this system to identify and distinguish between different cell types.  This system, with a cost of less than $5000, could replace commercial devices that determine different cell types (flow cytomoeters) which cost more than $100,000.  We believe this would lead to enhanced availability of powerful new research tools.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Klotzkin"
