 "awd_abstract_narration": "Berest\r\n\r\nThe proposed research lies at the intersection of several areas of\r\nmathematics and mathematical physics, including geometric analysis,\r\nrepresentation theory, noncommutative algebra and algebraic geometry.\r\nIt is motivated by old (yet unsolved) problems in the theory of partial\r\ndifferential equations. One such problem (known as the problem of lacunas)\r\ndeals with propagation of waves without diffusion, another with heat\r\nkernels on Riemannian manifolds with finite asymptotics. Despite being\r\nanalytic by their nature, these problems exhibit a remarkable feature:\r\nthey have algebraic solutions. The earlier work of the PI and his\r\ncollaborators links these classical problems of analysis to various\r\nquestions of algebraic geometry and noncommutative algebra, concerning\r\nrings of differential operators on algebraic varieties and their specific\r\nrepresentations (projective D-modules). One of the primary goals of this\r\nproposal is to systematically study the properties of such modules, their\r\nendomorphism rings and moduli spaces. The results obtained so far (mostly\r\nin the case of curves) reveal many interesting connections with \r\nnoncommutative geometry, representation theory, combinatorics and \r\nintegrable systems. Another goal of the proposal is thus to investigate \r\nsome of these connections. In a different direction, the PI intends to \r\ndevelop a new method for computing asymptotics of heat kernels based on\r\nideas of homotopical algebra.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical problems addressed in this project arise from the practical\r\nquestion: what happens when a short signal (light or sound, say) is omitted\r\nfrom a point A, travels through a medium and arrives at point B? There are\r\nmany possibilities: there could be focusing, diffraction, persistence of faint\r\nechoes, or still a short `clean-cut' signal at B. This last possibility is of\r\nparticular interest, but it may occur only under very special conditions.\r\nTo describe these conditions in precise mathematical terms is one of the goals\r\nof the proposal. The results sought in this direction are fundamental for our\r\nunderstanding of wave phenomena and may have applications in related physical\r\nsciences, including the theory of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, space \r\ncommunication technologies, magneto-hydrodynamics, crystal optics, etc. As \r\na broader impact, the PI expects that the interdisciplinary nature of this \r\nwork will stimulate communication and collaboration between experts in the \r\nvarious areas involved.\r\n",
