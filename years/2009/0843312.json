 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific Merit:\r\n\r\nSphingolipids are essential components of the outer membrane of plant cells where they contribute to the ability of plants to respond to environmental extremes. Sphingolipids also play important roles in the regulation of basic processes in plant cells, including the initiation of cell death in response to pathogens. Sphingolipids occur in plants as complex mixtures of different chemical structures. The specific contributions of different sphingolipids to the growth and physiology of plants is not well understood. This question will be addressed in this project by the generation of mutants of the model plants Arabidopsis and tomato with defined alterations in sphingolipid structures. These mutants will be characterized by advanced analytical methods to determine the impact on global sphingolipid metabolism. Studies will also be conducted with Arabidopsis and tomato mutants to examine how altered sphingolipid composition affects growth in response to environmental stresses, including drought and high soil salinity. In addition to generating fundamental new knowledge on sphingolipid metabolism and function in plants, the results will provide information that could lead to improving the performance and productivity of crop plants through breeding and biotechnology.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe project will offer educational opportunities and outreach to high school and undergraduate students. The PI and co-PI will participate in the Partnership in Research and Education in Plants, a program that engages high school students in the scientific process by allowing them to devise experiments using mutants of the model plant Arabidopsis.  The PI and co-PI will meet with participating students at a Saint Louis, Missouri-area high school and describe the important functions of cellular membranes as well as sphingolipids in human health and plant growth.  The students will be provided with seeds for Arabidopsis mutants that they will use for experiments to test hypotheses regarding growth and environmental stress responses. The students will maintain interactions with the PI and co-PI through an online laboratory notebook. The project is also designed to provide research opportunities to undergraduates through the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experiences (UCARE) program, a two-year program that allows students to conduct literature research and develop an independent research project. Through participation in UCARE, the PI will recruit and mentor an undergraduate student examining the effects of altered sphingolipid composition on growth and physiology of tomato and Arabidopsis.",
