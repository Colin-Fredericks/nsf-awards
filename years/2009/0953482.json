 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF funds are requested in support of the 9th International Seminar on EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES AND DESIGN IN COMPOSITE MATERIALS. This seminar will focus on composite materials, both with polymeric and metallic matrix. The main topics are:\r\n- Experimental techniques\r\n- Damage mechanics and characterization\r\n- Fatigue and fracture\r\n- Impact and crashworthiness\r\n- Mathematical and numerical modelling\r\n- Nanocomposites\r\n- Processing and properties\r\n- Structural design and optimisation\r\nAlthough the general aspects of composites will be discussed, particular emphasis will be given to the integration among testing, design and manufacturing for the definition of reliable design procedures. The area of nanocomposites will receive a special attention. \r\n\r\nThe seminar, covering the topics mentioned above, aims to represent a forum for researchers, scientist, engineers and designers, both of academic and industrial field, for exchanging ideas, proposing new solutions or even to put on the table questions still open about the development of reliable tools for an effective and safe design of composite components. Moreover the development of design procedures, the integration between testing, design and process are among the subjects expected to be discussed during the seminar.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity is that it will represent a forum for researchers, scientist, engineers and designers, both of academic and industrial field, for exchanging ideas, proposing new solutions or even to put on the table questions still open about the development of reliable tools for an effective and safe design of composite components.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity will include the development of design procedures, the integration between testing, design and process are among the subjects expected to be discussed during the seminar.\r\n",
