The sponsors along with five presenters will participate in the 13th IACIS and 83rd ACS Colloid and Surface Science Conference in New York.  The two meetings will be held jointly on the campus of Columbia University during the week of June 14-19, 2009.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Many of the topics impact on nanotechnology in the 1414 program; the topics are: (1) Interfaces and Interphases: Thermodynamics, Structures and Adsorption including:  (2) Particulate Systems including: Rheology and Soft Matter Physics (3) Surface Active Agents.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The annual conference has been held over the past several years at university campus locations rotated throughout the United States.  The joint hosting of the meetings presents a unique opportunity to draw from a large group of researchers globally, thereby insuring a forum in which a very diverse set of ideas will be presented.  Attendance at the conference insures cross fertilization of research ideas potentially leading to greater advances in the fields.\r\n\r\nThe PI is requesting foreign travel money to provide international travel for four conference presenters to travel from Norway, Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom to New York City.",
