 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2009 Society for In Vitro Biology (SIVB) meeting provides a venue for scientific exchange, education and discussion on important topics related to the understanding and use of developmental processes of crop plants.  The meeting will be held in Charleston, South Carolina, June 6 - 10, 2009.  Topics to be discussed will provide the most up-to-date underpinnings for basic investigations into plant biology, and include applied aspects of genomics and metabolomics, as well as the effect of gene expression, biochemistry and physiology on plant developmental biology. These state-of-the-art fundamental biology sessions exchange the information needed in the future for the applied application of the science, a format for which the SIVB has established a recognized niche. All the topics discussed have both national and global impacts.  Funding provided by NSF will be used to broaden participation of students, early career individuals, women, and those from underrepresented groups from the US scientific community.  Conference program and abstracts will be publicly available online on the conference website and through a program book of abstracts that will be distributed to meeting attendees and published in the In Vitro Animal and Plant Journals.  \r\n",
