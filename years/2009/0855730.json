 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is based on the premise that many of today's youth and young adults do not recognize the opportunities and rewards of a career in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM), have never met a STEM professional, and have no idea what kind of work one does.  In addition, some students who are interested in STEM believe that they should not pursue a STEM degree because of their gender, ethnic background, educational environment, or stage of life. Finally, some undergraduate STEM majors may fail to complete a STEM degree due to insufficient knowledge about effective study habits or a lack of resources to support them throughout their student years. \r\n\r\nThis STEP project is creating and supporting a retention and recruitment program to counter all of these barriers.  The program is built on and integrated with existing successful undergraduate recruiting and retention programs at the university. New retention efforts include the creation of student groups focusing on activities in their major (e.g. Seminars for Undergraduate Research Experiences, SURE), undergraduate research opportunities, and a new freshmen project course. The recruiting programs include STEP Forward (a summer day camp for 11th and 12th graders, Women in Engineering (WIE-UH), a support system for entering female STEM students, a set of seminars for present and future high school math and science teachers, and a freshman level undergraduate research opportunity. These efforts are designed to both enhance the quality of the undergraduate experience for all students and to attract new and typically under-represented students into the STEM fields. \r\n\r\nBroadening participation in STEM majors is a major goal of this project. The University of Houston is already one of the most diverse urban research institutions in the nation. Project efforts are continuing, however, to recruit more students from underrepresented groups into STEM areas, particularly those who will be the first generation in college for their families. A dominant theme of the project's strategies is the creation of various research experiences. The WIE-UH program includes presentations by female faculty members to describe their research efforts. The principal goal of the seminars for the high school teachers is to acquaint the teachers with the broad range of STEM research being conducted at the University. The SURE program allows a larger number of undergraduates to learn about the discovery based programs in their major field, while the two undergraduate research programs give a smaller number of them the opportunity for one-on-one mentored research experiences with our faculty.",

Many of the participants have later enrolled at the University of Houston and have received special industrial sponsored scholarships that are reserved for former STEP Forward campers.    Former campers are encouraged to serve as counselors in the STEP Forward Camp after their freshman year of studies.\n\nTwo Project Based Learning courses have been developed for the freshmen engineering students, exposing students to a number of group projects throughout the first year of studies.  Each class has undergraduate teaching assistants assigned as peer mentors who are undergraduates who have recently completed the class themselves. They take an active part in developing and improving the course and are highly motivated in helping new students. This arrangement is highly beneficial for both students and mentors alike. These freshmen begin to understand real engineering work very early in the curriculum.  As a result of the success of the first two freshmen courses, we now have a common first year for all FTIC engineering students in which we serve approximately 1100 students each semester.\n\n \n\nThe Women in Engineering (WIE) Program was successfully established in 2010 and a number of activities have followed.  These include a luncheon with STEM women faculty members, a Habitat for Humanity build, and a mentoring program with female engineers working in local industry. This program has now been integrated with the Society of Women Engineers chapter.  Student leaders and faculty now support joint WIE-SWE activities that leverage the existing organizational framework of SWE but add components that are beyond the scope of the student organization, making both organizations more impactful.  \n\n \nOur efforts in the support of undergraduate research were also most rewarding.  Most of those supported students have now graduated with STEM degrees and essentially all have enrolled in graduate programs in STEM areas.  The few that remain are continuing as undergraduates in their STEM majors and making progress toward their degrees.  In addition two of these students were named Goldwater Scholars, two were Hertz Fellowship Finalists, one was a Marshall Scholarship finalist, and two received recognition as Outstanding Poster Award Winners at the annual UH Undergraduate Research Day.  In all, an outstanding group of students have been supported in this program with essentially a perfect graduation and retention record.\nThe programs sponsored by the grant have benefited a very diverse set of students.  The demographics for each of the sets of participants are given below.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDemographics\n\n\n\nAfrican-American\n\n\n\nHispanic\n\n\n\nWhite\n\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\nPBL classes\n\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n31%\n\n\n\n29%\n\n\n\n21%\n\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP Forward Camp\n\n\n\n16%\n\n\n\n35%\n\n\n\n37%\n\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergrad Research\n\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n35%\n\n\n\n41%\n\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity STEM\n\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\n30%\n\n\n\n26%\n\n\n\n26%\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Undergraduate Participants by Ethnicity\n\n \n\nThe goals of the NSF STEP program at the University of Houston have all been accomplished, and many of the programs continue through support by the University and by industry.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/24/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stuart A Long"
