 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central component of this project is a face to face meeting between the National Science Foundation (NSF) Program Directors and key personnel from each of the Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs).  This event is an important step toward designing and implementing better strategies to achieve the common goal of improving STEM opportunities for all Americans.  \r\n\r\nThe educational needs on Indian reservations pose unique challenges.  It is important for the TCUs, as the experts in the field, to frame the problem and articulate solutions to these challenges.  By engaging the National Science Foundation at an earlier, deeper level, a positive impact on the design of programs targeting STEM education on the reservations can occur.  As a mutual effort, it is important that the aspirations, resources, and limitations of all the participants are understood by both NSF and the TCUs.  This meeting would further the development of active partnership on a broader scale than previously attempted.   \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nOne of the outcomes of the meeting will be the identification of the needs, resources, and aspirations of the TCUs in their efforts to improve STEM education.  Additionally, it will be important to identify the needs of the communities served by the tribal colleges, allowing the TCUs to design sustainable programs that address these needs.  NSF will gain valuable insights on what type of programs and resources are needed to ensure successful implementation.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe BIO Directorate at the National Science Foundation is an ideal partner for this project.  Every tribal college has academic programs which target STEM careers needed by the tribal communities.  Furthermore, this conference will serve as a future model for other directorates and federal agencies.  The selection of the TCU participants will be determined by the individual tribal college presidents.  The event organizers will suggest the inclusion of both STEM faculty and sponsored program officers to broaden the conversations at the meeting itself, and at the TCUs afterwards.\r\n\r\n",
