 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Prof. Michael R. Carrasco and colleague Thorsteinn Adalsteinsson from Santa Clara University will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposed instrumentation will be used in a variety of applications including:  1) Synthesis and characterization of single-walled carbon nanotube-embedded mesoporous silicates, 2) Study of polymer encapsulated sub-micron oil droplets, 3) Identification of foldamers that mimic proteins, 4) Synthesis and characterization of backbone-modified DNA analogs via click chemistry, 5) Chemoselective glycosylation of peptides to confer protection from proteolysis, 6) Identification of the ligand-binding properties of porphyrin assemblies, 7) Characterization of protein-nanoparticle interactions, and 8) Morphological characterization of polymer photovoltaics to understand how aging and oxidation lead to diminished cell lifetimes.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential for chemists who are carrying out research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in materials research, organic chemistry and biochemistry.  Undergraduate students will receive training in research and in laboratory courses preparing them for post-baccalaureate work and for careers in science and technology, and in education.",
