The success of this mission requires new advances in nano-electro-mechanical devices, from fundamental building blocks to enabling technologies to full device integration.  The research approach combines five major thrusts that strive to push the limits of utilizing nanotechnology in Energy, Sensing, Mobility, Electronics, and Communication. Each of these areas encompasses research projects spanning the full spectrum of basic through applied levels.  Deliverables include key advances in each research area as well as new approaches for integrating these advances together into a single, mobile sensing platform.  An example includes the recent construction of a fully self-contained radio system with integral single-atom mass detection capability built out of a single carbon nanotube.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the program will lead to enhancements in environmental monitoring technologies that open new possibilities for detection via substantially better spatial and temporal resolution, for example the tracking of air- and water-borne pollutants and a better understanding of the impact of source emissions on ambient concentrations and human exposure.  The mobile platform has the potential to fundamentally change the way one responds to proliferation events or serious natural catastrophic events by providing much more accurate information on conditions, allowing for improved countermeasures and security.  The research components of this program are highly leveraged to prepare, recruit, and retain the nanoscale science and engineering workforce; to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and women in nanoscale science and engineering in both industry and academia; and to increase the general public?s awareness and understanding of nanoscale science and engineering.\r\n",
