 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the investigator focuses on linear representations of\r\nGaussian random fields. He considers models that either avoid explicit\r\ncomputation of the covariance matrix or do so for relatively small\r\ndimensions. The correlation functions of the considered processes are\r\nvery general, avoiding particular symmetries or stationarity. The PI\r\nconsiders models that work in domains of general dimension and, in\r\nparticular, on the sphere, for gridded and non-gridded data. The PI uses\r\nhierarchical methods of inference to account for measurement errors and\r\ndifferent sources of information. He develops statistically rigorous\r\nprocedures to summarize the information of dynamically evolving random\r\nfields in a reduced number of time series and designs fast Monte Carlo\r\nmethods that take advantage of parallel architectures.\r\n\r\nThe investigator studies statistical models for spatial and\r\nspatio-temporal processes observed at a large number of locations and\r\ntime steps. The PI's research addresses the need for increasingly\r\nsophisticated models that can deal with different sources of\r\ninformation, include expert opinion and handle effectively several\r\nsources of uncertainty. While operating on large datasets, the PI's\r\nmodels consider time evolving dynamics and spatial heterogeneity.\r\nThis allows for the analysis of phenomena on global scales, making good\r\nuse of state of the art inferential and computational methods. An\r\nexample of a problem where unified inferences from a variety of data\r\nsources is needed is the prediction of future climate from different\r\nclimate models. Climate change prediction currently has a large societal\r\nimpact. This research provides tools to enhance our quantitative\r\nunderstanding of the uncertainties  involved in such predictions. This\r\nwill improve the ability of decision makers to make quality policy\r\ndecisions.",
