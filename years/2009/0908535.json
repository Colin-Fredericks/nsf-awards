 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project covers three areas related to multiply scattered waves: coherence propagation, focusing, and imaging in cluttered media. Firstly, a comprehensive and rigorous framework is formulated to analyze the space-frequency coherence properties of waves in random media. Secondly, the multiply scattered evanescent waves will be taken into account to enhance the wave focusing in cluttered media. Thirdly, imaging methods based on the compressed sensing techniques will be developed to achieve stable, accurate imaging of multiple targets in clutter with nearly minimal sensing resources. \r\n\r\nMultiple scattering is a basic phenomenon in wave physics. It affects how signals and information are transferred in clutter prevalent in both natural and urban environments. In addition to fundamental research in wave physics, the main applications of the project are in remote sensing and near-field imaging. In particular, the project on detecting intruders hidden in clutter is important for homeland security and tissue imaging. The project on imaging in the background of rough surfaces will have impacts on aerial sensing of natural resources and targets in the terrestrial environment, as well as design of nanophotonic sensors for detecting biological and chemical agents. \r\n",
