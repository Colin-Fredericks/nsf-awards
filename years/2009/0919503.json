Both are operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  Ships to be supported include R/V Walton Smith (RSMAS) and R/V Seward Johnson (HBOI).  As part of their basic operations they will provide one (Smith) or two (SJ) technicians on each seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.",
