 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with formal modeling of risk  analysis as it relates to the security of systems. Risk analysis  in the literature has focused on offline computations in conjunction  with a manual response. We propose a real-time approach to  risk management by dynamically trading utility for security. A  consequence of our approach is that it provides users with the  maximum possible functionality for any predefined level of  risk tolerance.\r\n  We model risk management through flow adjustment in a  tripartite graphs, with the partitions corresponding to threats,  permissions and assets in the system. The focus is on  establishing the complexities for the various flow queries in  this setting. We have already established that some of the  problems in this setting are weakly NP-complete and this  raises the possibility of designing polynomial approximation  schemes for them.\r\n",
