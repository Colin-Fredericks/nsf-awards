 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for a MARGINS synthesis workshop to be held Pril 2009 in Gisborne, New Zealand. MARGINS Source-to-Sink (S2S) initiative research at Papua New Guinea and Waipaoa focus sites has reached a stage where integration of results from the two S2S sites is now possible. Holding the workshop in NZ will allow full participations of the international partners that has been and is crucial for the success of the program. The meeting will allow integration of the results, identification of remaining gaps and ideas for future work, coordination with international partners for any future work and preparation of a summary paper. Participation of 59 scientists (about half from US and the rest international) is expected.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include close collaboration with international partners (New Zealand, Australia and PNG). Meeting at the mouth of Waipaoa River (S2S focus site) will allow greater outreach efforts including local scientist and native Maori populace. Involvement of graduate students and researchers not previously funded by MARGINS is also planned. Publication of a synthesis paper/volume would spur future research in this area.\r\n",
