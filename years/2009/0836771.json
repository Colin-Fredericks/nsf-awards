 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \r\n\r\nHood College proposes to incorporate liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) instrumentation into its chemistry and biochemistry curriculum.  LC/MS is an instrument that allows scientists to make discoveries in the fields of biology, biochemistry, polymer science, and chemistry.  The importance of the development of the instrument and its continued impact on science was recognized in 2002 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  The implementation of LC/MS instrumentation in their research laboratories and in classes enrolling majors and non-majors (~300 students per year) has a significant influence on the education of their predominantly (70%) female population.  Hands-on experience with LC/MS strengthen the preparation of Hood students for employment opportunities and graduate and professional programs as well as provide valuable research results to the broader scientific community.\r\n\r\nHood's commitment to effective teaching and undergraduate research in collaborative, active environments are greatly impacted by the LC/MS instrument.  By using the LC/MS from their freshman year to their senior year students gain valuable experience with this modern instrument in a variety of applications across the disciplines of biology, chemistry, and biochemistry.  Research students apply their knowledge of LC/MS to a range of interdisciplinary research topics including the study of proteins, marine organisms, and biofuels.  The progress and results of this project plan to be disseminated through presentations at regional and national conferences, as well as through professional journals.",
