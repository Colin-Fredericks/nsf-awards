 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled \"The Cephalopod Cornea as a Model of Convergent Evolution\" for Annie Lindgren. The host institution for this research is the University of California - Santa Barbara and the sponsoring scientist is Todd H. Oakley.\r\n\r\nOne leading edge issue in evolutionary biology is how similar structures arise in different species.  Either they are independently evolved (convergent) or arise through common ancestry (homologous).   The cornea, an eye component, has evolved at least twice in cephalopods, once in squids and once in octopods.  To determine how the cornea evolved multiple times in cephalopods, this research uses 1) a phylogenetic approach to resolve relationships among cephalopod species and to test for the possibility of homology, and 2) next-generation sequencing techniques to identify the underlying genes involved.   In addition, this research focuses on the development of novel computer programs that will help integrate the data into the phylogeny, with the end goal of improving our understanding of cephalopod evolution.\r\n\r\nTraining goals for this project include expanding skills in phylogenetic theory, program development of model-based analytical methods, character coding and molecular evolution.  To further collaboration and education, data will be made available online and students will be involved in various aspects of this project. This research paradigm integrates invertebrate biology, evolution, and development to provide a new approach to understanding the molecular basis for character evolution and generate novel methods and computer programs for analyzing large data sets useful to a broad group of scientists.",
