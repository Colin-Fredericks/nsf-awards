 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a multi-institutional collaboration in which we plan to investigate a new soft-logic approach for creating ?designer gene? circuits. Genetic circuits are crafted in the laboratory using genomic building blocks, and are used to control specific behaviors in engineered bacteria. A major research challenge for genetic circuits is that there is a high level of randomness in the cell?s internal environment. Belief networks provide a well-defined solution for handling the effects of randomness in genetic systems. We propose to study how belief networks can be applied to control and even exploit randomness to achieve new and useful genetic behaviors. Our research results will be used to improve a software application for genetic design called iBioSim.\r\n\r\nThere are many anticipated benefits for synthetic genetic circuits, including industrial, environmental, and medical applications. For example, bacteria can theoretically be engineered to clean oil spills, kill tumors, and deliver medicines, but only if we can precisely control when and how the bacteria perform their functions. Our investigation will illuminate the unique challenges involved in controlling highly random bacterial systems and will provide the community with rigorous theory and practicable techniques that resolve these challenges. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The team won a gold medal for their efforts.\n\n \nWe also discovered some ways to improve traditional electronic design by borrowing ideas from genetic circuits, which will aid in producing devices that last longer and operate more reliably in harsh environments. Our new method, called \"restorative feedback\" is based on a natural bacterial signalling mechanism known as \"quorum sensing,\" in which a population of cells exchange signals to help coordinate their behavior. Restorative feedback uses an electronic version of this process to suppress the occurrence of random logic errors in a computing circuit. A harsh environment may include high-temperature or high-radiation scenarios, which occur in many industrial and scientific settings ranging from mining operations to space exploration. \n\n \nBroader Impacts: The chief impact of our work is the development and free distribution of the iBioSim software, which is being used by researchers to advance the possibilities of synthetic biology. There are numerous potential applications for synthetic biology, including medical treatments, pharmaceutical manufacturing, production of biofuels and bioplastics, among others. Our work provides new tools to accelerate the progress of research in this young field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chris J Winstead"
