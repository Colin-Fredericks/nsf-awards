 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe State University of New York-Cortland is providing Noyce scholarships, 32 to undergraduates majoring in science, technology or mathematics and 18 to (science, technology, engineering or mathematics) STEM career changers seeking graduate degrees to prepare them to teach. This will result in 50 new science or mathematics secondary teachers, well prepared in both subject matter and teaching approaches, to serve in high needs school districts in central New York State and the five major city areas of the state, including New York City.  Cooperating school districts include: Cinncinnatus Central School District, The Cortland City School District, Dryden Central School District, Homer Central School District, Marathon Central School District, and South Seneca Central School District, and the New York City Department of Education. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The intellectual merit of the project resides in the rigorous course of study required of the Scholars; one that involves a course of study akin to a major in a specific STEM discipline and that includes strong preparation in and experience with teaching in inner city and other needy schools.  To prepare them to work in these high needs schools the Noyce Scholars are being enrolled in a comprehensive program in urban education and are being offered specialized course work and field experiences in these schools.  During at least the first two years of their teaching career (early induction years) they will receive specialized mentoring through both electronic and in-person means.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  In addition to the positive effect the Scholars will have on the schools and students with whom they interact, the project is designed to help the teachers it prepares become leaders in STEM education.  In addition to their scholarships the Scholars are receiving funds to cover membership in appropriate professional societies and to attend regional and national meetings of these societies so they become members of and contribute to the national STEM education community. The project is also preparing to create a Robert Noyce Facebook group to enable Noyce Scholars from across the whole community of Robert Noyce Scholarship projects post materials and ideas and exchange information on meeting common challenges.\r\n\r\n",
