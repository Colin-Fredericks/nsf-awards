 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nFifty annual scholarships of $10,000 each are being distributed among thirty six individuals.  Twenty four students are receiving one-year scholarships, ten students, two-year scholarships and two are receiving three-year scholarships.  Each scholar also receives a laptop computer for use during his/her undergraduate years and on into the induction to teaching period.  The scholarships support those who are in the process or have completed a bachelor's degree in biology or biochemistry and agree to enroll in the secondary credential program leading to a teaching credential with authorization to teach both high school biology and chemistry.  The last year of the five year program focuses on the credentialing requirements.\r\n\r\nPartners in the project are Anaheim Union High School District, Mount San Antonio College (a two-year community college) and the University of California at Los Angeles.  The project is serving as a model for a fifth year program emphasizing content and pedagogical content knowledge.  The initial requirement of financial need was changed to merit based criterion for the award of a scholarship.\r\n",
