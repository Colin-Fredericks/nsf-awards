 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electron density in the magnetosphere crucially affects a number of time-dependent phenomena such as the growth and propagation of whistler waves, chorus waves, and hiss. Chorus waves are thought to accelerate radiation belt electrons. The electron density can serve as a rough proxy for mass density, which affects the growth and propagation of ULF waves and the propagation of shock waves through the magnetosphere. Both of these phenomena can also accelerate radiation belt electrons, or cause their loss through pitch angle scattering.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop empirical models of the electron density in the magnetosphere.  It will used data from a variety of satellite missions (IMAGE, POLAR, ISEE-1, CRRES).  It will examine the field-line dependence of density by combining data from IMAGE and Polar.  The project will develop models based on solar wind parameters.  It will also examine how the electron density varies during magnetic storms.",
