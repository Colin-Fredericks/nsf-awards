 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oxide and Metal Nanoparticles: The Interface between Life Sciences and Physical Sciences \r\n\r\nThe University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) studies interfacial relationships between nanomaterials and the life sciences through its Partnership for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) with the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Northwestern University (NU) and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA).  The PREM creates a permanent relationship between these institutions to broaden and foster collaborative research and education in materials science. The research entails three principal components: 1) collaborative research in nanomaterials and their applications in various fields, 2) education and training for undergraduate and graduate students, especially, women and other underrepresented minority students, and 3) outreach program for K-12 students and teachers.\r\n\r\nThe research participants are focused in six thrust areas: 1) Rare Earth-based Dual Purpose Biosensor, 2) Medical Applications of Nanoparticles, 3) Novel Nanomaterials and their Applications in Biology, 4) Using Metal Nanoparticles in Neuroscience, 5) Terahertz Characterization of Nanomaterials for Biological Imaging Applications, and 6) Functionalization of Fibers Employing Low Temperature Pulsed Laser Deposition and Atomic Layer Deposition. This PREM establishes a unique and highly cohesive team enabled to investigate fundamental science questions in these specific thrust areas.   The NU-MRSEC plays a critical role in establishing and guiding the PREM program at UTSA, as the NU Materials Research laboratories provide infrastructure and support staff currently not available to UTSA undergraduate and graduate students engaged in these types of research areas.",
