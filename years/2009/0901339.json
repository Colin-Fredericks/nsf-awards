 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is dedicated to the study of prime chains and applications,\r\nthe distribution of integers in progressions which are the \r\nproduct of two primes, divisors of integers and of shifted primes,\r\ngeneralized Wieferich primes, and the efficiency of covering congruences.  \r\nPrime chains are sequences of primes \r\nso that p|(p'-1) for each pair of consecutive primes p, p' in the sequence, e.g.\r\n2,5,31.  We study the distribution of prime chains with a given starting\r\nprime, given ending prime, and chains with a given length.    Applications \r\nare given to the height of Pratt trees, and to the distribution of arithmetic\r\nfunctions.  One of the highlights of the work is the development of a \r\nmodel of prime chains with a given ending prime which is\r\nbased on a probabilistic random fragmentation process.  It is known\r\nthat there are subtle inequities in the distribution of primes in \r\narithmetic progressions with the same modulus, and we develop a parallel\r\ntheory for number which are products of two primes, emphasizing the \r\nsimilarities and differences compared with the primes case.\r\nSuch problems are intimately connected with the distribution of zeros\r\nof Dirichlet L-functions, the multiplicity of zeros being important in\r\nour studies.  We will investigate factorization problems, such as \r\nthe distribution of primes p so that p-1 has a divisor in a given interval,\r\nand the distribution of factors when integers are written as the\r\nproduct of k factors, for general k.  We will improve known\r\nestimates for the smallest positive integer b such that\r\np is a generalized Wieferich prime to base b.   A set of congruence\r\nclasses whose union is all the integers is a covering system of \r\ncongruences.  The sum S of the reciprocals of the moduli must be at least 1,\r\nand we study how close S can be to 1 if the moduli are distinct and\r\ngreater than N.\r\n\r\nQuestions about properties of positive integers, especially the way in\r\nwhich integers factor and the distribution of prime numbers, have \r\nfascinated people for thousands of years and have recently found\r\napplications in computer science and information security.\r\nThis proposal is concerned with a number of projects about\r\nconfigurations of prime numbers, how number that are products of few \r\nprimes are distributed in arithmetic progressions, the distribution of\r\ndivisors of integers, and how efficient covering systems of congruences\r\ncan be.  The research projects will involve graduate assistants and\r\npost-docs.  \r\n",
