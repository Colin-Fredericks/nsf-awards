 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is a request for funds to support the biennial MMDS\r\nmeetings on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets.  The goals\r\nof these meetings are: (1) to explore novel techniques for\r\nmodeling and analyzing massive, high-dimensional, and\r\nnonlinearly-structured scientific and internet data sets; and\r\n(2) to bring together computer scientists, statisticians,\r\nmathematicians, and data analysis practitioners to promote\r\ncross-fertilization of ideas.  The meetings will occur in the\r\nwake of two related meetings in 2006 and 2008 that addressed\r\nsimilar topics.  Both MMDS 2006 and MMDS 2008 were an enormous\r\ninterdisciplinary success, and they clearly highlighted the\r\nneed for a regular meeting forum to bring together junior and\r\nsenior researchers from a range of backgrounds to address the\r\nchallenging foundational problems that will be faced in upcoming\r\nyears as increasingly large and complex data sets are generated\r\nin a wide range of application domains.  The proposed meetings\r\nwill capitalize on these past successes and extend the MMDS\r\nseries into a more regular series of meetings to address\r\nalgorithmic, statistical, and computational aspects of modern\r\nmassive data set analysis.\r\n\r\nThe topics covered by MMDS address fundamental algorithmic\r\nquestions underlying much of the recent work in large-scale data\r\nanalysis.  In addition, topics of interest at MMDS include data\r\nproblems ranging from better search and ranking at internet\r\nsites to improved methods for extracting structure in genetics\r\napplications to analyzing biomedical images for improved disease\r\ndetection.  Progress on these fronts will be fueled by junior\r\nresearchers as well as researchers from a wide range of\r\napplication areas.  Thus, every effort was be made to include\r\njunior researchers, including women and minorities, at past\r\nmeetings and to disseminate the information presented at the\r\nmeetings to people who were not able to attend.  This will be\r\ncontinued at future meetings.  For more information, please see\r\nthe meeting webpage: http://mmds.stanford.edu/",
