 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  The project objective is to develop proton conducting ceramic membranes with enhanced transport properties for use in hydrogen membrane fuel cells.  The proposed synthesis method involves chemically growing ceramic crystals onto palladium substrates covered with nanometer-scale seed crystals.  The crystal growth is controlled by additives that strongly adsorb on specific facets of the crystals.  Facets of the crystals that are covered with adsorbed additives grow slower than other facets.  Therefore, the crystal size and shape can be controlled.  A novel muti-step crystal growth process is proposed to create a very thin and dense ceramic membranes in which crystal domains are aligned and oriented to promote proton transport through the membrane.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the project will enable the creation ceramic membranes with improved performance at temperatures lower than required for state of the art ceramic membranes currently used in fuel cells.   Lower temperature operation could potentially significantly lower fuel cell cost and increase device lifetime.  In addition, by integrating the hydrogen membrane into the fuel cell, the device may operate directly on hydrogen in gas mixtures produced by reforming renewable fuels such as ethanol, rather than solely on pure hydrogen.  The novel synthesis approach may be applied to other classes of ion conducting ceramics to improve performance in sensors, gas purification membranes, and fuel cells.  Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will benefit through involvement in the research project and through summer internships.  Undergraduate summer interns will be recruited through the University of Rochester Virtual Institute of Energy and the Rochester Eisenberg Fellowship program.  High school summer interns will be recruited through the Pittsford school district career internship program.\r\n",
