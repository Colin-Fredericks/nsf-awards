 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nectriaceae (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) includes some of the most conspicuous and ubiquitous microfungi in natural ecosystems. These fungi are common in soils, decaying plant material, insects, and other fungi. While most species are saprobes, others are pathogenic on plants and insects or endophytes living in the leaves and trunks of living trees. This study will define the taxonomy of three major genera: Nectria, Cosmospora, and Neonectria. These genera are significant because they include several species that are widespread plant pathogens and potential biological control agents. Even though these genera are ubiquitous and diverse in natural and agricultural ecosystems, none of them have received modern monographic treatment. \r\n\r\nThis project will also increase the participation of minorities in biological sciences and advance graduate research at Howard University. In addition, this project will increase the available germplasm of fungi as cultures deposited in public institutions; increase biodiversity data available through digital databases; produce web-based identification keys for those using these fungi as indicators of tropical forest disturbance and working to control the diseases caused by these fungi; deposit into GenBank diagnostic DNA sequences of reliably identified fungi; and provide the basis for studies on the population biology of species of interest to plant pathologists.\r\n",
