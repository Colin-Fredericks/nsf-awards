 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Second Midwest Statistics Research Colloquium will be held at the University of Chicago March 27 and 28, 2009.  The conference will consist of four sessions of two talks each and an evening poster session.  Speakers who have already accepted invitations are Peter McCullagh, Beth Andrews, Charles Geyer, Keith Worsley and Ed Ionides.  Funds from NSF will be used to defray the travel costs of speakers and of graduate students and other new researchers.  It is our intention that the Midwest Statistics Research Colloquium becomes an annual event serving to disseminate the best research being done in the region and to support intellectual exchanges in the community.\r\n\r\nThe Midwest possesses a large number of strong statistics departments.  To encourage interactions between these departments and the broader statistical research community in the region, a number of these departments sponsored the First Midwest Statistics Research Colloquium, held at the University of Chicago in March 2008.  The investigator, together with the organizing committee, seeks to follow up with a second meeting in March, 2009.  The day and a half meeting includes talks on a wide array of topics in theoretical and applied statistics and a poster session for graduate students and other new researchers.  The regional nature of the meeting will allow many graduate students to carpool to the meeting, thus allowing many students to attend at modest cost.  In addition, we will be encouraging direct interactions among the graduate students to get them started building the personal and intellectual relationships among their peers that will nourish them throughout their careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
