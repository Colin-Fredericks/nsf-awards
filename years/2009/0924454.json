 "awd_abstract_narration": "0924454\r\nParker \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Water Science and Technology Board of the National Research Council (NRC) will undertake a comprehensive study of the potential for water reclamation and reuse of municipal wastewater to expand and enhance the nation's available water supply alternatives.  This broad study will consider a wide range of uses, including drinking water, non-potable urban uses, irrigation, industrial process water, groundwater recharge, and water for environmental purposes.  The study will consider technical, economic, institutional, and social challenges to increased adoption of water reuse, and it will provide guidance to decision makers evaluating their water supply alternatives.  The NRC study will be carried out by a committee of approximately 14 volunteer experts, with support from NRC staff.  The committee will hold approximately five meetings to receive briefings, gather information, deliberate critical issues, and write its report. \r\n\r\nAs water demands and environmental needs grow, options for expanding traditional sources of water are diminishing.  Conservation, water trading, desalination, and potable and non-potable water reuse are all being closely examined by communities facing water supply shortages.  An improved understanding of the costs, environmental and human health risks, and benefits of various forms of water reuse are essential to water supply planning.  The recent advances in technology and the past decade of research deserve a thorough review in the context of evaluating the human health risks, particularly for indirect potable water reuse, and the energy requirements relative to other alternatives.  The study will also identify technical barriers and research needs.  \r\n\r\nThe results of the committee's work will be a published report that will consider technical, economic, institutional, and social challenges to increased adoption of water reuse and will provide practical guidance to decision makers evaluating their water supply alternatives.  A short (~8 page) color brochure will also be produced based on the final report for broad dissemination of the report's findings.  A broad assessment of water reuse options, available technologies and their performance, associated costs, and their acceptance by the public would provide useful information for utilities that are considering future water supply alternatives.  Parts of most meetings of the committee will be held in open session with utilities, non-governmental organizations, relevant federal, state, and local agencies, and other experts, and other interested parties in order to engage a broad group of individuals from the water management and policy community.",
