The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twelve-month research fellowship by Dr. Felipe O. Bendezu to work with Dr. Sophie Martin at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nPolarized growth is a critical process carried out by many biological systems.\r\nIn the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, vegetatively growing cells\r\nutilize the microtubule and microfilament cytoskeletons to coordinate polarized\r\ngrowth to the cell tips to increase in length and to mid-cell for division. Very little\r\nis known, however, about how fission yeast coordinate polarized growth during\r\nmating, or sexual reproduction. Preliminary evidence suggests both the\r\nmicrotubule and microfilament networks are required for establishing matinginduced\r\npolarized growth. Additionally, a member of the actin-nucleating family of\r\nformins has been implicated in the cell fusion event following cell-cell contact.\r\nThis project will investigate the mechanisms governing polarized growth and cell\r\nfusion during mating of fission yeast. Using the powerful tools of fission yeast\r\ngenetics and cell biology, the PI will 1) define the organization and role of\r\nthe mating cytoskeleton through live-cell imaging, 2) investigate the localization\r\nand function of formins during mating and 3) identify additional factors required\r\nfor mating-induced polarized growth in a genome-wide screen. \r\n\r\nThis work will provide insight into the poorly understood process of polarized growth during mating of fission yeast.  The fission yeast has been established as a powerful model system to decipher fundamental mechanisms of cell proliferation and polarization. Indeed, many of the mechanisms governing cytoskeletal function have been conserved\r\nfrom yeast to man, which remarkably share over 70% of their genes. Since many\r\nof the components important for polarized growth have been conserved through\r\nevolution, this work is likely to further our understanding of conserved\r\nmechanisms of cell polarization in more complex systems. This fellowship will\r\nprovide the PI with the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art equipment\r\nand facilities under the guidance of a leader in the field of cell polarity and to\r\ndevelop an original research project that he can pursue independently in the\r\nfuture.\r\n",
