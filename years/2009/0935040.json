This will enable students to develop a comprehensive understanding of the construction process and critical skills such as resource utilization, sequencing, site layout, and risk management. In the virtual environment students will manage a complete construction project and be able to explore alternative solutions.  Other areas of engineering are also faced with the challenge of how to best educate students to understand the broad and complex real-world context in which discipline specific content will be applied. Virtual reality games offer a promising approach to accomplish this using currently available cyber-technology. The guidelines for future development derived from this research will be valuable in improving engineering education to better prepare students for engineering jobs.\r\n",
