Designated by the National Security Agency as a charter Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education, ISU further recognizes the importance of the information assurance (IA) field by supporting an IA Center on campus. Through this project, ISU continues participation in the NSF SFS program. Faculty from the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Political Science, Mathematics, Educational Leadership, and Logistics, Operations, and Management Information Systems lead the interdisciplinary Cyber Corps program. Students work closely with the faculty to receive IA training, conduct research, and develop as leaders and team members. Students complete IA courses and develop deeper problem-solving skills through more in-depth research efforts and involvement with major professors. All students participate in the unique and critical component of the ISU SFS program: leadership, teamwork and professionalism development.\r\n \r\nThe expanded SFS program provides faculty team leaders with a foundation to develop a year-round recruiting plan with special emphasis on: increasing the number of participants from underrepresented groups; further enhancing the selection process; supporting the strong student cohort experience; increasing the scope of mentoring for students; more systematically involving all students in IA research; and employing additional measures of program success. This infrastructure allows placing 100% graduating students in the federal government after graduation.\r\n\r\nThe ISU SFS program continues to benefit society by providing the federal workforce with new professionals who have the capacity to address the problems of securing critical federal information infrastructure in innovative ways. It contributes to the IA knowledge base by enhancing several ISU research programs that address important issues including intrusion detection systems; network security; data privacy and security; dependable systems and networks; and security policy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this program is to expand the capacity of an education program already producing graduates trained in Information Assurance by continuing the successful Iowa State University (ISU) Cyber Corps program. Designated by the National Security Agency as a charter Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education, ISU further recognizes the importance of the information assurance field by supporting an Information Assurance (IA) Center on campus.  ISU\u00c6s participation in the NSF SFS program since its inception demonstrates the institution\u00c6s commitment and capacity to successfully prepare students for careers in information security and to place them with the federal government.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of the ISU SFS program is the leadership experience gained through the student cohort groups and the formal leadership courses required of all SFS students.  As stated in the proposal \"In order for participants to succeed as students and professionals, they must be fully participating members of a strong cohort group.\"  The SFS faculty defines \"cohort\" as a community of learners rather than a group of students who are in a program at the same time.  The primary structure to create this community of learners is the leadership, teamwork and professional development component of the Cyber Corps program.  One required course per semester is co-facilitated by a faculty member from the Educational Leadership &amp; Policy Studies Department in the College of Human Sciences and a senior lecturer who is a specialist in student team and leadership development.  This program helps students develop teamwork and leadership skills, explore aspects of professional behavior, and build an ethical foundation for decision-making and professional practice through self-exploration, self-reflection, team interaction, and service learning.\n\nAs a result of the funding 27 students were provided scholarships and received a gradute degree in cyber security.  They all then started a job with a government agency once they graduated.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas W Jacobson"
