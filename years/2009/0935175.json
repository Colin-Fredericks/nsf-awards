The goals is to create a rich educational environment that fosters the development of engineering knowledge, skills and achievement both within college and in launching a successful career as an engineer. The techniques to be used will be drawn from design theory, cognitive science, developmental psychology, and engineering education research. This is a one year pilot study and the results will be presented at technical conferences and published in professional journals. The goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering through more effective development of their professional skills.  The results will increase student?s interest in engineering and will enhance the number of students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.",
