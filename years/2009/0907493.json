 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe aim of the proposed research on ?Nanorod Assembly in Polymeric Matrices? is to understand the fundamental principles that drive nanorod assembly when spatially confined. An underlying theme is controlling the location, alignment and packing of nanorods to optimize targeted properties. The work to be undertaken during this project involves \r\n(1)\torienting gold nanorods in homopolymer thin films and lamellar block copolymer films that confine the nanorods, and measuring their polarization dependent optical properties; \r\n(2)\tapplying thermodynamic principles to design systems that incorporate and align gold nanorods within cylindrical domains of block copolymers, and then studying nanorod induced phase transformations in block copolymer morphologies; and \r\n(3)\tinvestigating unique nanorods including TiO2, silica with a gold nanoshell and Janus nanorod systems to explore how rod diameter, surface functionality, and biphasic surfaces direct the location of nanorods in block copolymers. \r\nA successful outcome of the proposed research will be precise control over assembly of functional nanorods in polymer films using spatial confinement. As a proof of concept, a nanorod/polymer device will be fabricated and its polarization-dependent optical properties tested to demonstrate that these coating can be used as color polarizing filters. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPolymer nanocomposites (PNCs) are utilized in applications ranging from sports (golf balls) to transportation (tires) because they combine materials with synergistic properties.  Presently, PNCs are attracting interest for information storage as well as electronic and energy applications.  The proposed research will provide scientists with the rules for selecting the materials that will lead to optimum efficiency in PNCs. The broader impacts include laboratory experience for middle and high school students, high school teachers and undergraduates including those from underrepresented groups.  An annual science day for middle school students (6th ? 8th grade) will continue at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition, female elementary school students are introduced to a summer camp called Girls in Engineering Math & Science Camp (GEMS).  A successful partnership with Central High School (CHS) in Philadelphia that has already resulted in a new innovative Materials Science course will continue. Future plans include extending the course from one to two sections, developing laboratories, exposing students to new characterization tools, and facilitating joint research projects. The first materials science textbook aimed at high school students is also planned.  Because CHS draws academically talented, multicultural and diverse (32% African American, 5% Latino, 50% female) students, this partnership will have a profound and lasting impact on the scientific and technological literacy of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n",
