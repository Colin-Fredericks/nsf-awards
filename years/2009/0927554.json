 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop a new efficient and scalable technique for the fabrication of polymer fibers as small as 200 nm in diameter from a number of solution-processed polymers. It is based on a bulk process of antisolvent-induced precipitation under shear stress in viscous media. The project will allow moving the technology from exploratory research to the engineered fabrication of regular and composite nanofibers. It will seek to establish universal molecular entanglement rules for fiber formation. Polymer-solvent interactions will be investigated to quantify the competitive kinetics of fiber formation, due to shear and phase separation, and fiber hardening, due to solvent and antisolvent diffusion. This method has specific advantages for production of composite fibers since it does not involve extrusion through nozzles and avoids the problem of clogging due to particle aggregation. Principles for making functional fibers and rods will be established. These fibers and rods will contain catalytic and magnetic nanoparticles, enzymes and cellulose nanocrystals. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will result in new large-scale technologies for making functional micro- and nanofibers. Such economic nanofiber production could immediately improve the prospects of manufacturing of highly efficient filters, functional textiles, scaffolds for tissue engineering, and substrates for flexible electronics and immobilized biocatalysts. The method allows the creation of biodegradable and multifunctional fibers by incorporation of inorganic and organic particles and biomolecules. It can be specifically relevant for sustainable technologies, since it is capable of creating high value products from solutions produced during polymer recycling. A postdoctoral researcher will be trained in a combination of fundamental science with technology development, entrepreneurship and interactions with industrial researchers. The project will also provide a training ground for undergraduate researchers as its scientific components relate to environmental protection and sustainable technologies. \r\n",
