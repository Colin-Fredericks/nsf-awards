This project aims to\r\naccount for the three-dimensional nature of the real world by exploring qualitative\r\ngeometric reasoning in terms of 3D spatial relationships between scene components,\r\ncategory-level object models, and global scene understanding.\r\nThe project is organized around two major research areas. Qualitative 3D scene\r\nparsing: A central part of our effort will be to develop qualitative 3D models of the scene\r\nthat describe the depicted objects and surfaces and their physical relations. Grounding\r\nobjects in the scene: We integrate the geometric representation of the scene and the\r\ncorresponding 3D spatial relations with the object recognition process by (1) inferring\r\nthe set of likely object identities based on 3D relations among scene components; (2)\r\npredicting the most likely object locations from the scene layout; and (3) using the\r\nocclusion relations and depth ordering to predict the parts of objects that may be visible\r\nin the scene.\r\nThe project is anticipated to result in major advances in 3D scene understanding from\r\nphotographs, a critical enabling technology for a wide range of applications including\r\nautonomous systems, health care, human-computer interaction, assistive technology,\r\nimage retrieval, industrial and personal robotics, manufacturing, scientific image\r\nanalysis, surveillance and security, and transportation.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0905402 PI Name:Hebert, Martial\r\nPrinted from eJacket: 05/06/09 Page 1 of 1",
