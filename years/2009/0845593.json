 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theoretical computer science community has recently witnessed a significant expansion in research interest at the intersection of algorithms and game theory.  As part of this trend, there has also been a resurgence of interest in ordinal matching problems, where one seeks to pair up elements in two or more sets, with the quality of a solution characterized in game theoretic terms by ranked preference lists of the individual elements participating in a matching problem, rather than in terms of a global objective function involving explicit numeric costs.  Ordinal matching problems arise in a diverse number of applications in practice, including matching medical school graduates to residencies at hospitals, maximizing the number of donor matches in kidney exchange networks, and efficient load balancing on the Internet.  Dr. Dean will develop improved algorithms for a broad range of ordinal matching problems, helping to bridge the gap in complexity between methods for ordinal matching and traditional cost-based matching problems.\r\n\r\nDr. Dean is an award-winning teacher and also serves as the associate director for the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), where his training initiatives increase the enthusiam and algorithmic problem-solving proficiency of students at the high-school level.\r\n",

Outcomes of this work include 7 published papers in high-quality venues, as well as dissertations of two PhD students on the specific subject of matching (as well as many other publications in other algorithmic areas not directly related to matching).

The primary educational objective of this grant was to improve the reach and impact of the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), one of several major \"Olympiads\" in the States tasked with identifying and training top high-school students in their respective disciplines.  The USACO provides on-line training material and programming contests at different levels in order to help bright high-school students learn computational problem-solving, it invites the top ~2 dozen students in the USA to a rigorous academic summer training camp, and it selects a team of the top 4 students in the USA to attend the International Olympiad in Informatics, the most prestigious programming competition in the world at the high-school level (one of several international high-school Olympiads in different scientific disciplines).  The principal investigator of this grant assumed the directorship of the USACO in 2011 and moved the summer training program to his home institution, Clemson University, at the same time.  Under his leadership, participation in the program has doubled in the past ~5 years, with more than 2600 students participating in our largest on-line contests, and thousands more utilizing our on-line training materials.
