 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term practical objective of this research project is to develop simulated training environments that mesh with the constraints of perceiving and enacting actions in the real world.  Simulated environments differ from real environments in a number of aspects. In particular, there are significant differences in perceptual and motor features between these environments. Advances in embodied cognitive science have consistently demonstrated how the body, and the environment which it inhabits, are tightly coupled with the mind, and together they form a complex system for perception and action. The central questions being investigated in this research involve identifying the conditions that promote perceiving and enacting actions in simulated training environments, and include questions such as:  (a) whether high fidelity simulation environments and perceptual motor cues signaling risk are necessary ingredients to enhance training effectiveness; (b) whether performance pressure is a necessary component in training paradigms; (c) the extent to which bodily interactivity with the training environment is necessary; and (d) the extent to which individual differences in perception and action contribute to training effectiveness of simulated environments. This research project also begins to investigate whether encoding events in language that selectively focus on particular conceptual components can be used as an effective mechanism to guide visual attention.  Simulation environments will be modeled after real world events, and will vary the degree of user control and level of immersion. Research participants will have their eye movements recorded, mark off when a meaningful event ends and another begins, perform perceptual mental simulation tasks by identifying the correct bodily movements, or manipulate user controlled simulation environments.  \r\n\r\nThis research project investigates how people spontaneously engage in riskier behaviors due to differences between simulated environments and the real world, whether putting people under some pressure is critical for successful training in simulated environments, and what type of physical interactivity with simulated environments is essential for optimal performance.  This research also investigates whether differences in cognitive abilities and personality types have effects on performance in simulated environments.  This project uses multiple methods in an attempt to understand along which dimensions training in simulated environments can effectively transfer to real world practice. This research pushes forward the frontiers of perceiving and enacting actions in psychology, computer science, robotics, and human computer interactions. The results will form an empirical basis promoting the development of improved methods for training in simulated worlds.  Improved designs of simulated worlds for training and modeling are increasingly important in many areas of our society including: impacts in education, military, law enforcement and emergency response organization training; smart environments for the better treatment of disabled or special needs populations; and entertainment industries and the arts.",
