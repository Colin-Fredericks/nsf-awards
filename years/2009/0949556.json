 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gene duplication is observed in virtually all lineages, and duplicate genes can play significant roles in regulation of gene expression. This project will integrate experimental and mathematical approaches to examine whether duplicate genes contribute to the ability of organisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions and whether selection in varying environmental conditions can maintain duplicate genes with redundant function. Working with yeast, the project will characterize regulatory dynamics of redundant glucose transporter genes in response to environmental conditions and examine the fitness consequences of asynchronously regulated redundant genes. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop methodological and empirical bases for future research on the role of asynchronous regulation of redundant gene copies. The research focuses on the genes and metabolic pathways that underlie glucose transport, a highly important process for organisms in general. The research has the potential to transform understanding of the role of gene duplication in evolution and of the basis of adaptation to changing environmental conditions. A student will receive training in an interdisciplinary research enterprise, and the research will inform teaching and outreach.",
