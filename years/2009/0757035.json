 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Santa Barbara group proposes research on a broad spectrum of fundamental questions in Physics ranging from formal String Theory to calculating QCD matrix elements using Lattice Gauge Theory. They also propose applying field theory concepts to important problem in Biology such as RNA folding as well as using modern methods to understand Quantum Chaos.  The proposed research in string theory will focus on fundamental questions in the formulation of the theory (including high energy scattering, time-dependent configurations, and holographic duality), possible observational signatures via cosmic superstrings, and the application of gauge/string duality to physics of gauge theories and other field theories. Related investigations include issues of scattering in gravitational theories, lessons from the black hole information paradox, and applications of models of emergent gravity to black hole physics. In particle physics and astrophysics, problems to be studied include the study of supersymmetric models, research to understand the smallness of the up quark mass and a proposal on how to solve the strong CP problem of QCD. There is also proposed a variety of studies in neutrino physics including studying the predictions for lepton masses in tetrahedral group models, CP violation in the lepton sector, and relations between neutrino and charged lepton masses. Research in quantum chaos theory will focus on the Ruelle resonances and their role in classical and quantum dynamics. Work in quantitative biology will continue the study of the topology of RNA folding using random matrix theory and Monte Carlo methods. Research in lattice gauge theory will be directed at the study of the masses of strongly interacting particles, the properties of light pseudoscalar mesons, the decays of particles with heavy quarks, the behavior of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures, and the generation of gauge configurations with improved staggered quarks for use by other lattice gauge theorists in their own research.\r\nThe scientific broader impact of this proposal is that research in string theory is aimed at developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental interactions of nature. The proposed research  in particle phenomenology and lattice gauge theory is directly related to, and supportive of, programs in experimental high energy physics. Furthermore, part of the effort in lattice gauge theory is aimed at developing large-scale computational infrastructure for the entire U.S. lattice gauge theory community. The approach being taken has broad possibilities for application to computationally-intensive problems in many areas of science and engineering. The  research topics covered by this proposal provide excellent educational opportunities for students and postdocs. This educational role is also greatly strengthened by interactions with the many visitors to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP). \r\n",
