 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economists have a good understanding of competitive markets, whose supply-and-demand diagrams are the staple of introductory textbooks and the source of much of our economic intuition.  Competitive markets are characterized by large numbers of sellers featuring identical products and large numbers of buyers, all with good information about trading possibilities.  As a result, participants in this market have no effect on the market price, and do not care who they trade with?buyers are just as happy to trade with one seller as another, and sellers as happy to trade with one buyer as another.  Prices have relatively little to do in such markets, serving to balance the quantities supplied and demanded, with the remaining details of how trade occurs and who trades with whom being largely irrelevant.  It is thus no surprise that competitive markets work relatively well.\r\n\r\n\tMuch of current economic theory is concerned with the many markets in our economy that are not competitive.  It is well understood that markets will not be competitive when there are only a few buyers or sellers, large enough to affect prices through the exertion of market power, and a rich literature in industrial organization has emerged to examine such markets.  The research described in this proposal is instead concerned with cases in which markets create asymmetries that distinguish agents, giving rise to personalized relationships (rather than the anonymous interactions of competitive markets).  How are resources allocated in such personalized markets?\r\n\r\nThe research begins by examining markets in which people must undertake investments before they can trade?potential employees may acquire skills, just as employers may invest in capital equipment.  These investments introduce a matching component in the subsequent market, as people vie to trade with desirable partners.  The appropriate legal and institutional structure, including especially the appropriate assignment of property rights, turns out to be critical for prices to do an effective job of clearing such markets.  This project gives us a new understanding of this relationship, potentially leading to the possibility of designing more effective matching markets.  A second component of the research examines relationships in which people repeatedly deal with one another, sometimes sacrificing short-term gain in the interests of a more effective long-term interaction.  Technically, the research advances the theoretical tools used to examine such relationships, namely the theory of repeated games under incomplete information.  More concretely, the investigator applies these tools to model specific economic questions involving resource allocation and price formation.   Finally, the research considers cases in which economic interactions are personalized rather than anonymous because the preferences of the parties are linked, with each having some regard for the welfare of the other.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual goal is a better understanding of resource allocation and economic behavior. A running theme is that personalized interactions often complement or even replace prices and markets in allocating resources. Taking a longer term view, this research enhances our understanding of how to better allocate resources through the design of more effective markets.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEconomists have a good understanding of resource allocation in competitive markets.  The analysis of such markets focuses on the role of prices in allocating resources, beginning with an examination of how the actions of large numbers of essentially anonymous buyers and sellers give rise to the demand and supply pressures that shape prices.\n\n \n\nThe work supported by this grant studies resource allocation in economic interactions that are personalized rather than anonymous.  Intuitively, we say that interactions are personalized if the participating agents care not only about what they do, but whom they do it with.  Many of our daily economic interactions fall into this category, and they require an analysis that complements the traditional study of competitive markets.\n\n \n\nThe first phase of the research considers markets in which no two goods are identical.  For example, we might think of the workers and the jobs in some markets for unskilled labor as being essentially interchangeable, and in turn might think of a single wage as clearing this market.  In contrast, in markets for highly skilled labor, each worker brings somewhat different qualifications to the market and each job similarly brings different demands.  Instead of a single price, we have \"personalized prices,\" or a different price tailored to every worker/firm match.  Our research studies the way such prices are formed, how they mediate the matching between the two sides of the market, and their efficiency implications.  We establish conditions under which a market equilibrium will exist and conditions under which it will be efficient, as well as conditions under which the agents on one side or the other of the market will fare relatively well.  Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the performance of the market depends very much on the property rights determining who owns the various components of the economic outcome of an interaction between agents in the market.  If these property rights are appropriately specified, a relatively simple specification of prices will clear the market and lead to efficient outcomes.  If not, pricing will be more complicated and less effective.  The interesting feature of these findings is that the specification of property rights can be determined by the institutional and legal framework within which our economy operates.  Products developed in the course of a job can belong to the worker or to the firm; client lists can belong to the professional or to the partnership; song royalties can accrue to the writer, the band, the publisher, or the public, and so on.  This research should provide a new perspective on how we might design these property rights, and more generally design markets for heterogeneous products, so as to achieve more efficient outcomes.\n\n \n\nThe second phase of the research centers around the observation that many economic interactions occur in repeated relationships, and that not only current prices but also future actions are important in allocating resources.  For example, many firms and their suppliers interact repeatedly, and a common reaction to a current surprise (such as the buyer needing a larger or smaller delivery, or the seller incurring unexpectedly high costs, or the buyer making alterations to an order, or the seller encountering a problem that renders them unable to deliver) is not to make a payment or adjust the price, but to resolve that \"we\u00c6ll make it up next time.\"  Hence, running mental accounts in repeated interactions play much the same role in allocating resources as do prices.  Our study of such interactions begins with an examination of how people build and maintain reputations for taking certain actions.  The research constructs a simple model in which (for example) a firm interacts with a succession of customers.  The research shows that if the customers are uncertain about some characteristics of the firm, then the firm has an incentive to first build and then maintain a reputation for ..."
