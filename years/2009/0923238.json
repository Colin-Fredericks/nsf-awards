The system relies on wearable sensing and computing devices to achieve human context awareness. The research aims to answer central questions in understanding the interplay between human and computing, mainly \r\n-\tUnderstanding human context (e.g., behavior, location) through embedded computing, and\r\n-\tExploring the knowledge of human context to improve embedded computing applications.\r\nThe first research project investigates the development of infrastructure ?free human context awareness in GPS-restricted environments. The second studies the use of the knowledge of human context to better understand human intentions and addresses the study in a human-robot interaction (HRI) setup. Both projects require a motion capture system that can provide location ground truth, allow performance comparison, and facilitate system calibration. The work aims to \r\n-\tDevelop a theoretical framework to achieve a stand-alone human context awareness that requires zero infrastructure setup.  (Some activities, such as 'virtual landmarks' are expected to contribute in indoor human localization.)\r\n-\tDevelop explicit human intention recognition based in the context of both location and activity that pushes forward research in human-robot interaction \r\n-\tLead to a better understanding of interactive, coupled relationship between human and computing.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The work impacts wearable computing, human-computer interaction (HCI), and ubiquitous computing research. Modifications of the developed hardware and software might serve to track the locations and monitor the status (activity and health) of first responders, improving the efficiency of personnel safety in their operations. The system improves the research capabilities in Oklahoma, an EPSCoR state.  Planned education and training activities contribute in preparing students in embedded computing, wireless communication, signal processing, and human behaviors. Outreach activities stimulate prospective students. Efforts will be made to involve Native American and female students.",
