They are used in \r\nstream cipher cryptosystems, spread spectrum systems in cellular \r\ntelephones, GPS systems, satellite communications, error-correcting codes \r\nfor digital communication, and large simulations for such applications as \r\nweather prediction, reactor design, oil well exploration, radiation cancer \r\ntherapy, traffic flow, and pricing of  financial instruments.  In each case \r\nsequences or nonlinear functions with particular properties are needed.  \r\nYet few general constructions of high quality pseudorandom sequences \r\nand highly nonlinear functions are known.  This research involves the \r\ndevelopment and analysis of a large supply of these tools for a variety of \r\napplications in  cryptography, coding theory, and simulations.                      \r\n                                                                                    \r\nIn 1994 Klapper and Goresky proposed \"feedback-with-carry shift registers\"\r\n(FCSRs), pseudorandom generators which are easily implemented and which \r\nrapidly generate sequences with many desirable properties.  These generalize\r\nto algebraic feedback shift registers (AFSRs).  Many basic properties of FCSRs \r\nand AFSRs have been determined and they have been used in stream ciphers\r\nand quasi-Monte Carlo.   This project addresses issues concerning FCSR and \r\nAFSR sequences including (1) The development of new classes of highly \r\nnonlinear functions for use in block ciphers and stream ciphers, (2) the \r\ndevelopment of new tools for the analysis of nonlinear functions based on the \r\n\"with-carry\" paradigm, (3) the solution of the \"register synthesis problem\" \r\nfor AFSRs, (4) the identification of new classes of AFSR sequences with good\r\nrandomness properties, and (5) the extension of various ideas and methods in cryptography to vector valued functions and sequence generators.  \r\n                 \r\n",
