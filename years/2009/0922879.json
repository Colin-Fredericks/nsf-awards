 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\nAward Abstract\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center to acquire high-resolution mass spectrometry for research in proteomics and metabolomics. The Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry Facility (PMSF) at the Danforth Center will house the NSF-supported acquisition of a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap MS, an Eksigent 2D-nanoLC, and an Advion Triversa nanospray robot to support research of scientists at the Danforth Center, our partner institutions, and collaborators.  As the depth and breadth of current biological research continues to expand, the ability to detect, identify, and characterize biomolecules remains an essential component in the elucidation of complex cellular processes.  High-resolution MS capabilities are essential for full characterization of both small (metabolite) and large (peptide/protein) molecules.  Examples of projects supported though this proposal include: analysis of the mechanism and function of lipid post-translational modification of proteins, the analysis of metabolic flux in the development of third generation biofuel systems, the analysis of the formation of diverse isoquinoline alkaloids that will be studied in both the animal and plant kingdoms, and the direct and collateral consequences of proteome alterations, and the determination of the alkaloid metabolome of transgenic opium poppies.\r\n\r\nThis project seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art research and education.  It supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and senior personnel in the ever-growing analytical field of mass spectrometry.  This instrumentation will promote interdisciplinary research leading to increased knowledge in the areas of plant proteomics and metabolomics.  The capabilities afforded by a high resolution mass spectrometer will be accessible to and utilized by a large audience through placement in PMSF and through outreach programs at the Center and participating universities.  Knowledge gained through utilization of this equipment will, per the Danforth Center mission, enhance the nutritional content of plants to improve human health, increase agricultural production to gain a competitive edge over commodity crops and harness agriculture research to create new and increased value for farmers, and support research to create new biofuels and biorenewable products that contribute to an expanding \"growing green\" initiative that will have local, regional and national impacts.  \r\n\r\nProject outcomes, including information regarding the instrumentation and publications resulting from projects using the instrumentation, will be available on the PMSF website: http://www.danforthcenter.org/pmsf/.  Additionally, peer-reviewed publications resulting from this funding will be posted on the corresponding NSF award website.",
