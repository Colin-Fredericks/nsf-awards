 "awd_abstract_narration": "Air pollution remains high in eastern U.S. forests and is considered a critical environmental stress. The goal of this project is to examine the effects of two atmospheric pollutants, acid precipitation and mercury, on wildlife communities in the Southern Appalachians.  Acid precipitation, in the form of sulfur and nitrogen deposition, pollutes both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and depletes calcium from these systems, posing a serious risk to egg production in birds and shell formation in snails.  Great Smoky Mountains National Park receives the highest acid deposition of any monitored national park in the U.S., and recently mercury has been identified as an additional serious pollutant to the area.  This project is focused on understanding the effects of acid deposition and subsequent calcium loss on both songbird and snail populations and determining the avian species and habitats most at risk of mercury contamination.  Chemical analyses will be performed on feathers from multiple species to determine if mercury contamination in birds is directly related to their source of food, thus helping to determine the mechanisms of contamination.  Numerous organizations are involved in this work as collaborators, public outreach is planned through talks and demonstrations, and high school, undergraduate, and international biologists will be trained in ecological research methods.  This research addresses two critical environmental problems with results applicable across a broad geographic range, and has significantly increased interest in pollution-related research in the Southern Appalachians.",
