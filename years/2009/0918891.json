 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct comprehensive surveys and inventories of amphibians and reptiles throughout Haiti -- in areas of known diversity, as well as in poorly known and unexplored regions. The primary goals are to determine how much of the known diversity of species still exists, and how much remains undescribed. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world and its land surface is now essentially devoid of native vegetation because of human activities. Some of the once-rich biodiversity of the country can be found in small, isolated patches of forest, but these forest remnants are largely unprotected, threatening the survival of nearly all species. \r\n\r\nAlthough Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, a large number of species occur only in Haiti. It has the highest proportion of threatened amphibian species of any country in the world. Many new species are likely to be discovered during this project. Sampling and analytical methods used during the inventories will provide critical data for understanding the process of mass extinction, to inform conservation management decisions, and to help prevent loss of biodiversity elsewhere. The project also involves training of graduate and undergraduate students. \r\n",
