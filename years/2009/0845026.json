 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor Guillermo Moyna at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia and his group will employ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods to probe the structure and dynamics of a series of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium based ionic liquids (ILs) and solutions containing these ILs, cosolvents of different polarities, and various carbohydrates. Specifically, deuterium isotope effects on chemical shifts, relaxation measurements, and diffusion determinations will reveal the connection between molecular level interactions and such properties as viscosity, and the ability of certain ILs to dissolve other species such as carbohydrates derived from biomass. Molecular dynamics simulations will be performed to complement the experimental studies and develop atomistic models of these systems. \r\n\r\nIn addition to gaining a better understanding of the basic science of IL-based systems and IL-mediated processes, achieving the project objectives will impact a broad swath of disciplines. For example, the data from these studies may aid in the design of new IL-based media that could find direct application in fields ranging from water remediation to biomass processing. In addition, the project will engage students at various levels of their careers in both experiment and theory. This will allow senior members of the research team to hone their skills as teachers and mentors, while at the same time providing the younger investigators in the group with the unique opportunity of learning advanced chemical concepts by doing chemistry.",
