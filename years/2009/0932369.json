The project will apply these coupled LCA-GIS tools to model inventory flows and assess impacts on biodiversity of land use dynamics associated with biofuel crop production.  Combining LCA and GIS creates the potential to develop indicators that are meaningful for biodiversity and that can account for the spatially-dependent and non-linear consequences of land use change.  This project aims to develop the tools to make this coupling of software systems feasible and practical for all LCA studies of product systems that have large land use requirements.  GIS tools will be developed to generate inventory flows from land use in Life Cycle Inventory.  Flow data will be integrated with ecological databases to create and compare various biodiversity characterization models and impact indicators.  Additionally, a multidisciplinary graduate seminar in environmental sustainability and impact assessment with LCA and GIS will be conducted to train a cadre of industrial ecology graduate students in this integration of technologies.",
