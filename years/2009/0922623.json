 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Jeffrey B. Johnson and colleague Moses Lee from Hope College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer to support research that includes mechanistic elucidation of transition metal-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond activation methodology, design of prodrugs for possible applications in prostate cancer, synthesis and analysis of organic photochromes,  polymer synthesis and characterization for use in light emitting electrochemical cells (LEC), and assessment of phosphates in lake sediments. The spectrometer will also provide research opportunities at collaborating community colleges through cyber infrastructure.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, environmental and energy research. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
