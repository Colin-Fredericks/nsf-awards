They are lightweight with high porosity but typically have low mechanical strength. Recently, Co-PI Leventis developed a method to nanoencapsulate 3D silica nanostructures under a conformal polymer coating without clogging the pores. This novel lightweight material, termed crosslinked aerogel (X-aerogel), has a significantly improved mechanical strength and possesses surface chemistry resembling biocompatible polyurethane. It is proposed here to develop this material as a leaflet material for artificial heart valves, typically made now of pyrolytic carbon.  It is hypothesized that the lighter weight of X-aerogel valve leaflets will lead to lower transvalvular pressures and reduced cavitation in the blood.  This hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims: (1) To determine the biocompatibility of X-aerogels towards plasma, blood cells (especially platelets) and vascular endothelial cells.  (2) To characterize the mechanical behavior and chemical stability of X-aerogels under compressive, tensile, shear, and bi-axial stress states; creep, relaxation, fracture, and fatigue of the material will also be tested. (3) To manufacture an X-aerogel monoleaflet heart valve and determine its hemodynamic performances in a flow chamber with dynamic properties matching the in vivo circulation.    \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  In view of the prevalence of heart valve defects requiring surgical valve replacement and the projected continuing need for artificial heart valves, this materials development proposal has the potential for significant clinical impact.  The project is headed by a very interdisciplinary team, and it provides excellent opportunities for training of students across the boundaries of chemistry, materials science, and biomedical engineering.  Both graduate students and undergraduate students will be trained on the project.  Provisions have been made for visits by PIs and students between the Oklahoma State and Missouri Rolla sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
