 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for travel of speakers and panelists at the National Nanotechnology Initiative Regional Initiatives Workshop in Oklahoma City April 1-3, 2009. The workshop brings representatives of regional, state, and local nanotechnology initiatives together with representatives of US Government, industry, trade associations, non-governmental organizations, and academia to stimulate increased interaction of these groups with one another and with the NNI. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the workshop is to improve the outcomes of nanotechnology research, education, and business activities undertaken by U.S. organizations and communities working to advance nanotechnology. The strategy for reaching this goal is to exploit synergies between the various initiatives, promote sharing of information and resources, and develop ongoing mechanisms for relevant interactions. A full report of the workshop will be prepared by the participants and distributed by the NNI and NNCO. Thus the highlights of the workshop and the collective best practice recommendations will be made available to the whole nanotechnology community in science, business, government, and non-governmental organizations using the NNI and NSF websites. A database of the financial resources and funding models, regulatory issues and practices, and areas of technology focus of the regional, state, and local initiatives will be prepared and updated on an ongoing basis.\r\n",
