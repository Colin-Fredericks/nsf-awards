Fabrication of a\r\ncontinuous and non-porous graphene shell offers a unique way to stabilize noble metal nanoparticles\r\n(NMPs) lending multi-functionality and unique properties to these hybrid nanomaterials. Such\r\nnanomaterials are of enormous importance for homeland and border security, sensor industry, and\r\nanalytical device technology.\r\nThe research involves studies on the growth of GE-NMPs and their nanowire-based heterostructures\r\nusing a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The information will be broadly applicable to many\r\nmaterials systems that have an ability to catalyze carbon growth and will be a notable advancement in the\r\narea of novel graphene-based nanomaterials and devices. These materials are highly robust and can be\r\nreadily functionalized for further applications. The approach is to fully utilize the functions of the individual\r\ncomponents (graphene and noble metal nanoparticle) to locate, detect, separate, and assemble chemical\r\nspecies with enhanced signals. In addition, hybrid nanomaterials will be vital in realizing advanced\r\nengineering applications, including, chemical and biological sensors and novel spectroscopy substrates\r\nthat integrate a uniquely heterostructured nano-electromechanical system (NEMS). These devices will\r\nhave high resolution, chemical selectivity, improved sensitivity and detection limits, reversibility, and\r\nrobustness. The research program is multidisciplinary and has strong fundamental and technological\r\ncomponents allowing students to work and gain experience in cutting edge nanotechnology research.",
