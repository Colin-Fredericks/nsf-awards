 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is supporting the PI and his three graduate students to attend the 11th meeting of the European Social Cognition Network (ESCON) in Warsaw, Poland, on August 26-30, 2009. This conference provides an international forum for the exchange of the most recent scientific developments in the field of Social Cognition. The intellectual merits of this conference are extensive.  First, the conference is innovative in its cross-national representation (some 16 countries will be represented, including the best European labs).  The PI, as one of the invited plenary speakers, will also be afforded the opportunity to present his research to an international audience and to discuss his work more broadly and informally with attendees.  This will allow the PI and his students to learn from, and present to, an audience that approaches social cognition questions from a different perspective, and get exposed to some of the most cutting-edge research being done these days in European countries.  Further, the conference provides a platform for young researchers -- including the three graduate students whose travel would be supported on this grant -- to present their research ideas and to receive extensive feedback from a variety of experts in the field.  This should greatly stimulate their professional development, not only conceptually, but also in terms of contacts with international colleagues.  Finally, one of the broader goals of this meeting is to foster international research collaborations and to develop additional opportunities for young researchers to become integrated into the international scientific community.",
