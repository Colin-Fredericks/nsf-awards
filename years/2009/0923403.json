 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to utilize an innovative nanoimprint lithography (NIL) technique for research and training in prototyping and fabrication of micro/nano sensors/actuators, nano devices, nanostructures and nanoscale tooling for nanomanufacturing at UMass-Lowell (UML). The NIL is a micro- and nanoscale replication process, which uses a combination of mechanical pressing and heating or ultraviolet lighting to generate uniform and high resolution features (below 10 nm) on a substrate at a low cost and high throughput. The requested NIL system will significantly enhance nanomanufacturing and nano/micro fabrication capabilities at UMass-Lowell. Current research projects directly benefiting from the requested system include: 1) three-dimensional nanofeatures fabrication for chemical and biological sensing systems; 2) hybrid polymer-metal tooling development for injection molding; 3) nanoscale lithography for nanowire based optical detection systems and nanoelectronics; 4) nanostructure fabrication for photovoltaic energy conversion systems; and 5) nanotemplate fabrication for nanomanufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe NIL system is an essential component of the nanofabrication process chain. The research projects enabled by this nanofabrication capability include many broader-impact applications such as: real time and in situ explosive detection for prevention of loss of human life and damage to infrastructure, biomolecular sensing, high efficiency solar cells for sustainable energy source, lead-free soldering for nanoelectronics packaging, and high-rate, high-volume, and environmentally-safe manufacturing processes. The requested instrumentation will be integrated into education and outreach programs for K-12 teachers and students, undergraduate and graduate students, and industry professionals through the Graduate Certificate in Nanotechnology, capstone and senior projects, course demonstration and laboratory experiments, summer research experience for undergraduates program and ?Nanotech Will Travel? umbrella outreach program. These activities are part of an extensive education and outreach infrastructure organized by the NSF Center for High-rate Nanomanufacturing (CHN) and the state-funded Nanomanufacturing Center of Excellence (NCOE) at UML. This project will also involve students from underrepresented groups in research projects and course work through CHN and NCOE recruiting programs. \r\n",
