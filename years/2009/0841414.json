Ferguson, Timothy Bolton, Srinivas Kambhampati, Iris Moreno Totten and N. Sanjay Rebello (Kansas State University)\r\n\r\nMuch public misunderstanding of science involves misconceptions regarding the types of evidence accepted within scientific disciplines as well as the manner in which scientists move from evidence to inference. Understanding how available data can provide information about objects or events that cannot be directly experienced or manipulated is particularly challenging to students. Through \"Evidence-based inquiry into the distant, remote, or past (EIDRoP)\", Kansas State University (KSU) graduate fellows in the biological sciences, geosciences and physics will work with mentor teachers at Junction City High School (USD 475) to develop and teach both discipline-specific and interdisciplinary lessons responsive to state standards in science as inquiry and the nature of science. Professional development activities include a Summer Institute, a fellows class and an annual Capstone Meeting. Program goals are to: enhance young scientists' abilities as effective communicators and as educational collaborators; improve science education for grade 9-12 students through the infusion of contemporary science research, an integrated emphasis on nature of science, interdisciplinary teaching modules and provision of scientist role models; enhance the knowledge of grade 9-12 teachers through teacher training, interaction with KSU students and faculty, and curriculum enrichment; strengthen USD 475's partnerships with STEM departments at KSU; and expand collaborative partnerships within KSU and between KSU and K-12 education. EIDRoP will have extensive broader impacts in terms of enhancing education (of fellows, students, teachers and faculty), and will drive a cultural change in science education with respect to interactions between University science departments and K-12 education.\r\n",

EIDRoP continues as a graduate training program through a sustainability phase, and has fostered many additional initiatives partnering university scientists and public school educators.
