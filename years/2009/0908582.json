Cairns.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this RET in Engineering site at West Virginia University (WVU) is to train and empower 30 middle and high school STEM teachers (10 per year for 3 years) from high-need rural school districts in Appalachia (specifically West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania) to inspire their students through project based learning linked to energy research projects in collaboration with industry partners from their community.  Teachers will participate in a six-week summer research program where they will be trained in project based learning, will attend an International Summer Energy School (ISES) at the University of Birminghamm, UK, and will perform socially relevant, individualized research on energy conversion, environmental monitoring and maintenance.",
