Here, the focus is on situations when the elastic\r\nbodies exhibit some sort of rigid behavior.  In this manner, the\r\nstudy of geometric properties of structures, e.g. the properties\r\nof various spaces of isometries and infinitesimal isometries of\r\n2-dimensional surfaces, comes to the fore.  This differs from\r\nclassical differential geometry in the weaker regularity of the\r\ngiven surface or of the deformations.  A first objective is to\r\nidentify and rigorously derive variational theories for thin\r\nshells from the 3-dimensional theory of nonlinear elasticity\r\nthrough Gamma-convergence methods.  The derived theories\r\nnaturally depend on the scaling regimes of the elastic energy or\r\nbody forces in terms of shell thickness.  In this context, the\r\ninvestigator works on problems involving various spaces of weakly\r\ndifferentiable isometries.  In parallel, properties of the\r\nderived theories, such as multiplicity and regularity of\r\nsolutions, or their dependence on the geometry of the shell, are\r\ninvestigated.  Another line of investigation is the study of\r\nnon-stress-free configurations observed e.g. in the growth of\r\nleaves.  A tangentially heterogeneous 3-dimensional nonlinear\r\nelastic model is studied and the Gamma-limit approach is used to\r\nreduce the dimension and analyze the model.  Quantitative\r\nrigidity estimates also are studied as a strong analytical tool\r\nin tackling these variational problems. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies different mechanical phenomena\r\nunder the unifying umbrella of the nonlinear elasticity theory. \r\nElastic materials exhibit qualitatively different responses to\r\ndifferent kinematic boundary conditions or body forces.  This\r\nfact has given rise to many interesting questions in the\r\nmathematical theory of elasticity.  The main goal of this theory\r\nis to explain various, apparently different, phenomena in terms\r\nof some shared mathematical principles.  The variational approach\r\nto the nonlinear theory has been very effective in dealing with\r\nthese questions.  It has also been helpful in rigorously deriving\r\nmodels for elastic shells or plates pertaining to different\r\nscaling regimes of the body forces.  In the latter context, the\r\nstrength of this approach lies in the fact that it can predict\r\nthe appropriate model together with the response of the elastic\r\nplate for the given scaling of forces or kinematic boundary\r\nconditions without any a priori assumptions other than the\r\ngeneral principles of the 3-dimensional nonlinear elasticity. \r\nAnother feature of this approach is that it can lead to new\r\nmodels that were not previously considered. \r\n",
