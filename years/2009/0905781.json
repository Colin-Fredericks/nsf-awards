 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical abstract:\r\n\r\nThis project explores the dynamics of nanomaterials, employing atomic-scale spatial resolution, femtosecond temporal resolution x-ray techniques to answer a fundamental question: How do the dynamics of nanoscale materials differ from that of bulk materials? Snapshots of nanoscale phase transitions will be captured as these processes occur, providing a new window into the ultrafast atomic-scale rearrangements that fundamentally determine the efficiency, stability, and speed of functional devices.  These experiments will elucidate the rules that govern nanoscale phase transitions in real time and lead to new ways of controlling these processes at the atomic-scale. An integrated educational outreach program involving visits to a nearby  middle school will be carried out, in which students will be exposed to the results of this work through demonstrations meant to motivate and develop excitement about nanotechnology and science in general.\r\n\r\nNon-technical abstract:\r\n\r\nThis project investigates how nanosized systems transform, using the equivalent of stop-action photography to visualize the pathways that nanoscale materials follow.  Novel experimental techniques enabling atomic-scale resolution, real-time measurements are used to capture the first steps in processes fundamental to the efficiency and speed of technologically relevant devices.  The output of this program will be a basic understanding that will potentially enable the engineering of new materials with unique and technologically useful properties. An integrated outreach program will be carried out as part of this project, in which the results of this work will be presented in a non-technical manner to students at an economically-disadvantaged middle school, with the goal of developing student interest in science.",
