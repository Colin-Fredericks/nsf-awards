The investigator\r\nstudies factors that are relevant to the low-frequency\r\nvariability of atmospheric and oceanic flows and that play a role\r\nin climate changes.  He focuses on three sources of atmospheric\r\nand oceanic variability: the wind-driven ocean circulation, the\r\nthermohaline circulation, and the El Nino Southern Oscillations\r\n(ENSO).  The study involves, on the one hand, applications of\r\nexisting mathematical theory to the understanding of the\r\nunderlying problems, and, on the other hand, the further\r\ndevelopment of new mathematical theories -- dynamic transition\r\ntheory, geometric theory for incompressible flows, and attractor\r\nbifurcation theory -- that are applied to the physical problems. \r\nThese new theories also have application to other problems in\r\nnonlinear science and engineering.  The main idea of dynamic\r\ntransition theory is to search for the full set of transition\r\nstates, giving a complete characterization of stability and\r\ntransition.  The set of transition states -- physical \"reality\"\r\n-- is represented by a local attractor.  Following this line,\r\ndynamic transition theory is developed to identify the transition\r\nstates and to classify them both dynamically and physically.  The\r\nproject involves specific collaborations with atmosphere/ocean\r\nscientists in different institutions and includes training of\r\ngraduate students. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies some typical sources of climate\r\nvariability, which, independently and interactively, play a\r\nsignificant role in climate changes.  Wind-driven circulation\r\nplays a role mostly in the oceans' subannual-to-interannual\r\nvariability, the El Nino Southern Oscillations are associated\r\nwith interannual variability, and the thermohaline circulation is\r\nmost important in decadal-to-millenial variability.  The\r\ninvestigator undertakes a careful fundamental-level examination\r\nof these phenomena.  Graduate students are involved in the\r\nproject.  The studies could lead to improved predictions of and\r\nnew insights into weather, climate, and environmental phenomena\r\nof central importance to our economy. \r\n",
