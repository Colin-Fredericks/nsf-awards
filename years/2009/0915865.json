 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to support multi-stage queries by integrating knowledge from across different queries, creating a \"knowledge mosaic.\"   This approach, if successful could radically improve and extend web search from one of primarily fact-finding to one of fact-finding and problem solving using a set of related queries which find pieces of information which are then \"stitched together\" such that relationships and links between the information can be better revealed. The approach to problem-solving becomes one of using a set of related queries which find out portions of information on graph models, building the knowledge mosaic using RDF and other graph-based Semantic Web technologies and extending a proposed new query language SPARQ2L  The resultant view keeps track of what knowledge has been found, and attempts tto combine it in useful ways to provide a more complex knowledge view for the information the user seeks to discover. The research could have pronounced impact on how search and discovery is performed on the web.",
