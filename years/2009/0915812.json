 "awd_abstract_narration": "The staff in trauma centers are faced with complex problems under time pressure.\r\nDespite the introduction of standard protocols, the diversity of injuries that can occur\r\nrequires a coordinated approach to the evaluation and treatment for each patient.\r\nTrauma care involves complex teamwork under time pressure, and teamwork errors\r\nendanger patient care and increase costs. Our proposed ethnographic study will use\r\nobservation and detailed analysis of video recordings of trauma resuscitations to\r\ndetermine the nature and extent of teamwork errors in a trauma center. This detailed\r\nstudy of complex teamwork will uncover the causes of teamwork errors in collaborative\r\nhigh-risk environments. Methods will be developed to understand how teams work and\r\nwhere difficulties arise. This work will yield detailed descriptions of errors and their\r\ncauses, a taxonomy of teamwork errors, information on how to improve team\r\nperformance, and guides to the use of technology for teamwork support. It extends the\r\nlevel of detail of ethnographic research so that we can achieve precision in the\r\nunderstanding of procedures which are difficult to monitor automatically but where\r\nstep-by-step records are essential to detect the causes of errors.\r\nUnderstanding and improving the effectiveness of trauma teams has direct benefit to\r\nsociety. Further, complex collaborations are ubiquitous in modern enterprises and these\r\nresults could improve collaborations both in terms of quality and productivity across\r\norganizations. In addition, this work will serve to develop the skills needed by a new\r\ncadre of researchers with knowledge of computer-supported collaborative work,\r\nvideo-content analysis and cooperative research.",
