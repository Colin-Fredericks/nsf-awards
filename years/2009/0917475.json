The STEM content over the course of the two year project will include a wide variety of topics in all disciplines.  The relationship between art and science will also be a focus.  \r\n\r\nThe NPR radio broadcasts currently reach 1.3 million listeners every week, and that audience is expected to increase.  In addition to that audience, this project will target a new audience of adults under the age of 35 using various cyber platforms and new social networking tools such as Second Life, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.  Audiences will also be reached through remote broadcasts from science centers and art centers around the country. Over 30 science centers will use this project's web content on their own web sites, reaching their audiences as well.  The web content will be translated into Spanish and widely disseminated to Hispanic audiences.  \r\n\r\nEach Friday afternoon, Ira Flatow, the PI will produce and host the nationally broadcast Science Friday radio program interviewing scientists and engineers in a lively engaging format.  In addition, the Science Friday digital media team will be producing and inviting others to create and post digital content and commentary on the Science Friday web site for further dissemination through Second Life, Facebook, as well as other  emerging networking platforms. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation will use a quasi-experimental design to study the appeal of both the radio broadcasts and the cyber-platforms with both older and younger audiences.  Proposed audience impacts include increased STEM knowledge, interest, and behaviors.\r\n\r\nPartner organizations include the Self Reliance Foundation, the New York Hall of Science, LA Theatreworks, and Tribeca Film Festival.",

Independent evaluation of the program&rsquo;s effectiveness shows that listeners regularly seek out more information about the topics they&rsquo;ve heard about on the show. Thanks to NSF support, we have been able to make <em>Science Friday </em>available at little or no cost to stations that cannot afford NPR&rsquo;s carriage fees.&nbsp; In this way, we have been able to ensure that people who aren&rsquo;t regularly exposed to STEM continue to receive news and information about it. &nbsp;<em>Science Friday</em> is one of NPR&rsquo;s most popular programs in broadcast and in podcast: it regularly ranks among iTunes Top 25, and in the top five podcasts in the science/medicine category. We have developed mobile applications for the iPhone, Android and iPad platforms that allow people to listen to <em>Science Friday</em> podcasts and view our SciFri Videos wherever they find themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Radio programs that want to reach &nbsp;new, younger listeners must build a complementary Web presence, which we are doing through our new interactive Web site that will be unveiled in fall 2011. Our goal is to encourage our audience not to limit their science to Friday. Our new motto is: Every day is Science Friday. To catch the attention of younger audiences as well as broaden our impact, we&rsquo;ve expanded our broadcast and online coverage of science and the arts. Besides on-air stories, new content appears every week on our dedicated Web site: www.sciencefriday.com/arts. In the past year, the number of visitors to <a href=\"http://www.sciencefriday.com/arts\">www.sciencefriday.com/arts</a> has risen 125 percent.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve also greatly increased our production of Spanish language multimedia content that we feature on <em>Ciencia Cierta,</em> <a href=\"http://www.sciencefriday.com/spanish\">www.sciencefriday.com/spanish</a>.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a Spanish speaker, <em>Ciencia Cierta </em>brings you news stories and videos that focus on science facts, rather than opinion. <em>Science Friday</em> also cultivates active communities of science enthusiasts and fans of the program in popular social communities. <em>Science Friday </em>has more than 147,000 followers on Twitter and more than 30,000 on Facebook.<em> </em></p>\n<p>Additionally,<em> Science Friday </em>is unique among public radio broadcasts in that it always has offered an online education resource at no charge. Are you a teacher, a homeschooling parent, or a student who is looking for STEM enrichment activities?&nbsp; For you, <em>Science Friday</em> has produced Teachers&rsquo; TalkingScience, free online science lessons targeted at middle school and each based on one of our popular SciFri Videos. Teachers&rsquo; TalkingScience attracts more than 1,700 visitors a month and individual lessons are downloaded in the range of 500 to 1,500 times annually.&nbsp; You can find Teachers&rsquo; TalkingScience at <a href=\"http://www.talkingscience.org/teachers\">www.talkingscience.org/teachers</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/06/2011<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ira&nbsp;Flatow</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/0917475/0917475_10028572_1315325816749_sikids_nsf--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/0917475/0917475_10028572_1315325816749_sikids_nsf--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A still from a Science Friday Web video, &quot;Young Inventors Soup Up a Wheelchair&quot;\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/0917475/0917475_10028572_1315325816749_sikids_nsf--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A still from a Science Friday Web video, &quot;Young Inventors Soup Up a Wheelchair&quot;\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two students from Staten Island Technical High School\"s \"Team TechSmart\" work on a new invention in the school basement.
