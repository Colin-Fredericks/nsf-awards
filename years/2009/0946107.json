 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is concerned with extraordinary attacks mounted by nation-state adversaries for strategic gain.  Recent events demonstrate the vulnerability of banking from cascaded effects, such as the sub-prime lending disaster. Banks have done reasonably well in protecting themselves from sophisticated criminals; losses have been growing, but are tolerable. It is expected that banking will continue to be effective against ordinary cyber attacks as part of the cost of doing business. A workshop will be held to develop set of representative worst-case strategic cyber attack scenarios and the options the nation may need to mitigate the effects of those scenarios. Key issues that will be addressed, include: worst case scenarios; factors contributing most to dame; long and shot term steps to reduce risk, early recognition of attacks; way to speed recovery; and ways to thwart attack.  A summary of the report will be made publicly available online.",
