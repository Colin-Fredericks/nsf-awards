Besides improving the understanding of some\r\nimportant problems, an aim of the project is to help improve the\r\nnumerical simulations of phenomena which bear many societal and\r\nindustrial applications.  The parts of this project related to\r\nmeteorology and oceanography focus on the issue of open boundary\r\nconditions for limited domain simulations, and well-posedness\r\nissues for meteorology and oceanography in the absence of\r\nviscosity.  Other parts of the project relate to the study of\r\nsingular perturbations, that is, calculations in the presence of\r\nsmall coefficients strongly affecting the equations, and\r\ntheoretical issues in turbulence.\r\n\r\n     Numerical simulations for weather forecasts are usually done\r\nin a limited area around the region of interest; such\r\ncomputations include the usual weather forecasts, or forecasts in\r\nextreme situations, like a hurricane, or the study of\r\ndesertification.  Similar geographically local questions arise in\r\noceanography, for example, the study of an estuary.  An important\r\nissue for limited areas is the choice of the boundary conditions\r\non the nonphysical parts of the boundary that are artificially\r\ncreated for the sake of the computations.  This issue becomes\r\nmore crucial as better computers allow more refined (more\r\nprecise) calculations.  Inappropriate boundary conditions may\r\ncreate incorrect waves (or winds), which may result for instance\r\nin incorrect precipitation forecasts.  The investigator and his\r\ncolleagues tackle this problem by theoretical and computational\r\napproaches.  They work in close collaboration with geoscientists\r\nto ensure the practical relevance of the project.  The project\r\nalso includes strong cross-training of students and postdocs in\r\ngeosciences and mathematics.\r\n",
