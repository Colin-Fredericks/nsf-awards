 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nUnder the term of this award, the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) will perform infrastructure improvements to facilities of the Arecibo Observatory in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, at which the cornerstone research instrument is the 1000-ft diameter Arecibo telescope. As the world's largest single-dish radio/radar telescope and most powerful radar system, the Observatory enables forefront research in the areas of astronomy, planetary studies, and space and atmospheric sciences by providing unique capabilities and state-of-the-art instrumentation for data collection and analysis to its multidisciplinary user community.\r\n\r\nTo address critical safety needs, environmental compliance and energy efficiency at its facilities, NAIC will replace outdated air conditioning systems, upgrade fire detection and suppression systems, and perform a structural condition survey of the telescope to inspect and redress potential safety or structural deficiencies. In addition, this award supports refurbishment of the S-band planetary radar transmitter, including replacement of its klystron amplifier tubes, which are urgently needed to maintain reliable, full-power operations. These infrastructure investments are pertinent to reducing future operations costs of the facility, to ensuring the safety of staff and visitors at the Observatory, and to maintaining efficient, environmentally complaint, and reliable science operations. \r\n\r\nNAIC will also acquire a 12-meter-class steerable radio antenna needed for Arecibo Observatory's participation in phase-referenced very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations, including worldwide collaborations that enable astronomers across continents to correlate observational data to achieve the highest resolution images of cosmic radio sources. Moreover, the antenna will be used as a teaching instrument, particularly in partnership with the University of Puerto Rico-Humacao, to engage students and faculty in astronomical research and instrumentation and to enhance technical workforce development in the region. Plans to make the antenna remotely controllable will potentially extend these educational collaborations to other Puerto Rican and mainland institutions.",
