 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nRobotic Sensor Networks (RSNs) are finding increasing use in critical\r\napplications such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, emergency\r\nresponse and search-and-rescue. With recent advances in embedded\r\ntechnologies, devices that can be used as RSN units are becoming available\r\nfor everyday use. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis project focuses on pursuit-evasion games where one or more\r\npursuers tries to \"capture\" an evader who, in turn, tries to avoid\r\ncapture. Robust, provably correct solutions to many RSN \r\ntasks (such as coverage and connectivity) can be obtained by modeling them as pursuit-evasion games.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions to pursuit-evasion games usually assume that\r\n(i) all players can observe each other at all times and (ii) there is\r\na centralized authority that coordinates all pursuers. Hence, such\r\nsolutions are not applicable for modeling RSN applications where the\r\nnetwork faces severe sensing and communication limitations. The\r\nprimary goals of the proposed work are to understand the effect of these\r\nlimitations on the outcome of the game, and to design strategies to\r\novercome them. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nSensing and actuation are expected to play significant roles in the\r\nevolution of information technology and the Internet. This\r\nresearch will contribute to this evolution in two major ways. First,\r\nit will deliver algorithms, tools and techniques to address\r\ncommunication, sensing and actuation issues simultaneously. Second,\r\nit will help scientists and engineers participating in this development acquire a broad\r\nrange of skills in areas such as algorithms, perception, robotics and communications. This\r\nwill be achieved through outreach programs and by incorporating this research in PI's courses.\r\n",
