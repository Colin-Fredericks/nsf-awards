 "awd_abstract_narration": "In most primate species, the members of one sex migrate around the time of puberty, leaving their birth group and attempting to join another group in which they then reproduce. Decisions about when, where, and with whom to migrate are possibly the most important decisions that these individuals make, because they have tremendous impact on risk of death, as well as access to breeding opportunities. In white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus), males migrate multiple times, whereas females remain in their birth groups. Males migrate either singly or with allies. Because new immigrants who take over the alpha male position often kill infants, it may be expected that the presence of recent immigrants is a source of stress for females as well as males. \r\n\tThis project, a continuation of an 18-year study documenting the life histories of 107 white-faced capuchin monkeys in 11 social groups, will collect demographic and behavioral data, as well as genetic and hormonal data (collected non-invasively from feces) to access the factors that contribute to migration strategies for males, and counter-strategies for females trying to protect their offspring from new immigrants who might kill the infants. Extensive behavioral records will enable testing of hypotheses regarding the effects of relationship quality, play experience and personality on the effectiveness of particular migration tactics.\r\n         The Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project will provide year-long internships to 18 students, preparing them for graduate school and conservation jobs. The project also provides research opportunities for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. The PI and the long-term research assistants serve as consultants to the Costa Rican Park Service and local landowners by providing recommendations for reforestation and ways to mitigate the negative effects of development and tourism on wildlife. Project staff members also create educational materials and give presentations on conservation at primary schools near the study site.",
