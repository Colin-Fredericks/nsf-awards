 "awd_abstract_narration": "0853777\r\nKeidar\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to study the plasma mechanism for synthesizing ultra-long single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) in an arc discharge. Their combination of stiffness and toughness makes SWNTs the strongest known fibers.  Ultra-long SWNTs (lengths more than 10,000 times larger than their diameters) are expected to enable micro-electric motors and can act as useful nanoscale cables for conducting electricity or heat.  Mass production and use will depend on understanding the science behind their synthesis.\r\n\r\nA possible manufacturing route has been inspired by the recent finding that length might be controlled by a magnetic field in arc-discharge synthesis. The present research studies plasma parameters and the resulting nanotube length distribution, aiming both to understand the effect of the magnetic field and to find the best conditions for synthesis of ultra-long nanotubes. The main distinguishing factor of this study is that the problem of the SWNT synthesis will be approached from the basic analysis of synthesis and rather than by trial and error.  A state-of-the-art Langmuir probe technique will significantly expand the limited data on plasma parameters during atmospheric arc discharge. The arc discharge and the plasma interactions with carbon nanotubes will be modeled using previously developed fluid codes. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project has both fundamental and technological significance. The fundamental significance is that understanding of the arc discharge and SWNT formation mechanism will be greatly expanded. The technological significance lies in exploring the possibility of controlling SWNT synthesis, enhancing SWNT yield, and ultimately paving the way for mass production and industrial utilization. \r\n\r\nBeyond the fundamental and technological significance, this work will serve as an excellent vehicle for undergraduate and graduate education in the field of nanotechnology and plasma science. To involve women and under-represented minorities, the PIs will work closely with student organizations at George Washington like the Society of Women Engineers. In addition, undergraduate students will be engaged in the research.",
