The overarching goal of the project is to identify actionable strategies to increase domestic student enrollments. Specifically, this study will address why the percentage of domestic students pursuing a PhD in engineering has steadily declined, what factors inhibit domestic undergraduates from enrolling in PhD programs, and what changes would make PhD programs more attractive to domestic students. In order to attract more domestic students, universities need an empirical understanding of the factors that underlie the decision to pursue or forego an engineering PhD. This new understanding can form the basis for a new set of strategies for increasing domestic engineering PhD enrollments and graduates needed by universities and industry.\r\n",
