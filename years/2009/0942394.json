 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nUnderwater acoustic communication presents severe challenges that are significantly different from the challenges of terrestrial electromagnetic communications.  The low speed of sound and limited bandwidth and the ocean's motion due to waves, currents, and tides lead to large delay spread, frequency-dependent Doppler shift, and high time variability of the channel.  The approach used in this research is to directly perform data detection without first equalizing the received signal.  The research tasks are to:  (i) design a statistical detector, based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, for the underwater acoustic channel with goals of high performance and low complexity; and (ii) develop signal processing algorithms for adaptive identification and tracking of the underwater acoustic channel.  Measured experimental data provided by collaborators are used to validate and evaluate the techniques.\r\n\r\nWith respect to intellectual merit, the research seeks to develop and evaluate novel low-complexity statistical detection methods for underwater acoustic channels, with the goal of approaching the performance of the optimal maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE).  If successful, the technique could significantly reduce inter-symbol interference in underwater acoustic channels and would be more robust under highly variable channel conditions in comparison to existing methods.\r\n\r\nWith respect to broader impacts, the proposed research has the potential to transform the design of next-generation acoustic modems.  Such acoustic modems are used for scientific applications, such as oceanography and environmental monitoring, and security applications, such as port monitoring.  The project also introduces related research experiences in Signals and Systems, Digital Signal Processing, Coding, Software Radio, and Digital Communication courses.",
