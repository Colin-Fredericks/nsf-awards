The academy is an honors program for incoming freshmen that wish to major in mathematics, biology or chemistry.  There are two options available; a two year scholarship for juniors who can complete the STEM major and the required education requirements within two years and, a three year scholarship for those who will require an additional year of study beyond the two years required to complete the STEM major in order to complete the education requirements.  Seniors who can complete the STEM and certification within two years are also eligible for the first option. Twenty one students are receiving annual scholarships of $11,000 for two years and eight students are receiving three year scholarships for a total of sixty six annual scholarships of $11,000 each.\r\n\r\nThe Teacher Academy is an outgrowth of a prior CUNY Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher preparation and also benefits from the New York City Alliance for Minority Participation in STEM supported Bridge to Teaching Program.  The Middle Schools and High Schools New York City School District 31 Staten Island are partners in this Noyce project.",
