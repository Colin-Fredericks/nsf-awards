Research goals are to investigate the structure and activity of augertoxins and turritoxins derived from venomous marine snails. These disulfide-rich neuropeptides are expected to demonstrate ion channel and central nervous system activity. The education and outreach goals include developing a suite of programmatic materials on the diversity of marine snails and the complexity of their peptide toxins. These materials will be developed in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History. The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program supported postdoctoral and professional development models that combined research expertise with professional service. Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellows are eligible to apply for this Faculty Development Award.",
