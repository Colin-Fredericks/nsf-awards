 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract of Proposal 0845042\r\n\r\nCAREER: Malware Immunization and Forensics Based on Another Sense of Self\r\n\r\nXinyuan Wang, George Mason University\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite recent advances in malware defense, computer malwares\r\n(e.g., virus, worm, botnets, rootkit, spyware) continue to pose\r\nserious threats to all computers and networks. Besides being more\r\ndamaging, modern malwares (e.g., blue pill, agobot) are becoming \r\nincreasingly stealthy and evasive. This has made it increasingly \r\ndifficult to protect our computer systems and networks from malwares \r\nand ensure the trustworthiness of our mission critical systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur natural immune systems are very effective in protecting our \r\nbody from intrusions by (almost endless) variations of pathogens. \r\nOur immunities depend on the ability to distinguish our own cells \r\n(i.e., \"self\") from all others (i.e., \"non-self\"). Inspired by the \r\nself-nonself discrimination in the natural immune systems, this \r\nresearch explores a new direction in building artificial malware \r\nimmunization and malware forensics capabilities based on \"another \r\nsense of self\", which is essentially a unique mark to be assigned \r\nto the programs to be protected. Based on such an actively assigned \r\n\"another sense of self\", the \"immunized\" program is able to \r\ndetect application level malwares effectively and efficiently. In\r\naddition, the actively assigned \"another sense of self\" enables\r\nnew malware forensics capabilities that were not possible before.\r\nSince the artificial malware immunization technique does not require \r\nany specific knowledge of the malwares, it has the potential to be \r\neffective against new and previously unknown malwares. The new \r\nartificial malware immunization techniques and tools to be developed \r\ncould automatically make many applications (e.g., Web server) immune \r\nto many malwares and thus greatly improve the trustworthiness of \r\ncomputer systems.",
