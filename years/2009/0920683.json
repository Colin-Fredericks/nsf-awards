 "awd_abstract_narration": "Respiration in insects is characterized by prolonged periods (in some cases up to several hours) in which no exchange of gases occurs and this pattern differs strongly from respiratory patterns in most mammals in which breath-holding is restricted to seconds or, at most, a few minutes. This research project will examine the relationship between metabolic rate and respiratory pattern in three representative insect species. Temperature, feeding, and atmospheric oxygen will be systematically varied as a means of producing varying ratios of metabolic output to oxygen availability. Under these controlled conditions, the pattern of respiration will be examined using flow-through respirometry. Release of carbon dioxide and water will be measured on a second-to-second basis. Specifically, this research will test the hypothesis that the critical factor in insect respiratory control is the regulation of internal oxygen levels as opposed to the reduction of water loss. The research will be conducted in conjunction with a graduate student engaged in her doctoral research, and with undergraduate students participating in the University of California, Irvine Excellence in Research program. Insects have major negative impacts on human society as vectors of disease and as destroyers of our food crops. The respiratory system of insects is both anatomically and physiologically distinct from that of mammals. As such, it is an excellent target for improved and safer insect control mechanisms. The proposed research will investigate how environmental factors impact the regulation and control of breathing in insects. The results should be of use in our ongoing attempts to disrupt insect breathing and metabolism as a means of controlling insect pests.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInsects have major impacts on society through the transmission of diseases such as malaria and West Nile virus, and through their effects on agriculture as crop pests.  Insect control is therefore a major issue in protecting public health and food security.  Our projects examined several aspects of insect physiology with the goal of producing new methods for insect control.\n\n                An understanding of insect physiology and ecology is central to insect control technologies.  We investigated and published papers in the scientific literature on the control of metabolism and breathing in insects.  The insect\u00c6s respiratory system is fundamentally different from that of mammals.  Those differences can be exploited to control insects in a manner safe for mammals, including livestock and human populations.  We also examined the mechanisms by which insects resist thermal stress, since elevated temperatures are used to control insects, for example in granaries. \n\n                We have elucidated additional specific control mechanisms for metabolism and breathing in insects.  These advances will prove useful in generating novel insect control mechanisms and procedures.  Two of the insects we concentrated our studies on are the vectors of very important human diseases.  One is Culex tarsalis, the major vector of encephalitis in the western U.S.  The second is Rhodnius prolixus which is the vector Chagas disease, an incurable, human disease endemic in South America.  Our studies provide important information vital to the control of these two vectors of human disease.\n\n                As part of this research, I trained four scientists who have now completed their PhDs.  All four are female, an important contribution given the skewed sex ratio in technical fields in the sciences.  Every one of these scientists has remained in science, one as a high school teacher, one as a biological consultant, and two as academic scientists at universities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy J Bradley"
