 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing numbers of scientific projects leverage mobile devices to monitor and at times interact with elements of the natural environment.  This important emerging trend however is not paired with an adequate forum for publication and exchange of information among researchers as that of other disciplines. This workshop gathers a representative sample of researchers and practitioners with expertise and interest in human-environment, mobile-based interactions. It provides a forum to present current technology trends in areas such as networking, communication, sensing, data mining, data visualization and robotics as well as discussions on synergistic applications. In addition to the presentations, the workshop participants are meeting to identify and plan sessions for presentations at future conferences.\r\n\r\nImpacts of this workshop are expected in mobile and sensing technologies as well as in application areas including biology, agronomy, environmental science, public health and citizen science. The workshop invitees are drawn from diverse areas and social-ethic backgrounds. The presentation abstracts of the workshop will be disseminated through the workshop website, http://hembi.media.mit.edu.",
