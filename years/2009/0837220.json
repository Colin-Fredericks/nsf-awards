 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \r\n\r\nThe major goal of the project is developing a semester-long laboratory course in biomolecular chemistry that emphasizes the research process by actively involving students in question formulation, data gathering, critical analysis, team work, and communication in a guided-inquiry format. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has been revolutionized by significant advances in molecular biology, genetic engineering, computer science, and information technology. With the knowledge base increasing explosively and techniques and equipment becoming out-dated rapidly, problem solving, constant questioning, critical thinking, analysis, and team-work abilities are critical for continued scientific and economic progress and for the next generation of students to successfully compete globally. \r\n\r\nThis lab course familiarizes students with biochemistry/molecular biology techniques through a series of open-ended experiments designed to guide students to become progressively more independent and culminate in a student-developed original research project. Appropriate learning and teaching assessments are incorporated throughout the project and necessary iterative changes are being made. More active involvement in research can increase the interest of students in scientific careers and alleviate the shortage of students entering careers in STEM fields. A majority of students (55-65%) in BS programs in Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Pharmaceutical Chemistry at Michigan Technological University are women, 7-8% are African-American and Hispanic; thus this project has a significant positive impact on groups underrepresented in these fields. This project improves the teaching of undergraduates, especially underrepresented groups, increases the interest of students to pursue careers in science, and advances the field of education research.",
