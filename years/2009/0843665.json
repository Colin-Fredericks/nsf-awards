 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change will alter key aspects of the environment for plants, such as temperature and water availability. Very little is known about how plants will contend with these changes, particularly species that are difficult to study, such as long-lived tropical trees. This project examines short-term physiological responses and the potential for long-term evolutionary changes in response to experimental manipulations of precipitation in populations of a tropical oak species that occur in different climates in Central America.  The project investigates the extent to which these populations are adapted to the climate they currently experience and their potential response to climates that are similar to those predicted for the future. New insights will be gained as to whether impacts of climate change at the seedling stage enhance or constrain adaptation at later life stages of the tree. In addition, the research will identify the physiological and genetic mechanisms that enhance or limit adaptation to altered climates in this tropical tree. The project fosters the education, mentoring, and training of undergraduates, doctoral students, and a postdoctoral associate in plant ecological physiology and quantitative genetics at the University of Minnesota and at the University of Zamorano (Honduras). This work offers unique training and mentoring opportunities for Latin American undergraduates and para-taxonomists in Honduras and Costa Rica. It will also develop a collaborative, interdisciplinary network between researchers at the University of Minnesota, Cornell University, the University of Zamorano in Honduras, the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste in Costa Rica, and the Center for Ecosystem Studies (CIEco-UNAM) in Mexico.",
