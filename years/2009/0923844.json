 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create innovations in the science and application of polymer doping, fiber drawing, and bundling technology. Research will be conducted to shrink fiber diameter limits to submicron dimensions, to dramatically reduce diameter fluctuations, to increase pixel density, to increase array size, to reduce manufacturing time, and to improve array quality. Experiments will be performed to develop novel methods of doping polymer with higher concentrations of quantum dots and other nanoparticles. Additionally, a ribbon array cutting machine and a microwell fabrication apparatus will be developed. The current glass-based fiber optic technology is expensive, has limited functionality, and cannot be used in some applications. The company's proposed polymer products will be better replacements for current glass products, not only because of lower fabrication costs, but because of the increased functionality polymers provide, as well. \r\n\r\nThe innovations from this Phase II program will have significant scientific, technological, and social benefits. For example, in the fields of biological investigations, genomic studies, new pharmaceutical development, and detection of biological agents, polymer fiber optic arrays will increase the efficiency and integrity of high speed analyses for high throughput parallel experimentation. This program will also advance scientific understanding of the dynamics of Qdot and nanopartical dopants in polymers, providing fundamental benefits to the scientific literature for nonlinear optical polymer dynamics, as well as new methods to exploit quantum phenomena in mesoscopic devices. The commercialization of cost-effective, reliable microstructured fibers provides equipment manufacturers a pathway to supply new products of high impact to medical, information technology, and retail markets.",
