 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, the Scholars in Math and Science (SIMS), addresses the continued under representation of minorities in both the STEM and health science fields.  Two cohorts of six to eight students are granted scholarships; the first group for four years and the second for three years with the last year paid for by the school.  Based on a comprehensive literature review, seven key actions are done to ensure student recruitment and success. These are (1) target recruitment at partnering high schools with help from guidance counselors and at the area free clinic, (2) pre-freshman orientation and first-year seminar, (3) a bridge program between high school and college, (4) mentoring, research or internship experience, (5) tutoring, in this case peer led learning sessions for gateway courses such as general and organic chemistry, physics and calculus, (6) career counseling and awareness, and (7) financial assistance. The broader impacts are that students in the same courses as the Scholars benefit from the same support services and the results of this project are being professionally disseminated.",
