 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most real software systems consist of modules developed in\r\nmultiple programming languages. Different languages differ in their\r\nsecurity assumptions and guarantees. Consequently, even if single\r\nmodules are secure in some language model and with respect to some\r\nsecurity policy, there is usually no uniform security guarantee on a\r\nwhole multilingual system.  This project focuses on low-overhead\r\ntechniques for providing security guarantees to software systems in\r\nwhich type-safe languages such as Java interoperate with native code.\r\nNative code is developed in low-level languages including C, C++, and\r\nassembly languages.  Although often used in software projects, native\r\ncode is notoriously insecure and is a rich source of security\r\nvulnerabilities.  The PIs are developing a two-layered approach to\r\nalleviating security threats posed by native code to type-safe\r\nlanguages: (1) Binary rewriting tools and their verifiers are being\r\nincorporated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for rewriting and\r\nverifying native modules at the machine-instruction level to enforce\r\nsecurity policies; (2) A safe dialect of C for interoperation with\r\nJava is being designed; with the help of programmer annotations, the\r\nsafety of programs in this dialect can be statically verified.  The\r\noutcome of this project will enable popular platforms such as the JVM\r\nand .NET and other major programming languages (e.g., Python, OCaml,\r\netc.) to incorporate native modules safely.  The developed principles\r\nwill also be applicable to web browsers and operating systems in which\r\nthere is a need of extending them with untrusted low-level modules\r\nwithout comprising host security.",
