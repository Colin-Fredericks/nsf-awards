 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER award is for an exploratory, high-risk, high-payoff effort to develop a novel instrument for dark matter detection. Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary Dark Matter particles that do not emit or absorb light. The leading hypothesis for the nature of dark matter is that it consists of new elementary particles produced moments after the Big Bang, generally referred to as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. One way to detect them in an Earth-bound experiment is to measure the low energy nuclear recoils they produce in rare interactions with normal matter. This group will develop small NaI and liquid xenon detectors that can be installed in the Solar Neutrino Borexino detector, at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory, Italy, for a dark matter search. \r\n\r\nThe detector would be inserted through existing plumbing tubes into the center of the Borexino liquid scintillator. When positioned in the Borexino scintillator, the background in the small detector due to external sources of gamma rays and neutrons will be negligible. The Borexino scintillator also serves as a very efficient anti-coincidence detector to veto internal gamma and neutron backgrounds that originate and scatter within the small detector and in the Borexino scintillator. A 10-kg detector with the combination of low backgrounds from external and internal sources should have sufficient sensitivity to test the validity of the reported DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal.   \r\n\r\nFor Broader Impacts, this proposal addresses one of the major scientific questions of our time, the nature of dark matter in the universe. As a cross-disciplinary topic it also has an impact on advanced detector technology.  The PI has a commitment to involving undergraduates in his research projects.\r\n",

However, the observed amplitude of the D-L modulation appears to be inconsistent with the results of other direct detection dark matter experiments that use detectors based on  xenon (LUX) and germanium (CDMS).  Since the signal can depend on the target a new experiment with sodium iodide detectors is needed to confirm or refute the D-L evidence for dark matter detection.\n\n \n\nThe EAGER grant supported the development of new NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors that would be more sensitive to dark matter events than D-L.   The goal of the new experiment is a detector with lower background in the energy region of interest (2-6 keV) and lower threshold energy than 2 keV, achieved by D-L.  To achieve these goals the new experiment features a liquid scintillator veto detector that surrounds the NaI(Tl) crystal modules to provides additional background suppression of radiation from crystal radioactivity, external gamma rays, and cosmic rays.

Their sensitivity to potassium now approaches 1 ppb, a significant improvement over gamma ray counting that reached 35 ppb sensitivity after several months of gamma ray counting with 5-kg samples.     The enhanced sensitivity of mass spectroscopy enabled rapid testing and improvement in methods to achieve crystals with low radioactivity.\n\n \n\nThe main outcome of the EAGER research was the eventual production of a 2-kg NaI(Tl) crystal with a potassium impurity of 9 ppb.

The low level of potassium in combination with additional background reduction with the liquid scintillator veto will result in an overall background reduction of  a factor of ten compared to the D-L background.  Addition improvements are expected to reduce the potasium and other impurities, based on studies of sources of contamination and tests of chemical purification of the sodium iodide powder.  A potassium level as low as 1 ppb in the final crystals may be possible.\n\n \n\nThe reduction of potassium summarized above are based on mass spec..."
