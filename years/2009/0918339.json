 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe project A Digital Resource for Developing Mathematics Teachers' TPCK is developing and conducting initial tests of a highly innovative interactive digital textbook to enhance middle grades mathematics teachers' understanding of core concepts in proportionality and their understanding of ways that technology can be used to enhance instruction. The project is led by professionals from SRI International with substantial contributions by mathematics educators at San Diego State University, San Francisco State University, the Singapore National Institute of Education, and the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST).\r\n\r\nThe digital textbook combines elements from SimCalc, Geometer's Sketchpad, and data analysis software to teach core ideas of proportionality from algebraic, geometric, and statistical perspectives.  It also includes elements designed to help teachers see the connections among those uses of proportional reasoning and the ways that such tools can be used in classroom instruction with middle school students.\r\n\r\nThe basic hypothesis of the project is that the proposed DynaBook will be a highly effective tool for mathematics teacher preparation and professional development and, ultimately, for classroom instruction of middle school students.  Pilot tests in laboratory, teacher preparation, and professional development settings are providing initial empirical evidence about two core research questions:\r\n\r\n*  In what ways does the DynaBook effectively support teacher learning of   \r\n   pedagogical and technological content knowledge?\r\n\r\n*  Does the DynaBook foster teachers' understanding of the coherence and \r\n   connectedness of middle school mathematics?\r\n\r\nThis project explores very promising new forms of instructional materials with potential to transform the ways that we think about educational texts and teaching strategies.",

With regard to empirical results, we found that preservice teachers could not be assumed to be \"digital natives,\" with knowledge and confidence to use and apply technology in classroom situations. Preservice teachers lacked sufficient depth of content knowledge, had weak understanding of how to engage students in mathematical practices, and lacked knowledge of how to use technology specifically for teaching mathematics. We found preservice teachers could make rapid and measurable content knowledge gains from a well-designed digital resource, and that technology could be used to create experiences for teachers which engaged them in thinking about relationships between mathematical practices and pedagogy.

Both had advantages, and we found we could preserve both possibilities by organizing content into a matrix (of mathematics topics vs. modes of engagement) and also allowing instructors to create a linear path in the form of \"an assignment\" for preservice teachers to do.

A \"teacher educator network\" was initiated and used to understand requirements for more broadly sharing the tools and outcomes.
