Most subjects of the planned research revolve\r\naround geometry of group actions on various spaces and geometric\r\nstructures on manifolds, as well as geometry of buildings.  The\r\nresearch planned by Kapovich covers geometry of buildings with\r\napplications to representation theory, in particular, Kapovich\r\nintends to continue his study of the geometry of the moduli\r\nspaces of polygonal linkages in symmetric spaces and buildings in\r\nrelation to the algebraic groups. Other topics of research\r\ninclude discrete groups in algebraic groups (in particular, the\r\ncoherence problem for arithmetic lattices), real-projective and\r\ncomplex-projective structures.\r\n\r\nGroups appear naturally as symmetries of mathematical and\r\nphysical objects, like wall-patterns, minerals, snowflakes and,\r\nultimately, the entire universe.  This project studies relation\r\nbetween algebraic properties of groups and geometry of spaces for\r\nwhich groups appear as symmetries. This two-way relation is\r\nbeneficial for both group theory (which is a part of algebra) and\r\ngeometry. An example of such relation is provided by the theory\r\nof \"buildings.\" Comparing various ways to navigate in buildings\r\ncan be mathematically described in terms of certain inequalities.\r\nSuch inequalities in turn provide answers to various questions\r\nabout symmetry groups of buildings.\r\n",
