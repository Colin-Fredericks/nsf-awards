Load measurements from this implant will facilitate development of better cartilage regeneration techniques, techniques to modify rehabilitation, and will allow patient specific adjustment to factors such as load distribution changes in the lateral and medial compartments of the knee. The scientific merit and technical impact of this project lies in the understanding of the relationship between load and knee cartilage tissue regeneration documented during the study.  The load vs. tissue response information will have a broad range of clinical and basic science uses promoting studies leading to faster more complete recovery from surgical procedures.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated impact of this particular study includes: a) on the Orthopaedic field will be to demonstrate the value of patient and joint specific load information on decisions related to rehabilitation following surgery, b) on the Bioengineering community at large will be to show that it is critical to determine loading when developing tissue regeneration techniques, and c) on human resources will be to directly educate 1 graduate student funded by this project, to educate at least 12 undergraduates who will work on various specific aspects of the project and to enlighten several medical students and residents about the value of understanding the relationship between loading and tissue formation.",
