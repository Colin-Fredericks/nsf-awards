 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nIn this project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will perform a systematic study of electron and ion transport in solar energetic particle (SEP) events and create a training program for space physicists. The PI will develop an enhanced Monte Carlo approach to follow the propagation of energetic particles by tracing single particle trajectories; examine how the radial dependence of solar wind magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence can affect energetic particle transport; explore various dynamic approximations of solar wind MHD turbulence beyond static quasi-linear theory; and investigate the effects of flux tubes in the solar wind on the transport of energetic particles. This project will include the design and development of a new space physics course to be taught by the PI, improving the space physics curriculum in the Physics Department at the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH).\r\n\r\nThe PI's science investigation will lead to a well documented model which will provide a realistic numerical tool to the community for studying particle transport in SEP events. This model will be useful for operational space weather forecasting, since SEP events are a serious space weather hazard. Studying the transport of SEPs and their interaction with interplanetary plasma in the heliosphere will directly contribute to increased understanding of energetic particle transport in the cosmos. The project's education and training component will directly support two graduate students and several undergraduate students. In addition to curriculum development at UAH, the PI will organize a biannual workshop on recent progress in space weather studies to complement the annual SHINE (Solar, Heliospheric, and INterplanetary Environment) meeting. The PI will provide financial support to interested graduate students throughout the country who apply to attend his workshop.\r\n",
