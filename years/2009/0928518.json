 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal integrates expertise in system dynamics and control with expertise in fluid mechanics and engine modeling to develop a systematic approach to modeling transient phenomena in compressible fluid flow systems.  Such a methodology does not exist today. The successful outcome of this project will be the ability to systematically carry out model order reduction for distributed parameter systems that describe the flow of compressible fluids, in analogy with existing methods available, for example, for mechanical systems.  The ability to develop physically consistent lumped-parameter models of compressible flow systems will enable improvements in the control of energy conversion systems such as internal combustion engines, turbomachinery, fuel cell systems, HVAC and refrigeration systems, leading to better performance, reduced costs and reduced environmental impact. \r\n\r\nThe automotive industry is striving to improve engine fuel economy and to reduce their emissions in view of increasingly stringent government mandates and market demand for vehicles with near-zero exhaust emissions and significantly improved fuel economy. It is well understood that such gains can only be achieved if improvements in engine design can be matched by the ability to closely control engine efficiency and emissions. The present project will lead to better fuel economy and emissions control, but will also significant shorten the development of new, more efficient and cleaner engines. Today, this process is very much ad-hoc and it requires significant amounts of experimental calibration.  The outcome of the proposed project is a systematic and widely applicable methodology that will shorten development time and that will lead to robust engine control designs that will also be easily portable among engine platforms.\r\nThe project involves significant participation of Honor undergraduate students from under-represented groups, and an international collaboration with the University of Stuttgart, Germany.\r\n",
