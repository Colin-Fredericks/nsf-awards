 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many tree-dwelling animals use aerial gliding to escape predators or to locate resources. Wingless arthropods fall from trees with high frequency as \"arthropod rain\", often landing in the unfamiliar and hostile understory. This work combines phylogenetic, ecological, behavioral and aerodynamic approaches to assess the overall biological significance of wingless flight. Morphological and behavioral characteristics relevant to gliding will be measured for a large number of arthropods, and will be mapped onto evolutionary trees to identify correlates of this behavior. Species composition of ants falling from the tree canopy will be compared with those that fail to glide to trees, and instead land in the understory. The research will be conducted at rainforest sites having high arthropod diversity in Peru and Panama. Finally, experiments focusing on one common species of gliding ant will examine mechanisms of aerodynamic control. This is the first study to associate gliding behavior in arthropods with specific selection pressures, and the first to quantify the larger ecological phenomenon of arthropod fallout in rainforests. It will more generally evaluate the biological relevance of gliding behavior for the earth's most diverse lineage, the insects.\r\n\r\nIn a broader context, information gathered in this study will be relevant to the emerging technology of self-righting and maneuverable microair vehicles. The research will include the training of a graduate student at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock (UALR) and field assistants at study sites in Peru and Panama. We will additionally work with historically under-represented undergraduates at UALR (an EPSCOR institution). We will also conduct an outreach component in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences to present our findings to teacher workshops. Our original gliding ant discoveries attracted considerable attention from the popular media and the public at large, and we expect comparable interest in results with other insect gliders.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany insects living high in the canopy of the tropical rainforest accidently fall from the tree, are blown out by the wind, or are chased out by predators.  For adult insects with wings, flight enables a simple recovery.  However, many juvenile insects, as well as those adults that have no wings (e.g., worker ants), can't simply fly away.  Instead, they engage in a remarkable behavior called directed aerial descent, a form of steep maneuvering and gliding that lets them regain the trunk of the tree from which they have fallen.  This research, conducted in tropical rainforests of Panama, Peru, and Costa Rica, together with detailed laboratory experiments at UC-Berkeley, has revealed the aerodynamic mechanisms by which wingless insects can engage in such remarkable aerial performance.  Ants, for example, glide backwards and use their hindlegs to steer, just as human skydivers use small hand motions to control their spin and orientation.  We have carried out three-dimensional reconstructions of ant gliding trajectories as they fall from large trees in the Amazon, and have coupled these studies with drop tests of ants into the vertical jet of a small portable wind tunnel, using high-speed video in both cases to reveal the control mechanisms that lets them right themselves and steer during falling.  Moreover, not just many ant species but many different kinds of larval insects that have no wings can carry out these amazing controlled glides.  This behavior is confined to diurnal taxa, is visually based, and has evolved independently numerous times.  We further demonstrated adverse consequences for these animal gliders when landing in the understory or in water (as in the flooded forests of the Amazon); this outcome enhanced predation (mostly by ground-dwelling ants) and increased mortality relative to successful directed aerial descent.  It is also highly relevant to the evolutionary origins of insect flight, as we discovered in the course of fieldwork that primitive and ancestrally wingless relatives of the winged insects (i.e., bristletails) also exhibit this capacity for aerial maneuverability.  The origins of flight, in other words, likely preceded the evolution of wings, and a similar story may have pertained to the initial stages of flight in birds, bats, and pterosaurs.  Fully developed wings are clearly not necessary for controlled aerial behaviors, and this result may also be relevant to design of microair vehicles that can both flap and run along the ground (an ongoing research project in collaboration with engineers at UC-Berkeley).  Using a towing tank and scaled physical models of tropical ants, we have also determined at UC-Berkeley the detailed biomechanical consequences of variation in morphology and limb orientation for the aerodynamic forces and torques produced during directed aerial descent.  Ongoing work in the Berkeley lab with a variety of different species of stick insects has furthermore demonstrated wide variation in righting abilities and gliding performance.  Many of these morphologies and aerodynamic mechanisms may be directly applicable to robotic design for gliding, landing, and hybrid running/flying machines.  The project supported graduate level training for one Ph.D. student at UC-Berkeley, and sponsored over twenty undergraduates working on various aspects of data analysis and collection.  Results have been broadly disseminated in the primary scientific literature, in a variety of popular media, and via informal communications to hundreds of ecotourists annually at our various study sites.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/12/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Dudley"
