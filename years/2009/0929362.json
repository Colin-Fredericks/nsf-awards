 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed planning visit is to further develop research collaboration between Dr. Tasmin Hassan from North Carolina State University, Dr. Prof. Kacem Sai from Ecole Nationale d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Sfax (ENIS) in Tunisia, and Dr. George Cailletaudat from the Ecole de Mines des Paris (PariTech) in France on the topic of next generation material models.  The anticipated outcomes of the planning visit are future collaborative research proposals on this topic. \r\n\r\nOperating loads, pressure and temperature levels of chemical and power generation plants are gradually increasing in order to achieve higher efficiency and to enhance sustainability, thereby reducing environmental impact. Modern alloys and steels are being developed by material scientists to sustain this extreme load environment.  However, many low cycle fatigue (LCF) failure phenomena (e.g., influence of dynamic strain aging on LCF life at various load rates and temperatures) demonstrated by these materials cannot be simulated using existing material models.  Hence, use of new materials in structures and machines requires a new material model for design and analysis.  It is anticipated that the desired material model improvement can be achieved by overcoming deficiencies of the material models developed by Hassan, Sai and Cailletaud and incorporating modeling features such as grain size and boundary, dislocation type and density.\r\n\r\nUsing the proposed travel grant, Hassan and a graduate student from North Carolina State University will visit Sai's research group in Tunisia and Cailletaud's research group in France.  This trilateral cooperation provides the US scientific community with access to facilities and expertise that will enhance research efforts currently underway at North Carolina State University.",
