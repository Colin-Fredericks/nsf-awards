 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF EAGER project is to develop novel prototypes for (1) iconic image analysis and recognition for retrieval, classification annotation, and analysis of iconic digital imagery of Cypriot cultural heritage materials, and (2) searching and exploring the Ancient Cypriot Secretariat Corpus. (The corpus contains works from antiquity to early Christian era written in period text and describing scientific, philosophical, social commentary, etc.)  The project will involve computer scientists, archeologists and art historians from Penn State and The Cyprus Institute. The systems developed will allow users to search for the iconic images in representative of Cypriot culture at various times of history based on such characteristics as image content, shape sketches, and metadata. From the Secretariat Corpus, end-users will be able to search for items belonging to different categories such as daily life at different periods, mythology, religion, politics, language, landscape, events and other categories. Strong support for this project has been pledged by the Cyprus Institute.  The NSF Office of International Science and Engineering will co-sponsor the award.",
