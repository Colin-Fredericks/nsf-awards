 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n Organization of cells into tissues and organs during development is a highly regulated process that requires coordinated cell shape changes and cell migration.  These cell behaviors are directed by rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton.  Abelson (Abl) kinases are key players in relaying signals for rearrangement to the actin cytoskeleton, but the mechanisms by which Abl receives signals from the cell surface and remodels actin during animal development remain unknown.  The overall goal of this project is to characterize the molecular pathways that Abl uses to regulate cell migration and other actin-based processes in vivo.  Drosophila embryos expressing activated Abl provide an ideal model system to elucidate Abl signaling pathways in the context of an organism,  since activated Abl alters cell migration and leads to visible defects in embryonic development. This research program aims to both explore the functions of candidate genes and identify new components of the Abl signaling pathways that modulate cell migration in vivo. These studies will provide significant insights into the molecular pathways that regulate behaviors of individual cells during developmental processes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact.\r\nThis research will be integrated with the training and mentoring of young scientists at both the undergraduate and high school levels.  The overall goals of this program are to provide more young scientists with hands-on research training and to inspire these students to pursue careers in basic research.  Scientific training will be incorporated at the undergraduate level by providing additional opportunities for independent research projects and by integrating aspects of this research program into the laboratory component of Genetics, a core biology course, at Randolph-Macon College.  This project also aims to provide unique inquiry-based experiences to local high school students and high school biology teachers, who will work as teams to investigate aspects of Abl signaling pathways in cell migration.  Opportunities to do original research early in their careers will both challenge and motivate students to pursue additional scientific training. To reach a broader community, the biology teachers will develop a plan for directly translating their inquiry-based experiences in this research program to their high school science courses.\r\n",
