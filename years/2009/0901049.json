 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe investigator's research areas are number theory and representation theory. \u00a0In particular, the investigator studies p-adic Galois representations and p-adic Hodge theory, with an eye towards applications to the modularity of Galois representations and the Langlands program. \u00a0The PI will undertake several projects organized around the theme of p-adic representations and their reduction modulo p. \u00a0He will study the weight in Serre's conjecture for arbitrary split reductive groups and arbitrary number fields, with the goal of giving an explicit Serre weight recipe in considerable generality. \u00a0The investigator will produce evidence for generalizations of the Breuil-Mezard conjecture, and will prove some cases of such a generalization, with applications to the Langlands program. \u00a0Another component of the project involves the explicit reduction modulo p of certain p-adic Galois representations.\r\n\r\nNumber theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. \u00a0At its most fundamental, number theory is the study of whole number solutions to equations, although sophisticated modern techniques can sometimes give the appearance of being rather far-removed from this goal. In recent decades, number theory has had revolutionary applications to the fields of cryptography (creating codes) and cryptanalysis (breaking codes). For instance, most cellular telephone communications are protected by a cryptosystem based on elliptic curves, one of the primary objects of study in the investigator's field. The PI is one of the directors of Canada/USA Mathcamp, a summer program for mathematically talented high school students, and believes it is vital that research-active mathematicians participate in such endeavors.\r\n\r\n",
