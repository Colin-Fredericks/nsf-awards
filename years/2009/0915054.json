 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many scientific disciplines today, a community of users is working\r\ntogether to assemble, revise, and curate a shared data repository.  As\r\nthe community accumulates knowledge and the database content evolves\r\nover time, it may contain conflicting information and members can\r\ndisagree on the information it should store.  Relational database\r\nmanagement systems (RDBMS) today can help these communities manage\r\ntheir shared data, but provide limited support for managing\r\nconflicting facts and conflicting opinions about the correctness of\r\nthe stored data.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a Belief Database System (BeliefDB) that allows\r\nusers to express belief annotations. These annotations can be positive\r\n(agreement) or negative (disagreement), and can be of higher order\r\n(belief annotations about other belief annotations).  The approach\r\nallows users to have a structured discussion about the database\r\ncontent and annotations.  A BeliefDB gives annotations a clearly\r\ndefined semantics that lets a relational database understand and\r\nmanage them efficiently.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merits: (i) Definition of a Belief Database Model: The\r\nproject develops a formalism that extends a relational database with\r\nbelief annotations on data and on previously inserted annotations.\r\n\r\n(ii) Design of a Belief Query Language: The project complements the\r\ndata model with a new query language that extends SQL.  (iii)\r\nDevelopment of a canonical Belief Database Representation: The\r\nprojects develops approaches to store and manipulate belief databases\r\non top of a conventional RDBMS.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: Curated databases and shared data repositories are\r\nbecoming widespread in the scientific communities.  A BeliefDB\r\nprovides a new data management system that addresses the need of these\r\ncommunities to manage conflicting data. If successful, the project\r\nwill be one of the pieces that will help data management technology\r\nundergo a new paradigm shift, from managing data as content, to\r\nsupporting a community of users in collaboratively creating partly\r\nconflicting database contents.\r\n\r\nFor further information on the project see the project web page::\r\nhttp://db.cs.washington.edu/beliefDB/\r\n",

They must also handle inaccurate, conflicting, and evolving data with extended user discussions and documentation. Large-scale shared data repositories are increasingly common in many sciences including astronomy, coastal and environmental sciences, earth sciences, coastal and environmental scientists, and many more. They can be also seen in non-scientific collaborative communities such as social networks, knowledge generating communities, even in web forums on role-playing games. The BeliefDB project developed fundamental techniques to enable users to understand, manage, and represent different possible belief worlds of what should be in the database and to have a structured argumentation over the database content and each other's annotations.\n\nThe project had several outcomes, which can be classified in six categories:\n\nRepresenting and reconciling conflicting data.  A framework called BeliefDB was developed under which every fact in a relational database can be annotated with a statement saying which agent believed that fact.  An extension of a relational query language (e.g. SQL) can than specify which agents' beliefs are to be retrieved.  Queries in this extended language can be entirely rewritten into traditional relational queries.  A separate question is how to reconcile conflicting facts given a Web of trust mappings between users; it was shown that the complexity of reconciliation can range from polynomial time to NP-complete, depending on the type of conflicts that one wants to represent.\nQuerying inconsistent data.  A breakthrough theoretical result was obtained on the complexity of computing certain answers to queries over databases with key violations: it was shown that for every conjunctive query without self-joins where every relation has a unique key consisting of a single attribute, the complexity of computing all certain answers is either in polynomial time, or is co-NP-complete in the size of the database.  Moreover, one can decide between these two cases by performing a static analysis on the query expressions.\nExplaining query outputs.  A novel framework was developed for explaining observed answers to queries.  In one application this technique was deployed to help users understand the performance behaviors of large, distributed systems.  In a more general setting, the framework finds explanations to outputs to complex queries.\nLower bounds on grounded probabilistic inference.  New lower bounds were proven on the limitations of DPLL-based inference algorithm for computing queries over probabilistic databases.  All modern model counting algorithm are based on variations of the DPLL backtracking procedure.  It was shown that there exists First Order formulas (queries) whose grounded Boolean formulas causes any DPLL-based algorithm to run in exponential time, although lifted inference compute the probability of the query in polynomial time. This is the first formal proof of the additional power of lifted inference.\nUpper and lower Bounds for Boolean functions.  New upper and lower bounds for the probability of positive Boolean functions were derived by treating multiple occurrences of variables as independent and assigning them new individual probabilities.  This method can be used to approximate weighted model counting problems. As example application, it was shown how existing relational databases can be used to give upper and lower bounds to hard probabilistic queries.\nQuery Interpretation.  A novel visualization tool was developed that reduces the time needed to read and understand existing SQL queries.  It thus enables effective query-reuse, a principal component in the vision of a  Collaborative Query Management System where users start from existing query templates when composing new queries.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wolfgang Gatterbauer"
