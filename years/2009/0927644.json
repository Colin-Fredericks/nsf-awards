 "awd_abstract_narration": "The HBCU-RISE proposal by Alabama A&M University aims to develop research infrastructure in the areas of advanced materials and nanophotonics. AAMU has a doctoral program in physics with emphasis in areas of optics and materials sciences. The proposed HBCU-RISEproject intends to strengthen the materials science and optics infrastructure in the department. Some of the research projects which will be supported include: nanostructured binary materials and their application to chemical sensing, growth of novel triboluminescent crystals and their application to structural health monitoring, preparation of rare-earth ion doped oxyfluoride nanostructured glasses and their application to luminescent devices, development of high-yield organic solar cells sensitized with metal nanoparticles, two-photon biophotonic nanomaterials for cancer diagnostics/ treatment and nanopatterned polymer substrates for plasmonic chemical sensors. Recent developments in nanoscience/nanotechnology are a common underlying thread that connects many of these projects. This project will provide new opportunities for graduate studies and will create a pool for new graduate students who would be interested in for PhD degree in materials science. In addition, participation of undergraduates in research internships, workshops and seminars will add to the pool of applicants for graduate studies.",
