 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a novel \"fluorescent emissive projection\" (FEP) display system, which will turn a glass window or windshield into a full color, high contrast electronic display panel, without blocking the view through the glass. The team will develop novel display engines as well as quantum dots based display materials while also integrating these key components into a full color 40 inch size FEP display prototype. The reliability and regulatory concerns for commercial applications will be investigated in Phase II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf successful this innovative display-on-glass technology will create a broad spectrum of commercial applications with significant market sizes and economic benefits. Success of this project could enable a mass deployment of the display technology in commercial advertising places and automobiles. The new display technology will be applied broadly for many commercial applications, such as the display on store front glass windows or cabinets to attract consumers into stores. It will present real-time commercials on glass windows, without blocking the view into the store and its displayed merchandises. Given the huge number of glass windows and windshields where the technology can be implemented, it has very significant economic impacts.",
