 "awd_abstract_narration": "The parasitic plant dodder has a remarkable ability to communicate with its host plants.  During parasitism it develops a structure called a haustorium, which penetrates the host, establishes vascular connections, and serves as a conduit for obtaining water and nutrients from the host.  This is all the more striking because recent research has demonstrated the movement of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from the host into dodder.  The project will investigate mRNA trafficking in the host-dodder system, focusing on tomato and Arabidopsis as model host species.  New mobile mRNAs will be identified by sequencing mRNAs from dodder and host tissues adjacent to the haustorium, and these mRNAs will be characterized with respect to their cellular localization and fate using fluorescent tags and probes.  These experiments will provide insight into how mobile mRNA movement is regulated and whether cross-species movement of mRNAs function to convey information from one plant to another.  Because mobile mRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of plant growth and development, this project will contribute to the fundamental knowledge needed to improve plant productivity.  The project will foster student training at several levels, including graduate, undergraduate, and high school.  For the latter, a high school teacher will collaborate on the project to develop an aspect of the research that can be used for student project.  These students will gain a valuable perspective on research by participating in an open-ended project, one whose outcome is not known and that holds potential for making a genuine contribution to the larger project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBackground\n\nThe cross-species movement of mRNA from hosts to the parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta pentagona) had been the subject of previous research, but little was known about the types of RNAs that are mobile in this system or the levels in which they move and are distributed in the parasite.  The phenomenon of mRNA movement between host plants and dodder is interesting because mRNAs are information molecules, with the ability to either code for protein synthesis or regulate gene expression.  In plants, mRNAs have been reported to move long distances through the vascular system and act as signals to help coordinate plant development. This RNA movement between cells of a single plant is increasingly documented, but cross-species RNA transfer is largely unexplored. The objective of the project was to characterize mRNA movement between hosts and dodder. \n\nExperimental approaches and results\n\nThe movement of mRNA between hosts and dodder is traceable because the genetic sequences of most genes are distinct between the different plant species. By growing dodder on hosts with fully sequenced genomes (Arabidopsis and tomato were the two species used), it was possible to measure the movement, distribution, and fate of host mRNAs in the parasite.  This was conducted using assays of specific genes as well as a more global approach that used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify the entire population of mRNAs (transcriptomes) in a given tissue.\n\nThe results showed that mRNA transfer between hosts and dodder occurs in surprising ways, with mRNAs moving in high numbers and in a bidirectional manner between the two species.  The mobile transcripts represented thousands of different genes, and nearly half the expressed transcriptome of Arabidopsis was identified in Cuscuta. Although many mRNAs were mobile, the uptake and distribution of host mRNAs into the parasite varied among mRNAs, and we detected evidence of host mRNA turnover in the parasite. The main point of regulation was at the connection between host and parasite, so once inside the dodder stem, mRNAs were able to move long distances.  From these findings we propose that mRNAs traffic into the parasite via vascular connections along with direct cell-to-cell connections.\n\nImpacts \n\nThis project expands current understanding of parasitic plant interacts with their hosts and RNA mobility. Dodder does not engage in a simple one-directional transfer of nutrients, but rather participates in a bidirectional exchange if RNA that represents an unexpected level of continuity between two different species.  This raises questions about the mechanisms by which two different organisms are able to integrate their systems and what determines the limits of exchange between them. Similarly, the large numbers of different RNAs found to move between hosts and parasite challenge the accepted wisdom of RNAs serving as only short-term or short-distance information molecules.  Indeed, this research suggests that under the right conditions RNAs can function in an ecological context. \n\nThe broader impact of this project has included formal training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, but also had a much wider affect.  The research results were picked up by main stream media and spread throughout the world, playing on the presumptions of most people that plants are inanimate, passive objects.  The findings from this project challenge such ideas, generating broad public interest by suggesting that plants may use RNA to communicate. This provides a point of entry into other aspects of parasitic plant biology and clearer demonstrations of plants communicating with other organisms in their environment, thereby expanding public perception of plants as complex and sophisticated organisms.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James H Westwood"
