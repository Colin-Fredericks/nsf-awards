This research explores two fundamental consequences of this fact: the forces that create and destroy patterns of genetic variation across a landscape and how these spatial genetic patterns affect responses to disease epidemics and climate change. The research applies high throughput genomic tools to understanding the demographics and genetic dynamics in more than 800 spatially distributed populations. Objectives are to understand how the distribution of organisms in nature affects the establishment, persistence and proliferation of isolated populations, with a particular focus on disease epidemics and host resistance. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the genetics and ecology of interconnected networks of populations is of applied importance for conservation biology, management of genetically modified crops, invasion biology, and understanding the potential of species to respond to global change.  The emphasis on disease dynamics and resistance also contributes to understanding the dynamics of human pathogens. The research involves training 10-15 undergraduate and graduate students in the interdisciplinary fields of ecology, genomics, and informatics, with training opportunities designed to enhance participation from members of under-represented groups.",
