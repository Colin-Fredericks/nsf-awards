 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the wide range of reactions that ruthenium complexes can catalyze, this proposal focuses on the development of \"one-pot\" multi-step processes effected by known and new ruthenium complexes.  The overall outcome of the proposed research will be more efficient tandem protocols for converting simple olefin containing starting materials into much more complex and valuable targets.  Specifically, the powerful olefin metathesis reaction will be coupled with other complexity-building transformations, such as cyclopropanations, metal mediated couplings, oxidations, cycloadditions, isomerizations and radical atom transfer reactions to yield highly unique and valuable, ruthenium-catalyzed, tandem transformations.  \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program at the NSF is supporting the research of Professor Snapper of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College.  Professor Marc Snapper's research involves the development of more efficient and effective bond-forming strategies. The ability to effect multiple complex functional group and bond changes in a single operation can represent a considerable improvement in efficiency for accessing useful organic compounds.  Moreover, minimizing the time, labor, solvents, reagents, energy, waste streams, and material losses by eliminating the isolation of intermediates will significantly reduce the cost and environmental impact of preparing desired targets. In general, this research will lead to new, more powerful reactions and molecule building strategies that will lower the cost and environmental impact of preparing current and future molecules of importance.  \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEven today, the most efficient total synthesis of an important compound may not be econo&shy;mically feasible.  The problem is that the syn&shy;the&shy;ses can be just too long.  Every step (i.e. reaction) in the synthesis of an important compound can add significant costs to the final product.  Therefore, developing ways to build complex molecules in fewer steps was the goal of this research program.  Catalysts are important tools for carrying out reactions.  We were able to show that you could manipulate a catalyst (precatalyst) to effect several different (mechanistically unique) reactions in a single reaction vessel.  In addition to learning how to orches&shy;trate the reactivity of a catalyst to achieve multiple reactions (the key intellectual advancement), these research efforts lead to highly efficient, new single flask transformations that previously required several operations and purifications to accomplish (broader impact).  \nOver three years of funding, we introduced four new tandem catalytic pro&shy;cesses in which a single ruth&shy;en&shy;ium complex was used to catalyze an olefin metathesis and then modified to effect one or more additional ruthenium-catalyzed trans&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tions in the same vessel.  Figure 1 summarizes those advancements.  They include the development of a 1) tandem ring closing metathesis/hydroacylation, 2) tandem ring closing metathesis/hetero-Pauson-Khand cycloaddition, 3) tandem ring closing metathesis/olefin isomerization/olefin dihydroxylation, and a 4) tandem ring closing metathesis/olefin isomerization/C,H-activation reaction.\n\nIn addition, the students involved with this research program developed important professional skills that will serve them well as they move into their independent careers as scientists.  Oral and written communication skills were advanced through their preparation of group meetings, departmental seminars, quarterly research reports, manuscript drafts, as well as in their participation in outside conferences and meetings.  Moreover, analytical and technical abilities were developed, as well as their ability to mentor others.  As these students move on to new positions in industry, academics, and government, the professional skills acquired in these studies should be vital for their future success. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc L Snapper"
