 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ongoing Workshop in  Analysis and Probability at Texas A&M University brings together senior and junior researchers and  graduate students in several areas of analysis and probability as well as  researchers in other fields (such as geometry and theoretical computer science) in order to broaden the education of the younger participants and to promote interaction among researchers in various fields.  The Workshop also sponsors  three day conferences (SUMIRFAS: Informal Regional Functional Analysis Seminar), Concentration Weeks, and mini-conferences.  These conferences include introductory lectures designed to acquaint junior researchers and non experts with the basics of an area as well as advanced lectures for experts.  \r\n\r\nThe Workshop activities have a broad impact by providing intellectual stimulation for all participants as well as giving an opportunity to a diverse group of junior participants to broaden their knowledge and to interact with senior researchers in several areas of mathematics.  There is also significant outreach to  applied mathematics and  computer science.  Indeed, a very important aspect of the Workshop is to promote cooperation among researchers in different fields, and every Concentration Week involves participants from experts in two or more research areas.",
