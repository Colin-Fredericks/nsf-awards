 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis CAREER award supports an integrated research and education program on spin transport and related phenomena. Spins play a central role in emergent phases of matter as well as in nonequilibrium phenomena, the latter fueling interest in potential applications to device technologies that exploit the spin of the electron for their operation. The research focuses on several related topics exploring collective and topological properties of spin transport and dynamics, which can be separated into two broad areas: \r\n(1) Spin flows and order-parameter dynamics in magnetic materials and nanostructures. Electron spin propagating through a magnetic texture experiences a reactive coupling with the texture. The ensuing ?spin magnetohydrodynamics? produces fascinating phenomena, such as spin torque and reciprocal electromotive gauge fields, which have recently ignited vibrant theoretical as well as experimental activities. The PI will pursue microscopic and phenomenological approaches to dissipative and stochastic magnetoelectronic phenomena, near and far from equilibrium, with particular emphasis on nonlinear current-induced dynamics and instabilities. \r\n(2) Spin orbit coupled quantum transport and correlations.  The PI will develop a geometric description of spin-transport that includes spin-orbit coupling and will study localization and interference effects in low-dimensional systems, small rings, ring arrays, and Wigner crystals; edge and interfacial properties of spin transport; and semiclassical and quantum spin Hall effects. The PI will also explore more broadly quantum geometric and correlation effects in nanostructures, with a focus on fictitious gauge fields in solid-state media and the interplay between spintronic, magnetic, elastic, and optical phenomena. The PI will collaborate with industry on problems of dissipation, stochastic dynamics, and current-driven instabilities in magnetic systems, as well as new magnetoelectronic device concepts.\r\n\r\nThe education component of this award will build on the already successful outreach program run by the California NanoSystems Institute at the UCLA, which works with Los Angeles public schools, promoting the ideas and excitement of nanoscience and nanotechnology in the Los Angeles unified school district. A theoretical nanoscience component will be developed for the UCLA REU program, offering students a program where they can study, simulate, and optimize magnetoelectronic circuits, while also collaborating with experimentalists and engineers on the UCLA campus. The broad scope of this field is very well suited for designing a new nanoscience course for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in physics and engineering. Collaborations with industry will be initiated on problems of dissipation, stochastic dynamics, and current-driven instabilities in magnetic systems, as well as new magnetoelectronic device concepts. \r\n\r\nNONTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis CAREER award supports integrated theoretical research and education with an aim to develop a better fundamental understanding of new phenomena that arise because of the intrinsic magnetic properties of an electron in a material. In an important sense an electron is like a tiny spinning top with an electric charge. The spin of the electron is intimately connected to the electron being also like a tiny magnet. The ability to manipulate the electron?s spin enables a new kind of electronic device that utilizes not only the electron charge, like conventional electronic devices, but also its spin. The research supported by this award contributes to the intellectual foundation upon which this new technology called ?spintronics? will rest through theoretical research to understand and control how spin moves through materials and to predict interesting phenomena that arise as a consequence. Spintronic devices may be more energy efficient and may enable continued successful rapid miniaturization of devices accompanied by enhanced performance that has stimulated the American electronics industry for decades.\r\n\r\nThe education component of this award will build on the already successful outreach program run by the California NanoSystems Institute at the UCLA, which works with Los Angeles public schools, promoting the ideas and excitement of nanoscience and nanotechnology in the Los Angeles unified school district.
