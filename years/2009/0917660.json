 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Deborah I. Olszewski and Maysoon al-Nahar will lead an international team on a three-year project investigating late Pleistocene hunter-gatherer adaptations in the Jordanian Western Highlands (Transjordanian Plateau). During this period, changes in behavioral strategies used to exploit landscape resources led to long-term processes that resulted in one of the key economic transitions in prehistory, the origins of agriculture, which in turn fueled the development of civilizations and state-based societies. This Western Highlands project focuses on Early Epipaleolithic (ca. 25,000 to 18,000 calibrated years BP) hunter-gatherer strategies during a period of major climatic change, including the Last Glacial Maximum and a climatic amelioration, all of which impacted plant and animal communities. Previous research at Ohalo II, Sea of Galilee, which dates to the Last Glacial Maximum, documented extensive use of wild cereals (barley). What is not clear, however, is the extent to which intensive use of wild cereals was a strategic economic pattern for these groups across the region and whether this strategy persisted through time or was reintroduced just prior to the onset of food production economies.\r\n\r\nMuch of the Jordanian landscape is currently under-explored from this perspective. To this end, the Western Highlands project will investigate three sites that are situated in different ecological zones - Mediterranean forest, Irano-Turanian steppe, and open parkland - covering the Late Glacial Maximum and the succeeding climatic rebound. Specific tasks include 1) mapping sites with a Total Station; 2) point proveniencing all cultural materials (stone artifacts, fauna, shell, etc.) and samples recovered during excavations with the Total Station for accurate locations and to examine site taphonomy; 3) specialist analysis of fauna and samples for pollen, phytoliths, macrobotanical remains, radiocarbon dating, and geoarchaeology, which will yield data on subsistence, chronology, and landscape use; 4)  field analyzing stone artifacts which will inform about site activities and mobility; 5) labeling and properly curating all cultural materials; and, 6) storing all project data, including images, in databases, as well as making this information available on a project website which will include a public-oriented component (including a section in Arabic). Understanding Early Epipaleolithic decisions and strategy options regarding food resource use in different habitats is the primary intellectual merit of this project and a crucial step that will provide new and important data relevant to how hunter-gatherer settlement and subsistence strategies are modified in the face of climatic and paleoenvironmental changes, leading to more informed insight into how domestication economies may have originated.\r\n\r\nIn terms of its broader impacts, the Western Highlands project is designed as an international partnership between Jordanian and non-Jordanian (U.S., France, Croatia, U.K.) participants at all levels from the Principal Investigators to the student members. In particular, each Jordanian student will be paired with a non-Jordanian student; this will facilitate learning different archaeological methods from each other, as well as result in enhanced cultural understanding. All student participants will be trained in Total Station use, lithic analysis, excavation techniques, and Jordanian prehistory prior to the advent of agriculture. Additionally, the PIs and specialists will offer opportunities for students to use the project materials for theses, and encourage the students to collaborate as co-authors on project publications.",

How these origins came about has been extensively discussed, often focusing on the presumed exact moment in time and/or the period immediately prior to the physical appearance of domesticated plants and animals. It has been far less common to approach this research question from the standpoint of an examination of the several millennia of hunter-gatherer behavioral choices that preceded these origins. These choices were made from an array of available options and were partly contingent on local ecological situations and on group interactions. Choices made about which plant foods or animals to target created knowledge sets about resources that could be modified as climatic and environmental conditions changed vegetation communities, accessibility, and abundance over the course of the late Pleistocene epoch. Moreover, these knowledge sets were traditional information passed down through generations. The diversity and flexibility of hunter-gatherer strategies meant that the origins of agriculture were not the result of a straight line trajectory nor were they based on a single set of decisions.<br /><br />The research conducted during this National Science Foundation funded project examined these strategies and behaviors in the western highlands of west-central Jordan (inland Levantine Middle East) for the period between 25,000 and 17,000 years ago. This interval was characterized by the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum, with its generally cold and arid nature, and then a return to warmer and wetter conditions. The archaeological sites chosen represent three major ecological habitats during that period&mdash;wetlands, open parkland, and Mediterranean forest. Our investigations have shown that wetlands provide reliable rather than risky food resources. However, when the context is in-stream wetlands, as is the case for several of the archaeological sites investigated, the areal extent of available plant foods is limited. This, in turn, has an effect on choices related to mobility, with prehistoric groups using in-stream wetlands more likely to be mobile rather than seasonally or year-round settled. The types of reliable plant foods in these contexts are not ones that later were domesticated during the origins of agriculture, thus serving as an example that choices were not always those one might expect. Hunted animals vary to some extent with the type of topography; thus, wild goats were more typical in rugged areas and gazelle were more characteristic of flatter regions. The presence of extinct cattle in all three ecological habitats indicates close access to fresh water sources. The results of our project will be used in comparisons with hunter-gatherer strategies from several other Levantine regions, including areas that had large marsh systems (where reliable foods were more abundant) and lakeshores (where abundance of reliable food resources allowed prehistoric groups to incorporate greater amounts of riskier foods, such as wild cereal grasses). Both of these latter contexts also appear to have offered more opportunities for a more settled lifeway.<br /><br />Finally, our project was designed as a joint partnership between Jordanian and non-Jordanian participants (including both undergraduate and graduate students), from the principal investigator to the crew level. Each excavation team consisted of one Jordanian student paired with one non-Jordanian student. This facilitated interactions from both a professional archaeological and a cultural diversity perspective. All participants were trained in the use of equipment for archaeological excavation, primarily a 3D measuring instrument (total station) and its related software, and in the analysis of stone artifact assemblages. Additionally, all excavation teams kept notebooks where they recorded information relevant to the units and levels they were excavating at the archaeological sites. Several of the graduate students have given presentations at professional conferences, as well as contributed to or written published articles using data from our project, as have also the principal investigators.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/05/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Deborah&nbsp;I&nbsp;Olszewski</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0917660/0917660_10028585_1470421248599_WHEEPNSFProjectOutcomesFig05--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0917660/0917660_10028585_1470421248599_WHEEPNSFProjectOutcomesFig05--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"WHEEP NSF Team Work\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/0917660/0917660_10028585_1470421248599_WHEEPNSFProjectOutcomesFig05--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"WHEEP NSF Team Work\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Project participants included teams of one Jordanian and one non-Jordanian student in all field seasons.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Deborah I.
