 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Science (21) The Departments of Mathematical Sciences at the United States Military Academy (USMA) and at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) are building on a history of annual teacher faculty development workshops that are focused on pedagogical issues and at the same time emphasizing learning by doing. This project is improving student learning in mathematics courses by raising the standard of teaching excellence in undergraduate mathematics programs nationwide.  This is being done through the following: \r\n\r\n1) Increasing the number of mathematics faculty who have studied and practiced sound,proven teaching methods and can share these ideas in faculty development sessions, \r\n\r\n2) Contributing to promoting and helping lead a nationwide network of mathematics educators and administrators who are committed to promoting better teaching and improved teacher education, and \r\n\r\n3) Organizing a one-week workshop for two consecutive years that provides 20 mathematics educators each year with an opportunity to make substantive improvements in the effectiveness of their teaching and in their ability to lead faculty development programs at their institutions. These educators must express an interest in initiating similar programs at their schools. \r\n\r\nThe content of the one week workshops can be incorporated into any school program, either as a full continuous week or at various times throughout the year. Classes and sample materials are provided to participants to utilize in their own faculty development programs. The materials that are created for the workshop, specifically the workshop schedule, lesson plans, readings from applicable literature, and all available handouts, are available to the participants of the workshop and will be broadly disseminated and made available to educators in mathematics, who are interested in faculty development, through publications, presentations and panel discussions at professional meetings, and the internet.",
