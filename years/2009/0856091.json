 "awd_abstract_narration": "The challenge to increase range without loss of bandwidth is a common problem in nanopositioning systems.  The proposed research will address this challenge by developing inchworm positioners that achieve high-resolution positioning within each step of the inchworm while allowing large range with multiple steps. Towards this, the research will develop novel vibration mitigation tools for systems with switched dynamics. The research will: (1) develop optimal output transitions without vibrations which improve on current state transition approaches; (2) invert switched dynamic systems that arise due to the changing of boundary conditions in the inchworm; (3) account for hysteresis input nonlinearities using inversion methods; and (4) develop preview-based techniques for the integrated tracking/resetting problem. The resulting optimal approach will be used to mitigate transitional vibrations caused by each inchworm step.  Thereby, the proposed work will achieve large-range, high-bandwidth positioning without loss of resolution due to movement induced vibrations during transitions. The vibration-mitigation strategy for the inchworm will be evaluated during nanoscale positioning. In summary, the proposed research will: (1) develop new tools for vibration mitigation in systems with switched dynamics; and (2) increase the bandwidth without loss of range in nanopositioning systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will have broad impact on nanotechnology since it improves nanopositioning in scanning probe microscopes, which are key enabling tools in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The proposed research will provide training and education in nanotechnologies through novel senior-level capstone design projects in nanopositioning and vibration mitigation. Additionally, the proposed work will offer research and educational experience to undergraduate students and promote the involvement of minority students in research. Thus, the proposed work will help to build the research and human resource infrastructure needed in emerging nanotechnologies.\r\n",
