 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: We propose to study Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) laser sources for the 3 um to 12 um band fabricated as monolithic on-chip nanowaveguides using standard lithographic tools. \r\nSpecifically, we propose an OPO that (1) is implemented as a monolithic, lithographically defined waveguide with integral Bragg reflectors;\r\n(2) employs form birefringent structures for phase matching; and (3) has a triply resonant cavity. The combination of all three of these elements is necessary to create inexpensive and efficient OPO sources.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: To the best of our knowledge, phase-matched form birefringent waveguides have not yet been exploited in resonant nanocavities to create OPOs. Triply resonant OPO cavities also, to the best of our knowledge, have not been realized, and even doubly-resonant devices are relatively recent. Therefore the proposed research is transformative in nature as it will advance the fundamental understanding of (1) parametric oscillation in multiply-resonant form-birefringent waveguide cavities, (2) materials and processes that may be suitable for mass fabrication of such cavities, leading to on-chip mid-infrared OPO laser sources, and (3) numerical modeling of nonlinear interaction in resonant cavities, and numerical optimization methods relating to the design of multiply-resonant structures.\r\n\r\nBroader impact:  The development of the proposed compact and inexpensive on-chip mid-infrared source will lead to advances in spectroscopic instrumentation, with applications to environmental science, pollution monitoring, chemical threat detection and other areas. The project will also play a significant role in the education, outreach and development of human resources in science and engineering at the graduate and undergraduate levels.\r\n",
