 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National STEM Education Distributed Learning (NSDL) community PI meeting underscores the importance of promoting cross-disciplinary communities of researchers and practitioners including technologists, educators, domain scientists and social scientists. This cross-disciplinary profile matches the NSDL community quite well. NSDL is an active community, whose collaborative project activities have been traditionally sustained by face-to-face conversations at annual PI meetings. Sharing the outcomes of NSDL-funded work provides an important base for responding to the recommendations in the NSF cyberlearning report. Attendees include past and present NSDL grant recipients, NSF program officers, and other interested STEM education stakeholders. Results from previous meetings suggest that the 2010 NSDL PI meeting will continue to be an important component in stimulating conversations, maintaining community vitality and supporting the collaborative efforts of this network of stakeholders immersed in addressing STEM cyberlearning issues.",
