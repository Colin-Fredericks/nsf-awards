 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this projects is to provide a new set of laboratory data \r\nto understand the deep mantle water cycling. Possible melting near the \r\n410-km and its consequence on geochemical cycling have been speculated. \r\nHowever, there have been no definitive studies on the conditions for \r\npartial melting under the deep upper mantle conditions. Consequently \r\nthere have been large uncertainties on the critical water content. In \r\nthis proposal, our efforts are focused on determining the critical \r\nwater content for partial melting near 410-km depth. The critical water \r\ncontent for partial melting is a critical parameter to understand the \r\ndeep water cycling including the origin and evolution of the ocean mass \r\nand the processes to control the water content in the upper mantle. In \r\nthis project, we will use electrical conductivity to determine the \r\nonset of partial melting and consequently, the results of this work \r\nwill also provide a critical new data set to interpret the distribution \r\nof electrical conductivity in terms of temperature and water content in \r\nthe mantle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions for partial melting involving water are difficult to \r\ndetermine experimentally. We will investigate the phase diagram of \r\nwater + peridotite system by measuring electrical conductivity. we \r\nanticipate that the onset of partial melting will dramatically change \r\nthe conductivity and consequently, by measuring the electrical \r\nconductivity, we should be able to detect a small degree of partial \r\nmelting. Experiments will be conducted using an impedance spectroscopy \r\nwith a multianvil apparatus under the conditions of P (pressure) =4-16 \r\nGPa, and T (temperature) = 1000-1900 K. The partial melting will be \r\ndetected by a jump in conductivity as well as the change in the trace \r\nelement concentrations. The results have an important implication for \r\nthe deep mantle water cycling as well as the interpretation of \r\nelectrical conductivity.",
