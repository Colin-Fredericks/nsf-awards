 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is on designing robust multi-core systems at lowest cost that are resilient to hardware failures. It is motivated by an imminent paradigm shift in hardware design resulting from the growing problem of hardware failures in future process technologies. The central vision is to develop techniques and tools for designing hierarchical robust multi-core systems that are globally optimized across multiple abstraction layers ? circuit, architecture, runtime, and application ? without incurring the high cost of expensive redundancy techniques. An inter disciplinary approach will integrate research and education required to enable future robust systems. Because of its cross-cutting nature, the proposed research has the potential of having a major impact on future systems, enabling future technology scaling, thus making everyday lives better.",
