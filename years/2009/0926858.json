 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe research objective of this BRIGE award is to develop new connection details utilizing the superior compression, bending, and torsion properties of hollow structural section (HSS) beam and column members for low to mid-rise steel frames in areas of high seismicity.  The behavior of HSS beam members under bending will be explored through full-scale experimental studies to determine limiting parameters for plastic hinge formation.  The data from these tests will provide the basis for detailed models that can accurately capture global and local behavior under bending and provide a means to identify suitable connection configurations and design details.  Further refinement of these models will be achieved through small-scale tests focused on local buckling and weld behavior.  The seismic response of frame systems with the identified HSS connections will be compared to those with conventional connection detailing through numerical analyses.  Additional numerical studies of the HSS moment connections will consider the use of innovative supplemental energy dissipation materials to further enhance their seismic performance.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide a knowledge base for the design of resilient and robust low to mid-rise moment frame structures utilizing HSS members.  The increased understanding of the global bending, local, and weld behavior of HSS members will directly benefit the steel design community and help to enhance the welfare and safety of communities in areas of high seismicity. The interaction between materials, structures, and natural hazards provides a unique context in which to broaden participation of underrepresented students.  K-12 outreach programs and involvement of underrepresented groups at the university level in everything from analytical modeling to large-scale structural testing will act as a catalyst to foster continued participation and interest of underrepresented groups in the math, science, and engineering fields.",
