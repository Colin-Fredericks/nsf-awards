 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis project aims to investigate African easterly wave (AEW) origin and storm track dynamics using a wide range of datasets including those from recent field campaigns and a hierarchy of numerical simulations in order to improve the current paradigm for mathematical instruction in the undergraduate atmospheric science curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe science component of this project covers two areas: AEW origin from non-modal and stochastic forcing of the African easterly jet (AEJ) and AEW evolution within a streamwise varying waveguide. Specifically, the investigator would (a) investigate key dynamic issues through a systematic analysis of observations and numerical simulations using stochastically forced models, (b) examine the evolution of AEWs in a streamwise varying waveguide from the perspective of dispersing Rossby wave packets as well as isolated nonlinear disturbances, and also investigate whether AEW history of nonlinearity holds a predictive value for tropical cyclone (TC) genesis, and (c) examine the post-TC genesis evolution of AEWs and investigate the range of processes that occur during the TC-wave decoupling.\r\n\r\nThe education component of this project addresses a long-standing issue regarding gaps in the mathematical preparation of atmospheric science students. It envisions (a) improved guidance to students for optimizing their mathematical instruction, (b) forging collaboration with mathematics faculty to provide context-based instruction, and (c) synthesizing math and atmospheric concepts in mathematical methods in an atmospheric science course.\r\n \r\nBroader impacts of this project are educational and in improving our understanding of AEW origin and evolution within a complex environment and thus contributing to an enhanced understanding of TC genesis from AEWs and its predictability.",
