 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Florida continues to operate a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site that focused on physics of materials.  The ten-week summer program would support 15 undergraduate students each year for three years.  Students are recruited nationwide with an emphasis to increase participation by women, members of groups underrepresented in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), students from institutions with limited research opportunities. Each REU participant is integrated into an active research group to carry out individual research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor.  Research projects cover a wide variety of materials research topics in physics and related fields and include experimental, theoretical and computational projects in the design, measurement and understanding of novel materials and quantum phenomena. The REU program also includes seminars on contemporary research topics, visit to National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, information on career possibilities in physical sciences, workshops and training on scientific communication, science demonstrations by REU students to K-12 groups and social events to facilitate informal interactions among peers and with faculty mentors. At the end of the program, students write research reports and present their project results at a REU research symposium and are encouraged and supported to present their REU research at national and regional scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nThis REU Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program and NSF Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs part of this grant, REU Site: Materials Physics at the University of Florida, 15 undergraduates were brought to the University of Florida to do research for 10 weeks in the summer for three successive summers (2009, 2010, 2011).  The total number of students participating in the program was 45 students.  The students conducted research on the science of new materials, which is the underpinning for using these materials in applications.  A wide range of different materials were studied by the students.  Some examples are listed below:\n\nTransparent nanotube conducting films: There are very few materials which are both conducting and transparent to light.  On the other hand, flat panel displays such as those used in cell phones and flat screen TV's all have a transparent conductor on the outside to allow one to read the display.  Thin films of carbon nanotubes pioneered by Prof.  Rinzler is a new class of transparent conductors, which may be used in next generation displays.\n\nA new class of superconductors: A new class of superconductors called the iron pnictide superconductors was discovered in 2006.  The origin of their superconductivity is still an active area of investigation.  In these superconductors as in all superconductors the current flows without resistance at low enough temperatures and magnetic fields.  Superconductors are used in large electromagnets such as those used in MRI machines.\n\nThin films of multiferoic materials: Magnets have a permanent magnetic moment.  Ferroelectric materials have a permanent electric moment.  There are very few materials which have both a magnetic moment and an electric moment at the same time.  In multiferoic materials one can change magnetic properties with an electric field, allowing for novel nonvolatile memory devices.\n\nOther examples of materials studied and further details on research projects and results may be found at the REU program web site: http://www.phys.ufl.edu/REU/ .\n\nStudents were recruited from across the United States to participate in the program with proactive recruitment of women, members of underrepresented groups, and also students from schools with little opportunity for research.   Averaged over all three years of the program, 36% of the participants were women, 22% were minorities, and 38% were from primarily undergraduate institutions.  \n\nBesides doing research within a research group mentored by a University of Florida faculty member, the participants attend seminars and workshops designed to give them the complete research experience.  There are seminars on cutting edge research, laboratory tours at the University of Florida and national facilities, seminars on applying to graduate school, a panel discussion on what it is like to be a graduate student, and workshops on scientific writing and public speaking.  Since many of the students are coming from smaller schools with limited research opportunities, these program activities may be their only chance to gain perspective on different research opportunities after being an undergraduate.  At the end of the program the participants must write a short paper on the research results and also give a 10-15 minute presentation.  Having the ability to explain their research results is just as important as learning to work in a laboratory.\n\nThe participants also do one outreach activity where they do hands-on science demonstrations with students from local elementary schools.  The students were brought to the University of Florida campus using funds from various sources including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  This event usually occurs about half way through the program.   We find that the students enjoy the outreach activity, and this activity encourages them to continue helping younger students as they progress in their careers. \n\nOne of the goals of the program was encourage the students continue on in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) careers in graduate school and beyond.
