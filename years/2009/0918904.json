 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streams and rivers are important sites of global carbon processing. Carbon in the form of dead leaves and wood (detritus) from the land enters streams and is colonized by bacteria and fungi (heterotrophic microorganisms). This complex of microorganisms and detrital carbon fuels food webs that support fish, amphibians and other consumers. Detrital carbon is consumed by organisms but is also converted to carbon dioxide by bacteria and fungi. Problematic to this important detritus-fuelled pathway is that human-derived nutrient inputs (nitrogen and phosphorus) stimulate microbially-driven release of carbon dioxide and decomposition of detritus, resulting in less available carbon for important ecosystem functions. In this study, laboratory incubations, streamside channels and whole-stream nutrient additions will be used to determine the concentrations and ratios of nitrogen and phosphorus that elicit such ecosystem changes. Knowledge of these threshold concentrations and ratios can guide management of aquatic ecosystems to maintain water quality for wildlife conservation and human utilization. Study findings can aid predictions of how excess nutrients affect the fate of detrital carbon in streams, which is relevant to global carbon budgets. \r\n\r\nExcess nutrient loading is the primary source of impairment to more than half of the freshwater and coastal ecosystems in the U.S. While hundreds of scientific studies have assessed autotrophic (e.g. algal) response to nutrient loading, few have tested nutrient effects on detritus, heterotrophic microorganisms and the larger aquatic organisms they support. The proposed research will advance our understanding of how aquatic ecosystems are affected by nutrients via detritus-fuelled pathways that potentially lead to carbon loss, a perspective that is currently lacking in management decisions related to nutrient enrichment. This project will provide critical research support to four early-career investigators, as well as experience and training for undergraduate and graduate students at three institutions in the southeastern U.S. The project will include public and K-12 educational components that will focus on how excess nutrients affect aquatic food webs and water quality.",

This large collaborative project had three experimental components: detailed laboratory-based work on microbial responses to N and P; field experiments using an array of artificial stream channels in which we could conduct highly controlled experiments on the effects of dissolved N and P concentrations and ratios on microbial activity and breakdown of leaf litter; and 2-year additions of N and P to entire reaches of five streams at different delivery ratios (N:P = 2:1, 8:1, 16:1, 32:1 and 128:1), with associated measurements of detrital breakdown and food web structure. All fieldwork was conducted at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, NC, U.S.A. My laboratory's component of the project examined the effects of the N and P additions on invertebrate communities and food webs in the five experimental streams. Our analysis of samples from this large effort is still ongoing. Preliminary data indicate that abundance, biomass and production of invertebrate taxa increased at all experimental N:P ratios, indicating limitation by N or P (or co-limitation) at ambient concentrations in the five streams. However, responses to N and P additions were higher at low N:P delivery ratios (2:1 to 16:1) and maximized at the delivery ratio of 16:1 (i.e., the canonical Redfield ratio that is associated with N:P ratio in living biomass across many types of organism). Further laboratory work and data analysis will investigate these patterns in more detail, as well as examine the effects of the experimental N and P additions on food web structure and flows of materials through food webs. In summary, our project has allowed us to study the effects of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and ratios on detritus-based communities at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We anticipate that our data will shed light on the responses of important ecosystem-level processes that produce carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) to increases in dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentration (and shifts in N:P delivery ratio) that are now common in streams and rivers of the U.S.A. and elsewhere because of nutrient pollution and other anthropogenic impacts. Our project also trained one PhD student, one technician, and several undergraduates, who were involved in laboratory-based tasks (i.e., sorting of samples collected from the field sites). The information gained from the project is being disseminated via traditional channels (conference presentations and primary research articles). To date, the award to my laboratory has resulted in five publications (published or in press) and 19 presentations at national meetings.
