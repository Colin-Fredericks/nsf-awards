 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an ambitious project that has the potential to fill in important gaps in the overall picture of orogenesis in the central Andes, and of convergent-margin tectonism in general. The project is constructed around a well defined basic-science question, did the Andes rise in a rapid pulse, or did they rise gradually? Producing elevations and crustal thicknesses of the magnitude found in this  study area remains a key problem in continental tectonics.\r\n\r\nThis question provides a foundation from which the PIs develop a variety of linked projects, including: 3-D structural analysis of fold-thrust belt shortening in the Andes, testing of new methods of paleo-elevation analysis, use of seismic studies to characterize the roots of the range (both in the deep crust and in the underlying mantle), creative use of petrologic and isotopic data to constrain thickened crust at times in the past. The project has the potential to address 3-D mass balance issues during orogeny, as well as the impact of a rising mountain belt on continent-scale weather systems. Of note, to put the analysis of orographic weather studies in context, the PIs will also undertake a broader paleo-climate study.  All of the questions to be studied are current and important, and are of interest across traditional disciplinary boundaries and, the research strategy as outlined has a high potential to answer the questions that it poses.\r\n",

Understanding the timing and mechanisms of formation of the Andean Plateau provides insights into changes in South American paleogeography that influence climate, as well as the geodynamic processes that build plateaus. This project represents an integrative study of the geodynamic processes responsible for plateau formation and evolution by bringing a vast array of data together, including geophysical studies of the crustal and mantle structure, geochemical studies of lithospheric evolution, structural and basin analysis studies of the long-term shortening and thickening history of the crustal lithosphere, thermochronometric studies of the exhumation history, and stable isotope studies of the surface uplift history. Current end-member geodynamic models for Andean Plateau formation predict one of the following modes of plateau evolution: (1) slow-and-steady rise of the Plateau commensurate with crustal shortening and continuous (ablative) subduction of dense lower lithosphere, or (II) rapid rise of the Plateau associated with rapid removal of dense lower lithosphere following significant crustal shortening. The controversy between these two models persists, in part, because of previously lacking overlap in space and time between fundamental data sets that are used to interpret temporal changes in paleoclimate, paleoelevation, lithospheric thickness and composition, and amount of deformation.&nbsp; This study provides new data from the Central Andean Plateau for comparison to the expected observables for each end-member geodynamic model for the surface uplift, deformation history, and lithospheric evolution of the Plateau. We have used multiple climate proxies within sedimentary deposits in the Central Andean Plateau (between 13&deg;S and 23&deg;S) to document punctuated (several million year) changes in the composition of meteoric water and surface temperature inferred to reflect significant (&ge;1000 m) surface uplift. These studies suggest that different regions experienced pulsed surface uplift at different times. In comparison with crustal thickening histories derived from reconstructions of crustal shortening, crustal thickening and surface uplift are temporally decoupled, with significant crustal thickening preceding punctuated surface uplift events by several tens of millions of years. Paleoclimate data and geologic evidence indicate that the high elevation Eastern Cordillera (~5 km) experienced an earlier pulse of surface uplift than the Altiplano zone, associated with an eastward sweep of magmatism that marks the current limits of the Plateau. Within the Altiplano zone, the southern Altiplano appears to have risen beginning in middle Miocene time and continued through late Miocene time. During this time, the central Altiplano remained low and experienced increasing rates of sedimentation. In late Miocene time, sedimentation rates in the central Altiplano slowed dramatically at the same time that climate proxy data suggest rapid surface uplift of the north-central Altiplano. The northernmost Altiplano of Peru experienced a pulse of surface uplift in late Miocene to Pliocene time. These results suggest that surface uplift of the Altiplano propagated from south to north. Crustal shortening estimates from the southern through the central plateau (between 17&deg;S and 24&deg;S) show upper estimates of 300&plusmn;30 km, sufficient to account for the crustal thickness of the Plateau assuming initial thicknesses of average continental crust. However, limited shortening estimates from the northernmost Altiplano suggest insufficient shortening to account for the modern crustal thickness.
