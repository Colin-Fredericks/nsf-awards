 "awd_abstract_narration": "The six micro-satellite Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) was launched on April 14, 2006 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. All satellites and payloads are functioning well, and the program began distributing all data to all interested parties three months after launch in late July 2006. The program was executed within budget and schedule and the high-quality data are already starting to significantly affect atmospheric and ionospheric science and operational weather forecasting. Following several months of testing, the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) commenced operational use of the COSMIC data on December 13, 2006. Several operational centers, including the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UK Met Office), M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, and the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) plan to begin operational assimilation of COSMIC data in early 2007. As of January 2007, there were 400 registered users of the data, representing major U.S. and international universities, leading operational weather centers, research laboratories, and several private companies. The status of the spacecraft and data processing center can be found at the COSMIC web site: http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/ \r\n\r\nThe COSMIC satellites are designed to operate through 2011. NSF and other participating U.S. agencies are providing support that is critical to ensure continued delivery of the data and data products. The main tasks to be performed with US funding are: (i) operation of the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archival Center (CDAAC) for data processing, quality control, and dissemination, (ii) continued development and improvement of processing algorithms, (iii) assumption of 50% of the cost for the operation of the COSMIC remote tracking stations (RTS) for near-real time data collection, (iv) continued improvement and maintenance of Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) science payload firmware and software, and (v) operation of the COSMIC Project Office to support the national and international science community. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project has extremely high intellectual merit in that it will make use of innovative GPS RO techniques to provide global, continuous, and all-weather observations of the atmosphere for research and operations. COSMIC delivers two major advancements in GPS RO science: (i) the design and implementation of an advanced \"open-loop\" tracking technique for space-based sensing of the atmospheric boundary layer and (ii) the design and operation of first constellation that produces real-time RO soundings with uniform global coverage to support atmospheric research and operational numerical weather prediction (NWP), climate monitoring and research, and space-weather forecasting. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: With the availability of ~2,500 soundings globally per day, COSMIC will have a broad and far-reaching impact for the operational and research atmospheric science communities. COSMIC will provide valuable data in traditional data sparse regions of the world, including polar and oceanic regions, for weather and climate studies. The fact that the COSMIC data are of high precision, high accuracy, and high vertical resolution, are not affected by clouds and precipitation, and require no inter-satellite cross-calibration, makes COSMIC ideally suited for climate research. COSMIC also provides much-needed ionospheric observations for analysis and forecasting of space weather, and other ionospheric research. The COSMIC data and the processing software will be made freely available to the broad university and user community. The project also has a significant educational component, as it will involve graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows through collaboration with universities.",

Since its launch in April 2006, COSMIC has been providing highly accurate globally distributed measurements of temperature and moisture from the Earth\u00c6s surface to over 30 km altitude for use in operational weather forecasting and climate research applications. COSMIC also provides measurements of electron density in the ionosphere above 100 km altitude to help scientists understand space weather science. Figure 1 shows the distribution of COSMIC soundings (in green) around the globe for a one day period along with current weather balloon station locations (in red). The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) designed the COSMIC mission and has been serving as program manager on behalf of NSF and U.S. agencies to execute the mission. The main outcomes of this project have been the development of the UCAR COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC), the operation of the CDAAC to process and distribute RO data products to the operational and research science communities, almost 250 scientific peer-reviewed publications as noted by Web of Knowledge, and technical and educational support for data users to maximize the scientific impact of the mission. \nUCAR has developed a fully automated state-of-the-art RO data processing, distribution, and archival system. The CDAAC hardware, software, and science data processing algorithms have been developed with over 100 man-years of scientific and engineering effort and currently provide high quality GPS RO data to the science community. The CDAAC data products have been extensively validated in peer-reviewed publications via comparisons with data from other instruments, numerical weather prediction and space weather models, as well as data from other data processing centers. In near real-time, CDAAC currently processes data from COSMIC into about 1500 temperature and moisture profiles every day and transfers the data to operational global weather centers. \nCDAAC also reprocesses RO data more accurately 6-8 weeks later for COSMIC as well as 7 other missions (GPS/MET, CHAMP, SAC-C, GRACE-A, TerraSAR-X, Metop/GRAS, and C/NOFS) for use in weather process and climate studies. Figure 2 shows the number of COSMIC atmospheric profiles generated per day throughout the mission with a total of approximately 3.7 million profiles. UCAR makes all processed RO data available with a powerful website at www.cosmic.ucar.edu.\nCOSMIC data have been used in approximately 250 scientific publications that have demonstrated significant impact on operational weather prediction, climate monitoring, and space weather and ionospheric research. For example, major global weather prediction centers, including NOAA\u00c6s National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) are providing significantly improved weather forecasts by assimilating near real-time COSMIC data. RO data are also a powerful observational tool to monitor the Earth\u00c6s climate due to their high accuracy and stability over time. COSMIC and other RO data sets are already being used to investigate temperature trends in the troposphere and stratosphere, and with continued RO datasets going forward, similar future studies will be able to provide temperature trends of the Earth\u00c6s atmosphere with high confidence. COSMIC data are also being used by scientists to better understand space weather and ionospheric processes, which will lead to future societal benef..."
