 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThis project will elucidate how proteins and polymers that compose the yeast cell wall control the formation of biofilms, which are multicellular, surface-adherent microbial communities.  Yeast are often thought of as single-celled fungi in which individual cells act independently of one another.  However, many yeast species can generate biofilms.  This project is a study of how the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, uses sliding motility as a mechanism for biofilm formation.  Sliding motility is a form of passive translocation in which microbes spread over a wet surface as they grow due to altered surface properties.  The yeast biofilm consists of a collection of adherent cells that are surrounded by a loose vanguard of cells at the outer edge.  The edge cells  continue to divide, spread, and slide over the surface due to their altered cell wall properties.  The goal of this project is to identify genes required for sliding, and determine how they foster sliding motility.  The project seeks to fit two established cellular pathways into biofilm regulation, the cell wall integrity pathway and the multivesicular body trafficking pathway, which controls trafficking, recycling, and degradation of primarily ubiquitinated cell-surface proteins.  The project also seeks to identify new genes, particularly cell wall genes, which control biofilm sliding behaviors.  The primary tools used are genetic and biological approaches, with some reliance on genomic data.  The study is important because it will promote understanding of how fungi form biofilms which are associated with fungal distribution and growth that impacts industry and ecosystems.  The project will also help to explain a mechanism of motility that is more dependent on growth than on the activity of surface appendages.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe project will support outreach activities to promote instruction at the secondary school level through a collaboration with a local high school for using the yeast model as a dynamic teaching tool.  The teaching project includes training high school teachers during a summer internship and then using undergraduate students, who are interested in science education as a career, in conjunction with graduate students to assist teachers in the classroom while teaching the modules.  The project also will support the integration of research in education at the home institution through a plan to incorporate classical yeast genetic analysis into an existing undergraduate Microbial Genetics course.  In addition the project will support a plan to incorporate whole genome deletion library screening into the class in the Fall of 2009 based on original research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nSingle-celled fungi called yeast include familiar organisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, used in brewing and baking, as well as less familiar ones like Candida albicans, which lives on the skin and in the oral and vaginal tracts of humans.  Many yeast species can generate complex, multicellular surface-attached communities called biofilms.  S. cerevisiae can generate biofilms on low density (0.3%) agar media in Petri plates that organize into complex flower-like patterns due to the formation of water channels within the biofilm.  We refer to these biofilms as mats and the process of growth as sliding motility.  Mat formation depends on a large protein in the yeast cell wall called Flo11p that allows the cells to adhere to each other and the agar substrate.  Flo11p is attached to the cell wall and is part of a group of proteins called adhesins.  A deletion of the FLO11 gene (flo11?) causes a loss of cell-cell adhesion, cell-surface adhesion, sliding motility, and pattern formation to generate a normal mat. The focus of this project is to discover pathways and proteins that control mat formation parallel to and independently of Flo11p. The following objectives were achieved during this project.\n\n1.  The vacuolar protein sorting (vps) pathway controls the trafficking of proteins and lipids from the outer (plasma) membrane of the cell to the vacuole or other membrane bound compartments within the cell.  We found that mutations in certain vps genes (i.e. vps27?) that affect membrane trafficking caused defects in mat formation that were independent of Flo11p.  For example, the vps27? mutant has a defect in mat formation, but it has normal levels of the Flo11p mRNA and protein as well as a normal distribution and localization of the Flo11p protein.  Thus, the defect is independent of Flo11p.  The vps27? mutation likely is causing a defect in mat formation by impairing the proper localization/function of a component of an unknown signal transduction pathway that affects the yeast cell wall independently of Flo11p.\n\n2.  The Wsc1p protein is a plasma membrane protein that senses changes, stresses, and alterations in the cell wall of yeast and then transduces a signal through the Rom2p and Rho1p signaling proteins to affect several signaling \"circuits\" in the cell that affect the cell wall.  We found that a wsc1? mutation blocks mat formation, but like vps27?, does so independently of Flo11p.  Our research further revealed that Wsc1p affects mat formation via a circuit involving the Skn7p transcription factor.  The Wsc1p pathway may act downstream of the vps proteins because a vps27? mutant causes mislocalization of Wsc1p \n\n3.  We discovered that 306 mutants from a whole genome deletion collection created in collaboration with Dr. Charles Boone at the University of Toronto cause defects in mat formation.\n\n4.  We also discovered that the enzyme that synthesizes the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is required for mat formation.  A PS synthase gene deletion (cho1?) cannot generate a mat properly, but appears to have normal Flo11p based on preliminary analyses.  PS is a precursor for making the phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), but mutations in PE synthesis genes reveal that the defect is specific to PS.  Furthermore, we expanded these analyses to show that loss of PS in the related yeast Candida albicans also compromise adhesion to specific substrates and cause defects in expression of a Flo11p like adhesin Als3p.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nA.    In the Fall of 2010, a grad student and I went to West High School and helped a science teacher develop a cell physiology lab on lipids in which we directed a laboratory exercise that used the yeast cho1? mutant to explore the effects of phospholipids on membrane integrity and its connection to the cell wall. \n\n B.    In addition, we have expanded our Broader Impacts to the college level.   We used the yeast biofilm model to develop a laboratory exercise for fr..."
