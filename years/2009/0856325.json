 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bi-layer material systems are present in various applications ranging from nanometer thick thin films in circuit boards to large structural elements in a building.  Fracture behavior in a bi-layer material system is a complex phenomenon and current analytical and numerical techniques are unable to describe its physical behavior when environmental effects, such as moisture, are present.  The objective of this research project is to develop an experimentally validated new simulation technique in order to understand the fracture behavior of bi-layer materials under the effect of moisture.  The proposed research is motivated from the durability concern of epoxy-concrete systems that are widely used in retrofitting concrete structures.  A framework for multi-scale simulation combining behavior at atomistic scale, and finite element method at structural level, will be developed through an optimization technique and extensive laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\nThis research will significantly advance the scientific knowledge in the area of fracture mechanics in bi-layer material systems with moisture and chemical effects, and introduce a new paradigm in engineering analysis of complex material systems.  Application and development of this methodology to infrastructure problems involving bi-material systems, such as concrete and epoxy systems, will lead to a better design, reduced maintenance cost, and help ensure public safety against unanticipated structural failures.  Knowledge and methodology developed in this project will be integrated into education via course curricula and made available for public through the OpenCourseware website of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and specialized research websites.   Every effort will be made to involve undergraduates, females, and minority students, in the conduct of the research.\r\n\r\n",
