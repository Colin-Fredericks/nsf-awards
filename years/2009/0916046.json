 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approaches to subjectivity and sentiment analysis often rely on\r\nmanually or automatically constructed lexicons. Most such lexicons are\r\ncompiled as lists of words, rather than word meanings (\"senses\").\r\nHowever, many words have both subjective and objective senses as well\r\nas senses of different polarities, which is a major source of\r\nambiguity in subjectivity and sentiment analysis.  The proposed work\r\naddresses this gap, by investigating novel methods for subjectivity\r\nsense labeling, and exploiting the results in sense-aware subjectivity\r\nand sentiment analysis.  To achieve these goals, three research\r\nobjectives are targeted. The first is developing methods for assigning\r\nsubjectivity labels to word senses in a taxonomy. The second is\r\ndeveloping contextual subjectivity disambiguation techniques to\r\neffectively make use of the word sense subjectivity annotations. The\r\nthird is applying these techniques to multiple languages, including\r\nlanguages with fewer resources than English.  The project will have\r\nbroader impacts in both research and education.  First, it will make\r\nsubjectivity and sentiment resources and tools more widely available,\r\nin multiple languages, to the research community, which will help\r\nadvance the state of the art in automatic subjectivity analysis, which\r\nin turn will benefit end applications.  Second, several educational\r\ngoals will be pursued: training graduate and undergraduate students in\r\ncomputational linguistics; augmenting artificial intelligence courses\r\nwith projects based on the proposed research, which will offer\r\nstudents hands-on experience with natural language processing\r\nresearch; and reaching out to women and minorities to increase their\r\nexposure to text processing technologies and access to research\r\nopportunities.",
