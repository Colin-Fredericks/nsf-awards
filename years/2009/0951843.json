 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to perform exploratory research into a radically different control mechanism for the tandem rolling of hot strip in a metal finishing process. This process is a highly significant part in the overall manufacturing of metals such as steel or aluminum. For example, in the case of steel almost one half of the finished product made in the world is rolled on a tandem hot strip finishing mill. The successful completion of this research will ultimately lead to a major improvement in the quality and yield of the final product of this process. The approach toward this research includes the development and verification of a mathematical model of the process, the exploratory research leading to the discovery of a novel method of nonlinear control for this process, and the evaluation of the extent of improvement in the quality and yield that will be realized in the process output. The results of this effort will be an improvement in the overall hot metal strip manufacturing process.  \r\n  \r\nThe improvement in quality and yield of the final product of tandem hot metal rolling that results from the successful completion of this research will produce major cost savings, and thus will be a significant step toward the revitalization of a vital domestic industry. A broader impact generated by these cost savings will be the incentives for the construction of new plants and the upgrade of existing facilities to counter the pressure from fierce international competition. The variety of skills required will provide an expansion of employment opportunities which will have a very positive impact on societal infrastructure. Another broader impact will be addressed by presentations at university seminars to reach graduate and undergraduate students whose employment in the metals industry will help relieve a crucial shortage of talented engineers in this area.   \r\n",
