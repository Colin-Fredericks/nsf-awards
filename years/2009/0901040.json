He has also been working to develop the asymptotics of stock-price distributions for basic models involving stochastic volatility. \r\n\r\nFefferman:  Interpolation of data is important for many purposes in science and technology. (Nearly) incompressible fluids occur in nature, but there is little fundamental understanding of how they flow.\r\nStein:  Methods of harmonic analysis used in studying operators on function spaces have vast applications in understanding a variety of phenomena in science and technology.  There is also great utility in better understanding the nature of solutions of stochastic differential equations.",
