 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-supported Program of Medium Energy Nuclear Physics will allow the nuclear physics group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to continue to lead and contribute to high-impact experiments in international nuclear physics research. The research program fea-tures two major themes, namely 1) The Structure and Formation of Hadrons, and 2) Fundamental Symmetries and the Standard Model. The physics pursued by experiments in this program will help answer questions such as, \"How is the proton built?\" and \"Is the current particle physics standard model correct?\"  Specific activities include the following major, established international experiments: G0, HERMES, MuLan, MuCap, PHENIX, E906-Drell-Yan, MuSun, Daya Bay, nEDM, g-2, and Mu2e.  The first four of these have completed data taking and all activities of the group are related to data analysis and publication preparation.  The other experiments are running or are in design or construction phases.\r\n\r\nIn addition to direct physics research outcomes, the group has reached beyond the laboratory to make significant contributions to education and outreach and will continue to do so.  Research projects contribute substantially to the education of a large number of postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students.  Outreach efforts, such as a major contribution to the literature and public appreciation of the Physics of Baseball, continue to receive broad appreciation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the period of this grant, the Nuclear Physics group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign addressed science questions in two broad areas set out by the national Nuclear Sciences Advisory Committee that establishes the agenda for our field in consultation with the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.  The two sets of questions are:  1) What is the nature of matter composed of quarks and gluons (e.g. protons and neutrons)?  and 2) What are the forces and particles at the smallest distances, or highest energies, in the universe?  In each case, together with a worldwide group of collaborators, we undertook experiments to try to answer certain aspects of these questions.\n\nQuarks are the constituents of the particles of atomic nuclei, protons and neutrons, just as atoms are the constituents of ordinary matter.  However, unlike ordinary matter, the forces between the quarks are so strong and involve so much energy that sometimes that energy is converted into more quarks, according to Einstein\u00c6s famous E = mc2.  It is convenient to think about this energy as being composed of particles, called gluons.  Although the conversion of energy to matter is rare in the interactions of and within ordinary atoms, it is not absent, and we hope to deepen our knowledge of both systems by comparison and contrast.  In this microscopic world, the spin of particles (similar to the earth spinning on its axis while orbiting the sun), is an important key to understanding how these strong forces affect the structure.  Three of our major experiments in this area have made new measurements of the spins and orbital motion of different kinds of quarks in protons and neutrons, finding surprising indications of orbital motion; we are also finding that although the gluons might have also made a substantial contribution to the spin of the proton, it appears, in fact to be quite small.  Finally, we have found that the conversion of energy into different types of quarks has an unusual pattern.\n\nOur model of the particles and their interactions at the highest energies has proven remarkably accurate in describing experimental observations.  There are, nevertheless, strong indications that the model is incomplete.  In its present form, for example, there are some delicate cancellations required to explain in a consistent way the wide range of phenomena we observe in nature.  Among these phenomena are the very different masses of particles called neutrinos, and, for example, the recently discovered Higgs boson &ndash; a particle a trillion times more massive than a neutrino.  Another indication of the limits of our current understanding is the very large difference we see in the amount of matter in the universe as compared with the amount of antimatter.  We are participating in two types of complementary experiments whose goals are to help fill out our model in this unexplored territory.  Neutrinos play a central role and may be critical to understanding what lies beyond our current model.  Their properties are unusual: there are three different types that, in a sense, only reveal their identity when they are measured; their overall properties are such that it is possible they are their own anti-particles &ndash; unique among the fundamental particles.  In our experiments, a fundamental characteristic of their mixed identity has been measured for the first time &ndash; a characteristic that may play an important role in the matter-antimatter asymmetry; and a stringent limit has been placed on the likelihood that neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are one and the same.  Finally, we have made significant progress in the development of ambitious experiments to look for one of the other possible sources of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas H Beck"
