Walters\r\n4th International Conference on Open Repositories, 2009\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe 4th International Conference on Open Repositories will be held May 18th - 21st, 2009 at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT). The venue will be Georgia Tech?s Hotel and Conference Center and Global Learning Conference Center. The conference is being hosted by the Georgia Tech Library and Information Center.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nSince 2006, the International Conference on Open Repositories has been a worldwide event where people, ideas, and recent innovations in digital repository development are communicated, explored, and advanced.  Significant enhancements to the lifecycle management of digital assets of importance to science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), and many other academic disciplines through repositories occurs via the human interchange taking place at Open Repositories conferences. The upcoming interchanges at OR09 should lead to new and maturing partnerships that support digital repository advancements while increasing repositories value as an essential element of cyberinfrastructure for research and education.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\nThe upcoming interchanges at OR09 will lead to new and maturing partnerships that support digital repository advancements, increasing repositories? value as an essential element of cyberinfrastructure for research and education.  The benefits to society are that information and data of import to the STEM disciplines will become more easily accessible and with greater speed, and will be better preserved for future generations. The public as well as scientific and scholarly communities will have access to the knowledge shared at the OR09 conference.\r\n",
