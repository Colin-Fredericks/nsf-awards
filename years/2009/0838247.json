 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researchers will use the locations of secondary ocean microseisms noise to improve the\r\ntemporal resolution of changes in crustal velocity, and to map the locations of coastal\r\nreflections of primary ocean waves. The proposed microseisms source location technique\r\nis based on an algorithm developed for real-time earthquake locations and is suitable for\r\nareas like Southern California where multiple simultaneous sources are located within a\r\nfew hundred km offshore and where there is a well distributed seismic array on land. The\r\nuse of source locations overcomes a problem with standard correlation methods that\r\nrequire a random distribution of sources to achieve precise measurements, which\r\ntranslates to long correlation times and hence a reduced temporal resolution. Using a set\r\nof source locations, a shorter synthetic seismogram can be used in the correlation. The\r\ncoastal reflection points will be determined by forming an adjoint problem with the\r\nhypothesized reflection source and an incident primary wavefield determined from high resolution\r\nWave Action Models (WAM's).\r\n\r\nThe source locations procedure is demonstrated with both a synthetic and real data\r\nexamples. The results show that there are often many source points active at any given\r\ntime. They provide two independent approaches: (1)\r\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements of the intensity of wave-wave\r\ninteractions at the source regions ? a necessary condition for microseisms generation. A\r\nnew airborne system that will be flown in June 2008 over the offshore S. California to\r\nlook for opposing ocean wavefields which are indicative of the source points. (2) A\r\ncomparison between the amplitudes of the observed micoseisms and estimated\r\namplitudes calculated using the source locations and the theory of ocean microseisms.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the\r\ncoastal reflections is currently poorly understood. This research will provide the\r\nopportunity to develop a model for this process and to ultimately to generate a description\r\nof the complete wave-field that can be incorporated into the next generation of Wave\r\nAction Models. Microseisms provide a means to continuously monitor the Rayleigh\r\nwave speed across the Los Angeles basins as a potential proxy for stress changes. The\r\nuse of sources in this procedure increases the temporal resolutions and removes the\r\nproblem of systematic bias due to the assumption of random source locations.\r\n\r\nThis research bridges three communities: radar interferometry,\r\noceanography and seismology and hence has the potential to spur research in all these\r\nareas. Determining the mechanisms for coastal reflections will significantly enhance the\r\ncommunity wave action models. The application to southern California can be extended\r\nto several other areas including northern California, Cascadia, and Japan. The procedure\r\nestablished by this research could become part of the standard seismic monitoring of\r\nSouthern California",
