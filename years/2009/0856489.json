The probability distribution of\r\ninterest is implicitly defined as the stationary distribution of a Markov process.\r\n\r\nMarkov processes are frequently used to model complex systems in a wide variety\r\nof areas including reliability and telecommunications. The rare event of \r\ninterest might correspond to states in which a highly reliable system has failed or when a buffer in a telecommunications network is full so that arriving packets would be lost. In well-designed systems, such events should be rare, but it can be critical to know how rare. Exact asymptotic expressions accurately approximate the probability of these rare events. In addition to knowing their probability, it can be beneficial to know how these rare events develop. Typically, they are preceded by the same type of behavior. For example, packets overflowing a particular buffer in a communications network may almost always be preceded first by a large increase in the number of packets at another node.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding\r\nof rare events, to exact asymptotic expressions for their probabilities, and to\r\nresults describing the system evolution prior to their occurrence. The analytical expressions will allow accurate assessment of the probability of rare events in complicated systems. Designers of complex systems will be able to use these results to determine whether a particular design meets performance specifications.\r\n\r\nIn addition, by knowing how the process evolves prior to the occurrence of the\r\nrare event, designers would have a better understanding of where to modify the\r\nsystem to improve performance.",
