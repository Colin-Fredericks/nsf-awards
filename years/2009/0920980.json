Existing research explores the dynamics of Fair Trade in coffee and its implications for peasant producers.  Yet Fair Trade's most rapid growth is now in commodities, such as flowers, which are produced by large enterprises using hired workers. There has to date been little research on the nature of these new commodity chains or their impacts on hired laborers, a significant share of whom are women. This project addresses this research gap, analyzing three key questions: (1) What types of commodity and non-commodity ties exist in global Fair Trade flower chains and how have Ecuadorian plantations been integrated into these networks?  (2) How successful has Fair Trade, which was designed to address the conditions of peasant producers, been at promoting partnerships with worker organizations and improving the conditions of workers employed by certified plantations?  (3) How does Fair Trade effect gender dynamics on certified plantations and what are the implications of certification how female as well as male workers?   \r\n\r\nThis project pursues a multi-level multi-method approach and entails 5 months of field research in Ecuador. It analyzes world Fair Trade flower markets, the Ecuadorian plantations supplying those markets, and the conditions of workers on those plantations. Research methods combine document reviews, ethnographic observations, 60-75 semi-structured interviews with Ecuadorian and US Fair Trade network actors, plantation managers, and worker organization leaders, focus groups with 40-56 female flower workers, and a random sample survey of 160 male and female workers. Integrating qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, the study gains both depth and breadth of understanding of Fair Trade flower networks and socio-economic production conditions. \r\n\r\nThis study will provide the first detailed analysis of Fair Trade's impacts on plantation enterprises and gendered labor in Latin America. The project contributes to key debates within Sociology and related social science disciplines. It informs and advances theoretical and empirical understanding in three key areas. The research strengthens our understanding of globalization and new forms of regulation by focusing on an initiative that is both a social movement and a certification system. It provides insights into how global commodity chains operate, focusing on how alternative norms of fairness may be integrated into trade relations and participating organizations. And, it sheds light on the implications of Fair Trade for workers, exploring particularly the integration of female workers.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis project integrates research and education activities in training a US graduate student and working closely with counterparts in Ecuador. It broadens the participation of underrepresented groups, giving voice to Ecuadorian flower workers in general and female workers in particular.  The project lays the groundwork for future collaborations between US and Latin American researchers.  Data will be shared with Ecuadorian counterparts and with affiliates of the Center for Fair & Alternative Trade (CFAT) with documents added to the CFAT collection at Colorado State University.  Project findings will be disseminated broadly to US and Ecuadorian academics, policy-makers, practitioners, and concerned citizens. The project will have strong societal impacts, providing access to needed information and pointing to avenues for strengthening existing programs that seek to ameliorate potential negative consequences of international trade.",
