The objective of the meeting will be to encourage students of under-represented backgrounds in science to pursue academic degrees STEM disciplines. The topic of the conference will be Sustaining Geosciences and it will include key note speakers, technical sessions, poster sessions, and exhibits. This student-centered meeting will facilitate mentoring interactions between professional members of the association and students. In addition, there will be opportunities for academic institutions, government agencies, and industry to recruit students for internships and permanent jobs.",
