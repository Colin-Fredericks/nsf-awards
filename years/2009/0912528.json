 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project is designed to enhance performance of small wind turbines, i.e., increased efficiency and kWh production, through advanced aerofoil design (as achieved with the proposed acceleration plate), will reduce the overall cost of operation (capital cost minus energy cost savings) and decrease the achievable payback resulting in a more overall cost effective system. The company and their university partner combine business and university expertise needed to evaluate and enhance the wind turbine design through modeling, simulation and experimental verification. These activities include computational fluid dynamics, prototype construction and testing in a wind tunnel.\r\nThis wind harvester incorporates a novel acceleration plate to direct air flow over the turbine rotors to increase the air speed and enhance the performance of the wind turbine. This design is most appropriate for small vertical axis turbines.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of a small cost effective wind turbine as a result of this research program will eventually have broad impact on society in the form of an inexpensive, clean source of renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).",
