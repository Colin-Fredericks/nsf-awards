 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAGER: Micromachined Thermophones with Engineered Thermo-acoustic Response\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to design, fabricate, and characterize a group of novel air-operated ultrasonic transducers that can significantly push the limits of acoustic ranging and detection systems.  The approach to achieve the above goal is to use thermo-acoustic generation of ultrasound by integrating wideband speakers and microphones on the same substrate.  The substrate thermo-acoustic properties are engineered using micro and nano fabrication technologies in order to optimize the performance.\r\nThe intellectual merits of the proposed research lies in the design and fabrication of highly-optimized thermo-acoustic transducers.  These include tailoring substrate micro and nano architecture, development of fabrication processes to so, integration of optimally designed heaters on the substrates, fabrication and full characterization of such transducers.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research are advances in applications that require long range and high resolution ultrasonic ranging and imaging such as robotics, surveillance, and smart guidance systems.  For example, navigation systems used for visually impaired individuals can benefit immensely from such high resolution ultrasonic transducers. In the education and outreach area, under-represented and minority undergraduate students will be included throughout the course of the proposed research project.  In addition, the PI will develop an educational exhibition/booth to be located at the Purdue University Birck Nanotechnology Center lobby area for hands-on activity and demonstrations for local high-school students.  The exhibition/booth will incorporate educational items related to ultrasonic transducers, its operating principle, and their applications in technology and natural world (e.g., bat sonar).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
