Ohio State University (OSU) and Wright State  University (WSU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with OSU as the lead institution.  \r\n\r\nSurveillance and situational awareness are critical technologies needed to address societal needs of safety and security.  Surveillance is used to provide our nation with both international and homeland security, and situational awareness for disaster mitigation and management (e.g. Hurricane Katrina).  The main motivation behind the proposed center is to address the theory behind the complex surveillance systems mostly based on sensors and sensor systems.  The proposed Center is expected to generate research that significantly advances current surveillance theory and technology and to become a focal point within the surveillance community. The inherent multidisciplinary nature of surveillance systems means that the Center will include researchers across a broad spectrum of disciplines, including signal processing, computer science, sensor technology and human factors.  OSU and WSU plan to use the NSF planning grant fund to hold a meeting with prospective industrial partners to establish the proposed Center's organizational framework, and to establish research projects of greatest relevance. \r\n\r\nThe research advances in surveillance technology developed by CST will be transitioned to applications of significant societal and national interest.  The Center plans to develop and promote a collaborative, focused scientific community in surveillance theory, including short courses, cross departmental and cross-university graduate course offerings, and internships with member organizations.  CST will recruit underrepresented groups, and plans to leverage existing programs such as the Ohio STEM Ability Alliance, the ADVANCE program at OSU, and through collaborations with the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate's Minority Leaders Program.",
