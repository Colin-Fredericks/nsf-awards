Unlike other undergraduate research programs, this project is actively training students to take their ideas and research results to the market place, resulting in new minority owned businesses related to alternative energy. \r\n\r\nThe program has three major components. First, we are developing a new course in \"Energy and Fuels\". This course is for science majors who have a good basic science background but do not have specialized knowledge from advanced courses. The second component is undergraduate research experience in alternative fuels. This element serves the dual function of providing an advanced laboratory in which students learn the techniques, and a way for students to perform and publish original research in alternative fuels. Finally, participating students are taking an existing class in \"Entrepreneurial Development\", where they are learning to put their ideas on alternative energy into a formal business plan. Mentoring is also being provided for students who wish to start energy related businesses on graduation\r\n",
