 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many biologically active compounds are chiral, and more than 50% of today's top-selling drugs are marketed as single enantiomers. The high and ever-increasing demand for enantiopure compounds requires constant progress in asymmetric synthesis. In particular, the development of new catalysts continues to be crucial. Chiral bisoxazolidines with a rigid C2-symmetric scaffold have very promising applications in asymmetric catalysis. This new class of N,O-donor ligands will be applied in challenging enantioselective carbon-carbon bond formation reactions. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic Synthesis: Methodology and Organometallic Program is supporting the research of Professor Christian Wolf of the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University.  Professor Wolf's research is aimed at the development of new chiral bisoxazolidine ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Studies to elucidate the mechanism of bisoxazolidine-catalyzed reactions and efforts to fine-tune the catalytic efficiency and asymmetric induction of this class of ligands will be undertaken. The successful development of new asymmetric catalysts is expected to provide new tools for the synthesis of complex chiral target molecules. This will have an impact on the pharmaceutical, food, and agricultural industries.",
