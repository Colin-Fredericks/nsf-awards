The expected outcomes include a set of guidelines for integration of visualizations into a standardized online lab user interface; on assisting curriculum developers and teachers in identifying the types of visualizations that are most useful in supporting student learning in an authentic scientific inquiry; and on guiding their search for appropriate visualization resources in NSDL repositories.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the ways in which learning experiences can be effectively designed by asking questions: about types of visualizations needed to support student learning; about the place in the learning sequence where each visualization and accompanying activity is placed; about giving a choice to learners whether they are directed to specific visualizations at specific points in the inquiry process or whether they are allowed to choose which visualization to view at their discretion. By producing specific guidelines, this project has a potential to improve the integration of appropriate visualizations into student scientific investigation activities, support individualized learning paths, and accommodate different learning approaches.\r\n\r\nThe guidelines developed during this project are shared with the NSDL Technical Network Services Group, all end-users of Teachers' Domain or other NSDL archives. They provide more descriptive metadata that improves the search and selection of appropriate visualizations from these repositories and can serve as a model for improving resource integration in a wide range of learning contexts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStudents taking science courses engage in lab activities that teach them important principles and concepts.  The resources required to establish and support these labs often place financial burdens on teachers and schools.  Space, equipment, and expertise are necessary to ensure students have hands-on experiences that can support their understandings of biology, chemistry, physics, and other science content areas.   A variety of tools and materials have been developed that attempt to alleviate some of these resource burdens, while also offering authentic, valuable educational experiences.   One specific case that has received considerable attention is the use of online-learning interactions, during which students can gain access to tools, experts, and activities from other locations and sites that are traditionally unavailable in their school and class environments.  The current project examined the kinds of experiences and responses that students show to remote online labs, which permit students to access real laboratory equipment via a web browser.  For example, students can complete research activities that involve testing hypotheses and collecting data about radiation by accessing the actual devices housed in labs at universities or other facilities around the world. To date, tools like this have been designed in a rather unsystematic way.  Our project assessed the particular kinds of designs that might prove more or less helpful for students\u00c6 use of these kinds of systems.\n\nOur project specifically focused on two elements of remote labs.  First, we examined whether interacting with actual devices through a live webcam interface might foster interest and understandings, as compared to interacting with those devices without the webcam.  This is an important question, given that the use of the webcam requires additional resources that might not be worth the cost if benefits are not clearly obtained.  Our results showed that such a cost is beneficial.  Videos can show students a phenomenon under investigation or the equipment used to study a phenomenon.  For remote labs, live webcams provide evidence that the lab is occurring in real-time, which helps students understand that a real experiment is taking place. Videos also enhance the authenticity of the remote lab, helping students to become more engaged during the experience. For instance, in our project, students who saw a live video during a remote lab wrote better research questions and were more likely to want to run the lab multiple times, in contrast to students who merely viewed a picture of lab tools.

This engagement prepares students for seeing and interpreting their results.\n\nThese results indi..."
