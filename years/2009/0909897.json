 "awd_abstract_narration": "Birds living in temperate regions are valuable for studying the molecular evolution of reproductive genes because reproduction takes place during a brief breeding season. Genes involved with reproduction could be active primarily during this time of year. Such genes may have evolved in response to natural selection, and could have a role in the formation of new species through influences on barriers to fertilization. Only a few reproductive genes have been studied, and most of the work has been in a few model organisms. Members of the Australian bird family Maluridae (Australian wrens), have an extremely high level of sperm production, suggesting an unusual genetic influence on reproduction. The first goal of this study is to identify novel reproductive genes that are expressed in the testes. Then the mechanisms of evolution of these genes will be examined and their diversification within the Maluridae will be compared with control genes that have not been exposed to natural selection. A final study, of geographic variation for one species, will give a better understanding of the underlying source of selection on reproductive genes. \r\n\r\nThis project includes collaboration with a several Australian organizations, which will foster the exchange of academic knowledge and scientific technology between Australia and the United States, and it will serve as an example of applying the most recent genetic methods to non-model organisms. Local landowners will be educated about the project. In addition, samples used for this study will be provided as museum voucher specimens to serve as resources to other scientists as well as the general public.\r\n",
