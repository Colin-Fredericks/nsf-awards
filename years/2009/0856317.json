Because these infrastructures depend on systems that were not defined to be secure, determined adversaries can easily attack with impunity these infrastructures through vulnerabilities in the underlying networks and computers.   For years, the approach to achieving security has been to patch systems to remove vulnerabilities as they are discovered, often by adversaries, or to detect attacks as they are launched or, hopefully, shortly thereafter.  This approach will not work against determined adversaries.\r\n\r\nNSF and other research funding agencies has been pursing new research ideas towards security and privacy, but usually such research does not lead to products and services that are fit into industry?s business models.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop will attempt to accelerate the collaboration of the security research community and industry towards sound ideas for the attainment of security and privacy but which industry sees as the basis for future products and services. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will produce a detailed report to be posted on the NSF web site \r\n",
