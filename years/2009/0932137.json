 "awd_abstract_narration": "This HBCU RISE proposal seeks support for the Center in the Environmental Sciences Institute at Florida A&M University devoted to the Study of Microbial Ecology, Molecular Biology, Biotechnology and Water Quality. The proposed HBCU-RISE project at FAMU will be in collaboration with researchers at the University of Southern Mississippi Gulf Coast  Research Laboratory (GCRL), University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Science and the J. Craig Ventner Institute of Genomic Research. The proposed Center already has an established foundation upon which to build, the highly productive Molecular Microbial Ecology Laboratory (MME Lab) initiated in 2005.with support from the previous 2005 HBCU RISE award. The Center will provide high quality research, instruction and expertise in microbial ecology linked to molecular biology techniques and concepts. Two major sub-projects proposed under the overarching theme are 1) to compare the ecology and role of the BALOs and viruses in bacterial mortality and the cycling of nutrients and 2) to sequence the genome of novel BALOs that appear to have an important role in bacterial mortality of specific species. The results of the Center?s research will be broadly disseminated through publications and presentations at international and national conferences.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this proposal is that it would provide for students extensive learning and training opportunities in microbiology, aquatic sciences, molecular biology and bioinformatics. Activities are also included for high school, undergraduate and pre-college teachers also The BALO?s uniqueness and action packed life style make them an excellent model for attracting and holding the attention of students at all educational levels. As such they will enhance the educational outreach components of the proposed project.\r\n",
