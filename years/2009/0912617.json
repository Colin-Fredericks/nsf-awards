Nanocellulose networks produced by the bacteria Acetobacter xylinum are biomaterials with unique hydrogel-like properties and biocompatibility that is ideal for cartilage tissue replacement. For applications such as meniscus there is however need to direct the nanofibril orientation. A new biofabrication process has been invented at Virginia Tech in which the precise control of bacterial motion in an electric field is used to control morphology of the nanocellulose network. In this project a microweaver, a device to manufacture customizable meniscus implants based on images from patients will be developed. This will be a major breakthrough in biomaterials for orthopedics applications. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is technology for inexpensive but high performance, biocompatible materials for health care. Over 15 million people worldwide suffer from knee-joint failure each year. More than 225,000 people annually undergo arthroscopic meniscal repair at an average cost of $25,000 each. There are no satisfactory products on the market today and there is an urgent need for a new biomaterial that mimics properties of natural meniscus. By developing a meniscal implant that can substitute for the injured native meniscus, it may be possible to diminish the prevalence of osteoarthritis and its related economic costs. BC Genesis LLC is a biomedical start-up company working with technology for developing implants and tissue scaffolds by using bacteria to grow cellulose biomaterial.\r\n\r\n",
