 "awd_abstract_narration": "Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a recent form of declarative programming that has been applied to many knowledge-intensive tasks, such as product configuration, planning, diagnosis, and information integration. Like other computing paradigms, such as SAT (Satisfiability Checking) and CP (Constraint Programming), ASP provides a common basis for formalizing and solving various problems, but is distinct from others in that it focuses on knowledge representation and has proved to be useful for rapid prototyping. While the research on ASP has produced many promising results, it has also identified serious limitations.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at overcoming the limitations by merging ASP with other computing paradigms, such as satisfiability checking, first-order logic and constraint programming, and exploring the synergy between them. This project is expected to provide a transformative understanding of ASP's relation to other computing paradigms, to enhance ASP's reasoning capability and broaden the areas in which it is effective. Within knowledge representation, the study will clarify the role of ASP as a major knowledge representation formalism with effective computation methods that combines various methods available in other computing paradigms.",
