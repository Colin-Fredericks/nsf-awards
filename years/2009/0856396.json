The Oklahoma project, STEM Double Bridge: Connecting High Schools, Community Colleges, and Universities for Tomorrow's Leaders in Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics, has used their experience with a previously funded STEP award to develop activities and initiatives that target incoming high school students and community college transfers.  The project's Summer Bridge program will provide a four-week, residential lecture and research experience to incoming freshmen who have expressed an interest in a STEM discipline.  New to the Oklahoma program, this program element will incorporate five area high school teachers who will serve as advisors to the program and who will work with the students on their research projects.   A second bridge, called the Fall Bridge, will target community and technical college students who are entering four-year programs.   This one-week residential program will provide the students with a campus orientation and academic advisement, provide assistance in developing writing and mathematics skills, introduce the students to the library system, and provide sessions on research methods and guidance in reading scientific articles.",
