 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project seeks to develop miniaturized optical spectrometers with high resolving power and wide operating wavelength ranges.  The realization of such devices will open up important new applications areas.  Factors which have limited the usage of current spectrometers include their size, weight, complexity, and cost.  This project seeks to use both integrated optical (that is, mainly 2D) elements as well as micro-optical (3D) components to create a new type of spectrometer. We propose a unique separation of functions between these elements that allows for miniaturization, which is not available with pure integrated optical or pure micro-optical designs. The 2D part of the microspectrometer is implemented in a planar waveguide. The 3D part is mounted on top of the waveguide slab. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of these devices will be a broadband spectral sensor that is orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest devices currently available.  This diffractive imaging micro-spectrometer is expected to promote transformative changes in industry sectors dealing with micro-systems that use optical spectroscopy.",

In addition, the production volume and price of these devices is limited by the necessity to precisely assemble multiple components onto an optical bench.  We have shown that the critical components for the DIS can be fabricated on the wafer level using nano-imprint lithography (NIL).\n\n \n\nBy using NIL we have demonstrated the potential for producing a compact (less than 12.7 mm cube), inexpensive (less than $200 in volume) spectrometer that can be produced in quantities of more than 10,000 per year.  These characteristics represent a disruptive technology in analytical science that has the potential for major impacts in environmental monitoring, point of care diagnostics, chemical and biological agent detection, and process monitoring.  \n\n \n\nIn addition, the insight that we gained in nanoimprinting small devices that are sparsely distributed over a large wafer has implications for other such devices, both optical and non-optical. \n\n \n\nFinally, through the research education of undergraduates (REU) program, we where able to include two undergraduate electrical engineering students in the project.
