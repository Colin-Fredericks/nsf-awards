 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eigenvalue computation is a fundamental problem in numerical\r\nlinear algebra. While there are numerous established algorithms\r\nfor this, they do not guarantee in general to compute, in a\r\nfloating point arithmetic, smaller eigenvalues to high relative\r\naccuracy. Indeed, the relative errors of smaller eigenvalues\r\ncomputed by conventional algorithms are proportional to the\r\ncondition number of the matrix. Research over the last two\r\ndecades has resulted in several classes of special matrices\r\nfor which the eigenvalues/eigenvectors can be computed to high\r\nrelative accuracy (i.e. independent of the condition number).\r\nAll existing high relative accuracy algorithms, however, appear\r\nto concern small (dense) matrices only. Yet, large matrices are\r\noften inherently ill-conditioned and it is typically a few\r\nsmaller eigenvalues that are of interests. The goals of this\r\nproposal are to study high relative accuracy iterative\r\nalgorithms for computing a few eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a\r\nlarge symmetric positive definite matrix. The investigator will\r\ndevelop algorithms for matrices arising in some important\r\napplications such as discretization of differential operators\r\nand dimensionality reduction in machine learning, where special\r\nstructure/properties of the matrices may be exploited to\r\nachieve higher accuracy.\r\n\r\nSpectral (eigenvalue) analysis is a widely used mathematical\r\ntool in science and engineering. Eigenvalues of differential\r\noperators describe the natural vibrating frequencies of\r\nmechanical structures. Dimensionality reduction of\r\nhigh-dimensional data in machine learning often leads to\r\nminimization of certain quadratic functionals, the solutions of\r\nwhich are eigenvectors. Solving such eigenvalue problems to\r\nhigh relative accuracy pose a challenge to existing algorithms.\r\nTherefore, the proposed works will not only advance theoretical\r\nfoundations and algorithm developments for large scale\r\neigenvalue problems, but also contribute to the general areas\r\nof applied science/engineering and machine learning by\r\nsignificantly improving the accuracy of the algorithms used in\r\nthese applications.",
