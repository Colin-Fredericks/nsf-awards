 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological systems respond to environmental stresses and chemical agents by producing unique biochemical signatures, i.e. biomarkers, that - when detected and interpreted correctly - yield enormous insight into the state of the organism. Thus, the central objective of this work is to develop an integrated instrument that detects and identifies biomarkers by acquiring small- volume fluid samples, separating and pre-concentrating the biologically important components in a nanofluidic-microfluidic chip, and then characterizing them using on-line mass spectrometry in a miniature mass spectrometer. In the process, the applicability of molecular identification tools in biological research will be enhanced by significantly decreasing the concentration levels at which specific organic molecules can be detected in complex mixtures. Novel protocols for transferring and ionizing compounds of interest based on high-frequency ac electrospray ionization and desorption electrospray ionization methods will be developed and compared with respect to figures of merit, such as mass transfer efficiency, sensitivity and background interferences. One specific aim is to improve the efficiency of the ionization step, by far the least efficient process in mass spectrometry. Critical performance tests of the analysis system will target biomarkers for \r\noxidative stress using biofluids which mimic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). \r\nThe coupling of micro/nano fluidic sample preparation to miniature atmospheric pressure mass spectrometers offers much value to the biological sciences, for example making it possible to realize real-time functional assays of changes in fundamental metabolic, regulatory and signaling processes in response to environmental factors. Fundamental improvements in the performance of mass spectrometers and in microfluidic devices will result from the synergy of this project, making possible future generations of biological instruments of great power and utility.  In addition to the direct relevance to biological research, successful instrumentation development will impact medical diagnostics:  The same markers relevant to biological oxidation processes are germane to the early detection and prognosis in a host of diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Niemann-Pick C, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, heart disease, Parkinson's disease and ischemic stroke, making the results readily translatable to human health studies.  Furthermore, the training of highly skilled instrumentation scientists is an emerging national need, and this need will be addressed by formalizing collaboration through (1) research student exchange between Notre Dame and Purdue and (2) larger scale exchanges between Purdue's Center for Analytical Instrumentation Development (CAID) and Notre Dame's Advanced Diagnostics and Therapeutics Initiative. Both institutions aim to (i) train graduate students in instrumentation science (ii) engage in instrumentation development, (iii) facilitate its commercialization, (iv) benefit the regional economy through instrument commercialization.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed at analysis of chemicals in small volumes of biological fluid.  This is important for fundamental studies of many biological processes and systems.  It is also central to diagnostics in personalized medicine.  As often happens in science, our original idea was displaced, early in the project, by a better idea.  The better idea was to transfer a small quantity of the biological material to a paper triangle add solvent, apply a voltage, and collect the fine spray in a mass spectrometer.  The experiment is called paper spray (Figure 1). It gives charged molecules and the mass spectrometer allows their identification.  So, taking the case of drugs circulating in the blood of a patient, the nature of the drug and its level could be measured using this method.  Such measurements are made routinely but are relatively slow and quite expensive.  The new method is fast and can be automated and gives similar results to the slower standard procedure (Figure 2).\n\n \n\nWorking in part with support from a private foundation, the paper spray method was automated and made more convenient and reliable. Most significantly, it was transferred to a miniature mass spectrometer (shown in Fig. 2) then under construction using other funds and a start-up company built a prototype of the combined system.  This device was tested in several drug companies and two hospitals over a period of almost two years.  The results were excellent and the technology which is summarized in a number of patents has been licensed by Purdue Research Foundation on behalf of the University. \n\n \n\nIn the latter stages of the project additional extensions and improvements were made to apply paper spray to other types of problems including drugs of abuse and food contamination.   The research and development needed for this project has served as a platform to train scientists in analytical instrumentation.  Participants in the project came from all academic levels, including undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral students.  They also represent an ethnically, racially and culturally diverse group of scientists.  The training in the development of new analytical instrumentation in part through Purdue\u00c6s Center for Analytical Instrumentation Development was a key feature of the human capital development of the project.      \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: R.
