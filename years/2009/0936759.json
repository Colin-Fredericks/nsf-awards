 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This is a three-year collaborative research project between Old Dominion University and Norfolk State University examining gender issues in professional identity development among engineering (ENG) and computer science (CS) students. Developing professional identity can help engender a sense of belonging in the STEM field that ultimately contributes to undergraduate retention. Grounded in social cognitive career theory (SCCT), this project investigates the mechanisms by which professional identity is developed when students capitalize on self-development opportunities available outside of the classroom. \r\n \r\nThis project applies SCCT, a well established theoretical framework, to capitalization, a new area of research.  Investigating capitalization using SCCT contributes to understanding gender differences in STEM and to the broader social psychology and capitalization literatures. Multiple research methods are used, including qualitative critical incident interviews, quantitative longitudinal surveys, and quasi-experimental design to test utility of capitalization training. The proposal includes several benchmarks and an experienced evaluator to oversee all assessment and statistical aspects of the project. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research contributes to the development of human capital by identifying mechanisms for intervention in the effort to increase gender equity in STEM. The training experiment is expected to yield evidenced-based methods for improving capitalization antecedents and capitalization; and, as a result, contribute to the development of professional identity, thereby leveling the playing field for women. Since capitalization is a self-development skill known to yield positive benefits in the workforce, skills developed at the undergraduate level will contribute to the development and retention of STEM professionals as well. Examining a Historically Black University and a Predominantly White University broadens the understanding of capitalization across contexts. Expanding the knowledge base regarding supports and barriers at each university type provides the opportunity to derive a common set of ?best practices? with wide applicability. Research findings will be shared via an interactive website; international, national and regional conferences and journal publications; and brochures and email campaigns targeted to relevant departments and professional societies nationally.\r\n",
