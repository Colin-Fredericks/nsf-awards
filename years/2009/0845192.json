 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\n\r\nAs computing becomes embedded in the very fabric of our society, the\r\nexponential growth and advances in cheap, high-speed communication\r\ninfrastructures allow for unprecedented levels of global information\r\nexchange and interaction. As a result, new market forces emerge that propel\r\ntoward a fundamental, cost-efficient paradigm shift in the way computing is\r\ndeployed and delivered: computing outsourcing.\r\n\r\nOutsourcing has the potential to minimize client-side management overheads\r\nand benefit from a service provider's global expertise consolidation and\r\nbulk pricing. Companies such as Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and Sun are rushing\r\nto offer increasingly complex storage and computation outsourcing services\r\nsupported by globally distributed \"cloud\" infrastructures.\r\n\r\nYet significant challenges lie in the path to successful large-scale\r\nadoption. In business, healthcare and government frameworks, clients are\r\nreluctant to place sensitive data under the control of a remote, third-\r\nparty provider, without practical assurances of privacy and confidentiality.\r\nToday's solutions however, do not offer such assurances, and are thus\r\nfundamentally insecure and vulnerable to illicit behavior. Existing research\r\naddresses several aspects of this problem, but advancing the state of the\r\nart to practical realms will require a fundamental leap.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses these challenges by designing, implementing and\r\nanalyzing practical data outsourcing protocols with strong assurances of\r\nprivacy and confidentiality.  It will also l initiate the exploration of the cost and energy\r\nfootprints of outsourcing mechanisms. This is essential as the main raison\r\nd'etre of outsourcing paradigms lies in their assumed end-to-end cost\r\nsavings and expertise consolidation. Yet, research has yet to explore and\r\nvalidate the magnitudes of these savings and their underlying assumptions.",
