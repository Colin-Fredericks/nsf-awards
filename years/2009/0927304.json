 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this BRIGE award is to gain a physical understanding of the behavior of an interface between two lubricated surfaces that are contaminated with solid particles and involved in cyclical rolling-sliding contact.  The primary testbed for this research involves the gear teeth of a power transmission device that has been infiltrated with solid contaminants.  A vital aspect of this work involves the combined modeling of the various physical interactions that take place within this interface, including lubricant fluid flow, particle motion, particle-surface contact, and the resultant abrasive wear that is experienced by both surfaces.  An additional component of this work involves a series of experimental wear measurements which will be conducted using a geartrain test rig.  The results of the experimental geartrain tests will be compared to the predicted wear from the model in order to verify the modeling accuracy.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will enhance the academic understanding of contaminated rolling-sliding contact, and will also aid in the prediction of overall gear life as a function of its exposure to varying levels and types of contaminants.  This research confronts an important challenge involving the lifetime performance of mechanical power systems which are exposed to extreme environmental conditions.  Such systems, which have recently emerged as enabling technologies for numerous applications ranging from power generation to space exploration, must be designed and tested for their ability to withstand infiltrated contaminants.  The existence of an experimentally-validated model for contaminant-based wear prediction will aid to optimize geartrain design for wear resistance, and will also decrease the number of required field tests, thus reducing costs.  Additionally, this project will serve to enhance the participation of underrepresented minorities who pursue engineering careers through the use of seminar modules and research activities that are geared towards pre-college minority students.\r\n",
