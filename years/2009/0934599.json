Its purpose is to increase the number of exemplary K-12 STEM teachers by targeting two specific candidate pools: Pacific University undergraduate STEM majors and career-changing STEM professionals. Individuals with no secondary school experience but interested in making teaching a career are strongly urged to complete a 30 hour volunteer internship with a mentor teacher. PSTP is providing up to two years of Noyce Scholarship support for 35 STEM teaching candidates, who are obligated for two years of service in a high needs school district for each year of support received. Teachers graduate with a Master of Arts in Teaching and are supported with an induction program for three years.",
