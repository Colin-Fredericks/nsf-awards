The Truman State University mission includes an emphasis on integrating original research in undergraduate education, and its faculty are committed to providing their students with a rich research-intensive learning environment through faculty-mentored student research opportunities and direct inclusion of research into its curriculum. Five Truman faculty members use confocal microscopy in their research projects, specifically, exploring: development and cell migration in C. elegans, genetic control of the shoot apical meristem in maize, actin dynamics during plant gravitropism, and plant-endophytic fungi interactions. In addition, the confocal microscope will be used in investigative labs in eight courses, ranging from core courses to upper-level electives. Each year, a diverse student population (more than 300 students, including an increasing number of minorities (currently 12.4%), and students with majors in Biology, Chemistry, Health Science, Exercise Science, Mathematics and Computer Science) will receive training in confocal technique and gain hands-on experience with the confocal microscope via laboratory-based courses. Research results will be disseminated through faculty and student presentations at scientific research conferences and in publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals.",
