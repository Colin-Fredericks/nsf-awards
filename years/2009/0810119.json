 "awd_abstract_narration": "****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nNanotechnology is well known as an important part of the economy, both present and future, but most people do not realize that for ages mankind has made materials with certain desirable properties by controlling the nanostructure of the material.  In this sense nanotechnology has been around for a few millennia.  What has changed dramatically in the last few decades is our ability to characterize what we make, which has greatly improved our synthesis techniques.  Microscopy has been an important component of this recent revolution in nanocharacterization.  This project is based on the simple idea of rastering a nano-sized sensor over the sample to measure different properties, such as magnetism and superconductivity.  The research team working on this involves young men and women, many of Hispanic background, from the High School to the Ph.D. level.\r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThis project emphasizes the development of novel scanning probe techniques that operate at low temperatures, with the goal of studying new materials.  Recent examples include the study of colossal magnetoresistive materials, manganites in particular, by tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and contact atomic force microscopy.  Another example is the study of multiferroic materials with Kelvin force microscopy and MFM.  The most recent technique is based on a microscopic Hall sensor, which has been used to study a dilute magnetic semiconductor (Ga0.94Mn0.06As).  These techniques will provide a better understanding at the nanoscale of the electronic, magnetic, and transport properties of new materials.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere are many examples where Science gives us beautiful results that can be appreciated even without an explanation, such as the inspiring images obtained by the Hubble telescope.  At the opposite end of the size scale we also find beauty in the nano world.  The PI and his team have developed microscopes that give us a glimpse of the intriguing patterns found in the electronic and magnetic structure of materials down to the atomic scale, especially at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields.  We show here only one small example among the many interesting results obtained during this project.\n\nThe figure shown here was obtained with a magnetic force microscope on the surface of a small crystal of UMn2Ge2.  The beautiful patterns of flowers, ribbons and bubbles represent how the magnetic structure in the material is organized in order to minimize the magnetic energy of the system.  While this is a new, exotic magnetic material, the patterns observed here are also seen in other strong magnets, such as Nd2Fe14B -- a material that is common in high quality headphones and speakers..  The understanding of magnetism down to the atomic scale is very important for our society because most of the information we have is stored on magnetic media.\n\nThe most important outcome of this project is the advanced training received by three PhD graduates (plus one who will graduate shortly after the end of this grant).  Of these, two were Hispanic women who received excellent offers for joining national research labs after receiving their doctorate degrees.  Seven undergraduates also participated in the project and experienced training they could not have in any courses.  A secondary outcome was the publication of our results in prestigious scientific journals and presentations at national meetings, as detailed in the full report.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alex L De Lozanne"
