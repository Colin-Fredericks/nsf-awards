 "awd_abstract_narration": "From Frames to Events: A Statistical Approach to Activity Analysis in Multi-Camera Systems\r\n\r\nVenkatesh Saligrama and Janusz Konrad, Boston University, MA 02215\r\n\r\nUnlike other sensors, cameras provide excellent resolution, long viewing range,\r\nwide field of view and low latency thus permitting pervasive, wide-area visual\r\nsurveillance. However, most network cameras deployed today are simple\r\ncapture/compression/transmission devices, at most supporting rudimentary motion\r\n\r\ndetection; all higher-level processing is highly centralized. This centralized\r\narchitecture stems from human-centric visual analytics as well as limited\r\nin-camera processing capacity, and is not scalable to large multi-camera\r\nsystems. With over 30 million surveillance cameras in use in the United States\r\ntoday, that produce 4 billion hours of video footage per week, monitoring by\r\nhuman operators is obviously not sustainable. An autonomous, distributed,\r\nbandwidth-efficient, real-time video analytics system is needed.\r\n\r\nThis project makes a step towards building such a system. At its core is a\r\nnovel statistical framework for activity discovery and analysis that departs\r\nfrom the centralized model and leverages processing power of camera nodes.\r\nWhile traditional activity analysis operates at object level, e.g., objects are\r\nidentified, tracked, and tested for abnormality, methods under development in\r\nthis project employ activity analysis at pixel level. If the abnormal activity\r\nis reliably identified, then object extraction and tracking focus on region of\r\ninterest and thus are relatively straightforward, on account of absence of\r\nclutter. In order to reliably identify pixel-level abnormalities, or more\r\ngenerally activities, a novel event-based video representation is used that\r\ndecomposes video into iid samples lending itself to the application of\r\nstatistical learning. In order to facilitate multi-camera collaboration,\r\ngeometric invariance of dynamic events is exploited thus bypassing the\r\ndifficult issues related to 3-D geometry dependent on viewing angles.\r\n",
