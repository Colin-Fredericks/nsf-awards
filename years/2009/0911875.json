 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is to develop extremely high thermal conductivity heat sinks that are thermal expansion matched to advanced semiconductors for high performance electronic and electro-optical systems. With low cost natural graphite platelet reinforcement, CuGrp composite heat sinks with thermal conductivities ranging from 750 to 900 W/mK will be achieved while controlling thermal expansion over the range of 7 to 4 ppm/K respectively. These properties are a factor of 2 to 2.5 times Cu and exceed any CTE matched thermal management material available. \r\n\r\nThis project will result in a family of high performance passive thermal management materials that will increase the performance of electronic and electro-optical systems without increasing complexity. These technologies will service an a $500mm market that is growing at a rate of 8.5%/year. Immediate applications will be heat spreaders for LED and laser diode manufacturers for advanced communication, industrial and municipal lighting and flat screen displays as well as heat spreaders for advanced radar MMIC and T/R modules. Because of the projected low cost, other expected applications include power control systems for advanced hybrid and electric powered vehicles as well high performance IGBT base plates.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).",
