 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Substrate Working Group is one of five Working Gropus driving the technical work to develop the architecture and design of a suite of experimental network infrastructure that is currently in its planning stages. The working groups hold three workshops each year that, on a continuing basis: 1) identify and resolve design issues, 2) identify areas of technical risk, 3) review documents prepared by the GENI Project Office, and 4) engage in outreach. \r\n\r\nBy having an open, transparent, well-managed design process, the community will have ample opportunities to comment and contribute to the design of a suite of experimental network infrastructure.  Engaging the community early in the design process will ensure that the infrastructure will have the functionality and capabilities required by the research community. Workshop topics will include: detailed open design issues and tradeoffs, risk assessment and mitigation, common vocabulary and models, design and integration activities, use cases, and the evaluation of software and services, for example.\r\n\r\nThe chairs will be responsible for workshop preparation, chairing workshops, results dissemination, and progress reporting. These funds will enable the chairs to recruit attendees, attend three workshops, and disseminate the results.",
