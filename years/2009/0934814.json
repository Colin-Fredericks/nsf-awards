 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Phase II Noyce project is supporting eighteen individuals seeking teacher certification in mathematics or science.  Six undergraduates are receiving annual scholarships of $10,000 for two years and twelve career changers are receiving one-year scholarships of $10,000.  The Noyce scholars teach high school mathematics or science for two years in a high needs school district for each year of scholarship received.  Phase II continues the integration of research and teaching that was established during Phase I.  Added Phase II activities include 1) a mentorship program; 2) summer professional development workshops; 3) a summer research institute; and 4) a summer mathematics and science academy.\r\n\r\nCurrently, 85 school districts recruit teachers graduating from this college.  While the Noyce scholars may complete their service requirement in any high needs school district, the college is working closely with such local high needs school districts as Wyandanch Union Free School District, Uniondale School District, Brentwood Union Free School District, and Central Islip School District.",
