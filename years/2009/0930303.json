 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is focused on the development of a new technology for reducing the human health risks associated with mercury over the life-cycle of fluorescent lamps. Fluorescent lamps can break and release their internal inventory of mercury, which is a known neurotoxicant, environmental pollutant, and developmental toxicant of special concern for children and women of child-bearing age. Aspen Sciences is teaming with Brown University and ARCH Venture Partners to develop nano-selenium-based products to react with and capture mercury vapor during fluorescent lamp shipping, use, collection, and recycling. The research focuses on: (i) cost-effective nano-selenium synthesis, (ii) design and testing of reactive barriers as box or bag safety liners, (iii) study of reaction rates and sorbent color change for mercury detection, and (iv) sorbent stability during storage use and disposal.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are to ensure consumer and worker safety in the large and rapidly growing market for linear and compact fluorescent lamps. Lamps broken at home or during shipping release elemental mercury vapor in the immediate vicinity of adults and children. Approximately 80% of inhaled mercury vapor is physiologically absorbed in the lung and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier to cause neurological disorders and developmental impairment. Aspen's new sorbent can capture mercury vapor at ultra-high capacity and reduce human exposure in the $7 billion annual worldwide fluorescent lamp market, as well as remove current psychological and safety barriers to the more widespread adoption of energy-saving fluorescent technologies.\r\n\r\n",
