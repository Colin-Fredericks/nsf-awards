This technology will be very beneficial for the development of high-efficiency boilers, heat exchangers and electronic cooling devices. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the enhancement to boilers, heat exchangers, and electronic cooling devices that serve various industries, such as, power/utility, oil and gas, chemical, food and beverage, and building and construction. Additional benefit from the this project will be its potential application in efficient heat transfer to increase energy output, reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases, consume less fossil fuels and reduce harmful pollution. \r\n\r\n",
