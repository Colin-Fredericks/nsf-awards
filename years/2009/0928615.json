 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe Department of Chemistry at Claflin University is proposing to acquire an Energy Dispersive Micro X-ray (EDX) Fluorescence Spectrometer for enhancing research and educational infrastructure for solid state chemistry, materials science and biology. As one of the oldest Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Claflin has been working on building competent science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs and providing an excellent teaching and research environment for minority students. The Department of Chemistry is ACS-certified and strives to build and maintain a vigorous undergraduate program by acquiring and incorporating modern infrastructure into its research and educational curriculum. The addition of the EDX spectrometer allows the department to target the instrumentation requirements for continued ACS-certification. \r\n\r\n\tThe requested instrument will be incorporated into existing experiments in general, inorganic, physical and analytical chemistry laboratories. Undergraduate students at all levels will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience on state-of-the-art techniques. \r\n\r\n\tThe Department of Chemistry is committed to establishing a strong research program in solid state chemistry, a field that is at the leading edge of current technological advances. The requested EDX is an essential addition to the physical characterization toolbox available for faculty and student research involving materials, chemical and biological sciences. \r\n\r\n",
