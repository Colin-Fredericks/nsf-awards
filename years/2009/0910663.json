 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanotechnologies promise new solutions for applications in biomedical, environmental, industrial, military and other fields. At the nano-scale, a nano-machine can be considered as the most basic functional unit, which is able to perform very simple tasks. Nanonetworks, i.e., the interconnection of nano-machines, will expand the capabilities of single nano-machines by providing them a way to cooperate and share information. Traditional communication technologies are not directly applicable to nanonetworks and need to undergo a profound revision in order to meet the requirements of this new environment. Instead of electromagnetic or acoustic waves, the use of molecules to encode and transmit the information represents a new communication paradigm, which demands novel solutions, including the characterization of molecular communication mechanisms, the definition of physical channel models or the development of architectures and networking protocols for nano-machines. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: With this planning effort for a larger NaNoNetworking (N3) project, the principal investigators (PIs) will undertake the first steps to address the above challenges toward the realization of this new communication paradigm. The research team will further develop their vision for a future nanonetwork paradigm and will determine concrete applications. The PIs will also incorporate new researchers with required areas expertise, of Experimental Molecular Biology and Theoretical Physics, into the project. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The envisioned N3 Project is expected to pave the way for research in nanonetworking and could have a significant impact on research in nanotechnologies and nanonetworks since the N3 Project would represent the entrance of the communications, computer science, and biology communities into this converging field. With this planning effort the researchers will take a first step toward the realization of the nanonetwork with initial research and the development of a large proposal on this topic.\r\n",
