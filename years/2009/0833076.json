 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Stevens Institute of Technology along with WEPAN and other partners will deliver an Extension Service project that will include training, materials, technical assistance, and mini-grants to improve instruction in engineering and faculty mentoring skills, using research-based strategies to enhance retention of undergraduate women of all races and ethnicities. The project will serve 30 engineering colleges over a five year period. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. Using a train-the-trainer model, the project brings together a team of nationally recognized, expert trainers who developed and tested the research-based strategies being used in this project, including: \r\n\r\n? Using relevant and engaging applications in engineering and STEM gateway courses \r\n? Using activities to improve student spatial visualization skills \r\n? Building faculty knowledge and skill to mentor students. \r\n\r\nExperts will train three-five person, university-based teams to serve as Extension Agents. Agents will train and work with Practitioners?faculty who teach 1st and 2nd year engineering and STEM Gateway Courses?to use new knowledge and practices. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal is to increase the capacity of engineering colleges to retain undergraduate women in engineering. Selected strategies and activities will be implemented in support of the overall goal. Desired project outcomes are: \r\n\r\n? All 30 participating universities will conduct training in the three research-based strategies. \r\n? All 30 participating universities will integrate relevant applications in their courses. \r\n? At least 95% of the participating universities will integrate spatial visualization skills into their curriculum. \r\n? More than 50% of the faculty in 1st and 2nd year engineering courses and STEM Gateway courses will participate in mentor training. \r\n? More than 50% of the faculty in 1st and 2nd year engineering courses and STEM Gateway courses will integrate relevant applications in their courses. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The project will directly impact up to 150 Agents at 30 US engineering schools. These Agents will then impact the behavior of engineering faculty at their institutions, improving students' instructional experience. The resources of the project including an on-line manual, archived webinars and tools developed under the Virtual Learning Community will be widely available on the project website and through links from engineering education and women in science websites. With these resources, interested faculty can change their own classes. Information about the project, its resources, strategies and effectiveness will be widely communicated using traditional methods but also using methods most likely to reach those interested young faculty including establishing groups on Facebook and posting on science and engineering education blogs.\r\n",

And what can engineering schools do to address this issue when time and money are limited? Engaging Students in Engineering (ENGAGE) was designed to increase the capacity of four-year engineering schools to retain 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> year undergraduate students, particularly women. To do this, ENGAGE facilitated the implementation of three pedagogical strategies that (1) research indicates improve the retention of undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented groups, and (2) are easy-to-implement cost- and time-efficient enhancements rather than large-scale changes to the curriculum. Since launch, ENGAGE has worked with over 70 engineering schools to implement the following evidence-based strategies:</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy 1: Improving students&rsquo; Spatial Visualization Skills (SVS)</strong></p>\n<p>Spatial Visualization Skills are the abilities to translate 2-D objects to 3-D and to mentally rotate 3-D objects. Research indicates that a basic level of proficiency with SVS is critical to persistence and success in engineering and that this skill can be improved with practice. ENGAGE resources include step-by-step guides and a tested training curriculum to help schools test student spatial visualization skills and provide training to those students who need it.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy 2: Using Everyday Examples in Engineering (E&sup3;s) to teach technical concepts</strong></p>\n<p>Using examples that are familiar and relevant to students&mdash;think soda cans and &shy;headphones instead of I-beams and boiler pipes&mdash;increases student engagement and retention and enhances the likelihood that they will be interested in and better retain the information they learn. ENGAGE provides lesson plans and demonstration videos across 13 STEM subjects &nbsp;and a &ldquo;Make Your Own&rdquo; toolkit for E<sup>3</sup>s that faculty can easily incorporate into any lecture or recitation.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy 3: Improving and increasing Faculty-Student Interaction (FSI)</strong></p>\n<p>Simple actions by faculty can have a cumulative effect on the retention and success of students enrolled in challenging programs such as engineering and directly impact students&rsquo; perceptions of their ability to succeed. The likelihood of positive faculty-student interactions can be enhanced by providing specific direction.&nbsp; ENGAGE provides Faculty-Student Interaction tips and techniques that help students and faculty engage positively with each other in ways that are simple and time-effective.</p>\n<p>ENGAGE&rsquo;s intellectual merit contributions are reflected in the approaches used to facilitate implementation of these strategies in the classroom across engineering schools. At the beginning of the project, ENGAGE worked closely with 30 partner schools to understand opportunities and barriers to implementation of the three strategies. A website (engageengineering.org) was launched and workshops, presentations, and webinars were developed, which proved critical in not only supporting implementation among ENGAGE partner schools but also in reaching the broader engineering community.</p>\n<p>For E<sup>3</sup>s and FSI strategies, ENGAGE found that barriers to implementation centered around faculty skepticism and concerns about time.&nbsp; The most effective path to implementation was through easily accessible, immediately available examples that require no or low investment of faculty time and resources. As this relates to E<sup>3</sup>s, faculty from partner schools were invited to create and submit their own peer-reviewed Everyday Examples. More than 100 E<sup>3</sup>s were developed and are immediately available for download and use. For SVS, ENGAGE found that barriers to implementation were around institutional administrative and technical challenges, so ENGAGE adjusted its approach to support the use of schools&rsquo; existing Learning Management Systems to deliver the pre- and post- spatial skills tests. These findings led to critical optimizations that informed ENGAGE&rsquo;s broad dissemination strategy throughout the remainder of the project.</p>\n<p>ENGAGE&rsquo;s efforts shifted entirely to dissemination activities during the last two years of the project. The website was redesigned to organize ENGAGE&rsquo;s strategy resources in a mobile-adaptive, user-friendly, easy-to-navigate interface. An optimized information architecture streamlined research background and faculty testimonials, reorganized ENGAGE resources to highlight the most popular, and provided easy access to immediately available E<sup>3</sup>s and FSI examples and a step-by-step guide for implementing SVS testing and training. The website redesign also ensures that it will exist as a low-maintenance sustainable hub for all ENGAGE implementation resources after the conclusion of the project.</p>\n<p>Following the redesign of the website, a blog was added to showcase existing ENGAGE resources in an immediate, easily digestible, and shareable format to encourage user-driven dissemination. The blog was launched in parallel with a &ldquo;social influencer&rdquo; strategy, in which respected professionals in STEM higher education with active social media followings were recruited to share blog content among their social networks. The blog and &ldquo;social influencer&rdquo; strategy encouraged dissemination by existing ENGAGE partners among their own personal and professional networks, effectively multiplying ENGAGE&rsquo;s reach.</p>\n<p>Since ENGAGE&rsquo;s launch in 2009, resources for implementing each strategy have been downloaded over 346,822 times and accessed by over 140,777 visitors on the engageengineering.org website, demonstrating wide reach across engineering schools beyond ENGAGE&rsquo;s partner schools, implying increasing implementation of ENGAGE strategies.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/16/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Susan&nbsp;S&nbsp;Metz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497643518824_ENGAGELOGO_NSF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497643518824_ENGAGELOGO_NSF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ENGAGE\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497643518824_ENGAGELOGO_NSF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ENGAGE\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ENGAGE: Engaging Students in Engineering</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stevens Institute of Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;S&nbsp;Metz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ENGAGE</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497634722453_fsithumb--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497634722453_fsithumb--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Faculty-Student Interaction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497634722453_fsithumb--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Faculty-Student Interaction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Faculty-Student Interaction</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeffrey Vock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;S&nbsp;Metz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Faculty-Student Interaction</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497634773286_svsthumb--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497634773286_svsthumb--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Spatial Visualization Skills\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497634773286_svsthumb--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Spatial Visualization Skills\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Spatial Visualization Skills</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeffrey Vock</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;S&nbsp;Metz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Spatial Visualization Skills</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497634653571_e3thumb--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497634653571_e3thumb--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Everyday Examples in Engineering\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0833076/0833076_10026482_1497634653571_e3thumb--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Everyday Examples in Engineering\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Everyday Examples in Engineering</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jeffrey Vock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;S&nbsp;Metz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Everyday Examples in Engineering</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
