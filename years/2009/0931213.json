The theory and application of mathematical models have proved useful for the purpose of providing a logical structure within which to synthesize knowledge, test assumptions, and make predictions about the dynamics of biological populations with regard to epidemiological problems. Models have provided the impetus and means for researchers to study increasingly complex and important questions in these disciplines. The main theme of this conference will be epidemiology and related topics, specifically, the dynamics of diseases to which biological species are susceptible, the establishment and spread of diseases within populations and their control and elimination. Mathematical models are built on trade-offs between biological accuracy and mathematical tractability. Of particular importance are the effects of modeling assumptions concerning spatial or temporal heterogeneities or concerning heterogeneities among the characteristics of individuals within the population. The conference theme will focus on the derivation and analysis of dynamic models appropriate for the study of epidemics and will address a wide variety of theoretical and applied problems and case studies that illustrate the connection of models with data, and the impact of the modeling results on the public health.\r\n\r\nThe conference will bring together expert researchers for the purpose of establishing a solid basis for contacts and interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers in mathematical biology at large and mathematical epidemiology in particular. Five distinguished researchers will each give a 50-minute plenary talk that will survey current directions and present frontiers of epidemic modeling. There will be three parallel sessions consisting of 30-minute talks given by invited speakers. The formal and informal discussions during the conference will result in the increase of collaboration among various groups and researchers. A panel discussion, moderated by the principal investigators, will discuss new directions and open problems in the field of Mathematical Biology, in particular, of Mathematical Epidemiology.  The panel will further discuss strategies to promote the integration of mathematics and biology curricula as promoted by NSF-UBM programs across the country. For the graduate and undergraduate students, this will be a great opportunity to meet leading authorities in the field and discuss with them, formally and informally, topics and questions in which they are interested.\r\n",
