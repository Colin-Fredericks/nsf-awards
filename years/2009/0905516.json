 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to make dynamic exhibits in informal learning environments (ILEs), such as zoos, science centers, and aquaria, accessible and engaging for visitors with vision impairments by providing real-time audio interpretations. Our efforts will also enhance the exhibit experience for all visitors, regardless of visual ability. We focus on the aquarium domain, since virtually every exhibit is dynamic, and the aquatic nature of the facility provides unique and interesting challenges to bio-tracking. The principles and techniques we develop will be immediately applicable to zoos, museums, and other ILEs with dynamic exhibits, potentially leading to a dramatic increase in the educational and entertainment opportunities for people with vision impairments. The project will employ focus groups and innovative simulations to test prototype exhibits during the development stages. The tracking and auditory displays will then be evaluated through laboratory studies and field testing in exhibits in a large public aquarium.\r\n \r\nThe ability to design exhibits and interpretation materials that are accessible to visitors with vision impairments is a growing concern. In addition to persons with specific vision impairments, the underserved population includes their family members, as well as the millions of older adults who have some vision loss that impacts their ability to read signage, see artifacts, and follow the activity in a dynamic exhibit. The results of our project will also enhance the experience for those with full vision, but for whom mobility, height, or other problems make it hard to see traditional signage. Indeed, all visitors will benefit from an audio enhancement that allows them to learn about the exhibit, while keeping their visual attention on the exhibit itself.\r\n",
