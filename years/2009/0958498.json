 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative workshop is being organized by Dr. Azer Bestavros, Boston University, and Dr. Magdy Nagi, Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt, in order to identify opportunities for US-Middle East cooperation on networking infrastructures, technologies, and applications. The proposed workshop will bring together leading US and Middle East networking researchers to discuss areas of mutual interest and to develop a vision for future collaborative research.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The following are three examples of broad thematic topics for the workshop:\r\n\r\nFuture Networking Research Infrastructures: Emerging networking architectures are moving away from the model/view of a federated set of \"autonomous systems\" to a model in which regional, multinational infrastructures are shared in support of virtualized applications. The global nature of this shared infrastructure poses important research and development challenges that must be addressed, including appropriate mechanisms for pooling resources and for designing regional testbeds and experimental infrastructures related to future generation networks.\r\n\r\nNetworking Technologies for Emerging Wireless and Ad-Hoc Applications: The wide penetration of smart devices in the Middle East region presents opportunities for the development of novel services and applications.  Such services and applications may have significant economic impacts, as well as impacts on quality of life and emergency response. \r\n\r\nNetworking Support for Scalable and Secure Distributed Information Systems: Increasingly, networking researchers have been concerned with problems that go beyond traditional communication needs (e.g., transport and routing) to include network measurement and characterization, network security and privacy, information discovery, management, and mining in emerging social networks, among others. Localization (including multi-lingual and transliteration issues) will be addressed.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The workshop will be organized as a peer-to-peer meeting of researchers from the US and the Middle East, with an emphasis on activities designed to facilitate tangible outcomes, including expanding existing collaborations, stimulating new research partnerships, and identifying priority areas for future research. Junior scientists from the US and from the region will participate in the workshop.  \r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Division of Computer and Network Systems and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
