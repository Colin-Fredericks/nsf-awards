 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\nProfessors James D. Batteas of Texas A&M and Charles M. Drain of Hunter College of CUNY are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to systematically design and synthesize a series of porphyrin and alkyl based molecular assemblies and orient them on metal surfaces. Molecular connectivity and local environment will be varied in order to rationally manipulate the electron transport properties of the molecules. The aim is to develop a global view of interfacial electron transport between optoelectronic molecules and substrates. The work encompasses molecular design, synthesis, and characterization by an array of spectroscopic techniques and theoretical methods. The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of charge transfer and conductance in these assemblies in order to facilitate the development of nanoscale electronics.  Students participating in this collaborative project will gain broad education and training in multidisciplinary research areas critical to the continued development of molecular electronics. The results of the proposed research will be incorporated in undergraduate courses, and in demonstrations at K-12 schools.",
