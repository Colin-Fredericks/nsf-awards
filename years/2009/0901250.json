 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Relativity has very important long term goals among which\r\nthe weak and strong cosmic censorship, final state and stability of Kerr\r\nconjectures are the most outstanding. To complete such goals one\r\nneeds to solve many fundamental difficulties among which the PI proposes\r\nto concentrate on the problems of uniqueness and stability of the Kerr\r\nfamily as well as the bounded curvature conjecture. The PI intends to\r\ncontinue his work with A. Ionescu, and more recently S. Alexakis, to\r\nremove the restrictive real analyticity assumptions of the well known\r\nresults of S. Hawking and Carter-Robinson. The PI also plans to continue\r\nto work with I. Rodnianski and J. Szeftel and settle the important\r\nbounded curvature conjecture. Together with I. Rodnianski they plan\r\nto adapt the recent work of Christodoulou, based on what he calls\r\nthe short pulse method, with which he was able to derive the first\r\nresult on the formation of trapped surfaces for solutions of the Einstein\r\nvacuum equations. The PI and his collaborator believe that the new method can be signifficantly improved and applied to various situations.\r\n\r\nIf successful the proposal will give a better understanding of some\r\nof the main theoretical open problems of General Relativity. The long\r\nterm hope is that some of the insight gained in the process will \r\ninfluence related areas such Theoretical Physics and Numerical Relativity.\r\nOf paramount interest to the gravitational wave experiments is to de-\r\nsign numerical algorithms which can simulate, realistically, black hole\r\ninteractions. The PI also hopes that the interplay between geometric and an-\r\nalytic methods, which are being developed, will influence other areas of\r\nnonlinear PDE, Differential Geometry and Analysis. The PI plans to attract\r\nand train a larger number of PhD students and postdocs, than he has\r\ndone so far, in General Relativity. The PI believes that the subject is going\r\nnow through an exciting period when important problems are solved and many new avenues of research are being open.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe    main research theme    pursued by the PI\n can be   summarized   as an  attempt   to show using mathematical  tools that   ``black  holes are real''.\n Indeed  the  reality of these physical object  which,  by  definition, are  beyond   direct observation can be  naturally tied  to    the following questions:  \n\n1.)   Are  black holes     necessarily     Kerr  solutions,   that  is\n   the special    class of   stationary solutions of the Einstein field  equations  characterized   by mass and angular momentum ? \n\n  2.)   Are   these  special solutions stable under small   perturbations ?    A  negative answer to this \n      fundamental  question will imply     that   the Kerr black holes    have  no    physical  reality, i.e.  they  are simply mathematical   artifacts\n\n3.)   Can these  black     holes form   dynamically through a  collapse mechanism?     Can  collapse   happen    due to pure radiation ?  What is the mechanism of collapse?\n\n \n\nThe PI has        given preliminary, positive results  (i.e. attesting  to the physical  reality  of black holes) for all these questions.    For example   in collaboration with S. Alexakis and A. Ionescu   the PI has shown that   any stationary black hole  which is sufficiently cloe to  a  Kerr solution must itself be a Kerr solution. This solves  1.)  in   the particular case of interst to the fundamental question of stability  described  in 2.).   \n\n       A particularly remarkable result  of  the  the PI,  in collaboration  with   J. Luk and I. Rodnianski, is  the discovery        that black holes  can form  through a fully  un-isotropic         mechanism.  More precisely  they have shown   that black\n          holes can form from strong,  regular, initial conditions  which  are fully concentrated in one direction.    This    fully           non-intuitive  result,  proved by rigorous  mathematical  tools  is  now  subject to  numerical  experiments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sergiu Klainerman"
