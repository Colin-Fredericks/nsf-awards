 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turbulence, \"the last unsolved problem in classical physics\" (Feynman), has been with us for over 100 years since Reynolds identified the laminar-turbulence transition in 1883. The correct description of fluid turbulence will impact such diverse fields as atmospheric pollution dispersion, weather, commercial chemical processes and aircraft design. Recent advances on information technology, turbulence modeling and experimental techniques have shown a great promise to overcome the fundamental difficulty in studying fluid turbulence.  In addition, modern database technology has made exploration of Terabyte datasets possible, which becomes a key component in understanding fluid turbulence. \r\n\r\nThe proposed International Symposium on Fluid Turbulence will be held at Peking University, Beijing, People?s Republic of China on Sept. 21-25, 2009. This Symposium aims to provide a forum to bring together scientists from all over the world to present their latest research results on fluid turbulence and to enhance academic exchanges. The participants will discuss and share developments and innovations in theoretical, numerical and experimental studies of fluid turbulence, covering all of its aspects. The focus will be given to physical and mathematical aspects of fluid turbulence and their connections to engineering modeling and applications. \r\n\r\nImproved understanding of fluid turbulence will benefit diverse areas of science and technology, from engineering energy-efficient machinery, to predicting transport of pollutants in the atmosphere, and to long-term forecasting of Earth's climate. The purpose of this Symposium is to bring together the world leading experimental, theoretical and numerical experts with a key interest in recent advances in fluid turbulence, in particular Lagrangian and Eulerian Turbulence, non-ideal flows, statistical tools, sub-grid modelisation and data analysis.  This would help stimulate an intense and fruitful interaction between these communities, with the idea of encouraging collaborations. China is among the world fastest economical growth regions. It is expected that this Symposium will provide a direct platform for US participants to exchange ideas on fluid turbulence with scientists from over the world and to foster collaborations with Chinese scholars. This Symposium will also serve as a window to allow Chinese graduate students to know US turbulence research better. The requested financial support is intended to support 28 US invited speakers attending this Symposium.",
