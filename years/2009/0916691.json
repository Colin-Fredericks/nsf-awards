 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data management systems are undergoing a sea change. Specialized\r\nengines with specialized physical storage structures are emerging to\r\naddress the extreme data volume and performance requirements of modern\r\napplications. At the same time, the complexity of these systems, the\r\napplications in which they are used and the platforms on which they\r\nare built is increasing. Thus, there is a growing need for automatic\r\ndatabase design for these emerging database systems. Unfortunately,\r\nprevious work in automatic design cannot be used directly. While the\r\nconceptual framework of previous research is useful, the specifics\r\nmust be reworked in order to adequately take advantage of the\r\nopportunities and address the challenges that these new structures\r\npresent. Furthermore, most design tools only create complete designs.\r\nThere is also a need for automatic designers that can produce a new\r\ndesign that is sensitive to the cost of migrating an old design to a\r\nnew one. Such an incremental designer would often generate a\r\nsub-optimal design if that design will produce 80% of the benefit with\r\n20% of the work.\r\n\r\nThe PIs propose to investigate this incremental automatic design\r\nparadigm for newly emerging database systems. Specifically, the\r\nproject addresses three data management platforms: column stores for\r\nOLAP, main memory, cluster-based systems for OLTP, and an extension to\r\nrow stores for exploiting correlations in data attributes.\r\n\r\nThe PIs expect to extend the work on current design tools by\r\ndemonstrating workable incremental designers as described above. There\r\nis a strong need for such tools, and if this research is successful,\r\nit should enable successful deployment of many new-style data\r\nmanagers. Moreover, incremental design ideas based on sound\r\ncost-benefit analysis are applicable to other data-intensive computing\r\nenvironments and constitute an important direction towards truly\r\nautonomic computing.
