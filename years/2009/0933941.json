 "awd_abstract_narration": "Relaxations and diffusion play important roles in many branches of science, technology and engineering. Relaxation phenomena occur in physics, biophysics, chemistry, materials science, metallurgy, rheology, glass sciences, polymer (biopolymer) physics and engineering, fiber optics, opto-electronics and electronics. It is the primary concern in basic physics as well as in very practical applications. The 6th International Discussion Meeting on Relaxations in Complex Systems (IDMRCS) is the premier international meeting dealing with the above subjects. The funding provided in this grant by NSF will support U.S. Ph.D. students, post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty to attend the meeting and to participate through oral and poster presentations. The IDMRCS forum provides these young researchers with the opportunity to interact with internationally known researchers, which is important for career development. In addition, benefits to all supported participants can be expected from cross-field fertilisation among the multiple disciplines represented at the 6th IDMRCS.",
