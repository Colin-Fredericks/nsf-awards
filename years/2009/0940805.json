 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\" \r\n\r\nGENI is a unique virtual laboratory for at-scale network experimentation on future internets. Dynamic and adaptive, GENI opens up new opportunities for significant socio-economic impact. GENI will support at-scale experimentation on a suite of shared, heterogeneous, highly instrumented infrastructure; enable deep programmability throughout the network, promoting innovations in network science, security, technologies, services, and applications; and provide collaborative and exploratory environments for academia, industry and the public to catalyze groundbreaking discoveries and innovation. \r\n\r\nSpiral development is the core strategy for providing a concrete focal point for community debate and engagement moving forward. GENI Spiral 1 launched in October 2008 and is making rapid progress to create a set of end-to-end GENI prototypes by October 2009 with broad academic and industrial participation and strong competition in the design and implementation of GENI's control framework. Based on lessons learned in Spiral 1, the GPO issued a 2nd solicitation in 2008 to fill critical gaps in GENI's architecture, especially security requirements and architecture, experiment workflow tools and user interfaces, and prototypes for instrumentation and measurement. This award funds 33 new projects, which build upon the achievements of Spiral 1 and move the project into Spiral 2 with federation and shakedown experiments that will prove critical in guiding progress in GENI system design.\t\t \t \t \t \t \r\n",
