 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13)\r\n\r\nThe goal of this and a previously funded project at the University of Alaska-Anchorage (UA-A) and Indiana University (IU) is to replace the standard introductory-level astronomy curriculum with one that is research-based.  Research-based science educational (RBSE) curricular materials have three goals: 1) to teach that science is a process of discovery, not just a body of knowledge, 2) to increase positive attitudes towards science and STEM careers, by giving students an opportunity to do authentic research, and 3) to develop important skills such as critical thinking, teamwork and goal-driven work skills that are important in any career path.  RBSE naturally integrates research and education as \"authentic\" research data becomes the driving force behind instruction.  In this particular project, students are analyzing data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the National Virtual Observatory, as well as data that faculty participating in the project might have developed from their own research endeavors.   After developing materials and piloting the program at UA-A and IU over the past three years, the project enables the implementation and effectiveness assessment of RBSE curricula at four additional academic institutions. Collectively this represents a widely-divergent student population and widely-varying classroom environments.  In addition to UA-A and IU, institutions participating in the current study include: University of Washington, Chicago State University, Pima Community College, and Truckee Meadows Community college.",
