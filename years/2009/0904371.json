 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work has revealed how important it is to examine the\r\nproperties of programs after they have been translated to machine\r\ncode.  For instance, many security exploits depend on\r\nplatform-specific features that are not visible at the source-code\r\nlevel, such as memory-layout details (e.g., the offsets of variables\r\nin activation records and padding between fields of a structure).  The\r\nexpected contributions of the project include (i) a\r\nlanguage-independent tool generator that, from a formal specification\r\nof a given instruction set's syntax and semantics, generates\r\nimplementations of dynamic-analysis, static-analysis, and\r\nsymbolic-evaluation components tailored to that instruction set, and\r\n(ii) a variety of prototype language-specific applications (i.e.,\r\nspecific machine-code-analysis tools), including\r\n\r\n o A tool to automate the detection of bugs and security\r\n   vulnerabilities in machine code. The aim is to identify definite\r\n   bugs and vulnerabilities, and information about what is required to\r\n   trigger them.\r\n o A tool to check sequencing properties on machine code.\r\n o A tool that can aid in detecting interoperability problems among\r\n   components by inferring input/output and network-communication\r\n   formats, and by summarizing the behavior of a component's client.\r\n\r\nThe results will help programmers create correct, reliable, and secure\r\nsoftware systems by providing them with new kinds of tools to (a) verify\r\nproperties of a program?s behavior, and (b) find potential bugs and\r\nsecurity vulnerabilities.",
