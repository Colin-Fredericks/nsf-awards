Huband\r\n\r\n\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe U.S. economy is facing enormous challenges, creating jobs that will produce significant technological and scientific innovation and create new opportunities for business growth is of utmost importance for future economic recovery. Given the challenges that the country faces today, there is an urgent need to transform the economy with science and technology.  Research challenges include energy independence, climate control and the development of credible economic models for a successful and sustained recovery of our economy.  It is very important to have scientists and engineering looking for the next great discovery, creating jobs in cutting-edge technologies and making informed investments that will help industries succeed in a global economy.  Of primary importance is the development of industrial R&D opportunities for the next generation of technology leaders in an environment that will stimulate innovation and invention.\r\n\r\nThe American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) proposes to establish an Industrial Postdoctoral Research Program that will provide forty recent PhD's the opportunity to conduct research in an industrial setting.  This pilot program would be a partnership between the federal government and various industrial sponsors.  Companies that have expressed a strong endorsement and support for this activity include the following: Agilent, Autodesk, Boeing, The Dow Chemical Company, Faraday Technology, Hewlett Packard Laboratories, IBM Research, Intel Corporation, MathWorks, Northrop Grumman, and SAP Lab.  \r\n\r\nThe Industrial Research Opportunities Program will aim to encourage the involvement of creative and highly trained engineers in areas of great interest and relevance to the nation as we face current economic challenges. With the U.S. leadership focusing more on the potential contributions of academic research and development efforts to enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. industries, this program will provide a mechanism to facilitate the technology transfer of academic research to the corporate sector.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. economy is facing great challenges and stimulating business growth and creating jobs is integral to aiding economic recovery.  The U.S. must create jobs in cutting edge technologies and make key investments to respond to the research challenges of today.  Training a new generation of technology leaders is integral to increasing the U.S. competitiveness in the global economy.  Therefore, it is critical to provide promising scientists and engineers with appropriate research settings, and to support and motivate their pursuit of the next great discoveries.  ASEE's Industrial Research Opportunities Program will contribute to technological and scientific innovation and help ensure industry success in the global economy.",
