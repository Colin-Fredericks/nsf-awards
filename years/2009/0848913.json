 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will further validate a groundbreaking wireless semiconductor platform that enables disposable, body-worn, physiological monitoring wireless sensors (wireless disposables) for a wide range of applications in healthcare and other industries. The company's chips are combined with today's body sensors such as electrocardiogram (ECG), Saturation of Peripheral Oxygen (SpO2), and blood pressure, to produce wireless disposables for continuous monitoring. For mass deployment, wireless disposables must displace today's wired sensors, therefore must have equally low cost, similar reliability, and days of operating life for a single use. Conventional radios are too unreliable, too power hungry and cause high interference to meet this challenge. The company is creating a single chip solution by combining radio with sensor functions providing a gain of 50X over conventional radio based solutions in terms of low power, low cost and wire-like reliability. \r\n\r\n\r\nEliminating the wires connecting a person's body to a patient monitor long held as impossible to replace could be possible with the proposed solution. Healthcare markets, the initial focus of the company (dominated by hospital use), represent more than a $2B market in disposables. The wireless disposables will have a broad global impact by contributing to cost effective, high quality care in hospitals and other care settings. In hospitals, wireless disposables can eliminate reusable monitoring wires, products which have been demonstrated to carry drug resistant pathogens in up to 75% of cases. Wireless disposables are also aligned with a future vision of highly automated institutions that support a more natural workflow. Outside the hospital, wireless disposables allow remote and mobile monitoring of people with chronic diseases, enabling early interventions, an important goal in maintaining health and lowering costs. Wireless disposables will help solve the global healthcare crisis, with US costs over $1.5 trillion and rising rapidly as 78 million baby boomers near retirement.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith the support of National Science Foundation, HMicro has developed breakthrough silicon based technology to enable fully disposable wireless patches for various types of vital sign monitoring applications.  These patches, which have not been possible to date due to a lack of needed silicon platform, will be a catalyst for the widespread use of wireless healthcare.  HMicro's vision is shown in Fig 1 - Market Inflection.  HMicro technology will provide significant help for solving looming healthcare crisis that is facing our nation and the world.\n\nHMicro has invented breakthrough silicon and sensor integration technologies to condense conventional complex wire based physiological sensor systems to simple wireless patches which are simple and easy to use with the complex technology behind the curtains.  One of the examples is shown in Fig 2 - HMicro's Disposable Patch Products.  An example of ECG monitoring patch is shown.\n\nHMicro pursued a unique goal, not pursued by others, of removing the wires in currently practiced clinical procedures with the wireless equivalents - while using current legacy \"wired\" equipment.  It required development of complex but simple to use technology.  It resulted in wireless patches and wireless adapters for legacy equipment as shown in Fig 3 - HMicro Silicon Embeds Breakthrough IP.\n\nAfter various considerations, HMicro invented a breakthrough radio architecture to meet the sensitive needs of wireless healthcare, unmet to date.  HMicro defined a hybrid radio that switches between multiple radios to maintain a highly reliable wireless connection for sensitive healthcare applications.  The key attributes of HMicro technology are shown in Fig 4 - Market Needs Drove HMicro IP.\n\nIn summary, HMicro has created industry's first platform to enable fully disposable wireless monitoring patches that can compete with the conventional wired clinical sensors in high volume clinical applications to reach the vast populations.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Surendar Magar"
