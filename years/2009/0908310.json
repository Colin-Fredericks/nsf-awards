 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding earthquake physics is a critical step on the road to forecasting the short-term behavior of faults with obvious consequences for hazard mitigation. This is a project whose goal is to examine the dynamics associated with earthquake rupture. The studies to be carried out will provide much more comprehensive constraints on the way that a major fault zone behaves. Specifically, the project will combine detailed imaging of the San Jacinto Fault (SJF) in Southern California using an array to characterize the fault zone in the subsurface. It will couple this with surface outcrop and mapping of the fault zone, paleoseismic analysis, GPS analysis of crustal deformation, and theoretical work on seismic propagation to understand how factors such as fault damage, juxtaposition of different rock types, and segmentation affect the behavior of the fault zone. The Principal Investigators bring together current ideas about the rupture process and outline an approach that may be able to provide a quantitative understanding of the evolution of fault zone structures and related deformation phenomena (seismicity, strain fields) in actively deforming regions. This approach requires a framework that accounts for faults with evolving geometrical and material properties, as well as time-dependent interactions between the seismogenic zone and underlying viscoelastic substrate.",

Specifically, our research activities in the past 5 years mainly focus on the following three areas: systematic search for deep tectonic tremor along the SJF and elsewhere in Southern California, detecting missing microearthquakes following recent moderate/large earthquakes in southern California and Mexico, and high-resolution imaging of fault zone structures along the SJF.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unlike regular earthquakes that occurred in the upper crust and have clear P and S arrivals, deep tectonic tremor occurred in the lower crust and have very long durations and no clear phase arrivals. Tremor has been observed along major subduction zones, as well major strike-slip faults around the world. Tremor is very stress sensitive, and small perturbations (on the order of kilopascals, similar to those from solid earth tides) could trigger tremor activities. Seismologists believe that tremor is likely driven by some kind of slow fault movement at larger depth where the rocks behave semi-brittle and semi-ductile. However, tremor did not occur anywhere along major plate boundaries, and it is still not clear what controls their occurrence and behaviors. In the first study (Chao et al., 2012, 2013; Yang et al., 2013), we systematically examined tremor along the SJF that are triggered by surface waves of large distant earthquakes around the world, and compared it with other regions in Central and Northern California (Figure 2). We found that tremor on the SJF was much less frequently triggered by distant earthquakes, despite the facts the triggering stresses are similar. While it is still not clear what are the primary reasons for such difference, this observation is consistent with the fact that regular tremor activities on the SJF are also infrequent.
