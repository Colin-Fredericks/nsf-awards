The lead of the proposed Center will be University of North Texas (UNT)) with site location at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD).  Net-centricity is the key to enabling increased productivity, performance, agility, and dependability in several areas that can have significant positive impact on modern society.  The net-centric paradigm enables a rich pervasive computing environment, and enables applications to leverage a variety of relevant information, knowledge, services, and other capabilities in real-time to achieve breakthrough enhancements.  The proposed Center will develop capabilities to enable rapid high-assurance integrated modeling, analysis, design, implementation, verification and validation, deployment, and evolution of critical net-centric systems. The formation of the proposed Center will significantly enhance the existing research collaboration and greatly leverage the research capabilities of the participating institutions and industrial partners.   \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center will encourage collaboration, and the research will expose students and faculty to state-of-the-art research projects of value to the industry.  Graduate and undergraduate students at the participating universities and engineers from the various industrial members will benefit from the I/UCRC infrastructure and industry-driven net-centric research and development projects.  By joining the diverse capabilities and expertise of the participating institutions and the real world experiences of innovative high tech companies, the proposed Center will revolutionize our national research competence.  As a leading technology innovator and a Center for technology commercialization, it will contribute to the economic growth of the nation.",
