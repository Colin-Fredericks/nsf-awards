The goal of this program is to equip physical smart environment testbeds, and disseminate the data and software tools that are collected using the testbeds to the computer science community.  Specifically, we will create one long-term and four short-term smart environment smart environment testbeds.  The testbeds will facilitate research and education projects in modeling and simulation, machine learning of resident behaviors, middleware design, health monitoring, energy conservation, and sensor network design.  Performing data collection and research in the testbeds will also rely upon the design of a number of software tools.  We will make all data, software tools, and related educational materials available online as part of our CASAS repository. The infrastructure represents a part of the CASAS smart environment project.  The infrastructure will enable a number of research advances at Washington State University and will facilitate advances in smart environments research around the world.  Disseminating the data will also enable world-wide collaboration in related areas of research.",
