 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Math Scholars project at the University of Colorado Denver  (UCD) aims to recruit mathematics students with academic talent and financial need as secondary math teachers and to prepare them in an exemplary manner to pursue a teaching career in a high needs school district. Over the course of five years, the project is awarding 47 scholarships in the amount of $12,000/year leading to 23 new mathematics teachers. The Noyce Scholars are eligible to receive scholarships for two years.  The program involves recruitment activities, newly developed coursework, and activities aimed to increase both the number of mathematics majors who pursue secondary teaching and the quality of their preparation. The Noyce Mentor facilitates many of these activities, serving as a consistent mentor to potential and actual Noyce Scholars from their freshman year of college through their induction year of teaching, and helping the program's leadership build a vital Noyce Scholarship learning community at UCD.  To implement the program, UCD is collaborating with Aurora Public Schools (APS), which serve as the site for many field and informal learning experiences available to potential applicants and the Noyce Scholars. Aurora Public Schools participate in the selection of the Noyce Scholars and actively recruit Noyce Scholars for potential employment in secondary mathematics positions.   The Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences is collaborating in the redesign of the undergraduate secondary math teacher component of this program with the Noyce Scholarship Program leading the cutting edge of this redesign.",
