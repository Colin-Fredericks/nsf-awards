The probe is 1986 vintage and needs several updated components, both hardware and software. Requested are a new WDS automation system including a Windows-based acquisition and analysis computer, new software to control the probe and integrate EDS and WDS data, a new EDS detector and related acquisition system, and a new cathodoluminescence detector. The University will contribute $50K in matching funds. The upgraded EMP facility will allow the PIs to continue multidisciplinary research projects encompassing geologic, public health, engineering and materials research. The PI studies igneous processes aiming to understand the physical and chemical processes of subduction-related magmas and the conditions leading to their formation. Areas of interest are the Aluetians and Kamchatka. Studies are conducted by measuring whole-rock geochemistry, Pb, Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopic ration, and phenocryst and glass inclusion EMP analysis. Co-PI Bizimis focuses on upper mantle processes using detailed mantel xenolith geochemistry. Planned EMP use involves detailed observations of mineral rim reactions, diffusion profiles, minor matrix phases and student training. Co-PI Barbeau studies sedimentation and tectonics. Foci include determining mineral elemental compositions including CL analysis, resolving sediment provenance, and contraining plate tectonic and kinematic reconstructions. Co-PI Hintz will use the EMP to better understand elemental abundances in foraminifera calcite and aragonite tests. These abundances will be used as proxies for existing environmental conditions in the paleorecord. Co-PI Zhao studies mantle processes and nuclear waste management. The EMP will be critical in determining mantle-related processes, composition and evolution. Additionally, the EMP facility will support materials research. The EMP is incorporated into undergraduate and graduate-level courses in mineralogy and igneous and metamorphic petrology. Professors from other departments (Biology) also teach EMP methods. The current probe supports NSF-sponsored research which produces peer-reviewed publications. \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
