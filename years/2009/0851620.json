 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site is in the area of Polymer Science and Engineering and will run for 10 weeks in summer during 2009 to 2011 at Case Western Reserve University. Ten undergraduate students will be recruited nationally each year.  These REU students will join active research groups engaged in polymer synthesis, studies of structure and properties, novel processing methodologies and fundamental simulations and contribute to the research.  The goal of the program is to prepare the students with a strong background in polymer research, supplemented by lectures on basics of polymers, and exposure to key questions in research ethics and entrepreneurship.  The students will present the results of their research to peers and also at the Northeast Ohio Undergraduate Polymer Research Conference.  Students will have the opportunity to gain insights into research careers and graduate school.\r\n\r\nThis site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. Within NSF, this award is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division of Engineering Education Centers in the Engineering Directorate.\r\n\r\n",
