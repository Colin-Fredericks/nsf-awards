 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), in collaboration with Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP)supports a research program in tropical biology designed to address the specific cultural and social background of Native American and Pacific Islander undergraduate students, two groups that are severely underrepresented in the environmental and biological sciences. This program is a continuation and extension of a successful program funded by LSAMP. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the 2010-2012 Native American and Pacific Islander program is to provide an intensive field research experience for Native American and Pacific Islander undergraduate students. The program is structured around an eight week timeframe during which the participants will conduct research at OTS? Las Cruces Biological Station, among other sites, and visit local indigenous communities. The focus of the program is the development of the students? interest in biology and their capacity to conduct field research.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the program lies in engaging Native American and Pacific Islander students in pure and applied biological research, while introducing them to the biodiversity, cultural diversity and community-based conservation issues of the tropics. Under the guidance of the program staff and faculty research mentors, the students will complete high quality research projects designed to sharpen their technical skills and enrich their professional development. In addition, by providing a broad range of scientific perspectives and research experiences, the students will gain a sense of career awareness to clarify and direct their future academic life.\r\n\r\nThe NAPIRE program is designed to impact the academic and professional development of Native American and Pacific Islander students by providing a broad range of scientific and research skills to improve their academic competitiveness at the undergraduate and graduate levels and to encourage them to pursue careers in the environmental and biological sciences.",

These programs encourage participation in science careers by minority students who might not otherwise have considered the possibility.  The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) used its 50 years of experience in teaching tropical ecology and research to college students to design a specific research training program for Native Americans and Pacific Islanders, the most underrepresented minority in science.  This program has been ongoing successfully for the past eight years.\n\nWith supplemental funding from LSAMP OTS also undertook a comprehensive assessment of its undergraduate and graduate education program, specifically to determine the involvement and profile of students in its courses from groups under-represented in the sciences.  The study indicated OTS was effective in reaching strong numbers of minority students in its semester-long and summer courses.\n\nAn extension of one-year was requested to survey the OTS graduate student community who have been participating in field-based courses offered by the organization for fifty years.  Of the 2,927 graduate alumni surveyed, 429 responded (14%).  Of the respondents, 71% were caucasian and 20% were hispanic; 54% were males and 45% werer females; 74% had completed their Ph.D. degree.  One important realization was that OT had incomplete or inadequate tracking methods for ethnicity in the early years of maintaining data on its graduate alumni.  More recently, the concerted effort to recruit students from underrepresented groups at the undergraduate level has not occurred in the graduate program.  In point of fact, a significant number of hispanic students participating in OTS' graduate courses from U.S. schools are, in fact, international students from Latin America.  Further work must be done to move underrepresented students in the sciences in the U.S. identified at the undergaduate level to graduate programs.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth Losos"
