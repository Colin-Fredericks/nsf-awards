 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the sponsorship of NSF, DHS, and the European Commission FP7 project, two workshops were held, in  2006 and 2007, to foster collaboration among U.S., EC, South Korean, Australian, and Japanese researchers involved in computer security and privacy.  This award funds the third workshop in this series; it is expected that the workshops will continue to be held.  \r\n\r\nThe first workshops were concerned with security for critical infrastructures. This third workshop has as its focus security and privacy for an evolving Internet, with the goal of exposing, among other things, the tradeoffs between these two topics.  \r\n\r\nAn outcome of the workshop series continues to be fostering working relationships among PIs supported by the EC and U.S. funding agencies, where related projects are augmented with travel supplements.  \r\n\r\n",
