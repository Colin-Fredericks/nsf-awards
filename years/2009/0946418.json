 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing wireless nanodevices and nanosystems are of critical importance for sensing, medical science, defense technology and even personal electronics. It is highly desired for wireless devices and even required for implanted biomedical devices to be self-powered without using battery. It is essential to explore innovative nanotechnologies for converting mechanical energy (such as body movement, muscle stretching) and vibration energy into electric energy that will be used to power nanodevices without using battery. This is a key step towards self-powered nanosystems. An innovative approach is proposed for converting nano-scale mechanical energy into electric energy by piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowire  arrays, and the core of the research will focus on raising the output voltage and the manufacturing of the nanogenerators. The technology makes it possible to harvest energy supplied by mechanical movement/vibration, heart beating, food steps, noises, light wind. This proposal is to develop this invention into a manufacturable technology for practical applications.\r\nThe proposed research will greatly impact the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students. The research will provide an excellent opportunity for us to recruit undergraduate students from under represented groups to participate in a project at the frontier of nanoscience and highly-relevant to the need of the society. The research program and results will also be used to help K-12 school teachers and students through several outreach programs organized by the two participating institutes. It also gives us the support to fully involve undergraduate students in our on-going research.",
