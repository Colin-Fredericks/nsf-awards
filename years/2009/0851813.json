A diverse research program in low-energy nuclear physics is conducted at TUNL by researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina State University, and Duke University where the laboratory is located. This REU summer program provides undergraduate students with a realistic and active research experience through the completion of a self-contained 10-week project. The students collaborate with faculty, postdoctoral and pre-doctoral research staff from the three major research institutions, and are exposed to the graduate programs at these institutions. Through active research, seminars, lab tours, and discussion groups, the students are exposed to various aspects of nuclear physics research and its impact on other areas of research. The student acceptance process mainly targets students from small colleges and universities across the country who have limited opportunities to be involved in active research programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOVERVIEW\n\nMaintaining the U.S. scientific and technological world leadership is essential for long-term global economic competitiveness.  Exposure of students to frontier science questions at all education levels is an important part of attracting new generations of students to consider careers in science and technology.  Recent studies by the American Institute of Physics indicate that about 36% of students receiving a bachelor\u00c6s degree with a major in physics continue to graduate school in physics within a year after graduation.  Participating in research gives undergraduate students a glimpse of the graduate-school experience and offers opportunities for learning outside the classroom with emphasis on what is not known, rather than the known. \n\nThe Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) has completed its twelfth summer session of Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in nuclear physics. Undergraduate students participating in the program conduct research with faculty, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students in the TUNL consortium, which includes Duke University (Duke), North Carolina State University (NCSU), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH).

These series were created about a decade ago and are updated regularly to keep them modern and optimized to the educational backgrounds and research experiences of the students in the program.   \n\nThe first series provides an introduction to concepts in nuclear physics and tutorials on basic tools used in experimental nuclear physics for planning and making measurements and for data analysis.  These lectures are given during the first two weeks of the program.  The topics covered include:\n\nRadiation Interactions with Matter\nNuclear Forces \nNuclear Structure and Shell Model\nNuclear Reaction Phenomenology\nIntroduction to Nuclear Electronics\nIntroduction to GEANT\nIntroduction to Root\n\n\nThe second series is the \"TUNL Advances in Physics\" seminars where local faculty and postdoctoral researches present their research or a topic of broad interest at the research frontier of nuclear and particle physics. Over the last three years these seminars included topics related to:\n\nThe Neutron EDM Experiment\nProblems in Nuclear Astrophysics\nPhotonuclear Physics and the High Intensity Gamma-ray Source      at TUNL\nThe Dark Matter Puzzle &amp; Proposed Solutions\nNeutrinos from the Sky and Through the Earth\nNucleon Structure through the JLAB Electromagnetic Microscope\nNuclear Physics at Low Temperatures\nEthics in Research\n\n\n \n\nREFLECTIONS AND THE FUTURE\n\nOver the twelve years that TUNL has hosted an REU program roug..."
