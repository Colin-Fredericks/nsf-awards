The concept is termed Differentiation Engineering, which is defined here based on its goals: to probe and understand the underlying signal-transduction of differentiation thus enabling genetic or other alterations of cellular differentiation in order to achieve desirable cellular phenotypes. \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts - The Differentiation Engineering approaches described in the proposal can be applied to other clostridia and other differentiating organisms. In addition, the knowledge generated from this project will make a significant contribution to basic biology, differentiation and genomics of all clostridia and of other sporulating, but not well-understood, organisms. Finally, this project provides unique opportunities for student education and training in an interdisciplinary environment on genetic engineering for strain development, prokaryotic flow cytometry, experimental and computational genomics, and bioreaction engineering.",
