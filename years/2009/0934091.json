 "awd_abstract_narration": "Center for Telecommunication Circuits and Systems (Connection One)\r\nIIP-0934091\r\nUniversity of Hawaii\r\nIskander\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to renew the University of Hawaii's  participation in the Connection One (C1) center, an I/UCRC center that was created in 2002.  The lead institution is Arizona State University, and at present includes five universities.  The main research mission of the C1 is to develop technologies and solutions for emerging wireless communication systems, ranging from circuit designs and smart antennas to wireless network architectures and protocols.  The scope of C1 extends to the integration of wireless and broadband wire-line technologies (optical communications). \r\n\r\nThe primary focus of the proposed site over the next five years will be to continue providing the capabilities, expertise, and research facilities for conducting research that complements and supports the overall research focus in the Connection One Center.   The University of Hawaii (UH) brings in significant research strength in areas such as channel modeling, advanced antenna system designs, and digital signal processing for smart antennas and effective detection and classification of buried objects.   UH has been a member of C1 since 2004, and during this period has attracted 17 funded projects from seven corporate sponsors.    \r\n\r\nThe projects listed in this proposal will have significant impact in various industries like communication systems, radar systems, RF device design, fabrication and testing, smart antennas, and various applications such as IED and UXO detection using electromagnetic. The educational highlight of the activities of the UH site is the RET program that trains a large number of teachers throughout the state as well as significantly contributes to the STEM education in Hawaii.  There is mention of participation of underrepresented minorities in the center from native Hawaiians, and faculty of this site appear to continuously augment their infrastructure needs by seeking NSF and other funding dedicated to enhancing research infrastructure, for example through MRI funding.     \r\n",
