The\r\nworkshop is conceived specifically to identify new challenges for\r\ntheory, modeling and simulation of soft materials, and to\r\ninvestigate the growing role of applied and computational\r\nmathematics in meeting those challenges.  The goal of the\r\nworkshop is to attract researchers at all levels, from graduate\r\nstudents and junior researchers to leaders in the field, with\r\nfocus on breadth and diversity of the participants.  Particular\r\nemphasis is placed on the training of young participants.  The\r\nresults are disseminated in a format useful to students,\r\nscientists and engineers, through graduate courses with\r\ninterdisciplinary audience at Colorado State University, and\r\nthrough the publication of a refereed Collected Lectures volume\r\nof the invited and contributed talks. \r\n\r\n     From blood and lipid complexes, detergents, paints,\r\nplastics, personal care products, to liquid crystals and\r\nbio-materials, we are made of and surrounded by soft matter in\r\nall aspects of our lives.  While many properties of hard matter\r\nare now understood, we are still on the learning curve with soft\r\nmatter, and the study of the salient features and complex\r\nbehavior of soft materials is one of the 21st century's\r\nchallenges, requiring the development of new tools, new\r\nunderstanding, and an unprecedented level of interdisciplinary\r\ncollaboration.  Progress in materials science achieved in the\r\nlast decades, as well as the rapid development of computer\r\ntechnology, have brought scientists to a better understanding of\r\nsoft matter behavior and phenomena.  Although much progress in\r\nthis area has been made in recent years, fundamental challenges\r\nremain, such as the development of a unified scientific approach\r\nto soft materials, and the conversion of the important scientific\r\ndiscoveries into useful technological solutions.  The workshop\r\nbrings together experts in mathematics, physics and engineering\r\nto explore and develop the potential in this rich\r\ninterdisciplinary area, and generates a diverse,\r\ncross-disciplinary, but highly cooperative research environment\r\nthat increases the accessibility of this interdisciplinary field\r\nto both students entering the field and non-specialists.  The\r\nworkshop presents a broad spectrum of current research and\r\nprospects for future directions that provides young researchers\r\nwith an intensive learning experience and a larger perspective\r\nbeyond their individual PhD thesis topics. \r\n",
