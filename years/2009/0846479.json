 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Well-defined nanostructures of organic semiconductors are important not only for future nanoelectronics, but also for improving the performance of current organic optoelectronic devices.  There are two critical issues in modern organic optoelectronics: the scarcity of useful n-type semiconductors and poor charge transport in solution-processed films.  This proposal presents a novel approach for addressing these two critical issues using one molecular design procedure.\r\nCreating one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures via intermolecular \u00f0-orbital overlap is a promising approach for achieving enhanced charge mobility.  With the guidelines obtained from the PI?s previous experiments in generating 1D nanostructures from certain asymmetrically substituted electron-deficient bisphenazines, three types of novel 1D n-type nanomaterials are proposed: i) T-shaped heteroaromatic building blocks with controllable electronic properties and self-assembly morphologies using peripheral substituents, ii) dimers and trimers of the T-building blocks connected through \u00f0-conjugation, and iii) dimers and trimers of the T-building blocks connected with electron-withdrawing partners.  The main objectives of this research are to develop a fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship in terms of the tunability of the electron-deficiency, and to enhance the controllability of the 1D nanostructure morphologies derived from the new n-type materials.\r\nOrganic photovoltaic devices will be fabricated using the n-type nanomaterials as a constituent of the heterojunction, providing a large donor/acceptor interface area for exciton dissociation and enhanced charge transport through the pathway created by the nanostructures.  The proposed work covers both fundamental aspects as well as device applications.  The feedback from device performance will guide future upgrades in the materials? design.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  It is necessary to utilize vast solar sources to overcome energy challenges of tomorrow.  Organic solar cells can provide light-weight, flexible, and cheaper devices.  However, an obstacle to improve device performance is lack of one of the crucial components (n-type semiconductors).  The purpose of this project is to develop novel organic nanomaterials for organic solar cells (and other electronic devices) to overcome this obstacle through novel molecular designs, and thus help making organic solar cells play a significant role in the future energy portfolio.\r\nThis project includes an outstanding opportunity for educational outreach involving a local high school.  The PI is in a unique position to utilize his research for motivating young students in their early education with eye-catching visualization and real research experiences.  Throughout the project period, the PI will initiate a partnership with local high schools in the Clark County School District, launching a summer high school student internship and a high school teacher summer research program.  In addition, the combination of synthetic chemistry, molecular assembly, nanoscience, organic materials, and optoelectronic device application will provide an excellent intellectual stage for graduate and undergraduate students to learn about interfacial chemistry which has growing importance as a contemporary science.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis project aimed to develop electron-deficient (n-type) organic semiconductors that can form nanostructures, as they are a crucial component for organic electronic applications.  The main objectives were to establish a fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship in terms of the tunability of the electron-deficiency and the controllability of nanostructure morphologies derived from the new n-type materials.  We have made significant accomplishments throughout the project period, which produced 8 publications in high impact journals and one book chapter.  An additional manuscript is in preparation currently.  Selective highlights are provided below.\n\nWe have developed unique systems which allow for tuning both electronic and self-assembly properties even with small structural modifications.  Expected electron-deficiency to be n-type molecules has been achieved, and moreover these molecules are capable of forming nanofibers. The flagship example of electronic property tuning is shown in Figure 1. Seemingly trivial structural change impacted the electronic properties of whole molecule dramatically. Note that the color change is directly related to the electronic properties.  Interestingly, the highest electron-deficiency and the lowest energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was observed from molecule D, which is relatively small compared to others.  The important message from this result is that it does not have to be a large molecule to have low energy gap, which has been the generally accepted idea.  Such accomplishment was only possible with a unique collaboration we built with Prof. Kathleen Robins (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) who evaluated the systems using quantum mechanical theoretical calculations.  The theory has become a valuable tool for not only understanding the electronic properties but guiding molecular design as well. \n\nAs we envisioned, the majority of molecules we developed showed exceptional capability of producing nanofibers.  Especially, they form gels in select organic solvents, which is called organogels.  Organogelation is the result of trapping solvents in three-dimensional networks of one-dimensional nanofibers self-assembled by intermolecular interactions.  It is a simple and reproducible way to produce nanofibers.  Particularly interesting properties of these molecules were unusual solid-state properties in gels including fluorescence enhancement and fluorescence color change.  Figure 2 shows such an example, in which molecule G exhibited different emission colors depending on the type of gelling solvents.  A high-end microscopic investigation revealed the fluorescence color change was due to the difference in the fiber morphology.  We also demonstrated the fibrillation effect on the small-molecule-based organic solar cells.  Although the power conversion efficiency was low, we have shown the fibrillation is beneficial for organic solar cells, which can form a quality film and could remove the post thermal treatment process.  As shown in Figure 3, the thermal treatment, which is necessary for polymer-based solar cells, destroyed the fiber network resulting in the decrease in power conversion efficiency. \n\nBroader Impact  \n\nThe achievement we made during this funding period is comprehensive from fundamental understandings to device applications.  The findings we made have been disseminated in high-quality scientific journals and national conferences, which will contribute to various scientific communities including organic chemistry, materials science, and device engineering.  Significant educational outreach activities have been made at various levels including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  A total of three graduate students, four undergraduate students, and a post-graduate research associate were supported and mentored.  Two theses (PhD and MS) were success..."
