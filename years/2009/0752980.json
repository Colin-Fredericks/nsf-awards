 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The systematic and global re-occupation of select hydrographic sections begun during 2003-2008 will be continued in the 2009-2014 period with the continued objective of quantifying changes in storage and transport of heat, fresh water, carbon dioxide (CO2) and related chemical parameters. The program is in support of CLIVAR (CLImate Variability and predictability) and the Carbon Science Programs, and is a component of a global observing system for the physical climate and carbon system. By integrating the scientific needs of the carbon, tracer and hydrographic communities, major scientific synergies and cost savings will continue to be achieved. In addition to efficiency, the coordinated approach produces scientific advances that exceed those of having individual programs. These advances continue to contribute to the following overlapping scientific objectives: Data for Model Calibration, Validation and Model Based Synthesis; Carbon System Studies; Heat and Freshwater Storage and Flux Studies; Deep and Shallow Water Mass and Ventilation Studies; and Calibration of Autonomous Sensors. A joint study of the ocean carbon cycle and circulation is helping to identify critical areas where potential changes in ocean circulation could have serious consequences for future anthropogenic uptake. Global warming-induced changes in the ocean?s transport of heat and freshwater, which could affect the circulation, are being followed through these long-term measurements. An average of two sections will be conducted every year, sometime collaboratively with international partner. The measurements made on each section include hydrography (full-depth vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, currents), Underway  surface temperature, salinity, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), air-sea fluxes, bathymetry, navigation), carbon system (dissolved inorganic carbon, pCO2. Total Alkalinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen), and transient tracers (CFCs, SF6, tritium/3He). This project will collect the data and perform the quality control measures routinely carried out by providers of reference-quality data. Post-cruise data updates, distribution, and archive will continue to be managed by groups with separate funding. This ongoing project is integrated with a larger international effort to monitor the ocean's response to climate change.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The results will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding. The project is based on the fundamental concept that data collected belong to the community, and are available to the community at large rather than being proprietary for the investigators involved in the project. The data policy is stringent and geared towards rapid and open dissemination, with a clear structure for all data to undergo thorough quality control and transmission to a recognized data center. This ambitious degree of openness has resulted in rapid and widespread availability and use of the data. The project benefits to society include the collection of a high quality data set, and use of the data to assess climate change. The global program provides full water column data of climatically significant parameters with decadal coverage. These data are and will be used to assess climate change by quantifying the uptake and storage of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean, and contributing to an understanding and models of the processes that control the uptake and transport of CO2 into the ocean's interior. Since these are likely to be the only systematic observations below 2000 m, they are and will be used to document long term trends in ocean warming, and heat and freshwater fluxes. The data will remain a resource for model calibration of the climate system. The project will continue to promote training and learning. It will continue to serve as a community resource for training and entraining graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and new scientists in sea-going work. Outreach activities will continue as opportunities arise.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project, \"Collaborative Research: Global Ocean Repeat Hydrography, Carbon, and Tracer Measurements, 2009-2014\", is the US component of an international program to document changes in the global ocean as the earth warms.  Data are collected along a set of lines that cross all of the ocean basins and the major circulation pathways of ocean waters from the surface to the bottom (Fig. 1) and the lines are repeated roughly every 10 years. Different countries occupy different lines, but make the same set of core observations, which are briefly discussed in the next paragraph.  The objective of the program is to document changes in the ocean, which has a major impact on the earth?s climate, and provide these data to the public and scientific community for investigations to understand in detail the climate changes that are occurring worldwide.\n\n These repeat observations reveal both decadal trends associated with global warming and other processes, and variability on shorter time scales.  Temperature and salinity and current velocity measurements reveal changes in heat and freshwater content and circulation of the ocean.  Oxygen and nutrient measurements reveal changes in the biological productivity and respiration cycles of the ocean.  Carbon chemistry measurements (dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, alkalinity, pH) also provide information on the biological productivity and respiration cycles and reveal changes in the carbon distribution and the exchange of carbon dioxide between the ocean and the atmosphere.  Measurements of anthropogenic tracers (CFCs, SF6, tritium and He-3) reveal ventilation pathways and rates since the mid-20th century.  More than 80% of carbon dioxide produced by human activity has entered the atmosphere since the mid-20th century.  Combining the anthropogenic tracer and the carbon chemistry data, the ocean uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and other human activities can be determined.  These are the core measurements of the Repeat Hydrography program.\n\n This specific NSF proposal supported the collection and measurement of anthropogenic tracer samples along the highlighted blue lines in Fig. 1.  Roughly 4200 samples were measured for tritium and He-3 and 21,000 samples for CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113 and SF6.  All of these data have been, or will be reported in the near future, to the CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO) located at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego.  All data collected from the Repeat Hydrography project are submitted to this data archive and are available free of charge to anyone wishing to use them.  The rapid dissemination of these data allows scientists to use the data in a variety of studies of the earth?s climate and oceanographic processes. \n\n The anthropogenic tracers have been produced by industrial processes (CFCs, SF6) and nuclear weapons testing (tritium and He-3 produced by the radioactive decay of tritium).  Their concentrations in the atmosphere and input to the surface ocean are well known functions of time and as surface water is converted to deeper water these substances follow the surface water into the ocean?s interior.  This reveals pathways of interaction between the atmosphere and the subsurface ocean, which is critical for understanding the evolving climate as the earth warms. \n\n \n\nAs  previously mentioned, interpretation of the data collected on the Repeat Hydrography program is done by many scientists and is ongoing as more and more data are added to data archive.  Presenting these results is outside the scope of this report.  These results are increasing our understanding of the earth?s climate and enabling models to be developed that can project future changes in the earth?s climate.  The projections are very important for society to develop plans to deal with the changing climate.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William M Smethie Jr."
