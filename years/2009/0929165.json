 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT HRD 0929165\r\n\r\nShaw University is improving the quality of its undergraduate biology program through infusion of bio-based technology courses and strategized training programs for both students and faculty. The specific objectives of this project include the development and establishment of new bio-technology courses, redesigning of some existing courses to reflect current bio-advances, training of students in bio-based techniques and skills development, broad-based training for bio-technology capability; and training of STEM faculty in bio-technology instruction conceptual framework and methodologies. \r\n\r\nThe State of North Carolina ranks among the top three biotechnology regions in the United States. As the industry continues to expand, more trained employees are needed to fill the jobs created, especially in the nearby Research Triangle Park (RTP). Currently, participation by underrepresented minorities in this workforce is very low. Shaw University is enhancing the quality of its Science program with the intention to increase the participation of African Americans in the biotechnology industrial revolution.\r\n\r\nProject activities include development and redesigning of courses; faculty training through the BioTechnology Institute, which trains Bio-technology teachers for more effective student learning; purchase of basic laboratory materials and supplies for teaching bio-techniques to students and for student-participatory laboratory activities for enhanced skills training, and dissemination of results. The overall comprehensive strategy targets collaboration with high-tech universities running bio-technology programs at undergraduate (and graduate) levels and organizing of student and faculty visits to high-tech labs for technology transfer; enhancement of STEM faculty for teaching of biotechnology courses through training sessions with the BioTechnology Institute; invitation of biotechnology experts to Shaw to meet with students; participation at conferences and organization of an annual in-house Biotechnology Seminar as an additional forum for training and for dissemination of project results; as well as regular evaluation of the project activities to ensure that the project plans are being achieved. \r\n",
