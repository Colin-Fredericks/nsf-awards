The proposed program has four components that will 1) support new research initiatives, 2) support dissemination of findings, 3) provide face-to-face training in the use of national databases, and 4) produce media-supported training in the use of national databases for dissemination via the Web. These components are targeted to doctoral students, postsecondary faculty, and institutional researchers who study higher education including trends in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and institutional researchers who use national data in comparative studies and decision support at colleges and universities.",
