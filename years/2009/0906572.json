 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThe principal goal of this project is to gain a detailed understanding of surface-initiated free radical polymerization, as well as its extension to controlled radical polymerization, and apply this knowledge towards preparing substrates with tailored and spatially-modulated distributions of polymeric grafts.  There are four main objectives of this work:\r\nFirst, free radical polymerization will be used to establish the relationship between the initiator density, polymer grafting density, molecular weight, and polydispersity index.  Substrates with independently varied orthogonal gradients in polymer grafting density and molecular weight will be fabricated comprising polymers grown from substrate-bound initiators.  The amount of activated vs. non-activated initiator sites and polymer grafting density and molecular weight of the grafts will be quantified by means of surface-sensitive analytical techniques.  Second, azo-based initiator system will be employed to monitor the characteristics of polymer brushes grown via reverse atom transfer radical polymerization.  While this transformation has been studied in bulk, it has never been performed in ?grafting from? polymerizations.  Expected differences in polydispersity index and polymerization kinetics will be expedited through use of polymer grafting density/molecular weight orthogonal gradients at varying temperatures and transition metal salt concentrations.  Third, the ability to UV-activate the azo-initiators will be exploited to form substrate-bound micrometer-sized macromolecular gradients.  By utilizing microfluidic reactors microscale polymer patterning will be accomplished by locally intermixing two monomer streams along the microfluidic channel and by employing UV irradiation through photomasks.  Fourth, as a seed project, microwave-induced free radical polymerization will be utilized to provide local substrate heating in order to de-couple the kinetics of propagation from the initiation step, which heretofore has not been possible, by concurrently cooling the monomer solution and heating the substrate locally by microwave.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThe relationship between surface initiator density and grafted polymer density, which has never been investigated in a systematic way before, is of critical importance when considering the breadth and depth of applications of polymer brushes.  While advanced materials have high value, economics limit their use, strictly confining them to those areas where they are absolutely necessary.  To this end it is advantageous, from both cost and performance standpoint, to fabricate thin chemically and structurally tailored coatings that can be applied to various surfaces.  By doing so, one can attain full control over the interface between the original substrate and its surroundings with just a few nm of engineered coating material.  Applications of these polymeric structures range from preparing chemically and structurally tailored films preventing fouling of ships to controlling biomaterial interfaces in vivo, as well as countless other technological applications, including (but not limited to), lubrication, anti-flocculation, particle assembly, protein adsorption, cell signaling, and nanoscale molecular motion.  Our outreach and education efforts, which complement the scientific aspect of the work, include: i) training graduate students, ii) outreach activities in an elementary school in Ararat, VA, and iii) attracting local K-12 teachers and students to take part in our interdisciplinary research endeavors through the Kenan Fellows and the Science House programs at NC State University, and iv) organizing national and international scientific meetings for undergraduate and graduate students at NC State University.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMacromolecules attached to substrates are called polymer brushes.  Polymer brushes are important in numerous technological applications, such as low-friction coatings, anti-fouling coatings, chemical sensors, surfaces that alter their appearance as a result of some external stimulus, and many others.  Polymer brushes are often prepared by the so-called \"grafting from\" method, in which a substrate (i.e., glass, metal, silicon wafer) is first decorated with molecules called initiators and is subsequently immersed into polymerization solution containing monomers, solvent, and catalysts.  Polymerization reaction, triggered by some external stimulus (i.e., temperature), proceeds directly from the surface-anchored reaction centers and leads to assemblies of long macromolecules that are chemically attached to the substrate.  The length of the molecules (i.e., their mass) depends on the time of the polymerization reaction.  The number of molecules per unit area (so-called grafting density) depends on the initial density of the initiator molecules on the substrate.  The polymer length and grafting density define the conformation of polymer brushes (i.e., their spatial orientation) on the surface. \n\nIn spite of their importance in defining the organization of polymer brushes, determining experimentally the molecular weight and grafting density is a challenging task.  Some approaches in the past suggested that one can estimate the molecular weight of the brush by growing simultaneously free polymers in solution and measuring their molecular weight by a technique called size exclusion chromatography (SEC).  During the course of this project we developed a computer simulation scheme that allowed us to study this concurrent surface- and bulk-initiated polymerization process.  Our studies revealed that the molecular weight of polymers grown free in solution outpaced that of the polymer brushes.  This observation invalidated the assumption that macromolecules grown in bulk can be employed to estimate the properties, most notably molecular weight, of surface-initiated polymers.  To offer a solution towards determining the molecular weight of polymer brushes, we developed a simple and robust method based on removing the surface-grown polymer by cleaving them from the surface at the linkage point that features Si-O bond.  We used a chemical called tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride, which attacks selectively the Si-O linkage, to remove the polymers from the substrate, collected them from solution and analyzed their molecular weight using SEC.  We have demonstrated that removing polymers from flat substrates as small as 5 cm x 5 cm produced sufficient amount of material for the SEC analysis.  Knowing the molecular weight of the polymers, we could determine the polymer grafting density on the substrate by using the molecular weight determined by SEC and thickness of the film measured by ellipsometry.  For most reactions the value of the grafting density was 0.5 chains/nm2.\n\nMost researchers employ controlled radical polymerizations in preparing surface-anchored polymer brushes.  The most popular is the so-called atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).  ATRP is a method of choice because of its robustness and simplicity; it proceeds even in the presence of a small amount of air.  However, ATRP utilizes often copper salts as catalysts.  Copper salts are difficult to remove quantitatively from the resulting polymer, which limits the application of ATRP.  In contrast, a free radical polymerization (FRP) proceeds without copper salts but it is much less forgiving with regard to the purity of the reaction medium.  Any small amount of air can stop the reaction.  While there are commercial initiators available for ATRP, no commercial FRP initiators exist.  During the project, we designed and synthesized a new FRP initiator and tested its performance.  We determined that FRP using this novel initiator proceeded faster that the ATRP and the polymer brushes ..."
