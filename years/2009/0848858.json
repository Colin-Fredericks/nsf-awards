 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports Professor Lisa M. Berreau of Utah State University (USU) for the preparation and characterization of divalent metal acireductone and flavonolate complexes.  Carbon monoxide (CO) has recently been implied in smooth muscle relaxation and may be involved in triggering (or inhibiting) apoptosis.  The mechanistic pathways of the CO-release that occur upon treatment of these complexes with oxygen are elucidated.  The understanding of CO regulation and production may give insight into links between metal homeostasis and other regulatory mechanisms in biology.  This work investigates the structure, stability and reactivity of C1(H)-substituted acireductone complexes with Ni(II) chelated by multidentate pyridine-based ligands and clarifies the role of single electron transfer and radical chemistry in the oxidation of a metal-coordinated acireductone.  An understanding of the role of the metal ion identity in directing the regiochemistry of the acireductone oxidation is also being developed.\r\n\r\nGraduate, undergraduate and high school students participate in the research.  The activities of the ACS Student Affiliate Group at USU bring students in contact with the elementary, middle and high school students in the local area.  Professor Berreau and her group prepare hands-on chromatography experiments that are made available to middle school science teachers in Logan, Utah. Two students from a local charter high school are hosted in the laboratory each summer.\r\n",
