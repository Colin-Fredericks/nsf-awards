 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mercury (Hg) is an important neurotoxin that is present throughout the environment.  Currently, there are significant gaps in our ability to measure mercury in the atmosphere.  This workshop will gather national and international experts on atmospheric mercury measurements to discuss questions concerning current measurement capabilities and develop a strategy for the community.  It will take place in Seattle, Washington in October, 2008, and the final product will be a written report for NSF and the community.  The workshop will address questions related to the ability to quantify mercury, the meaning and uncertainty associated with mercury speciation measurements, the availability of calibration systems for mercury, the capability and comparability of current aircraft measurements, and the need for new mercury intercomparisons.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding mercury is an important subject for environmental chemistry.  This workshop will help move mercury science forward by facilitating discussions among leading mercury scientists, including international participants.  It will lead to a report regarding future mercury measurements in the atmosphere and possible new measurement techniques.",
