 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sensor data is vital to the security, economy, and health of our nation.  \r\nIt comes in various formats and resolutions: visual, radar, lidar,\r\nlaser scans, and multiple forms of medical imagery.    There have emerged several approaches to the representation and visualization of point cloud data.  These developments have  typically been ad hoc, applying to one form of sensor data.   This project will develop new generic processing platforms based on the following key ingredients.  The quality of fit will   typically not be made in the least squares sense but instead will be determined by metrics closely tied to the application domain   such as variants of the Hausdorff metric.  The representation platform will be a fusion of implicit (level set) methods together with multiscale (wavelet like) decompositions.  The selection of optimal representations will be made with the aid of techniques from nonlinear approximation and learning theory.  The proposed research will be applicable to  generic point cloud data, but an emphasis will be placed on processing point cloud data that arise  in  applications such as autonomous navigation of robots and micro air vehicles, identification of sources of biological and chemical contaminants  and   climate modeling.  \r\n\r\n\r\nInformation about the world in which we live is obtained  through sensors.  These include medical imagery (MRIs, CAT scans), navigational tools (Radar, LIDAR, Sonar), surveillance (satellite imagery, video).  The data gathered by such sensors consist of an array of point values (called a point cloud).  This data must be processed and visualized in order to extract the important information they hold.  Such processing is done literally millions of times a day and how it is done determines the quality of the information. Most\r\ncurrent methods for processing and visualizing sensor data are built on old ideas from image processing and fail to capture many of their important features such as their  geometry and topology.  This project proposes new sophisticated techniques from mathematics and computer science to create more effective data processing.  The development will be made with an eye towards the critical issues of accuracy and the speed at which the processing and rendering take place. A particular emphasis in the proposal is on terrain data\r\nwhich are used daily in navigation, especially for robotics and unmanned air surveillance.",

Fast Point Cloud Surface Reconstruction Algorithms''\n\nPIs: Ronald DeVore, Guergana Petrova, and Scott Schaefer\n\nProgram Officer: Leland M. Jameson\n\nNowadays, a massive number of sensors acquire data for a variety of applications.  Sometimes the data represent physical or biological processes (such as atmospheric or genetic), while other times  the data is  used for surveillance or navigation.  For the acquired  data to be useful, it must be organized, displayed, and queried, in a timely manner.  This should be done automatically, using minimal computer resources.\n\nThis project developed state of the art algorithms for processing point cloud data.  It also developed new theories and algorithms for understanding large data sets through directed queries.  The main feature of these new large data algorithms is the idea of variable reduction which simplifies complicated structures by finding their most important variables.  This new theory enables the numerical treatment of complex problems that occur in physical and biological modeling and makes it  possible to find inherent structures.\n\nSoftware has been developed to show the efficacy of this new theory.  For example,  software for  the autonomous navigation of unmanned vehicles has been developed to identify physical structures and no-fly regions.  Software is also being developed to identify and classify features in large data sets.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronald A Devore"
