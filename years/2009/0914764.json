 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this exploratory project is on improving the representation of smoke plumes from forest fires in atmospheric transport models. Smoke plume height data from the Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) instrument aboard NASA's TERRA satellite can be used to evaluate the accuracy of smoke plume rise models as well as to estimate the extent to which forest fire smoke plumes penetrate the planetary boundary layer. In this project, ground-based plume height data will be derived from imaging obtained by U.S. Forest Service personnel using small, rugged, video recorders. This effort represents a novel, low-cost approach to satellite data validation, and a first effort at producing a database of forest fire smoke plume heights from ground-based observations.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the transport of pollutants from forest fires is critical to assessing the impact of natural processes on air quality in the United States. This project establishes collaborations between universities and the Forest Service. People in rural areas, a traditionally underserved group, will be integral participants in this project. The results of this project will be a resource for the atmospheric research community and air quality regulatory agencies.",
