 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lakes and ponds in the U.S. often contain submerged flowering plants in the genus Najas.  Some species of Najas are native to North America, whereas others are invaders from Europe that take over the ponds that they colonize.  The plants are nondescript, with tiny flowers; they often appear different when they are grown in various environments, and some species tend to form hybrids.  Because of this, they are hard to identify.  It is often difficult for land managers to determine whether the plants in a particular pond are the noxious invaders, endangered native species, or hybrids of the two.  This project will use DNA sequencing, examination of chromosomes, and advanced statistical approaches to produce identification tools for land managers.  In addition, the data will help scientists understand how these aquatic plants have evolved.\r\n\tThe project represents a unique partnership between an ecologist at a primarily undergraduate institution (Middlebury College) and an evolutionary biologist at a doctoral research institution (University of Connecticut).  Undergraduate students will acquire strong interdisciplinary training in ecology and evolutionary biology, and will be involved in both field investigations and laboratory work.",
