 "awd_abstract_narration": "Close relationships are central to health and happiness.  Most research has focused on relationship problems that interfere with well-being.  However, a number of recent, rigorous studies have found that it is also important that couples associate their relationship with a sense of growth, that relationship boredom can be a major cause of marital distress, and that relationship quality is enhanced when a couple does things together that are novel and exciting.  Yet, the research to date has not examined this important process in a significant real-life context, has not yet identified the fundamental underlying principles of just how this process operates, and has not yet delineated the conditions under which this process is particularly likely to operate.  This research takes advantage of a unique opportunity to advance knowledge by addressing exactly these issues, issues that have been almost impossible to test with standard research methods and populations. \r\n\r\nThis research is a unique collaboration between Dr. Arthur Aron and colleagues at SUNY Stony Brook and a non-profit organization called Welcome Home Troops (WHT).  WHT provides thousands of U.S. soldiers returning from combat deployments with tickets to exciting events (e.g., NASCAR races, concerts) to attend with their spouses. WHT hopes to help reduce the high divorce rate in this population by giving them a positive, high energy, shared experience, as a couple.  WHT is helping the research team connect with 2,000-5,000 married soldiers to better understand how and why their approach might be working, while also providing a unique platform to test basic theory on the role of shared experiences in relationship health.  Soldiers and their spouses, along with a matched comparison group, will complete surveys and indirect measures before and immediately after the event, as well as six months later.  The findings will illustrate the specific processes that promote relationship health and satisfaction within married couples who have experienced recent separation and stress.  Additionally, the work might directly benefit returning soldiers and their families by promoting relationship health and marital satisfaction.  \r\n\r\n",
