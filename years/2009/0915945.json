 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: Critical infrastructures are complex physical and cyber-based systems that form the lifeline of modern society, and their reliable and secure operation is of paramount importance to national security and economic vitality. In particular, the cyber system forms the backbone of a nation?s critical infrastructures, thus a major cybersecurity incident could have significant negative impacts on the reliable, efficient, and safe operations of the physical systems that rely upon it. Recent findings, as documented in government reports and literature, indicate the growing threat of cyber-based attacks on our nation?s power grid and other critical infrastructures. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity framework and algorithms for securing the electric energy infrastructure, and implement a novel curriculum, which include: (i) developing an integrated risk modeling methodology that models both cyber attacks on the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and the resulting impacts on the performance and stability of the power grid; (ii) developing risk mitigation algorithms, both in cyber and power system domains, to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks on the power grid; (iii) evaluating the risk models and algorithms through a combination of model, simulation, and testbed-based evaluations using realistic system topologies and attack scenarios; (iv) implementing a novel curriculum on cybersecurity of critical infrastructure systems through graduate courses and undergraduate projects. This project?s outcome will have broader impacts in securing our nation?s power grid and other critical infrastructures against cyber attacks, and creating a skilled workforce in this critical area of national need.",
