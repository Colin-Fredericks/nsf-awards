 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II (SBIR) project will develop a microfabricated subwavelength antireflective structure (SWARS) for use with a MEMS infrared detector to form and infrared camera. The SWARS structure was prototyped in Phase I and shown to allow greater than 90% of incident radiation in the 8-12 \u00ecm portion of the IR spectrum to pass, thus performing better than standard antireflective (AR) multilayer coatings which presently perform this function. These AR coatings are notoriously unreliable, as the thick films tend to delaminate during the processing and packaging of the IR device. In this Phase II project, the SWARS devices will be mated with a thermal light valve (TLV) to make the IR camera. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf successful the proposed approach may be used to produce MEMS devices for a broad range of IR applications, including gas sensors, IR beacons and IR thermographers. Because of their superior transmission properties and the robustness of the design to temperature fluctuations SWARS structures will be used in devices which must operate over a wide range of temperatures, and withstand virtually any operating or processing temperature. Such applications include equipment for factory floor inspections, power grid monitoring, maritime navigation, and security monitoring, in addition to fire fighting and first response.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II SBIR\nproject was to manufacture a microfabricated subwavelength antireflective\nstructure (SWARS) for use with MEMS infrared devices.  The SWARS structure was prototyped in Phase I, and found to be manufacturable in Phase II.\n\nAlthough the SWARS structure was fabricated\nsuccessfully and achieved all target metrics, it became clear that the\ninability of the rest of the target device to withstand the high processing\ntemperatures required for achieving vacuum would limit the commercial success of the technology.  We then turned our\nattention to developing a bonding process for vacuum devices that did not\nrequire these high temperatures.\n\nThe first attempt to lower the bonding temperature but\nachieve high vacuum used a metal alloy bond. \nWe found that the metal layers outgassed significantly, and low vacuum\nlevels coud not be achieved.  We then\ntried an Au-Au thermocompression bond. \nThis approach yielded very low vacuum levels as shown in the Figure\nbelow.\n\nAs shown above, we have achieved high vacuum (&lt;~ 20mTorr)\nat temperatures (&lt;~250C) that can be readily integrated into sensitive\ninfrared devices such as focal plane arrays for night vision systems.  Certainly yield improvements are warranted, but\na major milestone has been reached. \nFurther improvements will be pursued aggressively in the coming months\nusing IR&amp;D funding. \n\nAs a means to simplify the process for low temperature high\nvacuum wafer level packaging, IMT has also pursued a getter deposition process\nwhere a blanket film of getter material is deposit over the entire wafer.  However this simplification necessitates that\nthe getter material passes from inside to outside of each die, raising the\nquestion of whether significant diffusion of atmospheric gases laterally\nthrough the getter layer can lead to vacuum degradation over extended time\nperiods.\n\nHowever the average vacuum level achieved on this wafer is\nvery poor.  This thermistance level\nindicates a pressure of 700 &ndash; 800 mTorr, while our entitlement for this process\nis &lt; 5mTorr.  A likely explanation is\nthat the diffusion of gases through the getter is very rapid when the wafer and\ngetter are hot.  Because the bonded pair\nis unloaded from the bonder at a temperature of ~ 50C, significant diffusion\nmay have raised the die pressure to the 700 mTorr range.  Thereafter the wafer stack remained at 20C\nand the pressure remained stable.   In\nthe future this possibility will be more fully studied by thermal cycling the\nwafers and remeasuring.\n\nIn conclusion, this simplification remains questionable and\nwill not be integrated into any program until it is better understood.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jaquelin K Spong"
