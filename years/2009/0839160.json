 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a high-performance uncooled sensor to accommodate multiple spectral-band infrared detection at high operating temperatures. The photon detector will operate in the 3 to 5 and 8 to 10 micron spectral bands. In addition, the infrared sensor will be fabricated out of III-V nano-semiconductor materials. The nano-material will be composed of features, such as quantum dots and wells, and superlattices, for intra-band photon detection and dark current suppression. That is, detector materials and large format detector arrays will be design, constructed and characterized. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf successful the proposed uncooled high-performance sensor will be important for many commercial, scientific, and defense applications. In particular, the research and development activities will directly lead to a sensor product for high temperature operation (uncooled) and multi-color imaging. For example, the advanced sensors will benefit many industrial applications that include: environmental monitoring, biological and chemical detection, and medical imaging. Based on the advanced properties of the nano-material constituents, a number of unique detection and imaging capabilities will be realized. \r\n",
