 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many economic environments the participants do not have the same information\r\nabout the relevant aspects of their situation. For example, in a financial market each\r\ninvestor may have different pieces of information about the underlying value of an asset\r\nor a company. In product markets, each competiting firm may have private information\r\nabout its cost structure. In auctions, such as the wireless spectrum auctions organized\r\nby the Federal Communications Commission or the offshore oil tracts auctioned off by\r\nthe U.S. Department of the Interior, the bidders have private information about their\r\nvaluations and also some, possibly noisy, information about the valuations of their\r\ncompetitors.\r\nThe private information of an agent, whether it is about his/her own valuations or the\r\nvaluations of the competing agents will determine the behavior and the strategy of the\r\nagent. But in practice, the theoretical and/or empirical analysts do not have a clear\r\nunderstanding of what the economic agents know and, in particular, what they do or do\r\nnot know about each other. The missing and incomplete information si also highly\r\nrelevant from a policy perspective as the supervising or regulatory authority in many\r\nmarkets face similar informational constraints.\r\nThe PIs develop methods that allow predictions about the behavior of economic agents\r\nand the reulting market allocations in such settings. These predictions are robust to a\r\nlarge class of private information structures by the agents. They identify conditions on\r\nthe nature of the interaction and the market under which it is possible to make unique\r\npredictions about economic behavior. When these conditions are not met, the PIs\r\nestablish robust bounds on the distribution of possible economic outcomes, especially\r\nthe mean and the variance of the outcomes. They use these bounds to predict the\r\nwelfare impact of information sharing in markets. They also use the bounds to design\r\nrobust mechanisms, such as auction and voting methods, that perform well in many\r\ninformation environments.\r\nThis project provides an economic theory that can lead to practical solutions to market\r\nand mechanism design problems. It also provides a theoretical foundation for future\r\nwork in econometrics aimed at testing models in situations where the researcher does\r\nnot know the market's information structure.\r\nThis research will have broader impacts for the many different areas of social science\r\nthat use game theory as a fundamental tool. In addition, the project has direct\r\nimplications for antitrust policy, since whether or not to allow sellers to share information\r\nis a question for price-fixing policy.",
