 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe objective of this work is to develop accurate and efficient computational methods for the simulation of resonant damping in micro-electromechanical devices such as are planned for next generation sensing-arrays and communication circuitry. To address the central difficulty associated with such problems, the researchers will develop special iterative methods for solving the governing equations in the frequency domain; they also will examine the use of time domain analysis methods involving system excitation by narrow-band Gaussian pulses in combination with discontinuous Galerkin methods. The project will further address the central question of the development of accurate efficient infinite domain radiation boundary conditions as well as reduced order models for enhanced efficiency. The theoretical work will be complimented by a set of benchmark experiments.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the methods developed will provide device designers the ability to simulate, understand, and modify resonant based designs to optimize performance before engaging in costly prototype fabrication. This will result in more rapid and cost effective design cycles. It is also hoped this will enable designers to create the next generation of resonant based micro-electromechanical systems sooner rather than later. The work on radiation boundary conditions and model reduction techniques can also be leveraged for use in a wide variety of situations where simulation of infinite domains is needed ? such as in weather prediction, sonar applications, etc. The benchmark data to be collected and disseminated will also advance the work of other research groups examining similar problems.",
