 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project explores the use of nanophase mixed ionic/electronic ceramic (MIEC) conductors as functional electrodes in electrical energy storage (EES) devices. MIEC conductors are attractive candidates for use in EES devices because their high electrical conductivity facilitates double-layer formation, and their high ionic conductivity facilitates redox chemistry. Recent studies suggest that surface defect density in MIECs is enhanced significantly at nanoscales owing to space-charge or similar effects which can be effectively utilized for charge storage. The goal of this project is to provide convincing quantitative proof of concept of nanoscale MIEC's ability to enhance charge storage above existing materials. Main research objectives include: (1) screen MIEC conductors for performance; (2) evaluate electrodes containing MIEC conductors; (3) evaluate prototype EES devices; and (4) optimize performance of electrodes and prototypes. These objectives will be accomplished by: (1) synthesis and characterization of a series of MIECs; (2) fabrication of electrode blends containing MIECs; (3) evaluation of electrode performance and analysis by electrochemical methods; and (4) construction/evaluation of prototypes. Anticipated results include development of pseudocapacitors using MIECs that exhibit enhanced charge storage, novel hybrid battery configurations with higher power and energy density, and their prototypes containing MIECs.\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance scientific and first of a kind technological understanding of the nanoscale properties of ionic materials in particular the effect and utilization of enhanced surface defect density on increasing charge storage in nanoscale MIECs. The project is expected to lead to the development of new class of high-performance EES devices that contain MIECs. These high-performance devices are important because they would provide a useful solution to applications that require both high energy and high power in a small hybrid package. Oversized batteries are most commonly used in these applications, but the new nano-MIEC technology offers faster charge/recharge and longer cycle-life and could supplement or replace batteries in these applications. Anticipated markets include transportation (hybrid and all-electric vehicles), cordless power tools, and certain defense applications.\r\n\r\n",
