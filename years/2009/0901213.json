 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to improve the damping of inter-area oscillations in power systems by integrating damping controllers in grid-connected doubly-fed induction-generator-based wind farms. The approach is to employ two rotor control loops that allow independent modulation of active and reactive powers while providing damping benefits.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: This project addresses the problem of stability enhancements in power systems, given the increasing presence of and unique challenges in wind farms. The focus lies in developing robust damping controllers through a novel concept of real/reactive power modulation in wind farms to help mitigate instability concerns in the overall interconnected power system. The project will also help convey the benign effects of stability enhancements if grid interconnected systems are equipped with such controllers. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project will help reduce some of the barriers to grid integration of wind farms. If successful, the research will facilitate penetration of large scale wind power into the existing grid. Increased integration of wind resources will benefit society by reducing fossil fuel dependence on electricity generation and thus help build a sustainable energy infrastructure. The educational plan will integrate research results with graduate courses on renewable systems modeling /bulk power system dynamics and continue the recruitment of qualified female students for graduate research. This project will help resolve some of the skepticism surrounding the stability of grid interconnected power systems. Overall, the activities will help promote and develop wind resources in the midwest region and the nation at large. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
