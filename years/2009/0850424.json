Malone\r\n\r\n\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThis two year renewal REU site program will provide interdisciplinary research experiences for twelve undergraduates each year. The objectives of the program are to:(1) provide a significant number of research opportunities for women and underrepresented minority students; (2) build a diverse pipeline of graduate students; (3) educate students to recognize the value, significance and broad range of interdisciplinary research being conducted in the College of Engineering; and (4) create stronger relationships for research and educational exchanges between faculty and students at partner institutions.   REU students will have the opportunity to work with researchers who are leading experts in their fields. \r\n\r\nA major outcome of this program will be to further enhance the infrastructure for research and education in the College of Engineering by establishing a self-sufficient REU site program that will continue after this award period has concluded.\r\n\r\nThis program outlines a strong plan for recruitment that will broaden the representation of women and minority students entering the engineering and science pipeline.  Students will be recruited from partners Smith College and Mt. Holyoke College, Springfield Technical College and from the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez.  Since preparation for graduate education is a major focus of this program, our nation's academic institutions and industry will benefit from an increased number of students, particularly women and minorities, entering the workforce with advanced degrees.",
