 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program, Professor Martin Jarrold and his students will study melting and freezing transitions in isolated metal nanoclusters with 10-1000 atoms. Phase transitions like melting and freezing are normally associated with bulk objects. This work will examine what happens when the size of an object is reduced into the nanometer size regime, where the properties depend on how many atoms are present, and adding or subtracting a single atom can make a big difference. The melting and freezing transitions will be investigated using heat capacity measurements, ion mobility measurements, and trapped ion electron diffraction. The work will address three main topics: at what size do bulk-like melting and freezing transitions occur, whether superheating and supercooling occurs for specific sizes of nanoclusters, and the properties of the liquid nanoclusters. A liquid metal cluster with say 100 atoms is expected to have properties that are very different from a bulk liquid. Two international collaborations will contribute to the project. Prof. Andres Aguado (Universidad de Valladolid, Spain) will perform theoretical calculations that are critical to understanding the experimental meaurements. Prof. Manfred Kappes (Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany) will collaborate on using trapped ion electron diffraction to investigate the melting of medium-sized metal nanoclusters.\r\n\r\nThis work improves our knowledge of the statistical thermodynamics of small systems, and provides excellent training for graduate and postdoctoral researchers in experimental and computational physical chemistry.",
