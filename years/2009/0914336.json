 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of the present proposal is to develop efficient algorithms for electronic structure analysis that are applicable for both metals and insulators. This will be done by developing multipole representation of the Fermi operator, which is a fundamental object in electronic structure analysis and more generally quantum theories of matter. In addition, the PI also proposes to develop efficient algorithms for representing and computing the Green's functions that arise in this context. A second component of the project is the numerical analysis of the algorithms in electronic structure analysis. Topics to be studied include the accuracy of linear scaling algorithms, convergence and convergence rates of self-consistent iterations. This will be done by developing and using simple but canonical model problems that capture the essential aspects of the problem but allow explicit analytical  calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronic structure analysis is at the foundation of chemistry and material science, as well as some aspects of biology. Our ability to understand chemical reactions and fundamental aspect of materials relies heavily on efficient numerical algorithms for solving models from quantum chemistry or density functional theory. Existing algorithms are much more effective for insulators than for metals. This is particularly true for the recently developed linear scaling algorithms which relies heavily on the exponential decay property of the wave functions or density matrices, a property that holds for insulators but not for metals. The present project is aimed at bringing powerful mathematical tools to bear on the problem of electronic structure analysis. The proposed work will explore the mathematical features of the electronic structure problem in a way that has never been done before. By doing so, new insights and new algorithms will result that greatly advance our ability to analyze the electronic structure of matter.",
