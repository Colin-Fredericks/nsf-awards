 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this BRIGE award are to (1) characterize the fresh state microstructure of portland cement paste, (2) identify key factors linking the fresh state microstructure and rheological material functions, and (3) test the hypothesis that the aggregation mechanisms and morphology of the hydration products are impacted by shear-induced forces.  Key to the success of the project is quantitative measurements of the fresh state microstructure.  An advanced experimental method that enables in-situ particle size measurements will be used to characterize the fresh state microstructure.  A kinetics-based model will be used to determine the aggregation mechanisms and disaggregation mechanisms.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will advance the understanding of the rheological behavior of portland cement-based materials.  From this work fundamental information on structure-property relationships of cement paste suspensions will be gained.  This information can be used as a knowledge base to help predict how changes in the fresh state microstructure would impact the flow behavior and mechanical development cementitious composites. The results of this work are critical to the discovering of new applications for cementitious materials and for the development of high performance concrete with adapted rheology.  The approach proposed in this work could be used to characterize the microstructure of other particulate suspensions, such as drilling fluids, papermaking slurries, sewage sludge.  Integrated into this project are education initiatives aimed at broadening the participation of underrepresented groups, especially females, in engineering. The research and educational plan in this BRIGE proposal promotes an improved understanding of cement-based materials and civil engineering through research, teaching, learning, and training. \r\n",
