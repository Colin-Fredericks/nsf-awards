NCAR provided research and development activities related to Urban air mobility (UAM) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Traffic Management Systems (UTM).\n\nUAM is an emerging concept for enabling efficient, safe and affordable transportation by air across metropolitan areas. Research and development of technologies were conducted to enable this futuristic vision of scheduled and on demand urban air transportation that may include everything from small package delivery drones to passenger-carrying air taxi operations, aiming for largely autonomous flights in the future. Weather is one factor that has the great potential to disrupt urban air mobility.  All the weather hazards known to commercial and general aviation also apply to urban air mobility.  The weather challenges vary significantly across the examined metropolitan areas, exhibiting distinct regional, seasonal and diurnal characteristics.  The most challenging issue identified is to appropriately capture the at times very dynamic situation of winds and turbulence within the urban landscape to enable safe, efficient and reliable UAM operations in the future.  The project provided insight to the emerging modes of air transportation that the aviation industry is feverishly developing and revealed opportunities for the weather community on how to better support the aviation industry by enhancing the observing infrastructure and necessary weather guidance to enable such futuristic flight operations. Research activities indicated that aerial vehicles should be equipped with meteorological sensors and share that data in real time for the benefit of other flight operators in the vicinity and also for validation of micro-scale weather predictions.   The project clearly demonstrated that the current weather observing infrastructure and weather guidance are not adequate to support these emerging modes of air transportation especially in urban environments.  Additional infrastructure investments are needed towards enabling a weather-tolerant advanced aerial mobility in urban areas.\n\nThe project provided an educational platform for students to engage in cutting-edge research and learn/improve their data analysis skills.  Education and outreach activities related to weather challenges in urban areas and for these emerging modes of air transportation were provided at various venues, including presentations at conferences, workshops, and industry meetings.\n\nNCAR also provided support to the NASA Ames Research Center Systems Modeling and Optimization Branch in the research, development and testing of weather effects for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Traffic Management System (UTM). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly becoming an important component of the national airspace. To cope with the increased UAV traffic demands NASA is developing a UAV traffic management system that includes separation management, scheduling, demand capacity imbalance, contingency management, trajectory definition and prediction, and importantly, wind and weather effects. Research activities focused on atmospheric turbulence and wind gusts, and the response of these effects to UAV performance. Operational  forecasts of weather and turbulence factors that are important to successful UTM implementation were provided to NASA. NCAR also worked with NASA to create an initial UTM Weather Concepts document. The results from this project delivered guidance to the aviation industry about the potentially hazardous weather conditions and their regional to local variance at select locations around the United States.  Research results also provided direction to aircraft manufacturers on how to design UAS and UAM to safely, effectively, and reliably operate. Graphical Turbulence Guidance is now being used by the aviation community, and enhancements provide safer flights for both commercial and general aviation. \n\nDissemination of techniques and findings in the field of UAVs occurred through presentations by the scientific staff at conferences, meetings, and workshops.
