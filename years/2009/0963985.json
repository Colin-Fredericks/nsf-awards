Participants are selected based on demonstrated leadership in their respective science communities, and from institutions which have a strong interest, but less experience with China at the institutional level.  Half the participants are women or minorities.      \r\n\r\nThe U.S. PI is Dr. Wei Zhao, Dean of Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  The counterpart organizers are Dr. LIN, Jiahua, Office of the Provost, Peking University, Ms. CHEN, Huai, International Office of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Dr. ZHANG, ShengSheng, International College of Shanghai Jiaotong University.   The objectives of the visit include developing insight into challenges in science education, developing targeted exchange programs that complement research strengths of U.S. and Chinese institutions, and assessing the complementarities of China?s scientific infrastructure with the research interests of U.S. early-career researchers and students from the fields of science represented in the delegation.  \r\n\r\n",
