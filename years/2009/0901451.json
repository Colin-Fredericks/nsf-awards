The approach involves a deterministic study of the impact of relay node placement on connectivity and survivability, and a probabilistic study of the impact of node cooperation and mobile relays on probabilistic coverage and intermittent connectivity in large-scale sensor networks.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research is two-fold.  First, this research studies relay node placement under realistic constraints and, thus, goes beyond prior research that assumes that relay nodes can be stacked on top of other nodes and that there are no \"forbidden\" areas.  Both optimal and approximate solutions for the placement of relay nodes meeting connectivity and survivability requirements are developed.  Second, this project exploits new techniques for using node cooperation and mobile relays for improving probabilistic coverage and intermittent connectivity.  This research involves the potentially novel integration of hybrid network components including sensor nodes, static relay nodes, and data \"mules.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to broader impact, the project integrates research into educational experiences for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, especially students from underrepresented groups.  The research also has the potential to improve the capabilities of sensor networks with a variety of important applications.",
