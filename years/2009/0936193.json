This project builds upon initial project efforts and progress made by: (a) developing a two-hour movie script for a television series pilot; (b) soliciting network interest in broadcasting the pilot and optioning the on-going production of a television series; (c) identifying a professional management firm to represent the interests of NAE as a proxy for the engineering community as the series is developed; (d) determining broadcast network interest in the production of a series based upon the pilot; (e) building a coalition of funders to support production; and (f) building a coalition of supporters in the engineering community.\r\n",
