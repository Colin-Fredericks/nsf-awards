 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study discretizations of \r\nmechanical systems with constraints. This study is motivated by the \r\nfacts that such discretizations may be used for numerical simulations \r\nof mechanical systems and that problems of studying periodic motions \r\nin mechanics and control are intrinsically discrete. The proposed \r\nresearch is aimed at two areas:\r\n(i) Structurally-stable and structure-preserving discretizations of \r\nsystems with velocity constraints. The dynamics of systems with \r\nvelocity constraints is remarkably diverse. The goal is the \r\ndevelopment of discrete dynamical systems that adequately represent \r\nthe continuous-time constrained dynamics.\r\n(ii) The use of such discretizations in stabilization of periodic \r\norbits of mechanical systems. It is anticipated that such control \r\ntechniques will be especially useful in cases when the period is long \r\nand/or intrinsic structure of controlled systems should be preserved \r\nduring numerical simulations.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of systems with constraints is important in various \r\nindustrial and scientific applications. Such constraints include \r\nrolling and sliding constraints, chained rigid links, and various \r\nconstraints found in thermodynamics and electromechanical systems. \r\nThere are numerous instances in industry, engineering and science \r\nwhere such constraints arise: robotics, the dynamics of wheeled \r\nvehicles, and the motion of satellites in space are examples. In \r\napplications, stabilization of periodic motions may be desirable--for \r\nexample in achieving a desired robotic or autonomous vehicle motion. \r\nOur methods should be helpful in analyzing and prescribing motions of \r\nconstrained systems, such as robotic and autonomous vehicles.",
