 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI project aims at advancing the fundamental understanding of vortico-acoustic wave coupling with hydrodynamic instability and thermal waves, along with the nonlinear processes leading to wave steepening and limit cycle oscillations in solid and hybrid rocket motors. The analysis involves physical modeling, perturbation methods, and concepts derived from the biglobal instability theory and Liao?s homotopy approach for the treatment of nonlinearities.  The work will lead to multidimensional solutions of compressible core flow models in simulated combustors that take into account flow directionality.  An immediate example includes the multidirectional sweeping motion of the gases and the non-uniformity of the flow above and across the propellant surface.  As organized, this program builds on the existing strengths of the PI and an industrial sponsor who is presently focused on the development of state-of-the-art hybrid motors. Given that no universally accepted acoustic stability model exists for hybrids, the basic research activities proposed under this grant will enhance the efforts taken by the industrial investigator to promote the commercialization potential of clean hybrid technology. \r\nAdvancing a rigorous acoustic stability theory for propulsive systems will aid in promoting the deep scientific insight needed to improve existing diagnostic and design capabilities. The projected enhancements can have a substantial bearing on the future development of rocket and turbine based systems. The direct impact of a unifying stability framework on the mobility industry can thus be significant in both aerospace and power generation categories. For example, understanding and suppressing instability can critically aid in demonstrating the viability of hybrid technology and its use as a safe and clean propulsion alternative in both space and land applications. On the educational side, the principal investigators will combine their unique strengths in solid and hybrid flow field modeling to coordinate the training and mentoring of various researchers and participants. Their efforts will have a direct impact on society by exposing high school, college, and graduate students to vital research prospects in rocketry, acoustic noise control, and hybrid propulsion through strategically planned courses, colloquia, workshops, and capstone design activities. \r\n\r\n",
