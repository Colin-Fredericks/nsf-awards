Kim\r\nINST: University of Minnesota-Twin Cities \r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nOrganic Field-Effect-Transistors (OFET) have recently drawn much attention as their unique attributes make them attractive for emerging large-area electronics such as flexible display panels, organic ID tags, and electronic paper which were not achievable using traditional silicon-based devices. Although the last decade has seen a tremendous progress in OFET performance, there has not been any significant research effort from the design community addressing challenges associated with OFET systems.  The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive design framework for future OFET systems in which the circuit design knowledge, device compact models and design tools will be developed and integrated into an OFET process design kit. The research and education activities will be carried out in collaboration with the organic transistor group at the University of Minnesota. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is structured to maximize the impact on several sections of the general scientific and engineering community, as well as on society, education and outreach.  The proposed research will produce prototype designs showcasing new innovations in OFET electronics. Key achievements will be disseminated to the public through the PI's research webpage. This project will proactively recruit and nurture minorities (Afro-Americans, Hispanics, native Americans), women, under-represented groups and members of K-12 organizations, as well as strongly leverage existing university-wide efforts for diversity, service, and outreach. New course materials on OFET electronics design will be developed for undergraduate and graduate curriculum with special emphasis on training future scientists and engineers with creative problem-solving skills in cross-disciplinary areas. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
