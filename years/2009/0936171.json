 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EArly-Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to significantly advance the state of knowledge in ul-trafast laser enabled transmission welding and single-step channeling processes in transparent dielectrics such as glasses.  Specifically, the aims are to (a) develop a deep understanding of the underlying physical phenomena associated with morphology of generated welds and channels as well as reliable predictive capabilities; and (b) utilize characterization techniques in conjunction with the predictive capabilities to elucidate the relationship of the rearrangement of glass ring structures to the change in mechanical prop-erties as well as its implications on reliability of welds.  While the non-linear absorption of ultrafast laser in interior of transparent dielectrics is known, how to precisely control and predict the morphology of generated features presents significant challenges.  Equally important is the understanding and prediction how the laser process affects mechanical properties, for example, fracture toughness, around welds and to explore its strengthening effects.  Femtosecond laser induced structural rearrangement to lower-fold ring struc-tures are linked to glass densification and mechanical property changes.  \r\n\r\nThe success of this project will provide new design opportunities in life sciences industry.  Single-step-channeling enables monolithic microfluidic lab-on-a-chip designs with a new level of compactness and pressure resistance.  Transmission welding enables new capsule designs of implantable micro-systems containing thermally sensitive components.  Flat panel display applications such as liquid crystal displays and plasma displays and lighting applications such as organic light emitting diodes will have a more reliable sealing process and thus longer product life and improved quality.  Actively recruiting and thoughtfully nurturing qualified and underrepresented students in particular will be carried out to help train much needed human resources in these critical and emerging fields.  The research results will be incorporated into a graduate level course and widely disseminated.",
