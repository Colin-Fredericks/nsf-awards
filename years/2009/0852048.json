In order to build positive relationships between students and mentors in this program several social activities have been planned.  These include weekly lunches, a student/faculty cookout, trips to sporting events, and performing volunteer work for the American Diabetes Association Day Camp. These experiences will stimulate the interests of undergraduates in engineering research, in general, and specifically emphasize the needs for top-notch researchers in the field of diabetes.\r\n\r\nMore than 18 million people in the United States have diabetes. While a cure does not currently exist, biomedical engineering is providing important inroads to understanding and treating the disease and its many complications.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, ITT established a unique multi-disciplinary center, the Engineering Center for Diabetes Research and Education?s (ECDRE) under the umbrella of the Pritzker Institute for Biomedical Science and Engineering.  The objective of the ECDRE is to use engineering techniques to increase understanding and treatment of diabetes and its complications. Also, the ECDRE is the first engineering center in the U.S. to focus on diabetes.   The Biomedical Engineering Department at ITT in collaboration with the ECDRE will provide the foundation for this summer REU program\r\n\r\nThe PIs will target undergraduates from institutions were Biomedical Engineering research opportunities are limited, with a focus on women and underrepresented minorities for participation in this REU summer program. By conducting research projects related to a disease that affects more than 18 million people in the United States, the PIs have the potential to advance understanding while influencing engineers in their career.\r\n",
