 "awd_abstract_narration": "For more than ten years, the principal Investigator (PI) and his group have been developing an atmospheric remote sensing system called the Active Temperature, Ozone and Moisture Microwave Spectrometer (ATOMMS). ATOMMS combines the best features of the Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) techniques by actively probing via radio occultation (a subset of) the absorption lines that MLS observes via passive emission. Analyses of available data shows that ATOMMS will profile tropospheric and middle atmosphere water vapor and middle atmosphere ozone to 1-5%, temperature to 0.5K, and geopotential heights to 10-20 m, all with ~200 m vertical resolution, in both clear and cloudy air. This unprecedented performance will improve significantly with averaging. Because the occultation signal source is observed immediately before or after each occultation, ATOMMS is self-calibrating, which eliminates long-term drift. These capabilities will fulfill crucial needs for climate change monitoring, research and policymaking. This research focuses on several critical, near-term research objectives associated with the ATOMMS development. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to (1) complete the nearly finished first version of the ATOMMS instrument, (2) complete the instrument testing and performance evaluation in the laboratory, (3) use the instrument to measure for the first time the impact of near-surface turbulence on the ATOMMS signals and (4) assess that impact against recent theoretical predictions. The nearly completed, first version of the ATOMMS instrument provides two tones near 183 GHz which is the minimum number needed to make useful differential absorption measurements. Simplistically, one tone measures absorption plus unwanted amplitude variations due to other effects such as antenna pointing and the 2nd tone measures just the unwanted amplitude variations. As a result, the ratio of the amplitudes of the two tones largely removes unwanted relatively broadband effects like those caused by turbulent fluctuations of the real part of the index of refraction while retaining most of the desired gaseous absorption signature. A recent Ph.D. in the group identified a new error source: turbulent fluctuations in the imaginary part of the atmospheric index of refraction that will produce significant amplitude scintillations separate from and in addition to those due to fluctuations in the real part of the refractivity. The ground measurements will for the first time measure the magnitude of the scintillations (\"twinkling of a star\") of the ATOMMS signals caused by near-surface turbulent fluctuations in the real and imaginary parts of the index of refraction and provide critical information needed to isolate and better understand this new source of error. The four steps summarized above are critical in the overall evaluation and demonstration of the ATOMMS remote sensing capability and must be completed prior to ATOMMS progressing to its flight testing and demonstration phase that will proceed if the ATOMMS follow-on proposal is funded. These research objectives are important and well-justified scientifically even if the ATOMMS follow-on proposal is not funded because they will determine and document in the peer-reviewed literature the performance of a new RO climate instrument and an uncertain error source critical to the ultimate performance of the ATOMMS climate monitoring system. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is to isolate and quantify a recently recognized key source of error. The turbulence testing will provide the information to isolate, quantify and reduce amplitude scintillations due to turbulent fluctuations in the imaginary and real refractivity. Without these measurements and subsequent analysis, it will not be possible to quantify this critical error leaving the assessment of ATOMMS incomplete and its ultimate performance uncertain. \r\n\r\nThe long term goal is a constellation of a dozen or more small spacecraft making ATOMMS occultation measurements which will provide dense, global coverage with complete cloud-penetration and diurnal sampling every orbit. Given its unique and powerful combination of qualities critical to characterizing climate, ATOMMS should be a key element in the global climate observing system Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) which is a crucial component in solving the climate change problem.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe climate of Earth is changing.  Making informed decisions about our changing climate requires precise and accurate observations across the globe that unambiguously determine the state of Earth's climate and how it is evolving over time.  A truly global perspective as required to understand climate can only be achieved from satellites.  Unfortunately none of the present or upcoming satellite systems are able to measure the state of the climate without significant ambiguity.  In particular our ability to measure critically important vertically resolved trends in atmospheric temperature (which is how we often define climate) and water vapor (which is the strongest greenhouse gas in our climate system) have proven woefully inadequate.  For instance, different researchers using the same long term satellite data set reach different conclusions about how Earth's climate is changing.  To fill this pressing and fundamental observing need, we have been developing a new satellite remote sensing system concept called the Active Temperature, Ozone and Moisture Microwave Spectrometer (ATOMMS) that promises to measure atmospheric temperature, pressure, water vapor, ozone and other constituents of the climate state unambiguously with  much higher vertical resolution and accuracy than any existing system.      \n\nAnother key point is a climate observing system must be able to measure the climate state under any and all weather conditions.  This presents a big challenge for orbiting climate observing systems because visible and infrared observations cannot see through the clouds that cover approximately two thirds of the Earth at any time.  Because they cannot see through clouds, visible and infrared observations provide an incomplete and biased picture of Earth's climate.  One of the big advantages of ATOMMS is its relatively long centimeter and millimeter wavelengths will routinely penetrate through clouds to measure the entire range of behavior of Earth's climate state.\n\nThe ATOMMS instrument probes the 1.3 centimeter and 1.6 millimeter wavelength water vapor absorption lines to determine water vapor.  Under this RAPID grant, we accomplished the following research\n\n1.      We completed an initial version of the 1.6 millimeter portion of the ATOMMS instrumentation capable of making the first set of outdoor measurements. \n\n2.      We made the first set of outdoor measurements across the 1.6 millimeter water vapor absorption line spectrum along an 800 m path across the University of Arizona campus.  These measurements were made with a very high spectral resolution of 0.1%.\n\n3.      We demonstrated the ability of this instrument to measure changes in the water vapor along the path at the 1% level compared with a nearby hygrometer. \n\n4.      We evaluated two standard spectroscopic models of the 1.6 millimeter line, the models of Liebe et al. (1993) and the AM model of Scott Paine. This comparison revealed significant problems with the Liebe model which is important because this is one of the standard models used to interpret measurements near 1.6 millimeters\n\n5.      The instrument demonstrated  very high spectral amplitude precision of 0.3% near the 1.6 millimeter line center in comparison to the AM model of Scott Paine indicating the instrument can fulfill ts promise in terms of performance\n\nThese results from this RAPID research grant have demonstrated some of the very high performance promised by the ATOMMS technique, consistent with expectations that ATOMMS will provide more than an order of magnitude better accuracy than present satellite measurements (which claim water vapor accuracies of 20% in clear air).  These results are thus a key first step toward demonstrating the ATOMMS concept.  If the rest of the research demonstrates expected performance, then ATOMMS will eventually be placed in orbit and fundamentally improve our ability to quantitatively measure the changing water vapor and ozone concentrations and temperature in Earth's e..."
