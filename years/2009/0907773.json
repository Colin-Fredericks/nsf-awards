The project divides into\r\nspecific but interconnected lines: the mathematical development\r\nof a theory of elastic growth in soft materials; the long-time\r\ndynamics of growth; the linear and nonlinear stability analysis\r\nof growing elastic systems with application to morphogenesis and\r\npattern formation; the problem of cavitation and void-opening in\r\ngrowth; and the study of reduced theories.  The Principal\r\nInvestigators study elastic growth within the framework of exact\r\nelasticity theory, where growth is modeled through the\r\nmultiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient.  The\r\nmechanical consequences of growth, its long-time dynamics, and\r\nits potential to either generate instabilities through changes in\r\ngeometry and stresses, or to act as a regulatory mechanism, are\r\nexamined.  Furthermore, a study of growing tissues is carried out\r\nthrough the development and application of the techniques of\r\nweakly nonlinear analysis.  The development of reduced theories\r\nfor rods, membranes, plates, and shells for growing structures is\r\nalso undertaken.  Various applications in biology and physiology\r\nare studied; in particular the ideas of growth are applied to\r\nbacterial and fungal systems, stems, leaves, arteries, and blood\r\nvessels.  The various theoretical analyses and specific models of\r\ngrowth are carried out through the use and extension of nonlinear\r\nanalysis techniques developed by the Principal Investigators. \r\n\r\n     Growth is a fundamental scientific problem of great\r\ncomplexity coupling biological, chemical, and physical phenomena. \r\nThe goal of the project is to develop mathematical tools to\r\nunderstand and model a variety of problems related to growth,\r\nincluding plant and microbial morphogenesis, the stability of\r\narteries, the development of aneurysms, and the regular and\r\nabnormal functions of organs such as the heart, the esophagus,\r\nand the trachea.  Despite the great biological diversity of these\r\nsystems, they share common features that can be modeled through\r\nthe use of similar mathematical tools.  These models help the\r\nscientific community to understand the intimate coupling between\r\nmechanics and biology in growth processes and to predict better\r\nthe response of many biological and physiological systems. \r\n",
