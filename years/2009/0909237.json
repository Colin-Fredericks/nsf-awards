A European collaboration has already probed the central regions of such galaxies, finding an abundance of internal structures that are undoubtedly relics of the formation history.  Dr Romanowsky will use a wide field multi-slit spectrograph on the 10-meter Keck telescope, which provides high efficiency over a wide field of view, to extend those measurements approximately 5 times further out in radius, to provide better constraints on the assembly history of the galaxy.  These measurements will piggyback with observations of globular star clusters already planned with this telescope setup.  The team will obtain both the chemical abundances in the stars and their motions from a near-infrared absorption feature of calcium.  A pilot study of 5 galaxies has already shown that the motions and structure of the inner regions can be very different from those in the outer parts, where most of the galaxy's mass and angular momentum reside.  A numerical technique that does not depend on any assumed symmetry properties of the galaxy will be used to find what combinations of the gravitational field and stellar orbits could give rise to the observed motions.\r\n\r\nAn early-career scientist will be trained as a postdoctoral scholar.  The team will develop their collaboration with Science Buddies, an online resource for K-12 science projects, to produce activities in extragalactic astronomy for the website.
