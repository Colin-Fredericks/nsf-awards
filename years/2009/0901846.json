The novelty of our research, and its most transformative aspect, is that we focus on networked systems to develop new foundations for complex systems. As networked systems are the cradle for many complex behaviors, and will become even more central in the future society, and the explicit presence of communication links simplifies the analysis of the interplay between information and uncertainty propagation in the system.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is in the network sciences. The education of a new generation of students and industry leaders, and society at large, as complex interconnected systems are becoming more widespread and dominant in today society. The mix of motivating applications and new theoretical problems offers a unique educational opportunity to the students that will be involved in the program, and will provide material that will be introduced in the existing undergraduate and graduate courses and labs. The proposed further development of a networked control systems laboratory will have a central role in completing the educational program of students involved in the project, as well as it will provide a hub for outreach and student retention activities.\r\n",
