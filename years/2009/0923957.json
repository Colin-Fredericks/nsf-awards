The proposed laser will be capable of generating multiple individually addressable pulses from a single ultrashort pulse.  The proposed laser source will be used in a number of projects: 1) a multimodal non-linear imaging microscope; 2) biological and biomedical imaging applications; 3) detection of explosives or pathogens and 4) in-situ chemical analysis of the combustion products in jet turbines.  The project will be carried out by a diverse group of scientists, ranging in experience from undergraduate students to professors and research scientists.  The work involves collaboration with a number of American industrial partners, as well as with the Air Force Research Laboratory.\r\n\r\nNew kinds of spectroscopy techniques open up brand new avenues of research.  The instrument developed with this award will allow scientists to study the composition and properties of a broad range of materials -- from biological samples to hot combustion gases.  Knowledge developed with this kind of tool can lead to: improved medical diagnostics, improved food safety, and better materials for advanced technologies.  In addition, the researchers working with Prof. Dantus will receive invaluable training in high technology development, an important skill in today's workforce.\r\n",
