 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GIS Faculty Institute at the Community College of Aurora provides training for a group of thirteen community college faculty and supports them in implementing a GIS module in their classroom. This project addresses regional workforce needs for GIS-related skills by introducing students to GIS via an experiential, modular unit within a course of study. The GIS Faculty Institute uses a two-pronged approach: (1) faculty learn to use basic GIS applications and receive support in designing and delivering their own module for use in a class; and (2) faculty learn about occupational applications of GIS in the Denver Metropolitan region through guest lectures and industry field trips. Several hundred students are using the GIS modules in classes taught by the faculty and are gaining problem solving and collaborative skills while becoming aware of GIS career opportunities. GIS occupational information and learning experiences are also being included in a variety of student activities throughout the year, thus impacting the entire college. While the GIS Faculty Institute is impacting faculty and students at the Community College of Aurora, this project also contributes to ongoing national efforts to develop models of ways to incorporate GIS into existing community college curricula. In coordination with the ATE GeoTech Center, this project is disseminating its findings to the broad academic community working to address the challenge of igniting interest in, and knowledge of, GIS as an occupational option for students.",
