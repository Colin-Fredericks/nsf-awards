 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, Dr. Martin from the University of California at Irvine, will develop a new switched-angle NMR probe and methodology for studying the structure of membrane proteins in their native environment. The PI picked matrilysin as the initial target membrane protein, which cleaves other proteins from the cell surface. The educational plan comprises several components, including efforts in establishing awareness of global issues for international students, and outreach to high school students in grades 9-12 in the framework of UCI's SPIRIT program. The goals are to increase interest in science by hosting students in Dr. Martin's lab, and have them actively engage in experimental work. \r\n\r\nMembrane proteins are substances that adhere to the outside of a cell. They have many different functions such as transport of chemicals into and out of the cell or in helping the cell communicate with other systems in the body. Due to their multi-functionality, these proteins are involved in many diseases. Matrilysin, for example, the protein to be studied by Dr. Martin at University of California, Irvine, exacerbates cancer by cleaving proteins from the tumor cell surface, thus preventing the immune system to recognize these cells as cancerous.  In order to understand the function of membrane proteins and find cures for diseases, the structure of the protein in its native environment, that is, attached to a cell surface, must be known. Dr. Martin will develop sophisticated experimental tools that will help in elucidating such structures. Dr. Martin's work comprises elements of chemistry, biology, and physics. She plans to engage students from the high school to the postdoctoral level in her work, and train them in thinking and problem solving across disciplinary boundaries. Dr. Martin is committed to training a diverse and international workforce in issues ranging from scientific literacy to science policy through participation in existing programs at UC Irvine.",
