 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to develop next-generation ultra-sensitive, low-power, multi-component chemical sensors utilizing gallium nitride (GaN) nanowires. The approach is to realize highly-oriented arrays of GaN nanowires by utilizing dielectrophoresis and functionalize them with metal and metal oxide nanoclusters. After studying the electro-physical interactions of chemical species with these functionalized nanowires, ultra-sensitive, low-power sensors capable of operating in extreme conditions will be realized. \r\n\r\nCommercial thin film sensors have significant limitations in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and reliability. The proposed ?hybrid? devices will provide numerous active sites for adsorption of molecules and subsequent catalysis of chemical reactions. By combining the enhanced catalytic properties of the nanoclusters with the sensitive transduction capabilities of the nanowires, an ultra-sensitive and highly selective chemical sensing architecture will be created. Post-growth assembly and functionalization will enable the development of sensor arrays in a single chip for multi-component sensing.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental interactions of various chemical species with nanoscale surfaces, which is essential for the development of ultra-sensitive sensors. Nitride based highly selective gas/chemical nanosensors could have multitude of applications including environmental monitoring, biological detection for clinical purposes, and for detection of chemical and biological threats. Results of this research will be incorporated into a graduate level course on nano-electronics. Students from underrepresented groups and undergraduate students will be recruited to work on this project. A science teacher and students of a local Science and Technology magnet high school will be involved in the proposed research. \r\n",
