 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nKennesaw State University (KSU), in collaboration with Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), forms the Increasing Mathematics Teachers for ALL Students (IMTAS) project. This project is recruiting, preparing, and retaining 36 teachers of secondary mathematics for high needs areas of diverse populations. Junior and senior level students are recruited primarily from GT and KSU.  These recruits then enter KSU's Master of Arts in Teaching degree program for mathematics education. This program is designed to increase the number of teachers for high needs areas, and instructs teachers specifically in how to work with students for whom English is a second language. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe faculty team consists of professionals with expertise in culturally relevant pedagogy, and mathematics. This combination provides an innovative approach to preparing mathematics teachers for all students. The Master of Arts in Teaching degree program also takes into consideration the backgrounds of a variety of students that may apply, and provides several routes for students to obtain the knowledge and skills needed to be effective mathematics teachers for diverse student populations. This innovative approach is also combined with the partnership's previously successful Noyce project's strategy of tapping an engineering-focused student population as a source of recruits for KSU's historically strong teacher preparation unit.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nGeorgia's need for mathematics teachers is ever growing in number and diversity. This project is providing mathematics teachers to help address this need.",
