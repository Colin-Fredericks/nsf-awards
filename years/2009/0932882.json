Monomers such as styrene and many methacrylates, not alkyl acrylates, had been known to undergo spontaneous polymerization. In their work, they carried out laboratory experiments and identified several factors influencing the initiation step in the spontaneous polymerization. They have also made advances in efficiently using chemical quantum-level computations on supercomputers to study the kinetics of polymerization reactions.\r\n\r\nBuilding on these successes, they plan to employ an iterative research strategy that includes first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, design of experiments, batch laboratory experiments, and spectroscopic analyses. It is aimed at quantitatively understanding the kinetics, the reaction mechanisms, and the relevant intermediates and transition states for initiation and chain transfer in spontaneous thermal polymerization of methyl, ethyl, and n-butyl acrylates using this integrated research strategy, with the ultimate goal of designing 'gchemically self'regulated' polymerization processes for the production of high-performance acrylic resins. It will involve a broad spectrum of activities such as: (i) proposing initiation model mechanisms, (ii) estimating molecular geometries of reactants, transitions states, intermediates, and products using DFT calculations on supercomputers, (iii) validating and calculating reliable thermo chemistry using Gaussian-n theory, (iv) designing laboratory batch polymerization experiments to capture the initiating and product species and to verify the controlling nature of the species and mechanisms, (v) conducting polymerization experiments, (vi) conducting spectroscopic analyses, (vii) comparing end group structures from the chemical quantum calculations and spectroscopic analyses, (viii) calculating reaction rate coefficients from the quantum chemical data, (ix) comparing the theoretical predictions with values obtained from the experiments, and (x) validating the control living species.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n\r\nThe potential impacts of this project are societal (through improved safety), environmental, economic, and in human resource development. Spontaneous thermal polymerization allows for the production of higher quality, environmentally-friendlier solvent-borne paints and coatings at lower operating costs. Low molecular weight, polymer and oligomer solutions even at high weight percent solids have adequately low viscosity, thus requiring less organic solvents to be sprayable and brushable. The use of less or no added thermal initiators (normally the most expensive component of a resin formula) and significantly shorter reaction times lower the operating costs. The presence of less residual groups from azonitrile and organic peroxides thermal initiators (which adversely affect polymer properties such as resistance to UV radiation) in the final product and the use of the quantitative understanding in optimal control of molecular properties improve the resin quality. The PI and Co-PIs will train and mentor two doctoral research assistants as well as six undergraduate (REU) students, who will participate in broad range of research activities from quantum-level computations and supercomputing to laboratory experiments and spectroscopic methods, some of which will be conducted at DuPont Marshall Laboratory. The project results will be released to the public at conferences and in journal and conference proceedings papers. Students from under-represented groups will be selected, trained and mentored in this project.",

The market for automotive coatings, adhesives and sealants is expected to reach $5.6 billion by 2014 [1].  Acrylic coating is already a mature technology.  Acrylic? and methacrylic resins are usually produced through free?radical polymerization.  Even so, improvements in polymer quality or production cost have a great impact because the market is so large.  Both the fundamental interest in acrylate reactivity and the potential to enhance polymer functionality motivate the current series of theoretical studies into the initiation and secondary reactions of alkyl acrylates.\n \nPaints and coatings include polymer chains, pigments and some solvent.  The pigment provides color, the polymer forms the solid layer that remains, and the solvent allows the paint to be applied.  In automotive applications, organic solvents are used, and these contribute to air pollution.  Because of this, environmental regulations mandated a reduction in the volatile organic content of paints to less than 300 g/l by 2010.  The solvent fraction of coating formulations has consistently decreased.  To maintain the workability of the coating during the application process, shorter and more uniform polymer chain lengths are demanded. Polymer chain length distributions are controlled by the balance of initiation to secondary reactions like beta-scission and branching, reactions that can be accessed by running at higher temperatures.  However, several polymerization reactions that are insignificant at low temperatures strongly affect the quality of polymer produced at the high temperatures. These reactions are often called secondary reactions. An example is the monomer self-initiation reaction, in which a pair of monomers initiates polymerization reactions at high temperatures.  \n \nOur work has explored the mechanisms of self-initiation and propagation reactions as well as secondary reactions.  We have used experimental and computational methods to understand these reactions with the aim of designing novel processes for the production of higher quality, environmentally friendlier resins and coatings at lower operating costs. Understanding chemical reactions enables control, leading to the production of resins with desired microstructural properties. Of particular interest in this project is the spontaneous (no external initiator added) thermal polymerization of acrylates and methacrylates, a promising approach to produce low molecular weight polymers.  Spontaneous thermal polymerization enables the production of polymers without any added external initiators. Reducing the use of added thermal initiators in thermal free-radical polymerization lowers both the operating costs and the level of the initiators left unreacted in the end product. Unreacted initiators can compromise the resistance of coatings to photodegradation, making spontaneous polymerization advantageous. Also, the process requires less energy and allows for higher production rates, leading to significant economic benefits as well.  Our results also indicate that spontaneous polymerization is possible even at temperatures below 120oC.  The project has provided Ph.D. and undergraduate students with invaluable opportunities to gain research experience in an industrial setting.  Its results have been released to the public at conferences and in journal and conference proceedings papers.\n \nReferences\n\n[1] http://www.reportlinker.com/p060923/Automotive-Coatings-Adhesives-Sealants.html\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Masoud Soroush"
