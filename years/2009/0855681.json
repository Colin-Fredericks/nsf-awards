 "awd_abstract_narration": "From 1979 to 2008 CESR collided electron and positron beams, producing a spray of particles observed by the CLEO detector. Together, CESR and CLEO revealed the important properties of the bottom and charm quarks and the tau lepton. The last years of operation were dedicated to the charm quark in a program known as CLEO-c. The CLEO-c data, now under analysis, delve further into the mysteries of the charm quark, and provide important new information about the strong force, which binds protons and neutrons and governs quark behavior. In parallel, LEPP theorists are developing new techniques for calculating strong force phenomena. Some apply the power of computers to the strong force using so-called lattice gauge theory techniques, while others seek patterns that relate disparate strong interaction processes. \r\n\r\nThis investigator proposes to carry out studies of charmonium and bottomonium spectroscopy with the data collected with the CLEO experiment at Cornell. These measurements are important to the understanding of strong interactions. The investigator has had a long and important involvement in the CLEO experiment. Having now moved to Luther College in Iowa, he proposes to continue his work on the analysis of the CLEO-c data, with the involvement of undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nThe investigator is an expert in the area of charmonium and bottomonium physics, hence combined with his long term connection with the experiment is well positioned to carry out a successful program of analysis of the data. The proposed program of measurements of charmonium spectra and the connection with the XYZ states found at the B factories is well motivated and the CLEO-c data is likely to yield unique information in this area. \r\n\r\nThe study of quarkonium states proposed by the investigator is important to the understanding of strong interactions and to the advancement of knowledge of particle physics. The data analysis plan outlined in the proposal provides an excellent opportunity for the involvement of undergraduates in research at a 4-year college.\r\n\r\nMarvin Goldberg\r\nPO\r\nMPS/PHY/EPP",
