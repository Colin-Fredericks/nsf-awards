Granted funds will support acquisition of a new gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and upgrade of an existing stable isotope mass spectrometer within the biogeochemistry laboratory of PI Tim Filley, Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences Purdue University.  The new quadrupole GC-MS will replace an early 1990?s era GC/MS system which is experiencing increasing downtime and is no longer supported by the manufacturer.  Upgrade of an existing PDZ-Europa 20/20 stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) will include replacement of antiquated communication and power supply electronics, operating software and a high temperature pyrolysis system to permit analysis of the Hydrogen isotopic composition of lipids. These instrument upgrades will support PI research on the biogeochemistry of soil organic matter and riverine borne dissolved organic matter (DOM), support an active outreach program to Native American students in Tribal Colleges within the Red Lake Nation and through collaboration with faculty at Bemidji State University, MN. PI research has relevance to understanding the role of soils in climate change and may influence future sustainable agricultural practices.   \r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n",
