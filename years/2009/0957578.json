 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)\r\n\r\nThis engineering research award to the National Academy of Engineering will increase visibility of a more positive and accurate image of the engineering profession by translating the recommendations of the NAE 2008 report, \"Changing the Conversation: Messages for Improving the Public Understanding of Engineering,\" into an action plan. This project will increase the impact of that report through development and support of a coordinated national messaging campaign.  The two components of this effort will be a workshop for engineering thought leaders and an online toolkit for messaging resources. Our continued economic and technological development depends on attracting, retaining, and educating more engineers. Improving the image of engineering as a profession and systematically correcting public misconceptions about what engineers do and who can become an engineer will help increase the number and diversity of engineering students and the future engineering workforce. This work will have a significant impact on advancing that goal.",
