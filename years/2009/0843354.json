 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information that leaves the eye first encounters a structure called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).  From the LGN, information is relayed to the cortex, where neurons have properties closely related to our perceptual experience.  To understand how the cortex acquires its remarkable abilities, data on its inputs from the LGN are needed.  When we view objects in the world, the neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are stimulated by small regions of space called their receptive fields.  This project will record the electrical responses of the LGN neurons of monkeys performing a visual task.  Linear mathematical models of the receptive fields of LGN neurons will be constructed based on their responses to simple forms.  These models will be used to predict responses of the LGN cells to natural scenes.  In addition, the effects of regions of space surrounding the receptive fields will be assessed.  These surrounding regions are expected to reduce the activity of the LGN neurons so that they are more efficient and they conserve energy.  In addition to improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying human perception, the results may help to generate ideas about improved designs of artificial vision systems that have wide applications in industry.  This collaborative project will provide training for a graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Texas and will also provide training and data for graduate students doing mathematical modeling at Boston University.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report--IOS 0843354\n\nIn the natural world, color is an integral part of our visual experience and an ever-present feature of the natural inputs to the eye and the brain.  However, we are still lacking a firm understanding of the ways that information about color is selected and transformed by the retina and the pathways through the cortex.  The process begins with the passage of the light through the retina and absorption by the photoreceptors that initiate electrical activity that eventually is transmitted to the brain.  We have studied pigments in the eye that absorb short-wavelength light that is potentially damaging to the eye and also can degrade our visual acuity.  We showed that these pigments allow us to work comfortably at light levels where we can achieve our best visual acuity. \n\nWe have also been studying how our eye movements influence collection of information in natural situations.  We found that the visual neurons in the cortex are modulated by eye position such that the part of the retina giving input to that neuron is most sensitive when that retinal region is directed in the straight ahead position.  Furthermore, dark objects, such as holes in the ground that need to be avoided, are more effective as stimuli.\n\nIn addition to influences of the position of the eye in the orbit, the movements of the eye are critical for normal visual function.  Since our vision is so acute, very tiny eye movements need to be measured accurately as part of analyzing the input to the retina.  We have determined the ability of two refined eyetracking systems to measure these small movements and we have established measurement procedures that can be used to evaluate the performance of any eyetracking system.  These results will be useful for evaluating new technologies that are becoming available for measuring eye movements.  The newer systems are more convenient to use, and they are being applied to research in fields as diverse as advertising, computer display design, and neuro-ophthalmology.  However, the new technology often has unanticipated artifacts that can be minimized by applying approaches we have developed.\n\nOur most recent work has involved recording responses of visual cortex neurons while a monkey made normal eye movements onto, over and around images of natural scenes.  Most work in this area has only considered black and white images, which are, of course, only encountered in nature at night.  We have used full color calibrated images, which should provide a more realistic view of daytime visual function. The data collected during these experiments are still being analyzed, but we hope they will provide new insights into the ways that neural response properties and eye movements interact to extract critical information from the natural world.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: D.
