 "awd_abstract_narration": "MPOWIR (Mentoring Physical Oceanography Women to Increase Retention) is a community-led program aimed at providing mentoring to junior women in physical oceanography in order to improve their retention in the field. Initiated in 2004, the MPOWIR program has been in full gear, working on the objectives of the program, as determined by the community in a planning workshop in the fall of 2005: (1) to provide continuity of mentoring from a young woman's graduate career, through her postdoctoral years to the first years of her permanent job, (2) to establish a collective responsibility within the physical oceanography community for the mentoring of junior women in the field, (3) to provide a variety of mentoring resources and mentors on a variety of issues, (4) to cast a wide net to avoid exclusiveness and (5) to open this mentoring program to all those who self-identify as a physical oceanographer. This proposal is for the continuation and enrichment of MPOWIR activities. Specifically, the following MPOWIR activities will be continued and expanded:\r\n\r\n1. The Pattullo Conference: The centerpiece of the MPOWIR effort, this conference aims to provide advice to junior women on developing their research programs; build community with peers and senior scientists; and expose senior scientists to the culture and concerns of junior women.\r\n2. MPOWIR website: This website is the central place for information on MPOWIR activities and is intended to provide mentoring opportunities to all physical oceanographers regardless of gender.\r\n3. Databases and surveys: Data collection and surveys are used to establish retention statistics and to quantitatively assess and track the impact of MPOWIR activities.\r\n4. Mentoring groups: These groups provide both peer and traditional mentoring on a smaller, more intimate basis.\r\n5. Town Hall meetings and socials: These events facilitate networking between physical oceanographers and provide career development information to junior scientists.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the reach of the MPOWIR program will be broadened by adding three new elements: an increasing focus on gender-neutral mentoring; development of a mentoring workshop that can be conducted at institutions and universities; and a focus on exporting this program to other discipline-based communities.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This proposed activity, through its focus on the retention of women in the field of physical oceanography, will allow further capitalization on the investment the funding agencies and universities have made on the education of women students. Essentially, this proposed work seeks to stem the loss of intellectual capital for the physical oceanographic field, as well as other Geosciences disciplines.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This proposed work aids efforts to create a scientific workforce whose diversity more closely matches that of the student population and that of the U.S. population as a whole, by aiding the retention of women in the field of physical oceanography and other Geosciences disciplines.",

This survey asks participants to rate their opinion on specific topics and invites comments.
