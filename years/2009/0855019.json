 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).The award will fund the support of Prof. Yuri Gershtein research program on CMS Experiment at CERN and outreach efforts with QuarkNet. The ultimate goals of the CMS experiment is the discovery of Higgs boson and investigation of its properties, as well as the search for new phenomena that might shed light on the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking. The group has made significant contributions to new phenomena searches and electroweak measurements at D\u00d8 experiment at the Tevatron. In CMS, they will concentrate their efforts on electro-magnetic calorimeter (ECAL), electron and photon identification, and preparatory work for physics analyses. The group expects that it will be able make significant contributions to the early physics analyses and subsequent hunt for the Higgs boson and physics beyond the Standard Model.\r\n\r\nOn the broader impact the proposal includes a number of education activities. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in research at the forefront of the high energy physics. This proposal will contribute to enhancing the existing QuarkNet effort at Rutgers University.",
