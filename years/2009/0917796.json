 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop which will gather most of the researchers that use vole species in their research in order to facilitate collaborative research across several disciplines of biology.  Voles have become important animal models for understanding processes related to behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics and behavioral neuroscience.  Because of the diversity in mating systems in voles (e.g. monogamy vs. polygamy), and the diversity of habitats that they occupy, voles provide a unique opportunity to better understand how behaviors adapt to different environments, as well as how genes and brain chemicals produce variation in behavior.  Researchers using voles as animal models come from diverse disciplines and therefore rarely interact at other scientific meetings.  The goal of the workshop is to foster collaborations among vole researchers from different disciplines, which will have a benefit all research fields.  The meeting will consist of a series of talks from senior investigators as well as students, post-doctoral fellows and junior scientists.  Poster sessions will allow all participants to present their work and for participants to interact in a casual setting.  Participation by students and post-doctoral fellows will provide valuable networking opportunities and expose them to the latest technological advancements in the field, and therefore provide important training opportunities.  The funds provided by NSF will be used mainly to provide travel awards to students and younger investigators and to offset the cost of the venue.  This workshop is expected to have a significant impact on vole research by facilitating collaborative research between trainees and faculty across all disciplines.  This will lead to an acceleration in discoveries relevant to many facets of behavioral ecology, evolution, genetics and behavioral neuroscience and a substantial broader impact in terms of interdisciplinary training.",
