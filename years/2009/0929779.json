 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year study will support a partnership between Virginia State University, Virginia Commonwealth University and two local school districts in central Virginia to help improve STEM education for underrepresented students.  The main goals are to: (1) indirectly develop STEM higher-order cognitive skills in students using programming language and problem-solving skills in the context of video games; (2) directly training STEM-related basic-level cognitive skills (e.g., working memory, processing speed, attention) to enhance the underlying cognitive architecture in students using the methodology developed by LearningRx, Inc. and delivered online; and (3) assessing the impact of these interventions through psychometric tests of change in attitudes and cognitive abilities of the participants, looking at improvements in performance on school-based standardized tests of mathematics, and science abilities, and monitoring cortical changes in students using fMRIs.  The study builds on work conducted through NSF-0714874 (and NSF-0624615 through HBCU-UP in HRD,where the PIs worked with 400 middle and high school students in a pilot study that focused on cognitive factors in STEM functioning.  Through this proposed project participating students will be provided 28 weeks of instruction in two-hour increments for a total of 56 hours in an after school setting.  \r\n\r\nThis study is the next step in an attempt to gather more evidence to determine if results from the pilot study are valid.  It will assess the impact of these interventions at two critical developmental periods--the 6th and 9th grades.  The target audience for this project is 240 underrepresented students (120 at each grade level).  The project will be based on successful strategies such as dyadic peer relationships; age-appropriate programming languages such as Python, Scratch, and Small Basics; and emphasis on explanation and metacognition.  It will link cognitive training, programming instruction, brain imaging, and socialization and will develop pedagogical modules to help build the capacity of underrepresented students (and teachers) in STEM coursework. It appears that the leadership, plan, experience, resources, and implementation strategies are all in place to successfully conduct this study.\r\n\r\nThis research will strengthen the cognitive skills of underrepresented students and help them perform better in STEM courses and/or elect to choose careers in STEM areas.  To that end, this project will likely advance knowledge in the field since few studies of this nature currently exist.  The proposed model developed through this study could be widely adaptable and easily dissemination to schools and other institutions that support STEM education.  To ensure that the research proceeds successfully, extensive recruiting of parents and students will be conducted.  Further, incentives will be provided for both students and parents. An interdisciplinary approach will be used for this work that includes  scientists, mathematicians, and other appropriate experts as collaborators or advisors from the departments of psychology, biology, engineering, and computer science from Virginia State University and the Department of Radiology at Virginia Commonwealth University as collaborators in this research.  Key district leaders fully support this project. The project has a well-defined methodological approach and a strong evaluation plan. It meets the criteria for emerging research, which is by nature uncertain, so this high-risk/high-gain proposal could be transformative should the results identify cognitive skills required for underrepresented students to do well in STEM fields.",
