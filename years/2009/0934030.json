 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program conducted by East Central University (ECU) and seven local-area high-need K-12 school districts is selectively recruiting 24 Noyce scholars from ECU students with strong academic background in mathematics, who would otherwise not consider K-12 mathematics teaching as a career. Three cohorts of 8 students are being selected as Noyce scholars in their sophomore year based on academic merit, with consideration given to financial need, diversity and physical disability, and will enter the program at the beginning of their junior year. Upon completing a mathematics (secondary teacher certification option) degree, the Scholars are teaching secondary level (grades 7-12) mathematics in one of the collaborating high-need schools.  Pre- and in-service Noyce teacher scholars are being provided with several support mechanisms, based on effective evidence-based strategies. Collaborative involvement of ECU's mathematics and education faculty is enhancing infrastructure for research and education, creating new partnerships, and broaden existing partnerships on campus and beyond. Noyce graduates are impacting the students they teach in a positive way and society in a broader way via community-based activities. Results of ECU's Noyce program is being widely disseminated to the public.  Most public schools in ECU's service area are located in communities with high poverty rates and sizable percentages of residents from ethnic groups underrepresented in mathematics. Hence additional mathematics teachers emerging from the ECU Noyce program are providing positive role models for students within the high-need K-12 school districts.",
