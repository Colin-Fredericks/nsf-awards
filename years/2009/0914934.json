 "awd_abstract_narration": "Group based anonymization is the most widely studied approach for privacy preserving data publishing. This includes k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness, to name a few. The goal of this proposal is to raise a fundamental issue on the privacy exposure of this approach which has been overlooked in the past and come out with a computationally efficient solution. The group based anonymization approach basically hides each individual record behind a group to preserve data privacy. However, patterns may still be derived or mined from the published anonymized data and be used by the adversary to breach individual privacy.  The objective of this research is therefore to develop novel group-based anonymization methods that can defend against such an attack.  The first part of the project is to define the attack problem, i.e., the published anonymized data can in fact be mined for privacy attacks. It identifies and formulates the privacy exposure to such an attack. The second part is to conduct a systematic study on the exposure of existing privacy techniques to the attack. The third part is to derive the condition that is able to resist such an attack and develop efficient data publishing algorithms to prevent it from occurring.",
