 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis project deals with the development, analysis and implementation\r\nof novel techniques for the solution of large, sparse linear systems\r\nof equations of saddle point type. Despite much recent progress,\r\nthe solution of large systems of equations remains one of the main\r\nbottlenecks in many numerical simulations. Applications include\r\nfluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, image processing, and many more.\r\nThis project deals with the further development of the \r\ntechnique of hierarchical (H-)matrices. H-matrices \r\nprovide an efficient technique for computations\r\ninvolving approximations to fully populated matrices.\r\nThe standard construction of an H-matrix is based\r\non the underlying geometry of the application. Similar to the generalization\r\nof geometric to algebraic multigrid methods, the PI proposes to \r\ndevelop an algorithm for the algebraic construction of H-matrix \r\npreconditioners for saddle point problems. Sequences of three-dimensional \r\nOseen problems that result in the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes \r\nequations will serve as the major application of the novel techniques.\r\nAn additional topic to be considered in this project is\r\nthe application of H-techniques in only recently developed\r\nKronecker product preconditioners. The techniques of this proposal \r\nhave a high potential to lead to robust and scalable blackbox solvers \r\nfor large, linear systems arising in the simulation of scientific and \r\ntechnical problems of increasing size and complexity.\r\n\r\n\r\nH-matrices have first been introduced in 1998 and \r\nsince then entered into a wide range of applications.\r\nThe approach of H-matrices is of significant importance \r\nwithin its own field of numerical analysis and also with respect to\r\npractical large-scale computing challenges that scientists are \r\ncurrently facing. Examples for applications include models for \r\nmagnetic fusion, accelerator design, electrochemical processes \r\nor the growth of ceramic nanostructures.\r\nProgress in the areas targeted in this proposal will have a \r\npositive impact on science and engineering by allowing for faster\r\nand more accurate computer simulations.",
