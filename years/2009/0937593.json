Artificial Intelligence planning and scheduling is relevant to a wide variety of applications such as software engineering, manufacturing, transportation, and robotics. The ICAPS-09 Summer School includes a poster session, where students present their research ideas for commentary by more senior researchers, as well as intensive study of foundational material and the latest research in automated planning and scheduling. The Summer School realizes an integration of research and education in its preparation of emerging scientists.",
