 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\nPolymers and polymer-based composites are rapidly replacing metals as the material of choice in many engineering applications and characterizing the behavior of polymeric materials demands concepts and tools that are different from those that describe the response of metals. In contrast, the fundamental strength of materials course on most campuses has remained unchanged for decades. Through this project, the mechanics of materials course is being transformed to include modern topics and new pedagogies. The focus of the course is on the fundamental behavior of materials in terms of loading and failure with attention to the general case of non-linear materials and their practical applications. Linear materials response, which constitutes the traditional educational approach to mechanics of materials instruction, is included in the course as a specific case that extends from the general case. The course is being taught using a problem-based-learning approach with seven challenges selected to highlight both traditional and modern materials as well as linear and non-linear behavior. Student learning through this new approach is being rigorously assessed and compared to learning through traditional courses.",
