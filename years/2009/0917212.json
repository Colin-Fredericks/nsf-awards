 "awd_abstract_narration": "Power consumption is an increasingly important issue across society.\r\nFor communication, as the ranges of links in wireless networks\r\ncontinue to shrink, the power consumed in the encoding and decoding\r\nbecomes a decidedly nontrivial factor in the choice of system\r\narchitecture. This is particularly important in settings such as\r\nwireless patient monitoring, personal area networks, sensor networks,\r\netc. Shannon's classical information theory only established the\r\ntradeoff between rate and transmit power as the probability of error\r\ngoes to zero and the block-length goes to infinity. This research is\r\nabout giving new conceptual tools for reasoning about the power\r\nconsumption in encoding and decoding as well. The core idea is that in\r\nthe age of billion transistor chips, the proper metric for complexity\r\nis the power consumed by the implementation.\r\n\r\nJust as simplified channel models have enabled sophisticated analysis\r\nthat has revealed deep insights into error correction and transmit\r\npower, this research develops simplified implementation models that\r\nare amenable to analysis. This reveals the fundamental tradeoffs\r\nunderlying the interplay between transmission and processing\r\npowers. Crucially, the models developed are compatible with modern\r\napproaches to iterative and \"turbo\" decoding by massively parallel\r\nASICs, while also not being limited to just the currently known\r\nfamilies of sparse-graph codes. By developing a unified mathematical\r\nframework, this research allows us to understand the total power cost\r\nof meeting performance objectives like high rate, low distortion, low\r\ndelay and low probability of error. This in turn leads to an\r\nunderstanding of how to better engineer wireless systems as a whole:\r\nopening up avenues for collaboration between circuit designers,\r\ncommunication theorists, and networking researchers working at higher\r\nlayers.\r\n",
