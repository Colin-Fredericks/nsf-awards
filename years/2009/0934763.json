 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nIn addition to Michigan Technological Institution, this project includes Saginaw Valley State University, Grand Valley State University, Delta College, and Grand Rapids Community College and two school districts: Saginaw Public Schools and Grand Rapids Public Schools. Over the five year course of the project 24 science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) undergraduate students and 12 career changer/STEM professionals are being supported through Noyce scholarships and related activities as they prepare to be teachers in high needs secondary schools.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: As part of their pre-service experience the Scholars are being engaged in special related seminars conducted by STEM faculty and receiving support from faculty at one of the two partner universities during their intense field experiences in the two urban partner schools. During the first two years of teaching in the high needs schools they will serve, the Noyce Scholars will be mentored in-school through a Noyce Mentoring Committee consisting of a mentor teacher from the school and a STEM faculty member and a teacher educator from one of the participating universities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: In addition to the broad impact the teachers produced by this program will provide in the school districts to which they go, this project is enhancing teacher preparation more broadly through its dissemination. The program evaluation is designed to provide insights into the effectiveness of the strategies being employed so that viable approaches can be replicated in other settings.\r\n",
