Brown\r\n\r\nProposal Title:\tIowa EPSCoR: Harnessing Energy Flows in the Biosphere to Build Sustainable Energy Systems\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Description \r\nThe vision for the Iowa EPSCoR project is to build research capacity within the state to support a transition in energy supply from mining subsurface (fossil) energy stores to harnessing renewable energy flows at or near the earth's surface. Inherent to this new energy paradigm is large-scale interventions in the biosphere, which require a fundamental rethinking of the interactions between human societies and the natural environment. If future energy use is to be truly sustainable, then energy flows and processes must be studied and managed from a holistic systems perspective that considers technical, economic, social and environmental constraints and impacts. This comprehensive program will enable innovative research, educate students, train a clean-tech workforce and engage diverse communities in implementing environmentally and economically sustainable solutions to growing energy demands.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThrough a coordinated planning effort, it is expected that collaboration will increase between and among academic institutions in the State of Iowa. The planning process will be used to develop collaborations among the three public research institutions, (Iowa State University, University of Iowa, Northern Iowa University), and one private college (Grinnell) and two community colleges (Kirkwood Community College and Indian Hills Community College). The planning committee represents major institutions across Iowa and this committee will provide the leadership needed to successfully execute the elements outlined for this project. The vision incorporates principles such as \r\nexploration of  innovations to concentrate, store, and distribute inherently diffuse and intermittent renewable energy and recognition of three fundamental economies to devise renewable energy paradigms, namely the financial economy, the energy economy, and the carbon economy; which are subject to constraints of food production, protection of wild spaces, and other land use priorities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nBy establishing closer relationships between and among Iowa?s institutions of higher learning, this project will improve the educational experience of science and technology students at all levels, and increase the educational opportunities of under-represented groups. The results of these efforts are expected to significantly increase the capabilities of Iowa?s researchers to successfully compete federal and private sector research and development funding.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to foster partnerships between scientists, industry, and the communities where the proposed technologies are to be deployed to assure commercial adoption of renewable energy technologies and establish resilient rural communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
