The three-week program will draw approximately 30 talented undergraduates from across the United States and abroad, in \ffields such as mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, and expose them to topics in logic, causal and statistical inference, formal veri\ffication, and decision theory.\r\n\r\nThe summer school will thus introduce students to important areas of research at the interface between philosophy and the sciences, forge substantial connections between a number of disciplines, and support the use of formal methods in technology and the sciences. The program has been offered since the summer of 2006, and has been highly successful.",
