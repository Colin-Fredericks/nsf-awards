 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Math and Science Teaching (MAST) Fellows project represents a partnership among New Jersey City University, three high needs school districts in northern New Jersey (Jersey City, Union City, and Academy Charter High School), and the non-profit partners Latino Institute and the Urban League. The Liberty Science Center is also a participant on the project. The partners are working together to develop and retain twenty Teaching Fellows who will be secondary mathematics and science teachers who are highly qualified and who utilize evidence-based teaching innovations in their classrooms. Fellows are being recruited from recent STEM graduates in the region. The Fellows are participating in mentoring and professional development activities designed to enhance their teaching and to provide them with a support structure for retention in teaching. The project is being rigorously assessed to determine the impact of the program on the Fellows' content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, instructional practices, and ultimately the impact of the program on their students' mathematics and science learning.",
