 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant challenge in evolutionary biology lies in explaining why some groups are more diverse than others. This research investigates factors that produce species richness and diversity of forms (and the relationship between these two factors) within a major group of frogs, the Asian Toadfrogs (family Megophryidae). This family is exceptionally diverse, both in terms of number of species and variation in size, shape, and ecology.  The investigators will use DNA sequences and information from fossils to construct an evolutionary tree of species relationships, which they will then use to test hypotheses about evolutionary rates of diversification. The addition of geographical distribution data affords the opportunity to test whether historically important geological events also affected changes in biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThis work will provide key insight into the timing of diversification events and the mechanisms that led to the species diversity we observe today. It will advance our knowledge of the role that animal form has with regard to species diversification and will provide important new insights into adaptive radiation, a phenomenon of general biological interest.  Outreach will include training students in modern laboratory techniques and convening several public education programs in rural Washington, including workshops on evolution and museum displays of frog biodiversity. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
