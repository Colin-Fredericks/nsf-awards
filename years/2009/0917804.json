 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Pojman of the University of Southern Mississippi is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on the development of experimental and theoretical methods for the evaluation of an effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids.  Such interfaces represent a complex nonequilibrium system and are poorly understood.  No one has yet studied the physical integrity of this interface, and Pojman is applying a technique known as spinning drop tensiometry to the study of this problem.  This method has been previously applied to the measurement of high molecular weight polymer solution properties and Pojman has presented preliminary results demonstrating the feasibility of the method for use in this new situation.  \r\n\r\nThe work is being carried out at the University of Southern Mississippi and is having a broader impact through the participation of a number of African-American students from the Mississippi area.  The PI has been quite active in recruiting, retaining and placing these students in industrial and academic positions upon graduation.",
