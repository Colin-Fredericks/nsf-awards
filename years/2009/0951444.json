 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this project is to evaluate pedestrian biomechanics of safely walking on pervious concrete, compared to traditional concrete pavement, in normal and adverse weather conditions. The high permeability of this pavement makes melting snow and ice much less likely to refreeze and form surface ice. Less surface water, coupled with its open surface texture, may result in a much safer pavement under adverse winter conditions. Slipping and falling is a concern both for actual and perceived mobility, particularly among older adults.  The objective of the proposed work is to determine pervious concrete pavement?s impact on fall protection as compared to traditional impervious pavement. The specific aims include:  1. Measure the material surface properties of pervious concrete and compare with those of traditional concrete.  2.  Quantify the biomechanics associated with walking on pervious concrete and compare with those of walking on traditional concrete in both dry and icy conditions.\r\n\r\nPervious concrete has the potential to improve traction and reduce instances of slipping and falling under adverse conditions. Creating a safer walking surface may decrease medical and insurance costs, while maintaining the mobility and independence of older adults. Characterizing movement on pervious concrete surfaces and comparing with traditional concrete will help identify important slipping-related attributes of the pavement surfaces.\r\n\r\n",
