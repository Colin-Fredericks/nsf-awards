 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor John E. Straub and colleague Sean J. Elliott from Boston University will acquire an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer with cryogenic capability to support inorganic and bioinorganic research carried out by the research groups of Professors Caradonna, Elliott, Doerrer, and Liu at BU, as well as Armstrong from Boston College and Rybak-Akimova from Tufts University. This spectrometer will support research and education in iron-based alkane activation; studies of high-oxidation states iron, copper and cobalt; multi-heme cytochromes; mechanistic studies of metalloenzymes; models for photosynthetic processes; and general inorganic mechanisms. Cyber-enabling will extend the educational experience to nearby institutions such as Fairfield University, Emmanuel College, and the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth.\r\n\r\nAn EPR spectrometer yields information on the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes and identities of free radicals, short-lived species that are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, from chemistry to materials and biological chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
