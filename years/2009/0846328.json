Two hundred economically disadvantaged students are recruited into the Future Scholars program each year - or 1,000 students over the course of this proposal, and Rutgers' home communities are largely dominated demographically by under-represented groups. The proposed initiatives provide unique opportunities to these students that will excite them about education and training in biomedical and tissue engineering and helps shape future leaders of our scientific and engineering communities.",
