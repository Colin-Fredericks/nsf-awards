Distortion of the magnetic hysteresis loop in first and third quadrants in open-circuit measurements was reported by Weiss in 1926 and named ?image effect?. Such distortion was not reported in the closed-circuit measurements developed in 1960s until 2008 by this group, showing the hysteresis distortion to be linked with the saturation magnetization and the geometry of the ferromagnetic specimens. This research will investigate the distortion and develop a fundamental understanding of the interfacial interactions between ferromagnetic materials. Various factors, including the saturation magnetization and geometry of the ferromagnetic specimens and electromagnetic poles, as well as the pressure applied to the specimens, will be analyzed.  Both actual measurements and computer software will be used to analyze the interactions between the ferromagnetic materials. This research provides a chance to revisit Weiss?s magnetic theory for new discoveries, which is important for infrastructure enhancement in scientific research and for development of advanced modern technology to accurately identify new magnetic materials for high-performance generators / motors for renewable energy. The project provides an excellent training ground for young scientists; e.g., graduate students and post-docs.\r\n\t\r\n***** Non-Technical Abstract *****\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Both scientists and industry rely on magnetic ?hysteresigraphs? in closed-circuit measurements to characterize permanent magnetic materials, which are considered to be free from errors associated with open-circuit measurements. However, two reports published in 2008 by this research group show that such magnetic hysteresis distortion exist in closed-circuit measurements and is linked to the magnetic strength and geometry of the specimen materials when a magnetic field is applied.  The hysteresis distortion complicates identifying and developing new magnetic materials.  Only a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon can help to establish effective correction methods, which is important for infrastructure enhancement in scientific research and for development of advanced modern technology to accurately identify new magnetic materials for high-performance generators / motors for renewable energy. This project will use both magnetic measurements and computer modeling to investigate the magnetic hysteresis distortion and develop fundamental understanding of the phenomenon, and develop new devices for magnetic characterization. The project provides an excellent training ground for young scientists; e.g., graduate students and post-docs.",
