 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF researchers, Lyle Campbell (University of Utah), Helen Aristar-Dry and Anthony Aristar (Eastern Michigan University) are collaborating to create The Endangered Languages Information and Infrastructure Project (ELIIP)) which has two coordinated goals: 1) the production of an accurate, comprehensive source of information on the world's endangered languages and 2) the integration of this information into the electronic infrastructure of the discipline. These goals will provide for the coordination of this information with other sources, providing multiple access points and expanding on related research facilities. This project enlists the help of distinguished experts representing each region of the world who will provide the research team with authoritative information for the database. The LINGUIST List (LL) will create an ELIIP interface on the LL website, where ELIIP information, then accessible online, can be browsed, searched, and downloaded, as well as easily updated by users.\r\n\r\nThe present proposal funds an initial planning workshop for the development of ELIIP. The workshop is designed to be a two-stage event, with approximately fifty invitees engaged in working groups and plenary discussions. The workshop will address central issues involved in producing an accurate, comprehensive source of information on the world's endangered languages and on the integration of this information into the electronic infrastructure of the discipline. Invitees will discuss how best to collect the most authoritative information possible on endangered languages and how to create electronic infrastructure which allows constant updating of the information and maximizes its visibility, accessibility, and interoperability.\r\n",
