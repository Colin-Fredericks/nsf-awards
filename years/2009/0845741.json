 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe cardiovascular system is the first operational organ system in developing vertebrates and proper control of its function, which transports oxygen and nutrients, is absolutely critical for the subsequent normal development of the animal. Any perturbation, whether natural or experimental, of its normal function will negatively impact further development and ultimately embryo survival. This project will entail an extensive investigation of the cardiovascular system during the development of two reptilian vertebrates, American alligators and common snapping turtles. Prior studies have shown that these animals experience alterations in the developmental environment (the nest), resulting in periods of hypoxia (low oxygen levels). This research project will determine the effects of these hypoxic periods on the gene expression, regulation, and function of the cardiovascular system in order to construct a complete picture of the environment-induced changes in embryonic cardiovascular physiology. Given the potential for variation in nest temperature, water content and oxygen content, this study will clarify how environmental stress can alter the embryonic survival of these species as well as other egg-laying vertebrates. During the tenure of this research project several education goals will be achieved. This project will further physiological education on the UND campus through the development of a specialized course in physiology and will have regional impact through the development of the internet based experimental modules in physiology. In addition, Native American students will participate in a summer research experience program.\r\n\r\n",
