 "awd_abstract_narration": "For proper neuronal function to occur, the neuron must have the correct number of input centers, or dendrites, which look like branches on a tree.  However, very little is currently known about how the pattern of these branches is determined.  The goal of this project is to identify how both global and local changes in dendrite branching occurs.  The Principal Investigator and her students will make use of molecular biology, biochemistry, and neuronal cell culture to study signaling by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a major regulator of dendrite branching.  First, they will assess how administration of BDNF to neurons changes the shape of the dendrites overall and at distinct regions from the cell body.  Second, neurons will be exposed to BDNF-coated latex beads to mimic local stimulation, and changes in the dendrite branching by this treatment will be compared to those that occur with global BDNF treatment.  Third, they will use drugs and molecular techniques to identify the proteins that are responsible for the effects of BDNF.  These studies are important because they will provide information on how dendrite branching is regulated during development to yield a functional brain.  The impact of this research is far-reaching.  Conducting the experiments will not only advance our understanding of how dendrite morphology is regulated but will also be part of a program to train high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in cutting-edge techniques in neuroscience.  The project involves setting up an exchange program for undergraduate and Masters students at the University of Liberia so that they can perform summer research in the Firestein laboratory.  A major goal is to establish an international program to bring neuroscience to the University of Liberia community through seminars, workshops, and exchange programs.  This program will help educate people in a country facing global conflict.\r\n\r\n",
