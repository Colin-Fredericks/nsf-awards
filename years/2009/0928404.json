 "awd_abstract_narration": "The HBCU-UP program at Delaware State University will focus on engaging incoming freshman STEM students in programs that will enhance their academic success and identification with the University and their major discipline. We expect to significantly improve the retention and graduation rates of minority STEM students. STEM freshmen will be divided into learning communities of 5 - 6 students who will enroll together in three linked courses: a mathematics class, an English class and Freshman Seminar. Each learning community will be assigned a peer mentor who will communicate with their mentees daily and ensure that they attend their classes, go to tutoring and office hours, and meet with their study groups. Faculty mentors responsible for 4 - 5 of the freshman learning community groups will meet weekly with the peer mentors and will lead co-curricular activities involving both students and mentors.  The project brings together STEM and English faculty and student services administrators to focus on revising the freshman experience of STEM students to involve them in a community of peers, peer mentors and faculty. \r\nTo support student engagement with research we will continue the successful undergraduate research program begun in the first HBCU-UP project. The proposed program will support faculty development and research. Faculty will submit research proposals for research grants to work with undergraduate students. These proposals will be reviewed by a committee. This process will help faculty develop better student research projects and give them experience in writing research grants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Delaware State University is an HBCU with an undergraduate enrollment that is about 80% African-American and about 50% first generation college students.  About 89% of our first-year students place into developmental mathematics, negatively impacting retention and degree completion, particularly among STEM students.  For STEM students our freshman-to-sophomore year retention rate is just over 60% and our four-year graduation rate for STEM students is about 22%. \n\nOur HBCU-UP SMILE project was designed to improve our retention and graduation rates by targeting first year students with intensive interventions.  For five years we identified a cohort of 45 &ndash; 63 incoming first year STEM students and involved them in four major initiatives: 1) summer on-line introductory mathematics classes for STEM freshmen followed by a 4-day, on-campus STEM Summer Training Camp; 2) intensive peer mentoring in the freshmen year in which peer mentors were paid based on the semester GPAs of their freshmen mentees; 3) mandatory 5 hours/week study hall for freshmen STEM majors. A major responsibility of the peer mentors was to get their freshmen mentees to attend study halls and freshmen who met the study hall attendance and GPA requirements also received $100 - $500 reward payments based on their GPAs; and 4) A subset of the cohort participated in a year-long undergraduate research project (starting in summer after their freshman year).\n\nOutcomes:\n\nPassing rates for the summer on-line classes were around 80%, and students in the on-line classes scored equivalently on the common departmental final exams (taken on campus in person) as students taking the classes in the traditional format.  For students who passed the on-line classes, their performance in the following classes (College Algebra and Trigonometry) exceeded that of students who progressed to those courses by taking the traditional series of in-person courses.   STEM students who started college by taking an on-line mathematics course and participating in the STEM Training Camp had a higher first year GPA (an average of 2.5 &ndash; 3.6 for SMILE students versus 2.3 &ndash; 2.6 for STEM students), a better first year retention rate (an average 65 &ndash; 82% for STEM students versus 58 &ndash; 64% for STEM students and earned significantly more credits in their first year than the overall population of STEM students (an average 22 &ndash; 28 for SMILE students versus 21 &ndash; 24 for STEM students).  Most importantly, for cohort 1 of our SMILE program (the first cohort that has been participating in the program for four year) the four-year graduation rate was 45% versus 22% for STEM students as a whole.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThese results suggest a number of effective, scalable interventions that have a significant effect on the retention and graduation rates of diverse students. These include offering introductory mathematics courses on-line as part of a freshman bridge program, an intensive peer mentoring program where peer mentors compensation is directly tied to the success of their mentees, and mandatory freshman study hall to help first year students develop good study habits.\n\nBroader impacts\n\nThe students in our SMILE cohort were 87% minority (a larger percentage of minority students than the University as a whole) our interventions are clearly effective for diverse students.  The significant improvement in 4 year graduation rate for the SMILE students compared to STEM students shows the impact of the program in increasing the number of underrepresented students earning degrees in STEM.  We are currently in the process of disseminating our results on our own campus and more broadly through presentations at conferences and publications in STEM education journals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Melissa Harrington"
