 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. W. H. Wills, Edward A. Jolie will conduct research examining evidence for prehispanic social diversity within Chaco Canyon and throughout the Chaco regional system of northwestern New Mexico. Between A.D. 850 and 1140, Chaco Canyon witnessed the rapid construction of large communal structures where smaller settlements had existed previously and became the core of an extensive regional system in the Four Corners region of the U.S. Southwest. Although researchers debate the role of increased sociopolitical complexity in this development, less attention has been given to social diversity. This is remarkable because previous research has suggested the possibility of multiple socially or biologically distinct groups both within the canyon and throughout the regional system. Basketry provides an avenue for improving  understanding of Chacoan social diversity, but has been largely ignored in research on Chaco due to the bias of preservation towards ceramics and architecture. This research will examine archaeological basketry from 13 sites within the Chaco system to (1) examine evidence for social diversity and (2) identify the possible cultural or geographic affinities of Chaco Canyon's occupants. Using museum collections this study will employ analyses of basketry technological style to identify past learning networks and investigate social diversity. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the nature and extent of social diversity in the Chaco system is vital to describing its internal structure. Without knowledge of social diversity it is difficult to specify the details and processes of sociopolitical organization that managed economic and ritual organization, or how it affected post-Chacoan reorganization and migration. This dissertation will contribute to existing literature on the archaeology of Chaco Canyon and aid interpretation for the public by documenting understudied museum collections. Original data acquired during this research will have implications for evaluating models previously proposed to explain Chacoan sociopolitical organization. The estimation of stature and, possibly, sex from sandal data constitutes a novel application of anthropometric tools, while results of residue analyses and radiocarbon dates will enhance our understanding of multiple sites' use and chronology. There is also potential for this study to inform research on the role of social diversity in the development of sociopolitical complexity among middle-range societies more generally.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of this project lies in its ability to aid archaeological interpretation at several museums and national parks which are important destinations for the visiting public. Drawing on understudied museum collections, the project underscores the importance of these rare collections and reinforces the need to curate and preserve them for future generations. This study's findings may also contribute to discussions of policymaking and Native American claims of cultural affiliation with Chacoan archaeological sites in the Four Corners region because the project explores a case where archaeological evidence suggests that there may have been multiple social groups living together. This research is timely because it complements current research programs in the Middle San Juan region and at Pueblo Bonito. Additionally, this project will further the professional training of a Native American archaeologist by serving as partial fulfillment of the requirements for a doctoral degree in anthropology from the University of New Mexico.",
