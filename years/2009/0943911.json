 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Brazil-Argentina award will support a workshop entitled, ?Biofuel technologies and their implications for water and land use?.  The workshop will be held at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in August 2009 and will be organized by Dr. Robert Anex of Iowa State University, Dr. Marcos Buckeridge of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, and Dr. Miguel Laborde from the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina.  The purpose of this workshop is to promote collaborative activities in key research areas related to biofuel production, specifically: cross-boarder impacts on land use; the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from direct and indirect land use change; and the impact of biofuel production on water availability and quality.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will foster communication between a diverse group of senior researchers, junior researchers, and advanced graduate students from the U.S., Brazil, and Argentina.  Participants will be from a range of disciplines including engineering, hydrology, economics, systems theory, sociology, and environmental science.  The interdisciplinary group will work together to identify research topics related to the land and water use aspects of biofuel production in the Americas, specifically research that will enable the design and management of biofuel production that can lead to more sustainable systems of production to enhance rather than harm the function of natural systems. This activity will identify new research directions and networks of researchers capable of tackling such problems.\r\n",
