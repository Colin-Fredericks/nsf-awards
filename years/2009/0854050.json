 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kurtis Paterson of Michigan Tech University will lead twelve engineering graduate students from Michigan Tech in an International Research Experiences for Students project, with twelve engineering students from the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, to conduct research on  critical Tanzanian public health issues connected to potable water supplies, sanitation, indoor air pollution, and malaria via the development or integration of sustainable and appropriate technologies. While eight new university students will participate each year, this program is unique in that all three years? participants will be linked to produce workable solutions to these problems. The first year will focus on concept development, the second year on design, the third year on implementation and assessment. Over the course of twelve months, each year?s teams will gain a breadth of international development research experience with on-campus preparation, ten weeks of Tanzanian fieldwork, and dissemination of findings.\r\n\r\nThis project provides an important opportunity  for American engineering and science students to be exposed to and understand the problems facing the developing world. Only then can designers develop effective technologies to solve these problems through innovation within the constraints of available resources, cultural norms, and technological appropriateness. It is clear that conventional classroom education is insufficient preparation for this type of work. Students must experience first-hand the challenges to the communities, and the resident engineers, of such nations. Lastly, while student interest in international programs is high, there are few meaningful opportunities for graduate students to weave into their research training and professional development. \r\n\r\nThis program has the potential for many positive impacts. The partnering communities will benefit directly from the research developed by the student teams. Public health improvements in these communities could have far-reaching ripples through education, economics, and well-being. The university student participants will learn about another culture, make meaningful contributions to the community and the literature, and grow professionally and personally. The secondary school participants may better understand the value of a technical education, and higher education. Lastly, the interaction between the universities, Peace House, and the community could lay the groundwork for future education, research, and service opportunities benefiting all.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n",
