 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a new and innovative outreach project in the nascent field of gravitational-wave astrophysics. The project is timed to coincide with the International Year of Astronomy (IYA) 2009 and the World Science Festival (WSF) in New York City, June 2009.   The LIGO exhibit will convey to its visitor three main concepts: the LIGO scientific endeavor is motivated by the same curiosity which motivated Galileo four hundred years ago; the violent Universe is awash with gravitational waves but at the moment these phenomena are entirely unexplored; giant, new \\telescopes\" are needed to detect the gravitational-wave spectrum and the technology of these telescopes is pushing back the frontiers of many scientific fields. The LIGO exhibit will comprise the following elements: a fully interactive laser interferometer; a large-scale three-dimensional LED artwork; large-screen multimedia presentations on gravitational wave astronomy; an interactive `Black Hole hunter' computer game. The design, integration and implementation of the exhibit elements will be achieved in partnership with professional exhibit designers.   This award is cofunded by the Physics Division, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings.",
