The US principal investigator is Michael Middleton from the University of New Hampshire.  The foreign collaborator is Natalya Yurkova.  The primary purpose of this planning visit is to develop a collaboration on Indigenous student motivation for learning science.  \r\n\r\nThis project will continue an international collaboration with majority and Indigenous educators and researchers to examine science learning in 5 different Indigenous cultures worldwide (Hawaii, Taiwan, Siberia, Aotearoa New Zealand and Belize).  While in Siberia, the PIs will work with Indigenous teachers to receive feedback and refine the project?s conceptual framework and research methods.  They will test protocols for interviews and classroom observations, collect pilot data on science instruction, motivation, and the integration of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) into the classroom.  They will continue planning for a larger research study that examines how children in Indigenous cultures develop a positive identity as science learners.  They will also explore how incorporating sense of place into the curriculum, integrating traditional ecological knowledge and Western science, may foster cultural and science learning identity.\r\n\r\nThis project will extend the examination of place-based learning outside of North America and explore unifying themes regarding the role of place-based education in how schools can enhance Indigenous children?s identity as science learners. \r\n\r\n",
