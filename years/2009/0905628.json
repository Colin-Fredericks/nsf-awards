 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to study various problems in the field of geometric partial \r\ndifferential equations. For example, he would like to study the qualitative behavior of the Ricci flow on manifolds with positive isotropic \r\ncurvature. In particular, the PI would like to analyze what kinds of singularities can occur along the flow. In another project, the PI intends to study \r\nthe Yamabe problem on manifolds with boundary. The goal here is \r\nto construct conformal metrics that have constant scalar curvature in \r\nthe interior and zero mean curvature along the boundary.  The PI also intends\r\nto study ancient solutions to the Yamabe flow on the n-dimensional \r\nsphere. This question is motivated by a classification result, due to \r\nHamilton, Daskalopoulos, and Sesum, for ancient solutions to the Ricci \r\nflow on the two-sphere. \r\nThis project is concerned with questions at the crossroads of analysis \r\nand differential geometry. The use of analytical techniques in geometry \r\nhas been extremely successful in recent years. In particular, Hamilton's \r\nRicci flow plays a key role in Perelman's solution of the Poincare conjecture, \r\nas well as in the proof of the Differentiable Sphere Theorem \r\nby Richard Schoen and myself. The goal of the project is to gain a \r\nbetter understanding of these geometric evolution equations, and their \r\nqualitative properties.\r\n",
