 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to use transition metals, in particular cobalt complexes, for the development of methodology for the rapid construction of novel complex molecules by multiple bond formation.  These include the phenylenes, a new class of novel cyclohexatrienoid hydrocarbons endowed with strain and antiaromatic activation.  These molecules are not only adding fundamental knowledge to the understanding of aromatic delocalization, but also have great promise in applications such as thin film transistors, organic semiconductor materials, electroluminescent devices, energy storage systems, and others.  A long term goal is to facilitate the invention of integrated nanotechnologies for the microsystems of the future. In another thrust, the synthetic methodology to be developed under this program should facilitate the construction of hitherto inaccessible novel compound classes of synthetic and medicinal interest.  Through the understanding of mechanisms, and aided by computational methods, catalytic selectivity will be sought.  This effort should greatly simplify routes to natural and unnatural products, with impact on total synthesis and the development of compound libraries endowed with new potentially pharmacophoric motifs.  \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor K. Peter C Vollhardt of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley.  Professor Vollhardt's research efforts focus on the development of transition metal mediated transformations that lead to novel molecules.  His efforts could positively impact materials, energy, and medical research.",

These structures have not only added fundamental knowledge to chemical science, but have also shown great promise in applications as next generation electronic materials and energy storage systems as well as in the expansion of methodology of organic synthesis.  \nThe advances have been diverse. Thus, the chemistry of a new class of hydrocarbons, the phenylenes, developed under this program has been probed, leading to the discovery of novel thermal reorganization pathways that offer an opportunity to generate new allotropes of graphene (the graphite single sheet; Nobel Prize 2010). In addition, novel derivatives containing nitrogen atoms have been constructed, which show promise in electronic device construction. A major advance has been the uncover of chemistry that converts phenylenes to polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons, notably phenacenes, of immense current interest because they feature as components of optoelectronic materials, as building blocks for the bottom-up assembly of novel carbon allotropes, as platforms for the construction of functional molecular assemblies, in biological studies of the metabolism of environmental pollutants, and as scaffolds in natural products synthesis (see Image 1).\nA second thrust has been the exploration of molecular materials for long-term solar storage, which has the potential to revolutionize both the domestic and global energy generation landscapes, resulting in reduced necessity for imported energy and diminished emissions related to traditionally generated energy. Current state-of-the-art technologies for harnessing solar energy are limited to photovoltaic and to solar-thermal conversion. Both generate highly fluctuating amounts of power, dependent on both times of day and weather patterns. In addition, the former suffers from a lack of efficiency and scalability. Both also require vast amounts of land area to generate useful amounts of power. To address these issues, novel organometallic molecules have been constructed which undergo thermally reversible photoisomerizations: in other words, they store sunlight in the form of more energetic isomers, from which heat can be derived on demand by eliciting reconversion to starting material, the essence of a rechargeable thermal battery (Images 2 and 3). A device has been completed and the potential for commercial exploitation is being scrutinized.\nFinally, several advances have been made in the application of cobalt catalysts in organic synthesis, enabling the unprecedented rapid construction of carbon frames that are part of physiologically active motifs, such as analgesics [e.g., a modified naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)], new potential antitumor agents, and synthetically useful building blocks for related frameworks.\nWhile this work constitutes basic science, it has potentially far-reaching implications in applications of benefit to society, namely the development of novel materials for the future and of methodology for the construction of novel drugs. This project has also been instrumental in the education, training, and professional and cultural development of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, including a sizeable number from underrepresented groups. These individuals have gone on to major institutions as PhD candidates, postdoctorals, teachers, industrial researchers, health scientists, and science policy makers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: K.
