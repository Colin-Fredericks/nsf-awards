This workshop is a sequel to an NSF-supported workshop with the Japanese held October 31 and November 1, 2008 in Palo Alto California. Both countries, through CISE/NSF and Japananese research funding agencies, have major research efforts in networking research and in infrastructure development to support research activities. For NSF the major efforts are NeTSE/NeTS/FIND, and GENI and other infrastructure development awards. For Japan the initiatives include AKARI, the Japan Gigabit Network (JGN2). Increasingly, our Nation depends on high speed networks for national defense, commerce, and for interactions among out citizens. Research is continually needed to lead to new technology to improve the bandwidth, efficiency, security, and reliability of the networks we do so much rely on. Cooperation with Japan will accelerate the development of advanced networking technologies.",
