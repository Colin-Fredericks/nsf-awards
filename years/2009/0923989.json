The East Coast Van Pool will be operated out of Delaware and the West Coast Van Pool will be operated out of the Oregon State University facilities. Both pools request funds to be utilized in support of National Science Foundation (NSF), Navy?s Office of Naval Research (ONR), United States Coast Guard (USCG) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) funded scientific research at sea. The pools will provide portable lab vans (general purpose, isotope, clean and cold) on vessels. They will charge a day rate to the institution or Agency based on the type of van requested and will be responsible for all shipping and maintenance of the vans and the storage/support facilities. \r\n \r\n",
