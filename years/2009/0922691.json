 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Edward J. McIntee, Kate Graham, Brian Johnson, Thomas Jones and Chris Schaller from the College of Saint Benedict will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer to support chemical research of faculty and their undergraduate research students.  Proposed research spans a number of areas in chemistry, including:   1) the synthesis and development of a biomarker for Benzo[a]pyrene exposure; 2) the development of low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors; 3) the synthesis of models for the trinuclear site in multicopper oxidases; 4)  the development of organometallic catalysts; 5) the study of natural products isolated from fungi; and 6) the study of alkynoic acid cyclization reactions.  The instrumentation will be available to chemistry students at the College of Saint Benedict (a women's college) as well as Saint Joseph's University, and other nearby institutions.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry.  Students receiving training with this instrumentation will be prepared for post-baccalaureate work in chemistry and for careers in science and technology.",
