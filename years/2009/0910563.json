Her goal is to 1) achieve linear scaling with small prefactors  in accurate molecular quantum mechanics by restructuring the algorithms used and 2) to increase the accuracy and efficiency of orbital free density functional theory (OFDFT), a method for condensed matter physics that was developed in the PI's group. \r\n\r\nThe methods that the PI and her interdisciplinary research group are developing can be used to study the energetics of combustion reactions involving very large molecules, including  molecules that are being considered as alternative fuel sources. The methods are also being developed to study many classes of technologically important materials such as semiconductors and insulators.  Women, members of under-represented minorities and undergraduate  students are involved in this research program",
