Nanoporous silicon is a unique material with several features that make it attractive for biological sensors, including a very high surface area to volume ratio, simple and inexpensive fabrication techniques, and suitability for integration with silicon electronics.  The proposed sensor is designed to measure small changes in the refractive index of porous silicon waveguides that occur when biological molecules attach to the internal surfaces.  In addition to the promise of improved sensitivity, this approach could be faster and less expensive than conventional techniques that require fluorescent labels.  As a target application, they will explore the possibility of detecting prions, the protein molecules responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.\r\nBeyond these intellectual goals, the project will also provide summer research opportunities for undergraduate students, mentoring for high-school students, and will promote multidisciplinary collaboration between chemists, biologists and optical engineers.\r\n",
