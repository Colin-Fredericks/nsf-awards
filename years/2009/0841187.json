Schrock for the study of MonoAlkoxide Pyrrolide (MAP) catalysts that contain molybdenum or tungsten.  MAP catalysts are very useful in olefin metathesis due to their unusually high reactivity and their ability to exploit the chirality of the metal center.  These catalysts are much more stable, long-lived and reactive than previous generations.  This research focuses on maximizing the subtle steric interactions of the ligand coordination sphere.  New heterogeneous catalysts are prepared by attachment to silica supports.  The high oxidation state chemistry of compounds containing multiple metal-carbon bonds has a significant impact on organic, polymer, pharmaceutical and materials chemistries both in academic and industrial settings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe chemistry supported by NSF grant CHE-0841187 concerns the synthesis and reactivity of catalysts for the olefin metathesis reaction that contain molybdenum (Mo) or tungsten (W).  A Nobel Prize was awarded in 2005 \"for the development of the metathesis method in organic synthesis.\"  Olefin metathesis is now used or is being considered for a wide variety of reactions in the chemical industry, and has had a major effect on the areas of polymer chemistry, pharmaceuticals, medicine, flavors and fragrances, and renewable resources, among others.  Ruthenium (Ru) catalysts have also been developed for olefin metathesis.  \n\nAt the time of the award there were still major problems to be solved.  One of the most important of those problems has been solved in the last three years.  This advance promises to push olefin metathesis to entirely new heights.  The advance can be traced to the unique behavior of Mo and W catalysts compared to ruthenium catalysts, which do not yield the same positive results.  A company was founded in October of 2010 that is devoted to promoting the considerable advantages of Mo and W catalysts compared to Ru catalysts.  Although there are still additional problems to be solved, the future of catalytic reactions based on olefin metathesis looks increasingly bright.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard R Schrock"
