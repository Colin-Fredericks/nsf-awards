Our vision continues to be to develop a model to strengthen science leadership at Tribal Colleges. The Cultivating Synergy in Science and Education program would expand on prior TCUP initiatives by cultivating scientific curiosity through collaborative undergraduate research and educational initiatives between mainstream Universities, Tribal Agencies and the K12 classroom. The project goals are as follows:\r\nGoal 1: Improve the quality of undergraduate STEM education through developing OLC faculty and educational resources with the purpose of delivering hands-on, place-based STEM instruction for undergraduate students\r\nGoal 2: Strengthen partnerships in within OLC, Tribal resource programs, and outside academic institutions\r\nGoal 3: Broaden the pipeline of future STEM undergraduates at OLC",
