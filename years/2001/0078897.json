 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an optimized prototype of the UNCOPIER-a chemical-free, energy-efficient, ACIM-based device designed to non-destructively deink laser-xerographic prints one sheet at a time.  Acoustic Coaxing Induced Microcavitation (ACIM) is a novel, chemical-free, and energy-efficient process which uses only \"Silent Sound and Clean Water.\"  Underlying ACIM's energy efficiency is microcavitation's ability to concentrate an enormous amount of energy on an extremely small (i.e. sub-microscopic) point.  These controlled concentrations of energy result in nearly spontaneous cleaning which does not hurt the substrate. ACIM is the ideal technology for deploying energy exactly at the point of use.\r\n\r\nUNCOPIER technology will revolutionize the paper recycling industry in a number of ways, as well as innovation in the recycling process itself.  Since the UNCOPIER leaves the deInked paper immaculately white and undamaged, it will save environmental resources by making it possible to manufacture new print grade paper from the recycled laser-xerographic prints.  The UNCOPIER is being developed as an office machine to advocate a pioneer method for recycling paper-at-source deinking, \"one sheet at a time.\"  DeInking paper prior to recycling protects confidentiality.   This novel approach will appeal to banks, hospitals, law firms, government agencies, and other institutions interested in recycling, but also concerned with safeguarding confidentiality.  The UNCOPIER system will reduce recycling costs and enables vital commercial motivations for its improved recycling endeavors.  \r\n",
