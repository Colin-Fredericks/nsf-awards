The goals of the project are to provide students with a meaningful independent research opportunity that may stimulate pursuit of graduate study and a career in environmental biology. The program is designed to expose students to the range of scientific career opportunities and to offer preparation and encouragement for pursuit of those opportunities. The program explicitly incorporates multicultural perspectives into the research theme in order to enhance cross-cultural competence in the academic community. The unifying theme of the program is Biodiversity Conservation. Through a 2-year sequence of seminars, field research and opportunities for international travel, students will gain expertise in the concepts, skills and career opportunities in the science of biodiversity.\r\n\r\nBiodiversity research is recognized as a critical area of investigation by federal and international agencies.  The accelerating rate of species loss and the increasing impact of humans on global ecosystems provides urgency to the complex task of conserving biodiversity. All over the world, conservation biologists and policy makers are realizing the importance of incorporating local and indigenous knowledge into conservation efforts. Cross-cultural competence thus becomes an important component of functioning effectively in the global scientific community.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
