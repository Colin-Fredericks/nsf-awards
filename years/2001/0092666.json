Mechanical strain induced in processing and service of the devices has wide ranging effects on functional properties from the atomic scale up to the continuum scale.  This CAREER program will develop coupled mechanics, physics, and materials models to address these multiscale phenomena.  Computational and analytical methods will be used to study the following problems: (i) defect and interfacial strain effects on electronic structure in optoelectronic materials, (ii) mismatch strain effects in arrays of self-assembled quantum dots, and (iii) process strain-induced curvature in thin, free standing optical MEMS devices.  The research program will be complemented by a comprehensive educational plan, with the goal of motivating students to study micro- and nanomechanics.  A freshman level mini-course in nanomechanics will be instituted as part of the Intro to Engineering series in the College of Engineering.  A journal club for students of all levels interested in micro- and nanomechanics will be organized.  A student chapter of the Materials Research Society will be founded and will allow students to take advantage of the proximity of the University to the fall annual meeting held each year in Boston.\r\n***",
