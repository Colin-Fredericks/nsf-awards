 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves continued research on the geometric,\r\nprobabilistic and combinatorial aspects of functional analysis and\r\nconvexity theory, with particular attention to noncommutative objects and\r\nphenomena.  While most of the problems considered in the project have\r\nmotivation in other fields of mathematical sciences, they are typically\r\nexpressed in the language of local or finite dimensional geometry of Banach\r\nspaces and/or analyzed using the methods prevalent in that area.  Sample\r\nresearch topics include:  entropy of linear operators and duality of such\r\nentropy, structural properties of high-dimensional convex bodies, various\r\nanalytic and geometric questions related to random matrices, some problems\r\nin the  \"local\" operator theory, Gaussian correlation of convex sets,\r\nconcentration phenomenon in the noncommutative context and some geometric\r\nquestions related to free and quantum information theories.\r\n\r\n\r\n        On an elementary level,  Analysis is a study of  functions,  or\r\nrelationships  between quantities and the parameters on which they depend.\r\nAs it happens,  very many naturally appearing relationships are linear or\r\nat least convex.   Thus,  a good understanding of convex functions and,\r\nconsequently, of convex sets is a prerequisite for understanding those\r\nrelationships. The number of free parameters in the underlying problem can\r\noften be related to the dimension of sets in the corresponding mathematical\r\nmodel.  Since real-life problems usually do depend on very many parameters,\r\nthe high-dimensional setting is of particular interest.  This is exactly\r\nthe domain of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis, which studies quantitative\r\nproperties of convex sets as the dimension goes to infinity.  It\r\nconstitutes a fertile middle ground between the classical Functional\r\nAnalysis and the classical Geometry.  Functional Analysis is usually\r\nconcerned with the infinite-dimensional setting  (which frequently is an\r\nidealization of a very large dimension), but it often provides only\r\nqualitative information.  On the other hand,  Geometry typically yields\r\nvery precise information for a specific not-too-large dimension.  For the\r\nlast two decades or so the asymptotic theory has been quite successful in\r\nidentifying and exploiting \"approximate\" symmetries of various problems\r\nthat escaped the earlier \"too qualitative\" or \"too rigid\" methods. (This\r\nled, among others, to the discovery of many links to Computer Science.)\r\nFinally, to explain our interest in noncommutativity we point out that it\r\nsimply reflects the fact that the final outcome of a process may depend on\r\nthe order of operations involved;  the best known, but by far not the only\r\nmanifestation of that principle is quantum mechanics.\r\n",
