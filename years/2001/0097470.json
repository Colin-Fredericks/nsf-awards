 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a three-year REU Site in Biomechanics and Imaging (RUBI) at the University of Rochester, under the direction of Dr. Amy Lerner.  The objective of this program is to provide research experiences for 10 undergraduate students interested in biomechanical and imaging aspects of biomedical engineering during a 10-week summer program.  Opportunities will be provided in at least ten different laboratories on the university campus, including the School of Medicine and Dentistry, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a Movement Analysis Lab affiliated with the Ithaca College Physical Therapy Progam.  An educational program of weekly seminars and laboratory tours will be developed to broaden the exposure provided to include a wide range of biomechanical and imaging research tools as well as information about careers in biomedical engineering research.  The eudcational program will also provide a framework for interactions between multiple faculty mentors, advisors and participating students.  Progress on research will be reported informally to faculty mentors and the other REU participants throughout the summer, and will culminate in a research poster session during the last week of the program.  To broaden the impact of this program local high school teachers will be invited to attend to learn more about the nature of biomedical engineering research and education.  Reporting and evaluation of the program will be handled largely through web pages dedicated to the program.",
