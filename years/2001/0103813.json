 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is proposed on the following topics:\r\n1. Breakup of liquid jets: This research will mathematically analyze\r\n   the capillary breakup of jets of Newtonian and viscoelastic liquids. The effect\r\n   of polymer additives in suppressing breakup is well known and exploited both\r\n   in nature (spider webs) and in technology (control of drops sizes in spraying\r\n   of liquids). The research will concentrate on the asymptotics of breakup and\r\n   compare various constitutive theories.\r\n2. Stability of viscoelastic flows: Elastic instabilities have been\r\n   investigated extensively over the past ten years. Such instabilities often\r\n   pose limits for polymer processing conditions. In the numerical investigation\r\n   of instabilities in complex flows, continuous spectra which are poorly resolved\r\n   pose a significant challenge. The research is aimed at using analytical \r\n   techniques to determine the location of these continuous spectra.\r\n3. Shape control in elasticity: An elastic medium is controlled by\r\n   actuators which can supply a stress of a given type. The research will \r\n   investigate the question whether such controls can achieve a given shape of\r\n   the medium.\r\n4. Numerical simulation of two-fluid flows: The research will continue\r\n   work on simulation of flows of two liquids using a volume of fluid code. The\r\n   following three problems will be investigated:\r\n   a) Formation of ``staircase\" structures on impacting drops due to\r\n      capillary waves.\r\n   b) Tipstreaming in drop breakup under shear when surfactants are\r\n      present.\r\n   c) Effect of normal stresses on breakup of viscoelastic drops under\r\n      shear.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research addresses fundamental issues which arise in the processing and\r\nuse of polymeric liquids, the control of deformations of elastic solids and the\r\nformation of emulsions by shear mixing. The proposed topics include a comparison of\r\nthe qualitative behavior various models of polymeric fluids in jet breakup, the\r\nstability of polymeric flows, the question which shapes of an elastic medium can\r\nbe achieved by a given type of control, and the development of numerical methods for\r\ntwo-fluid flows.\r\n\r\n",
