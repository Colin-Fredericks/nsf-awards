 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Professor Samuel Gilman of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  The primary focus of this research is the use of capillary electrophoresis for the study of aggregated proteins.  Both laser light scattering and fluorescence detection will be utilized.  There is a substantial scientific and biomedical interest in the fundamental aspects of protein self-assembly and aggregation.  A model system of amyloid proteins will be studied.  The educational component involves the creative use of animated tutorials (created by senior students) for the education of junior students.  These internet and CD based tutorials will be widely disseminated and will enhance student education.\r\n\r\nProtein aggregation and self-assembly are known to occur during normal and disease state biological functions.  Abnormal protein aggregation is implicated in aging and in neurological disorders.  The research includes components of instrument design and fundamental chemical studies on separations of compounds with biomedical relevance.\r\n\r\n",
