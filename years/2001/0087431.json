 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allmendinger\r\n0087431\r\nThe Atacama fault zone can be traced for nearly 1000 km in the \r\nforearc of the Central Andes.  The northern terminus of the fault zone \r\noccurs just south of Iquique, Chile, in a series of complex blocks \r\nbounded by strike-slip, thrust, and normal faults.  Digital topography \r\nproduced from satellite radar imagery shows that this area is one of \r\nthe most tectonically active parts of the entire fault system.  The \r\narea overlies the general region where the Iquique ridge on the Nazca \r\nplate is being subducted beneath South America, and correlates well \r\nwith a seismic gap in the Benioff zone that many seismologists \r\nbelieve will be the site of the next major earthquake on this plate \r\nboundary.  We are dating these young faults using Ar/Ar and Uranium \r\nseries isotopic methods, and are also studying their kinematics using \r\nmeasurements of slip directions on the well-exposed faults.  These \r\nfield data are being combined and analyzed in a map view block \r\nrestoration program developed at the Universite de Rennes (France), \r\nwhich will allow us to quantify the strain and rotation in the \r\nregion.  Then, we can evaluate block rotation versus oroclinal bending \r\nhypotheses spurred by paleomagnetic data, as well as investigate the \r\norigin of proposed arc parallel compression.  Finally, our fieldwork \r\nand digital elevation model provides a well-documented \"before\" \r\npicture to compare to the \"after\" picture to be obtained following \r\nthe next great earthquake along this plate boundary, site of the \r\nlargest earthquake on record.  Thus, eventually we will be able to \r\ndocument how the forearc of a major ocean continent convergence \r\nsystem deforms during Benioff zone seismicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
