 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI intends to continue the study of singularities of nonlinear heat\r\nequations in differential geometry and mathematical physics, such as The\r\nRicci flow, Harmonic Map flow, Mean curvature flow, and the Porous medium\r\nequation. Possible singularities will be analyzed by means of matched\r\nasymptotic expansions.\r\n    In addition to this the PI hopes to continue his collaboration with\r\ngroups in medical imaging, serving at least as a source of theoretic\r\nknowledge for such groups and perhaps collaborating more intensely.\r\n\r\nNonlinear diffusion equations occur in many forms in mathematical physics\r\nand engineering, as well as in pure mathematics (differential geometry).\r\nUnderstanding of the solutions to such equations can be gained by studying\r\ntheir singularities. E.g. singularities of a solution to an equation\r\nmodeling a chemical reaction in a reactor may correspond to explosion as\r\nopposed to steady reaction. The PI intends to study such singularities.\r\n    In addition, the PI intends to continue his collaboration with a\r\nresearch group in Medical Imaging. The practical problems of how to\r\nautomatically process 3D fMRI images all belong to a branch of mathematics\r\ncalled differential geometry. A detailed knowledge of differential geometry\r\nhas proved to be very useful in medical imaging in the past, and promisses\r\nto stay important. Conversely, medical imaging problems may serve as a\r\nsource of new mathematical problems and theories.\r\n\r\n",
