 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance of graphic processors is outpacing the performance of general processors, in fact cubing the growth curve. It has been recently shown that some graphics algorithms can be performed in new ways on the graphics processor, using a novel technique known as multipass programming. Multipass programming treats the graphics processor as a SIMD processor acting on a data array stored in the screen's pixels, with each operation applied as an image-processing pass. The proposed research will extend this concept further not only within the graphics community, but also for the scientific computing and general computing communities, by developing a multipass programming language general enough to support both graphical and non-graphical programs. Existing problems of numerical range and precision will be overcome, and the fidelity of the resulting numerical implementations analyzed.\r\n\r\nWork in multipass algorithms for procedural shading will be continued our, and multipass programming applied to radiosity and physically-based animation. Multipass programming will also be extended to applications outside of computer graphics, including solving linear systems, the finite element method and computational fluid dynamics.\r\n\r\nIf graphics processors continue to grow at the current rate, they will attain a four teraflop performance at the end of the proposed funding period. During this growth period a library of programming techniques and applications that will harness this otherwise untapped source of high-performance computing power will be developed. The result will be richer graphics, more realistic virtual environments, more natural simulated motion, and the ability to perform sophisticated supercomputing simulations on consumer-level personal computers.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
