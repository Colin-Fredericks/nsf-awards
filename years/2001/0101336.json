Historically, the two conferences, which have considerable technical overlap, have both been held in June.  In recent years travel restrictions have increasingly forced individuals whose technical areas are covered by both conferences to choose between them.  PPPS-2001, therefore, is an experiment by the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society, the parent organization for both conferences, to determine the viability of holding these conferences jointly on a regular basis.  PPPS-2001 is scheduled for June 18-22, 2001 at Rio Suite Hotel in Las Vegas, NV.\r\n\r\nThis project requests travel support to defray the travel expenses for young investigators whose papers have been selected for presentation at the Conference, but who lack funds and might not be able to attend without travel support.  It is proposed that the PPPS-2001 Student Grants Committee, in collaboration with the Technical Program Committee, select those to receive the support.  The total amount requested is $6,000 on the basis of an average travel grant of $500 for 12 participants.\r\n",
