 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for acquisition of a MALDI/reflectron time-of-flight mass\r\nspectrometer system. This system will be used for studies of  protein structure and function by a broad range of investigators including seven faculty and students in the departments Biophysics, Biology, Chemistry and Pharmacy on the main campus of the University. The system will provide the required resolution and mass accuracy to support applications in peptide mapping for identification and searching of modification sites in protein digests, and for studying various protein-protein and protein-drug interactions. A high mass detector will permit monitoring of proteins as a function of cellular processes, protein-drug studies and for verifying sequences obtained by peptide mapping.  \r\nMass spectrometry is a widely-used, critical technology in the study of protein structure and function, sometimes referred to  proteomics.  In addition to the group of seven major users, at 13 other investigators will benefit from the availability of the MALDI-TOF device. Many of these investigators currently rely on instruments in local industry or in private laboratories for their research. The new instrument will be located in the mass spectrometry facility in the Chemistry Department and will accessible for use by investigators from other departments.  In addition to its use in research, the instrument will be used in graduate and postdoctoral training of a large number of students, including as many as 50 students and post-doctoral trainees in the major users laboratories, plus a large number of other students, including undergraduates, in these and other laboratories.\r\n",
