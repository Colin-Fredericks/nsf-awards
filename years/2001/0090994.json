 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary focus of this project is upon the problem of how the functions of biological macromolecules are governed by their structures. The research plan focuses upon this problem in the context of RNA enzymes (or ribozymes), with the hope of discovering the properties of biological catalysis that are so fundamental that they are shared by all enzymes, whether composed of RNA or protein. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a fundamental understanding of how biological catalysts function, be they proteins or RNA.\r\n\r\nTwo catalytic RNA systems will be investigated using both static and time-resolved X-ray crystallography to elucidate their structural properties and reaction mechanisms. These, in order of increasing complexity, include the hairpin ribozyme, and RNase P. The hammerhead ribozyme structure has been solved and time-resolved crystallographic experiments have been initiated.  The more complex ribozymes have been crystallized and will be used in static and time-resolved crystallography in an effort to elucidate their reaction mechanisms. The principle objectives of this research are: (1) to determine the three-dimensional structure of the hairpin ribozyme, and to initiate determination of the structures of reaction intermediates of hairpin ribozyme cleavage and ligation using the techniques developed for the hammerhead ribozyme; and (2) to initiate determination of the three-dimensional structure of RNase P.. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the principles of catalysis that enable RNA molecules to be enzymes. This knowledge will lead to the understanding of how the three-dimensional structure of an RNA enzyme determines its catalytic properties. By learning how RNA enzymes work, this project will discover what properties are so fundamental to biological catalysts that they are invariant with respect to both RNA and protein enzymes.\r\n",
