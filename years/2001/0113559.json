 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program supports California Polytechnic State University with the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope with electron backscatter diffraction capabilities. The research that will utilize the equipment spans the disciplines of soil science, tribology, biomaterials, thin film science, metal-joining technology and the development of intermetallic alloys. The instrument will be used in undergraduate and Master's-level -science and engineering research and education programs. The goal is to expand the research opportunities for undergraduates, enhance the current courses and laboratories, seed a greater awareness of the benefits of materials research within industry and expand the opportunities for professional development of the faculty.  This will be accomplished using four mechanisms: (1) Well-structured, yearlong research teams that target involving 50% females and 50% males; (2) Short-term industry-related projects aimed at promoting research for \"real-world\" challenges; (3) Senior-level and Master's-level research projects based on individual faculty research interests; and (4) Laboratory experiments incorporated into the curriculum for the purpose of educating the students on the use of an increasingly important materials characterization tool. \r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program supports California Polytechnic State University with the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope with electron backscatter diffraction capabilities.
