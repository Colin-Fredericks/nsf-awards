This NSF MRI project presents an innovative concept of a six-axis magnetically levitated (maglev) instrument.  This novel instrument can be a fundamental research tool in many crucial research activities in nanotechnology and other precision applications dealing with delicate motions and forces.  They include manufacture of nanoscale structures, atomic-level manipulation, assembly and packaging of microparts, vibration isolation for instrumentation, and seismic motion detection.  A compact, lightweight, single-moving part that holds the specimen will eventually be magnetically levitated in all six degrees of freedom.  The objective of this MRI project is development of a maglev prototype design concept and to demonstrate its applicability in nanotechnology.\r\n\r\n          Magnetic levitation is an enabling technology for high-precision multi-axis motion generation and control.  During the first year of this instrument development program, we will derive a dynamic model and analyze mechanical and electromagnetic characteristics.  After completing detailed design, we will construct a single-axis unit lenear actuator, compare its behavior with the theory, and calibrate it experimentally.  This unit actuator will be a corner stone for the full 6-axis instrument to be constructed by the end of the second year.  During the last year of this MRI project, we will design and implement real-time digital controllers based on the dynamic model obtained previously, and perform various tests and experiments.",
