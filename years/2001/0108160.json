 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will perform a study of acceleration and transport of energetic ions in the heliosphere via energetic neutral atoms (ENA) by comparing observation with simulation. The study encompasses the heliosphere and its immediate interstellar environment. The main effort is to continue development of simulations of the production of ENA by the dominant ion populations of the anomalous cosmic rays (ACR) at and beyond the termination shock of the solar wind and of the corotating interactions regions (CIR) in the inner heliosphere. Previously, the investigators have shown that the use of energetic neutral atoms (ENA) in the study of space plasma can provide the needed global view of the distribution of energetic charged particles in the entire heliosphere, especially in regions not easily accessible to space missions. The approach complements all existing in situ investigations. Simulating the production of ENA requires modeling the parent ion population. Modeling of the ion populations needs understanding of ion acceleration and transport as well as the ambient magnetic-field configuration. Comparing simulated distribution of ENA with the observed, then, provides a self-consistent global view of ion acceleration and transport. The main goals of the research are more realistic ACR and CIR simulations, simulation of production of ENA by other inner heliospheric ion populations, and simulation of production of energetic helium atoms in ACR, CIR and other populations. Since the University of Arizona is a student-centered research university, the project will involve the participation of one undergraduate and one graduate student.",
