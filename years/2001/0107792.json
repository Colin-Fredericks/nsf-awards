The Principal Investigator proposes to study and \r\nfurther develop a recent construction that give invariants \r\nfor closed oriented 3-manifolds and a related construction  \r\nthat give invariants for smooth closed oriented 4-manifolds. \r\nThese constructions use handle decompositions and a version\r\nof Lagrangian Floer-homology. The PI will also study \r\napplications of these new techniques in 3 and 4-manifold \r\ntopology. In particular PI will study these invariants for three-manifolds that fiber over a circle and symplectic \r\n4-manifolds.\r\n\r\nGauge theory is a very important technique in smooth \r\n4-manifold theory.  It involves the theory of Donaldson \r\ninvariants and Seiberg-Witten invariants. These invariants \r\nare constructed by solving certain elliptic partial differential equations inspired by mathematical physics. Both constructions \r\nhave ramifications for three-manifolds as well, these\r\nare related to solving the partial differential equations \r\nover four-manifolds with a three-dimensional boundary. \r\nIn addition to studying these invariants the Principal \r\nInvestigator also proposes to study in detail a third \r\nconstruction that involves holomorphic disks and a \r\ndecomposition of the manifold into elementary pieces.\r\n",
