 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) \r\nThe purpose of the project is to extend the curriculum reform and the use of computer technology to introductory courses into linear algebra, differential equations, and statistics. The curriculum reform involves a thorough revision and restructure of the three courses and includes the adaptation and implementation of appropriate material for computer-based instruction and extended student projects in these areas. Several programs are adapted and implemented into the curriculum, e.g., the Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group Recommendations for the First Course in Linear Algebra developed by D. Carlson, C.R. Johnson, D.C. Lay and A.D. Porter, the ODE project developed at Boston University, and ActivStats developed by P. Velleman. Per year, these three courses are offered in 35 sections of about 40 students each, with a campus-wide total enrollment of more than 1300 students. To serve these students, a 40-seat classroom laboratory is constructed with networked workstations and audiovisual equipment. About half of the time, this laboratory is used for in-class instruction, while, the remaining time, students work on computer-based projects, often in a collaborative environment. Graduate teaching assistants who are carefully trained in the relevant software and its use in the specific areas staff the laboratory. Workshops for faculty development and graduate student training are designed and offered on a regular basis. These workshops have an important impact on the mathematics education for pre-service and in-service teachers in the region. Materials and results are disseminated both electronically and through publication and presentation. The success of the project is monitored through a variety of fine-tuned evaluation and assessment instruments.\r\n",
