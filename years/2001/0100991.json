 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project of Professor Shokurov. The project\r\nis focused on the finite generatedness of algebras--\r\na fundamental problem of algebra. The work proposed is \r\nto resolve the problem in a certain important class of\r\nalgebras (named (FGA)) with the aim to finish the proof \r\nof the existence of log flips in any dimension \r\nwhenever the Log Minimal Model Program (LMMP) \r\nand, in particular, the log terminations hold in \r\nthe lower dimensions. To apply this inductive step \r\nto the LMMP in dimensions higher than 4\r\nthe principal investigator intends to finish the log termination \r\nfor 4-folds. This gives the 5-fold log flips, and establishes \r\nthe LMMP in dimension 4. A concrete application of this technique\r\nwill be done by his student, Jihun Park, in his study of birational \r\ngeometry of Del Pezzo fibre spaces, with a view to their existence, \r\nuniqueness of their certain models, and to the birational classification. \r\n\r\nThis is research in the field of algebra with methods and applications \r\nin algebraic geometry. The finite generatedness corresponds to\r\ncompleteness in geometry, and effectiveness from the computational point \r\nof view. Algebra and algebraic geometry are very old, traditional areas of \r\nmodern mathematics, but which have had a revolutionary flowering in \r\nthe past century. In its origin, algebraic geometry\r\ntreated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest\r\nequations, namely polynomials, or be given in the 3-space by the simplest\r\ngeometric constructions, e. g., conic sections.\r\nAlgebra is about these equations. Both fields interacts with most of \r\nbranches of mathematics, e.g., analysis, topology and\r\nmathematical physics, with applications in those\r\nfields as well as in number theory, physics, theoretical computer science,\r\nand robotics.\r\n",
