 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) \r\nImmunology is an exciting discipline that has been at the forefront of modern biological research. Twenty five Nobel Prizes have been awarded in Immunology in the past century which is a testament to the rapid rate at which our understanding of Immunology advances. Thus, immunology teachers must continually stay abreast of new developments and incorporate them into their lecture and laboratory curricula. The Immunology course at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse (UW-L) contains a laboratory based primarily on traditional antigen-antibody interactions. The PI of this project has been very successful at modifying existing exercises so that they are more inquiry based and emphasize quantitative skills, critical thinking and student design of experiments. Although much of the explosive growth in knowledge and methodologies in immunology has been in cellular aspects of the science, laboratory exercises that focus on cellular immunology are lacking. The objectives of this project are 1) to implement a series of cellular immunology exercises in the UW-L Immunology course and 2) to design inquiry based experiments. Exercises that are being developed provide students the opportunity to design, carry out, and analyze experiments on T cell proliferation, cloning and screening of hybridomas to produce monoclonal antibodies, and flow cytometric analysis of cells of the immune system. These curricular changes are intended to enhance students' ability to design experiments using modern technology, enhance their quantitative and computer skills, and provide them with experience in methods widely used in biological research and medical diagnostics. The experiments also aim to enhance students' understanding of important concepts of cellular immunology presented in the lecture component of the course. The new laboratory investigations are an adaptation of and reflect recent trends in the clinical and research aspects of immunology, and are modeled pedagogically after contemporary science education literature . The PI has a strong track record in designing inquiry-based laboratory exercises, and has extensive research experience in cellular immunology, but requires additional equipment to accomplish these objectives. This project impacts a large target audience as Immunology is required by all Microbiology and Medical Laboratory Science majors and is a popular elective for Biology/Biomedical majors. It is the highest enrollment upper lever course in the Microbiology Department at UW-L with enrollments of 80-120 students per year. This projects is serving as a model for other faculty in the Department and University as they move toward more inquiry-based laboratories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
