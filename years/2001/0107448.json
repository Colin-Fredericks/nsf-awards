The purpose is to advance the interdisciplinary state of the art in the synthesis and characterization of particles and also in particle-based materials synthesis.  These challenges involve most often processes at the nanoscale range, e.g. self-assembly, templating or force field approaches.  Three plenary speakers of international recognition have been chosen from the disciplines of engineering, chemistry and physics.  Approximately 180 specialists have accepted invitations to speak in a series of symposia which shall focus on basic particle processes, on materials, pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, etc...80 more papers have been contributed for oral presentation.  Two poster sessions will enable still more people to share their concepts and results.  A very detailed listing of titles and speakers is available and kept up to date through the webside \"nanopaarticles.org\".  \r\nThe focus on the role of nanoparticles in such areas as advanced materials, particle formation and characterization seems to be enough of a discipline overlap to generate an interdisciplinary stimulus. \r\n",
