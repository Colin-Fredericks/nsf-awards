 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to partially support the Fifth North American Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability, sponsored by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. The primary objective is to provide a venue for interaction among new researchers in statistics and probability. The conference will take place from July 31 - August 3, 2001, on the Georgia Institute of Technology campus in Atlanta, Georgia, just prior to the annual Joint Statistical Meetings to be held in Atlanta. Participants will include approximately 50 statisticians and probabilists who have received their Ph.D. within 5 years of the conference or who expect to receive their Ph.D. within 1 year of the conference. Presentations by 4 senior speakers and roundtable discussions on the processes of publishing and grant funding (with participants from NSA, NSF, ONR, and NIH) are also part of the schedule.",
