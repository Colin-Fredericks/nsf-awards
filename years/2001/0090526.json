The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0082).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nFisk University; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL); Coherent Technologies Incorporated (CTI)\r\n\r\nProposed Activities\r\nFisk University will grow crystals; LLNL will evaluate the crystals; CTI will build the laser systems.\r\n\r\nProposed Innovation\r\nThe primary application for these laser devices is as transmitters for eyesafe active remote sensors.  These sensors are used for a variety of commercial applications including pollution monitoring, atmospheric trace gas monitoring and meteorological studies and wind sensing (lidar systems for aircraft to detect clear air turbulence).  CTI has a proposed plan to obtain funding for development of markets for future developments with these laser materials.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe proposal does not assess the economic impact, although the potential applications and companies that could participate in the marketing of the products are identified.  The primary applications for these lasers is as transmitters for eyesafe active remote sensors used for pollution monitoring, atmospheric trace gas monitoring, meteorological studies, and wind sensing (clear air turbulence).  The potential applications range from aircraft safety to air quality and pollution monitoring and control.  Education of African American students, especially in engineering is another strong benefit to society.\r\n\r\nPotential Societal Impact\r\nThe technology will contribute to public safety, air pollution monitoring etc.  In addition, the number of African Americans with both undergraduate and graduate degrees will increase.  The strength of the research and education of this institution will be increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
