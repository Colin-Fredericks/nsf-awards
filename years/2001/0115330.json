 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a simulation tool, validated by experiments, capable of predicting the evolution of key microstructural characteristics in Al-Mg-Si alloys during hot bulk forming. New models and simulation tools will be developed and used to model the phenomena the govern the evolution of the microstructure during hot forming. Carefully designed and controlled experiments will be used for model calibration and validation.  Al-Mg-Si alloys are among the most common materials used in aerospace, construction and automotive industries. The ability to predict final microstructure, and therefore mechanical properties, in a final aluminum part that results from a controlled deformation process is extremely important for the US aluminum industry and its customers. This work will guide process designers to design processes that are lower in cost and produce aluminum products with improved material characteristics. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will benefit aluminum producers and their customers, may have a positive environmental impact, and will contribute to the advanced training of engineers. The research will lead to a better understanding of the way Al-Mg-Si alloys behave during forming and could lead to the design of new forming processes resulting in improved material properties at lower cost. This would make it more economical to use aluminum components in automobiles, for example, which would result in lighter weight vehicles, and thus improved fuel efficiency. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will participate in the research, and the results will be widely disseminated.\r\n\r\n",
