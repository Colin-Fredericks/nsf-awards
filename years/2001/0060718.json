 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the electron emission behavior of aligned nanotubes coated conformal coating of nanocrystalline diamond.  Carbon nanotubes and nanocrystalline diamond has recently attracted attention due to their promising electronic and structure properties.  Due to the aligned structure and electrical properties of nanotubes and the negative electron affinity of the wide band gap of diamond it is expected that diamond coated aligned nanotubes could be ideal\r\nmaterials for highly efficient electron sources.  It is proposed to produce aligned nanotubes with varied growth density, develop and coat with conformal coating of nanocrystalline diamond, and to characterize these novel materials for electron emission behavior. These results will be compared to existing and developmental emitters.  The proposed approach if successful can be applied to produce large flat panel displays\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nFlat panel displays are becoming increasingly important in today's society.  With the demand for portability in such applications as laptop computers, automobiles navigation system, cellular telephones, pagers, etc., the market for flat panel displays is growing rapidly. A low cost scaleable technology of efficient emitter urgently needed.  Aligned nanotubes coated with diamond can the breakthrough needed.",
