 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exponentially increasing multimedia information content has become a problem at the\r\nheart of modern communication networks. This is a paradigm shift from traditional com-\r\nmunication networks, where the primary function is information transmission, and where\r\nquality of service improvements are attainable through better dimensioning of bandwidth\r\nand switching resources. However, in networks where information storage plays a central\r\nrole, major improvements in quality of service can not be successful without the help of\r\ncaching, prefetching and/or mirroring of information. It can be argued that even if an\r\nunlimited amount of free bandwidth were available, the concentration of information on a\r\nsmall number of servers would cause server overloads, resulting in unacceptable download\r\nlatencies.\r\n      This general problem has created the explosion of research studies that are to be found\r\nin the network systems engineering literature on Web caching. Although this work has\r\ncontributed important engineering solutions, much of it is ad hoc and informal. Indeed, in\r\nthe large literature on caching research, it is rare to find papers dealing with mathematical\r\nfoundations, especially those underpinning stochastic models. Also, one rarely finds proofs in\r\na rigorous setting of nontrivial stochastic or average-case properties of caching structures and\r\nalgorithms. It is our thesis here that more systematic approaches are needed. This proposal\r\ndescribes a project to meet this need; more generally, we outline a systematic treatment\r\nthat focuses on fundamental design issues, one that, in dealing with these issues, integrates\r\nexperimentation, analysis and statistical measurements.\r\n      Network cache design objectives are reductions in access latency, traffic congestion, and\r\nserver loads. These objectives can be attained only through a thoughtful design that ad-\r\ndresses many important and challenging research topics. Some of the fundamental questions\r\nthat remain without definitive answers include: dynamic caching and caching with expiration\r\ntimes; design and analysis of easily implemented heuristic algorithms; impact of locality in\r\nrequest sequences on caching performance; caching and prefetching in low bandwidth access\r\nenvironments, with a special emphasis on wireless Web accesses; cache allocation and sizing\r\nproblems; and Web-graph performance modeling. Extending the knowledge base and deep-\r\nening our insight into these and several other equally fundamental caching system design\r\nproblems is the main theme of this proposal. The ultimate goal is to utilize this improved\r\nknowledge base to develop an experimental testbed for achieving practically feasible and\r\nefficient network caching systems.\r\n      The inherent complexity of the research topics identified here, and the network caching\r\nproblem as a whole, necessarily call into play all available research tools. Thus, methodologi-\r\ncally, the scope of the proposed research ranges from mathematical modeling and analysis to\r\nstatistical measurements and experimentation. The impact of our results, by their interdis-\r\nciplinary nature, will not just be limited to designing multimedia network caching systems,\r\nbut will potentially lead to improved problem solving techniques in related fields of computer\r\nalgorithms, software engineering, probability theory, and operations research.",
