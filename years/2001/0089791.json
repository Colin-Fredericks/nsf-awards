They will conduct comparative US-France studies of resource allocation in scientific institutions and impact on research productivity. The objective is to test a simulation model and understand its econometric properties, using data from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  These two organizations use different resource allocation systems to support research and scientific institutions. In addition to this project, the investigators will continue their studies on the econometrics of investment and the heterogeneity of behavior of US and French manufacturing firms.  The US and French investigators have complementary expertise.  Hall and Mairesse will focus on the econometrics of investments; and all four investigators will work on the comparative studies of resource allocation and productivity of scientific institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators and graduate students.  CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers to the United States. \r\n",
