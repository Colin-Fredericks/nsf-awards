 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) Opportunity Program is designed to provide an innovative pathway for academically talented, low- income students to enter an educational track in computer science, engineering, or technology; graduate with an associate degree, transfer to four-year colleges, or directly enter the workforce. This is being accomplished through the implementation of a structured mechanism that moves students through critical junctures in the educational process. With an inclusive team of educators, industrialists, scientists, and concerned public officials, the project is using the following goals to guide an educational path for continuing excellence: \r\n1) To include diverse student groups who are academically- talented and low- income into the National Science Foundation's Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship Program. \r\n2) To build a coalition of scientists, educators, and concerned industrialists, with the purpose of enhancing the degree of active participation and success of CSEMS students. \r\n3) To institute an inclusive student support services system that enhances each learner's rate of active persistence, continuing scholarly performances, appropriate placement in four- year colleges and/ or employment, and overall satisfaction with college experiences. \r\n4) To enhance the degree of student- college \"fit\", and therefore academic survival and success, of the first- time and full- time enrollees in CSEMS Opportunity Program. \r\n5) To establish a continuous system of documenting the impact of the CSEMS program in assisting students to successfully achieve desired outcomes.",
