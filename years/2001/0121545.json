 "awd_abstract_narration": "To facilitate research and education in Green's functions and their applications, this project is developing an education-oriented digital library focusing on Green's functions and their applications - the Green's Functions Research and Education Enhancement Network (GREEN). GREEN will serve undergraduate, graduate and professional education user communities and support Green's functions research and application development in academia and industry. The project is providing an integrated learning environment and set of digital resources for science, mathematics, engineering and technology education (SMETE) and is aggregating and organizing learning materials related to Green's functions and their applications. This project has two primary objectives. The first objective is to implement a solution for transforming and expanding the existing digital resources of an on-line collaborative work group (the National Institute of Standards and Technology Green's Functions Working Group or NIST-GFWG) from a loose collection of useful digital resources to an NSDL-SMETE digital library. The second objective is to enhance the educational value of the proposed NSDL-SMETE library by applying an education-oriented metadata schema (Learning Object Metadata schema from the IEEE Learning Technology Standards Committee) to the collection and coupling that schema with a quality assurance process and support tool that will provide for the continual evolution and refinement of the collection materials during their lifecycle. Significant co-funding of this project is being provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences in recognition of the emphasis on collections in the area of Green's functions represented in this work.\r\n",
