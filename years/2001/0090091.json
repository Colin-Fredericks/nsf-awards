 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of projects in theoretical gravitational physics will be\r\ncompleted. In the first set, issues pertaining to black holes will be\r\nanalyzed using a new paradigm, introduced recently by Ashtekar's\r\ngroup.  In particular, physical information will be extracted from\r\nnumerical simulations of black hole mergers in regions where gravity\r\nis so strong that effects of Einstein's general relativity dominate.\r\nIn the second set, mathematical issues pertaining to the structure and\r\nsolutions of Einstein's general relativity will be resolved using\r\n``Twistor theory'' introduced by Roger Penrose and developed by his\r\nresearch group. The third set contains a number of projects pertaining\r\nto quantum gravity, the theory that will unify general relativity with\r\nquantum physics. Suitable approximation methods will be developed by\r\nthe research groups of Ashtekar and Pullin to better understand the\r\nstructure of a quantum gravity theory, that is being developed by the\r\nPIs and others, and to make physical predictions which could be tested\r\nin the near future.\r\n\r\nThese projects interlink several fields: general relativity,\r\ncomputational physics, astrophysics, quantum theory and several\r\nbranches of geometry. For example, the first set of projects is based\r\non Einstein's equations of general relativity but the accurate\r\nestimates of the mass and spin of the final black hole and of the\r\nenergy radiated in the process, obtained from them, will have impact\r\non astrophysics in general and to gravitational wave physics in\r\nparticular. The second set will use novel techniques from algebraic\r\ngeometry to solve Einstein's equations. Unification of general\r\nrelativity and quantum physics is perhaps the most outstanding open\r\nproblem in fundamental physics today. The proposed projects in the\r\nthird set combine sophisticated techniques from modern mathematics and\r\ntheoretical physics to probe the nature of space-time geometry at the\r\nsmallest scales conceivable today. Through his general relativity\r\ntheory, Einstein proposed that geometry is a physical entity.  Some of\r\nour projects are aimed at elevating Einstein's vision to the quantum\r\nworld showing, in particular, that matter, radiation and geometry can\r\nbe converted in to one another through quantum processes involving\r\ngravity.  Other projects will use astronomical observations of gamma\r\nray bursts from ongoing NASA missions to directly probe the\r\nramifications of these novel quantum effects. This will be among the\r\nfirst systematic efforts at confronting the rather abstract quantum\r\ngravity theory with concrete experiments.\r\n",
