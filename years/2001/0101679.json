 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the recruitment and retention of rural and underrepresented students into teaching careers in mathematics, science, and technology through a partnership involving Colorado State University and four community colleges: Aims Community College, Morgan Community College, Northeastern Junior College, and Front Range Community College. Preservice preparation competencies required of future teachers are being incorporated into an associate degree program. Future Teacher Mentors on each community college campus advise and mentor community college students as they transition into university programs preparing them to teach mathematics, science, and technology. The project focuses on three outcomes: 1) to attract and retain greater numbers of students into targeted teaching areas to serve rural communities; 2) to attract and retain larger numbers of minority students into teaching in the targeted areas; and 3) to improve the preparation and current teaching of mathematics, science, and technology teachers and preservice providers. Recruitment efforts include Future Teacher Clubs on each campus, scholarships for prospective teachers, and recruitment in high school mathematics, science, and technology classes. An annual needs assessment determines the professional development needs of K-12 and community college faculty and guides yearly conferences and on-line workshops. The project builds on the course reform efforts of the Rocky Mountain Teacher Education Collaborative (RMETC). \r\n\r\n",
