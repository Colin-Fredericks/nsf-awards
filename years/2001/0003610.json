 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new, permanent exhibition at the San Diego Museum of Man will reflect the great scientific strides made in unraveling the mysteries of our uniquely human biology.  The exhibit of 7,000 sq. ft. will take visitors on a 65-million year journey through time and even go beyond the present with glimpses of current technologies which will shape the future of human evolution.  The exhibit development is being guided by a team of renowned scholars, museum professionals and community members in order to insure that the material is scientifically accurate, current and comprehensive.  Evaluation and community input combined with engaging exhibitry will further enhance the informal science learner's experience.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit will be about time, genetics and the environment.  Dioramas, casts, artifacts and engaging interactives will convey the storyline.  As a result of the development of culture, technology is refined and becomes intertwined with the human evolution.  The exhibit will unify and draw together other halls in the museum.  Further hands-on discovery will be encouraged in an outdoor archaeological site.  Associated programming, which will foster the integration of research and education, will include a lecture series, on-line chats and guidebooks, as well as resources for teachers and students.\r\n",
