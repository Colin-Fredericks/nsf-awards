The subtitle of this conference \" A New Generation of Professionals---A New Generation of Processes\".  Like its predecessor conferences, this meeting is organized around the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards and is intended to accelerate the adoption of cleaner processes in all sectors of industry.  In addition to presentation by award winners, research papers and posters on relevant topics are given.  This year's conference is also putting emphasis on improving education to support the development of clean processing.\r\n\r\nThe NSF support is given to expand exposure and participation of young scientists and engineering and thus to contribute to education and expansion of research activities in this important environmental area.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
