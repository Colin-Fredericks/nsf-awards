 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at Rutgers University is to investigate the effects of intrinsic nanoscale inhomogeneities on the bulk properties of several important oxide systems.  These inhomogeneities appear to play a crucial role in the technologically important properties of these materials, such as superconductivity, magnetoresistance, and ferroelectricity.  For this purpose, x-ray and neutron scattering techniques will be combined with bulk-property measurements.  State of the art scattering techniques, such as resonant x-ray scattering, will be utilized to study the domain structure of the multiphase states, charge and orbital ordering in these states, and the nature of the structural, charge- and orbital fluctuations in the states not exhibiting phase separation.  In many cases, simultaneous scattering experiments and in-situ transport measurements will be carried out to characterize metastable states and time- and history-dependent effects.  The knowledge gained as the result of this project is expected to facilitate the understanding of correlated oxide materials, as well as to aid in the design of novel materials with technologically useful properties.  This project also contains an integrated educational part.  In particular, development of the modern science course for non-science majors and the utilization of feedback techniques in student education will be implemented.\r\n%%%\r\nAs the advancement of technology pushes the characteristic device size beyond 100 nm (one hundred-thousandth of an inch), microscopic inhomogeneities begin to play a crucial role in a number of technologically important materials that include silicon-based structures used in computer chips, magnetic memory media, and ferro- and piezoelectrics. Many of these materials belong to the family of the so-called transition-metal oxides with strong correlation effects. The\r\ngoal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at Rutgers University is to investigate the microscopic inhomogeneities and their connection to the physical properties of these materials. For this purpose, state of the art experimental techniques, including x-ray and\r\nneutron scattering combined with other experimental techniques will be used. The research will be carried out at the leading national research laboratories, as well as at Rutgers University. The knowledge gained as the result of this project is expected to facilitate our understanding of the materials used in modern technology, as well as to aid in the design of novel materials with technologically useful properties. This project also contains an integrated educational part. In particular, development of the modern science course for non-science majors and the utilization of feedback techniques in student education will be implemented.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
