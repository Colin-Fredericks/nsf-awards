 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposal focuses on providing a feasibility\r\ndemonstration of producing electrospun nanowebs of nanofibers, and combining them with conventional\r\nfilter media to form novel NanoFilter media for specific filtration applications.  These applications are well\r\nsuited to address the problems of removal of particles smaller than 3 microns from effluent streams -where\r\nsuperior efficiency of nanowebs in capturing sub-micron particles is very attractive for cost considerations\r\nas well.  Initially, the nanofibers will be electrospun from a solution of Nylon 6 in formic acid and laid directly on to a conventional support filter media as a nanoweb.  The web architecture will be easily tailored to achieve the desired composite filter performance by varying fiber diameter, fiber orientation, fiber packing fraction within the nanoweb, and the nanoweb thickness.  This project will be carried out collaboratively by eSpin Technologies, a small, high-technology start-up company based in Chattanooga, TN, and specializing in providing custom-made electrospun nanofibers, with academic centers and major corporations as its partners. Together they possess the skills and facilities needed to successfully carry out the work under this grant.\r\n\r\nNanotechnologies developed in the coming years will form the foundation of significant commercial\r\nplatforms. This business will be a key supplier of nanofiber technology which have the potential for\r\ncommercial applications in a variety of fields including, filtration: industrial filters, biological separations,\r\nultra pure air and water systems, next generation clean rooms, agriculture and food industries, and\r\nmicroelectronic industries.\r\n",
