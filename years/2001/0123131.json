 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in partnership with the National Science\r\nFoundation will increase the number of Native Americans matriculating into science,\r\nmathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) baccalaureate programs and/or entering \r\nthe science and technology workforce. This will be accomplished through a comprehensive\r\nprogram, irVision-21le which includes: a) curriculum development in calculus, physics and\r\nchemistry; b) standards-based faculty development in problem-solving instructional \r\nstrategies and in the use of instructional technologies; c) two-year student experiences\r\nin research; and, c) an expanded program for networking professionals leading to\r\nindustry certification to address the need for information technology workers in\r\nNative American communities.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to improve student-learning outcomes in calculus, physics, and\r\nchemistry.  Students will participate in inquiry-based learning strategies delivered through\r\na technology-enriched curriculum that is delivered/facilitated by a skilled faculty.  Native\r\nAmerican undergraduates will also participate in meaningful research experiences that \r\nwill lead to improved diverse career opportunities, particularly in the SMET fields. \r\nStudents will learn and write about the research process, and develop presentations\r\nfor professional student forums. This is a learning experience that is rarely afforded \r\nto two-year undergraduates. Finally to address the need for certified information \r\ntechnology professionals in the U.S., and especially among Tribal Nations, SIPI will\r\nexpand its networking training program, allowing for industry certification.\r\n\r\nProject staff in collaboration with faculty will develop an extensive evaluation\r\nand assessment program.  Staff will encourage and monitor student enrollment \r\nand success in college courses that will prepare students for science, mathematics,\r\nengineering and technology careers.  Curricula products will be packaged and shared \r\nwith Native serving institutions, and evaluation and assessment results will be \r\nelectronically disseminated.\r\n\r\n",
