Kopperman\r\n\r\nThis award provides partial support for participants at the\r\nSixteenth Summer Conference on Topology and  Its Applications,  \r\nto take place July 18-21, 2001 at City College in New York, NY.\r\nThis Conference series addresses the need of topologists  to \r\nshare new ideas at a time of year when most are free of academic commitments, a need demonstrated by its continued growth.  \r\nThis series began in 1984 at the City College of New York with 35 participants and 13 talks. Over the past decade, attendance has averaged  about 150,  with participants all inhabited  continents \r\nand  about 100  talks.  Today, after much concentration on \r\nproblems internal to  topology, emphasis in this field is again  turning toward  applications to other areas.  Thus we have \r\norganized the following Special Sessions: Asymmetric Topology and Computer Science, Dynamical Systems, Topological Algebra and \r\nFunctional Analysis, Set-theoretic Topology, and Topological \r\nGroups and Semigroups.  Further  information, including  invited  speakers, schedule of talks, and housing information, is available \r\nat sumtopo.att.net.\r\n",
