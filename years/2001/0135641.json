The mathematics specialists involved in the exploratory phase of the work will compile school-specific and network composite lists of barrier concepts, and will then develop a set of instructional strategies and resources to redress the barriers.  Minority and majority parents of students in grades 5-7 will be interviewed as to their understanding of the role of higher level coursework, and access to such courses; the effectiveness of district communications; their understanding of district policies; and their relationship with schools. \r\n",
