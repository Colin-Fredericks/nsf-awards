 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI project focuses on in-situ, real-time studies of complex oxide thin films composition, structure, and properties to be used to optimize film quality and to develop film formation models that optimize desired film properties.  A unique process and characterization system combining spectroscopic ellipsometry and low energy ion scattering, together with a multi target ion beam sputter deposition system for film growth is being completed.  This GOALI project involving systems development requires not only the diverse scientific talents provided by the University of North Carolina and James Madison University (an undergraduate institution) and Argonne National laboratories, but also industrial participation for the industrial hardware implementation phase.  Oxide films with both complex compositions and structures are being considered for the next generation electronic and optical devices.  Among the classes materials currently being emphasized are highly optimized thin films of superconductors, high dielectric constant dielectrics, ferroelectrics and piezoelectrics.  Training students for job opportunities in these areas is regarded as a high priority by industry.\r\n%%%\r\nThis ROA grant will increase the participation of undergraduate students at James Madison University in GOALI project DMR-9986682.  Oxide films with both complex composition and structures are being explored for the next generation electronic and optical devices.  These include superconductors, didectrics, ferroelectrics and prezoelectric materials.  This GOALI will provide excellent training for students competing for 100 opportunities in areas regarded as a high priority by indarky.\r\n",
