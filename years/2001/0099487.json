 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the completion of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility\r\nat Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory (JLAB), the precise measurement of\r\nthe polarization of high energy photons has become an important topic.\r\nFor example, the scientific program at JLAB's Hall B includes fundamental\r\nexperiments that require polarization measurements to be accurate to at\r\nleast 5%, and some of them require an accuracy of 1-2%.  The physics\r\nprogram at the planned Hall D will also depend largely on linearly\r\npolarized photons whose polarization must be accurately known. \r\n\tIn spite of a history extending over 40 years, high energy photon\r\npolarimetry is still a relatively undeveloped field.  For high energy\r\nphotons, such as those produced at JLAB, all known methods for measuring\r\npolarization have low analyzing power, and absolute accuracy below that\r\nrequired for the approved and anticipated physics programs. The\r\npolarimeter proposed in this project will have an unsurpassed experimental\r\nasymmetry of approximately 1.7 for an energy range from a few tens of MeV\r\nup to several GeV. The polarimeter is simple in construction, compact, and\r\nits costs will be lower than that for polarimeters built according to any\r\nother available method.\r\n\tTwo prototypes have already been built and tested. The performance\r\nof the detectors and the electronics met expectations and the measured\r\nanalyzing power was as large as predicted.  The use of this polarimeter at\r\nSpring-8 enabled the first direct measurement of the azimuthal asymmetry\r\nin pair production by linear polarized photons in the energy range 1.5 to\r\n2.4 GeV.  However, more improvements are needed to produce a polarimeter\r\nthat will be permanently in use at JLAB.  This project will undertake\r\nthose improvements, including additional work on pair production theory\r\nand calculations, data acquisition and analyzing software, and the\r\ndevelopment of detector hardware.\r\nIn addition to solving urgent needs in polarimetry, providing the ground\r\nfor the ultimate experiments at JLAB, the development of this program will\r\nbring novel equipment to NCCU, and increase involvement of students in\r\nresearch, advancing the education of undergraduates from underrepresented\r\ngroups.  \r\n\r\n",
