Many quantitative studies have measured this inequity\r\nand the impacts of individual educational reforms, but few scholars have explored\r\nhistorical or epistemological patterns behind the successes and failures of diversification\r\nefforts. Using archives, artifacts, and approximately 35 interviews with engineering\r\ninstructors and graduates, this project compares engineering education in American\r\nuniversities attended primarily by black students and white students since 1945 to\r\nestablish such an overview.\r\n\r\nBased on four pairs of schools, representing each of four states and four historical\r\neras, this study describes the broad political conditions in which these universities\r\nfunctioned, and provides detailed accounts of practices within their engineering\r\nclassrooms and laboratories. The cases of Lincoln University (Missouri) and the\r\nUniversity of Missouri will illustrate conditions during the science and engineering\r\n\"manpower\" crisis immediately following World War II.  Technical programs at\r\nMaryland State College and the University of Maryland will illustrate the impacts of\r\nintegration as separate-but-equal doctrines fell away in the 1950s. The histories of two\r\nurban schools, the Kennedy-King College and Illinois Institute of Technology in\r\nChicago, will reflect the coalescence of civil rights activism and legislation in the 1960s\r\nand 1970s; and comparisons of Prairie View and Texas A&M Universities will document\r\nthe ascendance of political conservatism and a \"post-industrial\" economy in the 1980s\r\nand 1990s. Engineering curricula and course materials varied greatly among these\r\nsettings, and this project treats post-secondary technical education since 1945 as both a\r\nreflection of prevailing social ideologies about race and a shaping force of those values.\r\nIt explores, overall, the uncertain connection between technical and social modernity in\r\ncontemporary America.\r\n\r\n",
