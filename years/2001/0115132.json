 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enzymes produced by fungi that degrade the pectic components of plant cell walls are central to fungal pathogenicity. Two of these classes of enzymes, endopolygalacturonases (EPGs) and pectin methylesterases (PMEs), are the focus of this project. Fungi produce EPGs to hydrolyze the cell wall polysaccharide homogalacturonan as one of the first steps in invasion. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) often act in concert with EPGs by converting methyl-esterified regions of homogalacturonan to a substrate which is susceptible to the EPG. One of plant defense mechanisms involves the interactions between fungal EPGs and plant-derived polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs), that reduce the hydrolytic activity of the EPG. The ability of PMEs and EPGs to modify and fragment homogalacturonan, respectively, has led to their exploitation in a variety of commercial applications, including the clarification of juices, the texture and firmness of processed foods and purees, and control of the rheology of pectins as gelling agents. \r\n\r\nLittle is known about the mechanism of action of EPGs and PMEs, despite their economic importance to both industry and agriculture. To increase our knowledge of EPGs and PMEs, this project will use amide exchange-mass spectrometry to identify the sites on both EPG and PME that bind to their respective substrates. This technique will also be used to investigate the sites of protein/protein interaction between EPG and its inhibitor protein (PGIP). The information obtained from the initial experiments will identify amino acids of EPG and PME that appear to be critical to these interactions with the substrate (and in the case of EPG with PGIP). Based on these data, site-specific replacements will be designed to potentially disrupt interactions. Amide exchange-MS will then be used to determine if the resulting change in amino acid(s) has disrupted the binding interaction under investigation. Besides obtaining the information on the binding surfaces on the mutant enzymes, the project will also investigate if changes to the binding site of PME alter the products of this enzyme. This will be done by a comparison of the products of native PME action on short, methyl esterified pectic fragments to the products of a series of site-specific mutant forms of the PME on the same substrates. \r\n\r\nThe detailed characterization of the protein/protein and protein/carbohydrate interactions in this project will provide added insight into mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions, and new avenues for increasing plant disease resistance. This knowledge will provide information on fruit ripening and plant development, and will be of great benefit in the design and selection of overexpressed enzymes to meet specific industrial requirements.\r\n",
