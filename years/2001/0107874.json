 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is mainly concerned with the study of the regularity of\r\nsolutions of partial differential equations that arise in the theory of\r\nseveral complex variables and on CR manifolds.  In particular we plan to\r\nstudy various properties of subelliptic multipliers and also\r\nhypoellipticity when subellipticity fails. Related questions are Hoelder\r\ncontinuity and real analyticity of solutions. We also will continue our\r\nstudy of global regularity on CR manifolds using microlocal methods.\r\n\r\nPartial differential equations arise naturally in physics, chemistry,\r\nengineering, economics, and in several diverse areas of mathematics.\r\nSometimes these equations can be solved explicitly but more often they\r\ncannot and, in that case, the problem is to find whether the solution\r\nexists and if so to find various of its properties and to approximate\r\nit. This is accomplished by means of estimates. Here we study estimates\r\nfor certain special fundamental partial differential equations but the\r\ntechniques we develop are applicable in much greater generality. The\r\nbasic concept that we use are \"subelliptic multipliers\" this is a tool\r\nwhich converts the search for estimates into problems of algebra and\r\ngeometry.  This concept has proved very effective not only in proving\r\nestimates but also in the study of various algebraic and geometric\r\nproblems.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
