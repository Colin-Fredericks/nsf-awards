Two are associated with plate boundaries, that is, regions of\r\nplate divergence and convergence, and the third is intraplate volcanism.\r\nMagmas erupted in these different environments differ significantly in\r\ngeochemical characteristics.  In this proposed research the goal is to\r\nunderstand the source and processes which determine the geochemical\r\ncharacteristics of Hawaiian lavas.  This endmember is of great interest\r\nbecause it may in part represent the consequences of subducting oceanic\r\ncrust deep into the mantle at subduction zones.\r\n\r\nThe approach will be to determine abundances of major and trace elements\r\nand isotopic ratios of O, Sr, Nd, Pb, Hf and Os in lavas of varying\r\nrelative age from these two shields.  For Koolau the samples to be studied\r\nare from a recently drilled core, that penetrates the shield to a greater\r\ndepth and older age than previously studied surficially exposed samples.\r\nFor Kahoolawe, which has not been intensively studied, the samples will be\r\nfrom several stratigraphic sections across the shield.  The principal\r\nobjective is to understand the source components contributing to these\r\nmagmas; hence emphasis will be on evaluating correlations between abundance\r\nratios of highly incompatible elements, e.g., Ba/Th, Ce/Pb and La/Nb, and\r\nisotopic ratios.  These geochemical characteristics will be determined\r\nusing analytical facilities such as inductively couples plasma mass\r\nspectrometry and thermal ionization mass spectrometry.\r\n\r\nBecause of their oceanic plate setting, relatively simple mineralogy and a\r\nwealth complementary studies, Hawaiian volcanoes present the best\r\nopportunity for understanding the role of recycled crustal components in\r\n\r\noceanic island volcanism.  In particular, this research will aid in\r\nconstraining the processes and source components which create a geochemical\r\nendmember of Hawaiian shield lavas.\r\n\r\n",
