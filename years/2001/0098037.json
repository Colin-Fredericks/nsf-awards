Rance Cleaveland (Co-PI)\r\n\r\nConcurrent systems such as network protocols and net-centric programs\r\nare difficult to build and debug because of the potential they exhibit\r\nfor unintended process interactions.  The development of net-based\r\napplications which have to contend with probabilistic guarantees from\r\nlower-levels is even more difficult as they need to be functionally\r\ncorrect and also satisfy reliability/performance constraints.  This\r\nproject will investigate how formal methods can be extended to address\r\nboth logical correctness and reliability/performance constraints.\r\n\r\nThe current project will explore semantic theories of systems that\r\nhave both non-determinism and probabilistic choice.  In particular,\r\nnotions of equality and approximate equality of system behaviors will\r\nbe investigated.  Furthermore, the effect of these notions on\r\ncompositional reasoning will also be studied.\r\n\r\nThe second topic of the proposed work will be a thorough comparison of\r\nthe semantic theories developed in this project against traditional\r\napproaches to dealing with non-determinism and probabilistic choice.\r\n\r\nFinally, practical algorithms for process minimization and for\r\nchecking equality (and approximate equality) of processes will be\r\ndesigned and implemented in the Concurrency Workbench of New Century.\r\nCase studies, to evaluate the proposed theories, will also be\r\nconstructed and studied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
