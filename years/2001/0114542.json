Rudolph, University of Wisconsin-Madison \r\nSchool Science Epistemology And The American Public In The Twentieth Century\r\n\r\nThe integration of science into American institutional, economic, and cultural life has increasingly become a defining characteristic of modern society. The growing importance of expert knowledge and technical skill in a country that has continued to exhibit low levels of scientific literacy has prompted scholars and policymakers to devote greater attention to the various avenues of communication between science and the lay public.  As useful as much of this work has been, however, it has overlooked the schools -the one place society has set aside specifically for communicating knowledge about science to the public -as an important site of study.  Though traditionally viewed as a place where only scientific content knowledge is transmitted to students, science classrooms serve a more important function mediating the relationship between science and society through its portrayal of scientific epistemology -that is, the process by which science generates reliable knowledge about the world.  Perceptions of how science works in the abstract provide the backdrop against which local, context-specific scientific issues are viewed, and ultimately resolved, by the public.  To date, few researchers have looked carefully at or considered the social implications of these school-science epistemologies.  \r\n\r\nThis research project provides a historical analysis of the image of science in schools over the course of the twentieth century.  The specific aim is to understand how the curricular portrayal of scientific epistemology has been used to define the role of science in American society and culture.  Dr. Rudolph uses rich archival resources of both key individuals and institutions to examine how the construction of science in education has varied from the Progressive era 's view of the scientific method as the sole path to objective knowledge to the more recent images of science as only one among many, equally legitimate ways of knowing.  He is interested in how portrayals of science in the classroom -through textbook, homework, and lab -both have situated the individual with respect to the scientific community and its practices and how science as an institution has been placed within the larger social and political structures of the time.  With this work, Dr. Rudolph provides a detailed case-study history of United States science education in its extended social context that promises to give insight into how schools and the school curriculum have functioned in the past and how they might be made to function better as a bridge between science and the lay public in the future.\r\n",
