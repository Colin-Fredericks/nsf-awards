 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David W. Wright, Department of Chemistry, Duquesne University is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a Career Award whose principal focus is the development of functional interfaces for inorganic nanostructures. Specifically, the main objective is the use of synthetic combinatorial approaches to design, synthesize and characterize a \"molecular toolbox\" of scaffolds for the synthesis of new materials inspired by biomineralization processes. Following the multidisciplinary nature of the research activities, the award also supports development of an integrated laboratory concept for upper-class undergraduates and a practicum for first year graduate students.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that this multidisciplinary research cuts across such fields as material science, the environment, chemistry, biology and nanotechnology, graduate students and post-doctoral associates will be trained in diversified disciplines and sub-disciplines. The integrated laboratory concept and the pedagogical goal to have students \"think with their heads and do with their hands\" will provide undergraduate and graduate students with basic skills and a philosophy that will expose them to innovative approaches for independent research.",
