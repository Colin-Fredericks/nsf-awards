This project studies the impact of ecotourism on the livelihoods of host community households. Using a research method known as tourism impact assessment, the two anthropologists, their students and colleagues in Costa Rica and Belize will measure \"household livelihood security and vulnerability\" using an inclusive set of proxy indicators of social, economic, and environmental well-being. The hypothesis to be tested is that household participation in ecotourism improves household livelihood security and reduces vulnerability.  Eight sites (four in each of the two countries) will be studied, half of the sites engaged in ecotourism and half not, in both the high- and low-tourism seasons.  Qualitative data will be gathered using participant observation, key informant interviews, household surveys, and general ethnography; quantitative anthropometric measures of health will be recorded for small children; household economic indices will be measured; and available statistics on tourism and economic development will be collected and analyzed. The resulting study will advance our understanding of the impact of tourism, one of the world's major industries, upon rural communities in the developing world.  This new knowledge will be valuable to planners, local officials, and community members.\r\n\r\n",
