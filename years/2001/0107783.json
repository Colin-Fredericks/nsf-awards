The objective of the conference is to provide a forum where mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from academia and industry can exchange ideas concerning theoretical, applied, and computational developments in differential equations and associated simulations.  The conference is the fifth in a series of biennial meetings on the subject.\r\n \r\nWith the rapid development of high performance computing and communication, and robust and efficient mathematical/numerical algorithms, computational simulation has emerged as an essential tool for engineering analysis and design environment.  This has fundamentally\r\nchanged the way underlying principles of science and engineering are applied to research,\r\ndesign, and development.  These computational simulations involve (i) a system of differential\r\nequations representative of the physical phenomena (mathematical model); (ii) a numerical\r\nmethod to simulate the mathematical model; and (iii) an efficient sequential/parallel/distributed\r\ncomputing environment.  Successful simulations require interdisciplinary collaboration between various scientific and engineering fields. This conference is an opportunity for workers in these fields to discuss important recent results.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
