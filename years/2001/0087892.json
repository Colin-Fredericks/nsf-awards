 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) \r\n\r\nIn this proof-of-concept proposal, a strategy for improving university-level mathematics courses for future secondary math teachers is tested. There is increasing evidence that the mathematical training that secondary school teachers receive in U.S. colleges and universities often fails to impart a deep understanding of the structures that underlie high-school math. Cooperating teams in four Louisiana locations, consisting of college faculty, high-school teachers and college students, work under central support and direction to author and test curriculum materials in algebra, geometry, analysis, or statistics that address this need. Each lesson package concerns a single topic of limited scope, chosen for its mathematical interest and relevance to state and national standards and designed for use in university- level courses.\r\n\r\nA unique feature of the lesson package is the inclusion of extensive examples of student work. The advantages of this are ensuring that the product is \"in tune\" with students' thinking, providing teachers with tools to better comprehend students' conceptual understanding, and providing a powerful instrument for assessment and evaluation that is built into the system.\r\n\r\nThe project also tests the organizational model under which the lesson packages are produced. A change in faculty culture is achieved by instituting a new form of pedagogical scholarship that is self-sustaining and capable of adapting to future needs. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
