 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides for training and faculty professional development to students and faculty at a group of community colleges with large native American populations. It has goals that include increasing the numbers of American Indians in the technological workforce and enhancing the educational opportunities for students on the reservation. Students participate in a recently implemented information technology program at one of the community colleges. They have the opportunity to select courses to achieve different IT hardware certifications and to do internships in the community. The IT courses are offered by distance education, allowing place-bound reservation students the opportunity for a degree. Professional development opportunities for preservice teachers, teachers and college instructors in technological applications are also included, with integration of the technologies into the associated curricula. Summer workshops provide training for teachers who then serve as trainers and mentors for peers. This model of community collaboration and involvement addresses workforce needs in the geographic area and a unique way to increase the participation in IT careers by under-represented groups.\r\n",
