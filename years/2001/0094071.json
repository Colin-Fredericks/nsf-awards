The program has the full backing of a committed administration and the support of a strong student infrastructure that enhances existing campus programs ( such as the McNair and CSTEP programs) without supplanting them. This program aims to significantly increase the number of talented, but economically disadvantaged students in the three majors who can successfully complete a degree in a timely manner and go on to employment in their field or graduate school.",
