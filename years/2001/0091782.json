 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sir Ronald A. Fisher (1890-1962) is most widely known for his contributions to statistics, including the analysis of variance, and for his work in genetics, especially his genetical theory of natural selection. Less well known is his major contribution to experimentation, the role of randomization in experimental design.  This dissertation research project will explore Fisher's actual development of the concept of experimental randomizing, how he conceived it and what led him to recognize the need for it. The second part of this project is an examination of Fisher's promulgation of randomization, the impact it had then and in later years, and the ways in which Fisher answered his critics, some of whom viewed randomization as unnecessary. Of special interest are the \"volunteer workers\" who came to Rothamsted Agricultural Station in England to work with Fisher and who stayed for periods of from three weeks to three years. These visitors, many of them international, returned to their respective countries and institutions carrying Fisher's methods of experimental design with them. Within two decades, randomized experimental design as first put forth by Fisher came to be not only accepted but also required in many areas of research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
