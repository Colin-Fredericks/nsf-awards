 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Delta Research & Education Foundation (DREF) is following up on a successful planning grant with the Science and Everyday Experiences (SEE) Initiative.  The SEE Initiative will be implemented by the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, a non-profit organization composed of 190,000 predominantly African-American professionals, that provides programs and services to promote human welfare.  The program offers a five-year, comprehensive approach to the delivery of resources designed to help parents and caregivers of African-American children in grades K-8 effectively support informal science and math learning.  By partnering with the AAAS, SEE provides members of the 800+ Delta chapters with leadership and professional development training in informal science education.  The first phase of training is a three-day professional development workshop for Delta regional officers and members.  Regional leaders are prepared to conduct State Chapter Leadership Professional Development Workshops.  State Chapter workshops are 12-hour sessions that train 4,200 sorority members per year to sponsor ongoing family science events.  Finally, Delta members that are K-12 or community educators will be designated as Parent Educators.  SEE Parent Educators will receive 40-hour training sessions from AAAS, which enables participants to provide parents with 24 hours of informal science education.  It is anticipated that 2,800 SEE Parent Educators will be trained during the life of the grant.  Delta chapters are located in seven geographical regions, which encompass 40 states and will serve as the primary mode of dissemination.  Promotion of the SEE Initiative will occur in conjunction with media partners.  A 30-minute science radio talk show for families will broadcast nationally on Radio One and inquiry-based science inserts will be placed in the Afro-American Newspaper, which has a circulation of 6.5 million.  Other outcomes include an informational website, as well as science activity cards for families and training materials.  This project will impact 17,500 families per year.",
