Examples of applications of these architectures include unprecedently small and inexpensive nanoscale intelligent sensors. The architectures can be used to implement neurocomputing models and are well suited for nanotechnologies, thus accelerating the development of useful nanotechnology by providing clear functional targets for nanodevices.\r\nThe team of investigators includes computer architects, neurocomputing experts and device physicists working in close collaboration along three highly synergistic thrusts. One of the two thrusts is focused on advancing the understanding of biologically-inspired dynamic information processing systems in order to understand the impact of constraints imposed by architectures and technologies on the properties of these systems. Another thrust investigates neurocomputing system architectures that can be engineered within the constraints of nanotechnologies. The third thrust develops a toolbox of novel mechanisms for integration, self-assembly and interconnection of nanoscale devices. \r\nThe architectures are investigated via formal methods and simulation. Internet resources are used to conduct simulation, and to disseminate models, software and other research results. A new course, summer internships and educational materials are being developed to educate students on the key interdisciplinary aspects and results of the project.\r\n\r\n",
