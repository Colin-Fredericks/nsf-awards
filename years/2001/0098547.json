It is imperative that innovative design paradigms that\r\nmaximize system performance be pursued. Significant attention has been given to maximizing\r\nperformance in the communications protocols, while less has been given to the system\r\nthroughput available from \"smart\" array antenna design. Adaptive conformal antenna arrays are\r\narrays with radiating elements that are placed in arbitrary locations and the elements may be\r\ndirected in different directions. The interest in adaptive conformal antennas at the base station\r\nand on the mobile terminals is motivated by previous work reported on indoor wireless channels\r\nand on novel space-time coding techniques that suggests the use of conformal arrays improves\r\nthe reliability of the communications over multi-path propagation effects and fading, and in\r\ngeneral, improves the overall quality of service of the entire wireless network.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses the development of simulation, design, and analysis approaches for\r\nadaptive conformal array antennas and provides an in-depth investigation to quantify the\r\nperformance capabilities available from conformal arrays. The result will be a new class of array\r\nantennas and design tools for fourth generation wireless systems and beyond. This work will be\r\nfocused in two main areas. The first area involves developing novel simulation algorithms to\r\nunderstand how the particular array weights for several conformal array configurations\r\ninfluences the spatial distribution of the transmitted or received signal. This work will include\r\nthe development efficient tools to determine the optimal set array weights necessary to obtain a\r\nspecified spatial response. The research will use the results of previous antenna modeling efforts\r\nto factor in the effects of realistic designs of typical antenna elements, (element patterns, gain\r\nand phase imbalance, and mutual coupling etc.) and real-time processing resources. The second\r\narea involves developing processing methods to determine space-time characteristics for\r\nconformal arrays. This will allow the determination of the angle-of-arrival of an incoming signal\r\nand will allow the PI's to adapt the array weights in order to maximize signal to noise ratio and quality of the wireless channel.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual and creative aspects of the proposed activities include advancing the\r\nstate-of-the-art for general conformal array antennas for wireless communications, implementing\r\nevolutionary programming methods that take into account multi-design criteria for conformal\r\nantenna arrays, quantifying fundamental characteristic design formulas to understand the\r\ncapabilities and limitations of conformal array antennas, and utilizing directional elements in the\r\ndesign of conformal arrays and quantifying the performance enhancements obtained from the use\r\nof directional elements in conformal arrays. Other activities include investigating the mutual\r\ncoupling between radiators in conformal arrays, and developing novel adaptive processing\r\nmethods specifically for conformal arrays for angle-of-arrival and time-of-arrival estimation. The\r\nPIs plan to interface with research activities in this proposal with work in a wireless networking\r\nproject when applicable. This will have broader impact beyond the research described in the\r\npresent proposal.\r\n",
