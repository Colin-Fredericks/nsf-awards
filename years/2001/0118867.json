 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0118867\r\n\r\nNew production is that component of total phytoplankton production fueled by nitrate uptake and  the fixation of N2. In a nitrogen-limited model of ocean plankton growth, new production can be  used to define an upper limit for the export of organic material from the surface to deeper layers.  Thus, new production is an important starting point to determine the ocean's role in the vertical  flux of bio-active materials such as carbon dioxide.  A second critical factor is the amount of new  production that is exported to depth.  Both export and new production can vary independently and  both need to be understood to predict how efficiently material will be removed from surface  waters.  Previous time series measurements in the Cariaco Basin off northeast Venezuela  recorded prodigious productivity associated with the winter upwelling period and lower (although  still moderate) production in summer as well as the possible contribution of chemosynthesis at  depth to the total organic export.  Thus, the region is a useful example of a low-latitude eutrophic-ocean  margin region in which much of the production reaches deep water.  \r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers from the Lamont-Dougherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University will study the relative contribution of nitrate uptake and N2 fixation to total particulate  export and how these sources vary seasonally in the Cariaco Basin.  The proposed work is a companion effort with the ongoing CARIACO Time-Series Project. While the latter core effort will provide the basic logistics, physical and chemical and  productivity measurements, the work undertaken in this project will focus on the source, amount and export  efficiency of new production.  Direct incubation methods will be used to measure the seasonal  changes in nitrate uptake and N2 fixation in surface waters using both 15 N tracer techniques for  nitrate and di-nitrogen gas as well as the acetylene reduction for N2 fixation.  Seasonal sampling  of these rates over two years will provide a basis for estimating the relative importance of N2  fixation, a potentially important input of combined nitrogen to the ocean. In addition to sediment  trap comparisons, the overall efficiency of export also will be measured with a recently developed 13C dilution method for estimating sub-surface carbon respiration.  Finally, these rate measurements will be used to calibrate a model of new production and export  in the region based on remotely sensed information. The model will explicitly estimate N2  fixation. This work will help to constrain the cumulative role of tropical margins in the supply of  combined nitrogen to the ocean as well as in total-ocean carbon uptake. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
