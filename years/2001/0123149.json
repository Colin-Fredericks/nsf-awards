 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oglala Lakota College (OLC) is a tribally controlled and community governed four-year\r\nacademic institution with 1300 students located in ten college centers across the\r\nPine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota (SD). The student base is approximately 90%\r\nAmerican Indian.  As one of six NSF-designated Model Institutions for Excellence \r\n(MIE), OLC has developed the infrastructure to offer Science, Engineering, Math and\r\nTechnology (SMET) degrees and increase the number of Native Americans continuing \r\non to graduate school.  We currently have general collaboration agreements with the \r\nSD School of Mines & Technology (SDSM&T) and SD State University.  Since 1995, the \r\nMIE Program at OLC has developed five new accredited degrees in the SMET areas.\r\n\r\nPresently the Oglala Lakota Nation is forced to outsource all analytical work to off-\r\nreservation labs due to the lack of qualified facilities and expertise. Our long-term \r\ngoal is to train a pool of highly skilled scientists and lab technicians who will serve\r\ntheir communities as self-employed entrepreneurs or hired employees. Also, one of \r\nthe major shortcomings of our SMET programs is the lack of lab facilities with modern \r\nanalytical equipment. This creates a disadvantage for our students at every level of \r\ntheir career.\r\n\r\nWe propose a multifaceted approach to develop the technological infrastructure of our\r\ninstitution and the reservation as a whole.  We will build a research center housing \r\nseveral federal and state certified labs that will provide us with the capacity to conduct\r\nresearch and routine analytical work in the areas of chemistry, environmental science, and \r\nbiology.  Collaboration agreements with three faculty members at SDSM&T and Black Hills\r\nState University in these areas are procured for this proposal.  We will actively seek \r\npartnerships with tribal agencies to provide research and analytic services. This insures\r\nthat a significant portion of the funding allocated by tribal agencies would be re-infused\r\ninto the reservation economy. This would also sustain the project beyond NSF funding.\r\n\r\nOur faculty and students will be trained on the equipment by the collaborators and\r\nthrough industrial short courses, workshops and seminars.  Both collaborators and \r\nfaculty will initiate research projects involving our students utilizing the new equipment. \r\nWe will strengthen our curriculum by developing new analytical lab classes and by\r\nenhancing existing sciencecourses. Finally, students and faculty will reach out to \r\nreservation communities to help them address their concerns about economic \r\ndevelopment and the environment.  Students and faculty will also teach SMET\r\nclasses at reservation schools and will open up the labs for teachers and students \r\nto stimulate scientific knowledge and curiosity .",
