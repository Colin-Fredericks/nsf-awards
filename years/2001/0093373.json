 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational geometry arose out of the need for many\r\nscience and engineering applications of geometric computing.\r\nOver the last two decades, the field has emerged as a rich,\r\nmature, and mathematically rigorous discipline. However,\r\ndespite its impressive achievements well-received in the\r\ntheoretical computer science community, computational\r\ngeometry has had limited impact in the practical areas of\r\ngeometric computing. As advocated by the recent\r\nComputational Geometry Task Force Report, it is important to\r\nreorient the field towards providing more practical\r\nsolutions to the specific needs of the applications that use\r\ngeometric computing, and towards focusing on new\r\n\"bottleneck\" problems of identifiably important practical\r\nareas. In this proposed career plan, we intend to develop\r\nour research career toward this goal, by working on the full\r\ncomputational pipelines of some important real-world\r\napplications of geo-metric computing, including air traffic\r\nmanagement (conflict prediction), graphics and scientific\r\nvisualization (I/O-efficient isosurface extraction, I/O-\r\nefficient direct volume rendering, external-memory view-\r\ndependent surface simplification), and manufacturing\r\n(maximum scatter traveling salesperson problem (TSP)). An\r\nimportant aspect of the work is to examine the full\r\ncomputational pipelines of the practical applications to\r\nidentify and formulate critical tasks into new algorithmic\r\nquestions, extend computational geometry methodologies to\r\ndevise novel solutions, and finally implement and integrate\r\nthe developed algorithms into the pipelines to evaluate\r\ntheir practical ef-fectiveness in the original real-life\r\napplications. Key components of the plan are the expected\r\nrich interactions between theory and practice, and the aim\r\nof designing simple, easy-to-implement geometric algorithms\r\nthat are efficient both practically and theoretically. In\r\nthe long term, we expect to be able to have real impact on\r\nthese important practical areas of geometric computing, and\r\nat the same time enrich the knowledge body of the field of\r\ncomputational geometry. The proposed educational plan\r\nincludes introduction of new courses, involvement of both\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students in the proposed research\r\nprojects, participation in an outreach program, and further\r\ndevelopment of a research laboratory.\r\n",
