 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding to support the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Florida Institute of Technology (FIT). During this program, eight undergraduate students will spend eight weeks in the summer working on research issues including ocean engineering, environmental science, and management of coastal zones. Students will conduct an independent research project under the direction of a faculty mentor. They will also attend seminars on topics such as experimental design and analysis, data management, graphic display of results, web design, Powerpoint presentations, environmental justice and ethics, and participate in a variety of field trips and a 3-day cruise aboard a 60-foot research vessel. Field trips will cover topics such as inlet management, restoration of salt marshes, re-diversion of flood control systems, installation and biological monitoring of artificial reefs, etc. Through their research, seminars and field trips, the students will have to opportunity to meet with individuals from private industry and government who work in the field of coastal management and coastal engineering. The program is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a profession and for training young researchers. This program is well designed to encourage highly motivated students to continue the their pursuit of careers in coastal oceanography. It encourages interest in interdisciplinary and applied research, and students will be exposed to a variety of careers in coastal oceanography. Students will conduct independent research and produce oral and written reports at the end of the internship. In addition, the program will encourage a diverse set of students to continue their education in the field of oceanography, and will particularly promote participation of women in coastal research. In the past the program has had 83% female participants and has drawn students from across the nation.  This award provides two years of support for the program.",
