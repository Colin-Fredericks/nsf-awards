 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) In 2001/2002, PKAL will sponsor two summer institutes (16 workshops at each) and a select number of other workshops to enhance the skills, understandings and capacities of undergraduate faculty seeking to strengthen SME&T learning of their students. Planned and facilitated by leading national agents of change, the design of these PKAL activities is to model the discovery-based, research-rich, collaborative learning environment that works to attract students to and enable them to succeed in SME&T disciplines. Benefiting from a hands-on experience with some of the best practices in undergraduate SME&T education, participants will leave with an agenda for immediate action on their home campuses and with a plan to keep connected to their workshop peers/facilitators, regional and national colleagues and to PKAL for support in continuing reform efforts. Related PKAL efforts, including an expanded web presence, print publications, a consulting service, the Faculty for the 21st Century and the evaluation of the impact of PKAL involvement on participating individuals and institutions, will support these workshops and institutes.\r\n",
