 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nConnecting with the River: Geoscience Research and Education for Hartford, CT\r\n\r\nThe students in the Hartford public school system come from ethnic backgrounds\r\nnot widely represented in the geosciences (51% Hispanic, 42% African-American and\r\n3% Asian). This two-year collaborative program seeks to enhance geoscience\r\nand technological literacy among these urban youth by drawing upon the rich educational value of the Connecticut River. This river, the longest in New England, and an American Heritage River, flows through Hartford CT and provides an excellent earth science laboratory. Connecting these students with the river provides an ideal opportunity for them to learn about earth science process, to develop a toolbox of research skills and to understand the relevance of earth science to their lives. \r\n\r\nThis diverse group of high school students will be engaged in the design and implementation of an environmental monitoring initiative that will document the physical processes and biological health of the river. Students at the Greater Hartford Academy of Math and Science (GHAMS), a magnet high school, and other area students will conduct this research as part of their regular school curriculum and during weekends, and in an intensive summer program. Many community organizations will be involved with the collection and presentation of the data. Data will be distributed among fellow student scientists and displayed on a student created website and the project will be promoted at various public buildings and museums and in print media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
