 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to establish a scholarship program for low- income, academically talented students enrolled fulltime in one of the degree programs offered by the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. There are forty awards per year. Students may apply for a second year of funding. The selection process includes indicators of academic merit and likely professional success. Support structures, which are already in place at the college assist in recruiting, placement, and retention of scholarship recipients. Several options are available to the students who receive a scholarship: a research project mentored by a senior faculty member, participation in already established college projects, and internships in New York City programs for academic assistance to high school students. A goal of the project is to attract academically sound students to the computer science and mathematics majors at the college.",
