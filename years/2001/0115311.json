Professors Thomas Cundari, University of Memphis and Shankar Bhattacharyya, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science will collaborate on developing genetic algorithms for use in molecular modeling.  Novel soft computing techniques - genetic algorithms, neural networks, and fuzzy logic - for solving the Schroedinger wave equation for chemical systems will be developed, refined and implemented.  Further development and application of such algorithms are important in creating efficient computation of molecular properties in realistic systems.\r\n\r\nScope:  The international collaboration will exploit the synergy between the US and Indian research groups.  The expertise of the Indian team in algorithm development and genetic algorithms will complement the US team's strengths in other branches of soft computing and the chemical applications.  This project will promote mutual benefits with respect to scientific exchange and graduate student development.  The project is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Government of India's Department of Science and Technology.   \r\n",
