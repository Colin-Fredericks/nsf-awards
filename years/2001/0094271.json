 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a semi-quantitative understanding of the relationships between composition, crystal structure and the electronic structure in extended solids.  The focus is on oxide and oxynitride materials. The motivation is to use this knowledge to design new materials, or rediscover existing materials, with interesting optical, electrical and/or catalytic properties. Specific emphasis is given to the development of new materials where both the electrical and optical properties are important, such as photocatalysts and transparent conductors. The development of a photocatalytic material that can efficiently utilize visible light would have far reaching implications in the areas of environmental remediation and hydrogen generation. There are two aspects to the educational plan.  The first element involves improving the way general chemistry is taught by incorporating more aspects of active learning and group work into the recitation and laboratory sections. The second aspect of the educational plan is to develop a series of modules for use in teaching solid state chemistry at the graduate/advanced undergraduate level. The combined research and education components described here were chosen to enhance our understanding of structure-composition-property relations in solid state chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe need for new transparent conductors is driven by the increasing popularity of optoelectronic devices, such as flat panel displays, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. Students trained in the areas have a significant chance of competing well in these high-technology job markets.  \r\n",
