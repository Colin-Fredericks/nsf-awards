 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical communication networks employing wavelength division multiplexing can support several\r\ncommunication sessions using a limited number of wavelength channels. The employment ofwave-\r\nlength reuse in different parts of the network contributes to the increase in the number of sessions\r\nthat can be supported. As such, these networks can provide a means to serve those applica-\r\ntions which individually or collectively require large amounts of bandwidth. An important class\r\nof services with such property is the class of multicast, or multipoint traffic, which requires the\r\ndelivery of data from the source to a group of destinations. Although a few studies have addressed\r\npacket-switched multicast services in broadcast-and-select optical networks, the topics of routing,\r\nwavelength assignment, dimensioning, and performance of circuit-switched multicast services in\r\nwavelength routing optical networks have received little attention.\r\n     This project deals with multicast services in optical networks, with and without wavelength\r\nconverters. Such applications can be served using wavelength routing networks. The project has\r\nseveral objectives. First, we would like to develop multicast tree construction algorithms for optical\r\nnetworks which take into account the optical network constraints into account, such as thepower\r\nbudget, wavelength collisions and wavelength continuity, aswell as the cost and type of splitters and\r\nwavelength converters. Optimal network provisioning and dimensioning under multicast service,\r\ngiven the traffic demands and cost constraints, is another objective. We also plan to investigate the\r\npossibility of formulating a joint problem for the optimal provisioning, and the optimal wavelength\r\nconverter and splitter placement. It is also planned that routing, and wavelength selection algo-\r\nrithms will be developed for multicast services in optical networks. It is also planned to study the\r\neffect of these algorithms on the dimensioning and performance of the network. All this requires\r\nconstruction of accurate analytical models for the evaluation of call blocking probabilities under\r\ndifferent routing and wavelength selection algorithms. As the efficient support of multicast traffic\r\nrequires the branching of the traffic at several points in the network, these models are expected to\r\nbe very involved, especially that several standard independence assumptions cannot be used in this\r\ncase. In addition to general performance models, bounds on performance will be established, which\r\nwill provide a guide to the provisioning and dimensioning of networks for multicast service. Such\r\nbounds will be established through the identification of extreme network topologies which serve to\r\nprovide these bounds.\r\n     The results of this work are expected to advance the understanding of the behavior of optical\r\nnetworks under futuristic, yet more involved, traffic conditions. At the same time, these results\r\nwill contribute to the design and dimensioning of such networks.",
