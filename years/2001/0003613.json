 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"The Great Lakes Story\" is a 3,000 sq. ft. interactive traveling exhibit based on the highly successful and unique permanent exhibition at the Great Lakes Science Center.  Its focus is devoted to highlighting the natural history of the Great Lakes ecosystem.  The traveling exhibit will allow even more visitors around the country to understand the beauty, majesty and restoration efforts of this important national resource.  Through a planned six-year tour, it is estimated \"The Great Lakes Story\" will be experienced by as many as three million people.\r\n\r\nThere will be several components, including hands-on exhibits, organized with a centerpiece of a walk-around model of the Great Lakes region, and other interactive components.  The four major areas of the exhibit are physical characteristics of the Lakes, the natural cycles and processes which shaped them over time, changes and threats to the Lakes (especially human-induced), and finally, restoration efforts to bring the Lakes back to being the rich and productive ecosystem they should be.  Along with these exhibit areas, other project components are educational and marketing materials to ensure that host science centers are able to provide a complete learning experience to their youth, family, and adult audiences around the country.\r\n",
