 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for more bandwidth and capacity in wireless systems currently is the main culprit for the\r\ngreat interest in the development of wireless communications systems operating at millimeter wave\r\nfrequencies and higher. The future needs of broad-band interactive services (1Gb/s) demand the\r\napplication of optical fiber feed networks for distribution of the radio signals to and from the antennas at\r\nthe various base stations. Fiber-optic technologies have reached the stage where insertions into various\r\ncommercial RF systems are being considered. Today, there are three main steps in the evolution of\r\nRF/Photonics systems for wireless communications. The first step has been in the direction of using\r\nphotonics to slowly replace conventional RF components, such as, the coax that is used to interconnect\r\nthe antenna to the electronics. Optical fibers, in contrast to coaxial cable, provide a more ideal medium for\r\nbroadband RF communication systems. The light weight property of fibers, and its immunity from other\r\nsignal interference make them very critical in the development of future RF distribution systems. The\r\nsecond, and more challenging step, is in the seamless integration of photonics and RF wireless circuits.\r\nThe challenge in this step is to use photonics and RF circuits as complementary systems and blend them\r\ntogether. Finally, the third step is towards the development of optically coupled antennas. In this step the\r\naim is to eliminate the need of local oscillators, mixers, amplifiers and a host of other parts by directly\r\nfeeding an antenna through a fiber at millimeter wave frequencies.\r\n     Here, it is proposed that an array of RF modulator/photodetectors be integrated directly to an array\r\nof antennas. This new RF/photonic antenna array system, with the appropriate space-time processing and\r\ncoding, will form a iosmart antennaln that can enhance network coverage, capacity, and quality. It is\r\nenvisioned that a large number of such RF/Photonic antenna elements could be networked together into a\r\nstar configuration, feeding in and out of a radio hub.\r\n     As a transmitter, the proposed optoelectronic device operates as a photodiode, while as a receiver\r\nthe device operates as an optical modulator. It has already been demonstrated that this dual function of a\r\nsemiconductor electroabsorption modulator and photodiode in the same device for duplex operation, can\r\noccur, using bias control as a transmit/receive mode control. For full duplex operation, two\r\nmodulator/photodiode devices need to be incorporated in the each transceiver element.\r\n     We propose to directly drive a coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed slot antenna by converting optical\r\npower into microwave power and vice versa using these RF modulator/photodetectors. As a transmitter,\r\nthe CPW line is connected to the active surface of the photodetector, from which the microwave power\r\npropagates to feed the radiating slot. The photodetector is fed via an optical fiber from beneath. When the\r\ndevice functions as an optical modulator, the receive function can also be achieved. Preliminary results\r\nfor a single antenna show that a very good bandwidth and radiation patterns can be achieved.\r\n     It should be noted that these elements can be interconnected via the fiber to achieve summation,\r\nmixing and other signal processing functions, at the antenna site or at a remote site. Some preliminary\r\nresults have been achieved in the area of multiple functionality for the optoelectronic components, such as\r\nmodulation, photodetection, self-biasing and RF frequency mixing. They have shown properties, such as\r\nhigh bandwidth and high power, that are desirable for the antenna applications. A main emphasis here is\r\nto further investigate the material and device designs for the optoelectronic component that can\r\nincorporate into the smart antenna architecture.\r\n     The proposed approach will have significant impacts on wireless communication systems by\r\nproviding higher system bandwidth capacity and enhancing their reliability. It may lead to a new type of\r\nlong distance, broadband network infrastructure that supports transparent transport of optical signals.\r\n     Our team is formed to provide the expertise in the four key elements for this proposed research.\r\nOur project will provide a good opportunity to train graduate and undergraduate students in one of the\r\nmost exciting interdisciplinary areas in science (RF, photonics, signal processing and communications).\r\nThe interactions between the researchers at the different institutions will be aided by the close\r\ncollaboration that exists between the members of the group.",
