 "awd_abstract_narration": "Altricial species, such as humans and rats, have a difficult task at birth:  they must be able to identify, remember and prefer their caretaker. This attachment is greatly dependent upon perinatal experiences, especially learning.  For example, human infants learn their mother's voices, faces and odors; rat pups learn their mother's odor, and avian species learn to identify the mother visually and/or aurally.  Generally, infants that require perinatal learning for attachment exhibit unique learning abilities that have been referred to as imprinting, or sensitive period or critical period learning. \r\nOne consistent aspect of early attachment is that the organism appears to have a \r\nvery broad basis for learning an attachment which involves increased ability to \r\nacquire approach responses and a decreased ability to acquire aversions (Bowlby, 1965). These unique infant learning capabilities, which facilitate attachment, appear throughout the animal kingdom and may have evolved to ensure that altricial animals easily form a repertoire of proximity-seeking behaviors, regardless of the specific qualities of the treatment they receive from the primary caretaker.  However, the sensitive periods for attachment must end as animals matures and must learn about the environment away from the nest.  \r\nThey must now be able to learn to acquire approach responses only to special \r\nstimuli and learn to avoid other stimuli. The research proposed in this grant \r\nwill explore the neural mechanisms which help an organism make the transition \r\nfrom one stage of development to the next. While there is some understanding of \r\nthe neural mechanisms that underlie the sensitive period, there is very little \r\nknown about what neural mechanisms cause the sensitive period to end and begin the next stage of the animal's life.  The results of the experiments proposed \r\nhere will begin to characterize those physiological events that are involved in \r\nthe termination of a sensitive period and the emergence of neural structures for \r\nthe next stage of development.\r\nRecent work from this laboratory suggests that corticosterone (a neurohormone \r\ninvolved in stress and other behaviors) plays a critical role in the termination \r\nof the infant's unique learning abilities.  Experiments have been proposed that further characterize the role of corticosterone in the termination of the sensitive period and assess the actions of corticosterone on brain areas important in \r\nlearning: the amygdala, hippocampus and locus coeruleus. \t\r\n\r\n",
