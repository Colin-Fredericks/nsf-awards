 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) \r\r\nStudents preparing to teach in elementary school do not receive adequate exposure to the sciences they will be expected to teach nor do they learn to integrate mathematical concepts with scientific applications. In response to this problem, the Divisions of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and Computer Sciences, working cooperatively with the Division of Education are developing several new courses integrating mathematics, science and technology (MST). Materials and practices will be adapted from the successful Integrated Mathematics and Science curriculum at La Salle University, which is the cornerstone of La Salle's Institute for the Advancement of Mathematics and Science Teaching. These courses are intended to promote scientific and mathematical literacy, overcome math and science phobias, and allow students to see the connections of these disciplines to their own lives. While these courses are initially targeting elementary education/special education pre-service teachers, when fully developed and evaluated, they will become the mathematics and science core required of all non-science students at the college. The MST courses are promoting active learning via proven innovative pedagogies such as inquiry-based cooperative learning exercises and discussions based on selected interdisciplinary themes. Students are designing and implementing investigations as members of collaborative groups and are interpreting these experiments using mathematical concepts and computerized research and analysis tools. They report on their findings in a peer-review forum orally, followed by laboratory reports that reflect an understanding of good scientific writing. Mathematics and science presented in this way, enhanced by use of computer technology and integrated in the college classroom, is enabling pre-service teachers to better integrate mathematics and science with the rest of the elementary school curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
