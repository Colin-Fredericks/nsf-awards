 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program to the University of Arkansas is for the acquisition of a field emission environmental scanning electron microscope. The system is expected to provide a spatial resolution of two nanometer at thirty kilovolt accelerating voltage and at elevated chamber pressure up to ten Torr. This allows imaging of biological or other wet samples without the requirement of conducting coating. The system will be equipped with hot/cold stages and micromanipulators. It includes additional features such as computerized image processing with capability to capture videos of sample evolution. Faculty and students from universities in Arkansas with underrepresented minorities will have remote access to the instrument. The instrument will be used by twenty faculty members along with students and postdocs. The instrument will also support the research and training activities of the Arkansas-Oklahoma Center of Instrumentation and Science for Planetary Surfaces, the Center for Advanced Technology and the MRSEC.  \r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program to the University of Arkansas is for the acquisition of a field emission environmental scanning electron microscope.
