 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims towards developing a unified on-line experimental methodology combined with simulation to determine the dynamic performance of complex structural systems, such as reinforced concrete building with masonry infill walls.  The methodology will be developed in the framework of mixed-variable (diakoptics) pseudodynamic (PSD) approach combined with substructuring.  Moreover, advanced sensors (e.g. fiber optic strain gages and grid-based pressure sensors) for distributed measurements to monitor complex structural systems is an integral part of the proposed research and education project.  The detailed monitoring of the structural response is essential for feedback control during the developed diakoptic PSD testing methodology.  Ultimately, this methodology will be verified using benchmark data from dynamic experiments of a generic hybrid system consisting of bare frames and an infilled frame connected by a reinforced concrete slab.  The PSD testing methodology will be simultaneously applied to the main substructures of this generic hybrid system, namely the flexible bare frame as one physical substructure and the stiff infilled frame as another physical substructure with the connecting slab as a simulated substructure.  The success of the project will lead to advances in experimental research on large-scale structures and recommendations on use and distribution of advanced sensors to monitor the dynamic response of complex structural systems.",
