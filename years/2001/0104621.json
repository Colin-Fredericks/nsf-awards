 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for DMS - 0104621\r\n\r\nThe algebraic-geometric theory of soliton equations developed in the middle \r\nseventies has become one of the most powerful tools in the theory of integrable\r\nmodels, and has had enormous influence on many branches of mathematics and \r\ntheoretical physics. The main objective of the present project\r\nis a further development of this approach to integration of non-linear \r\nequations, models of solid state physics, and models of quantum field theories.\r\nAn immediate goal is to construct integrable models corresponding\r\nto various supersymmetric gauge Seiber-Witten models, \r\nwhich can be instrumental in investigating key physical issues such as \r\nduality, the renormalization group, or instanton corrections.\r\nAnother goal of the project is a classification of commuting difference \r\noperators. Particular attention will be paid to connection of this \r\ntheory with the Hitchin system which is central in modern theory of \r\nthe moduli space of vector bundles over algebraic curve.\r\n\r\nRecent progress in understanding non-perturbative structures in \r\nsupersymmetric gauge theories has shed new insight upon the role of \r\nintegrable structures in modern theoretical physics.\r\nThe nineteenth century saw many aspects of geometry and analysis,\r\nparticularly the development of Abelian functions, drawn together in \r\nthe study of integrable systems. The works of Jacobi, Abel, Riemann \r\nand Weierstrass enabled a number of important integrable\r\nproblems of mechanics and physics to be solved. The modern discovery of \r\nsoliton theory has led to a renewed interest to the theory of integrable \r\nsystems. Nonlinear phenomena could now be treated, and the ever-growing \r\ninterest in this theory is connected with the fact that it is applicable to \r\nequations which possess a remarkable universality property. They arise in the\r\ndescription of the most diverse phenomena in plasma physics, the theory of\r\nelementary particles, the theory of superconductivity and in nonlinear optics.\r\nGeometry and algebraic geometry, functional equations and special functions,\r\nLie algebras and groups all come together in their study. This ubiquity of \r\nintegrable systems together with the beautiful structures that underly them \r\nhas been confirmed recently by discovery of  unexpected relations between the \r\nWhitham perturbation theory of soliton equations developed in earlier works \r\nof the author and the Riemann mapping theorem. It seems urgent to develop \r\nmethods which can identify various Whitham hierarchies with conformal maps \r\nfor more general types of domains. A range of possible applications\r\ninclude flows in porous media, fundamental theory of  pattern formation.\r\n",
