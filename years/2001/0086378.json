 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary- We describe an educational partnership between The University of Akron, the Cuyahoga Valley Environmental Education Center, Bath Township Elementary School, and Akron Public School District that builds an educational community covering K-graduate work in Life Sciences. Each partner will provide expertise in training GK- 12 fellows in research, teacher training, and curriculum and pedagogy development. Impact of our project will stretch well beyond a single school district, to train teachers that come into contact annually with more than 15,000 K- 12 students in over 20 school districts in NE Ohio. A compelling feature of our project is the integration of GK- 12 graduate research projects into content modules that will serve as the organizing theme for teacher professional development and curricular enhancement. Our model moves well beyond the central goal of using GK- 1 2 Fellows as K- 12 content resources. Our approach allows faculty and GK- 12 fellows to integrate their research and teaching goals (an NSF priority) and to provide curricular content that is immediately and directly relevant to the K- 12 institutions. Because each of these partners already cooperate in educational activities, building the comprehensive partnership we describe will benefit from well established lines of communication. Furthermore, extending the existing solid foundation promises that the educational community we seek will have longevity well beyond the granting cycle.\r\n0086378\r\n",
