 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of its high performance, low cost, and compatibility with silicon\r\nCMOS, SiGe HBT technology has recently emerged as a contender for both\r\nmobile and optical networking applications. Current SiGe HBTs designs are\r\nfocused on improving the speed of these devices, while our recent\r\nexperiments have shown that the optimum device structure for wireless\r\napplications are considerably different. Issues important for mobile and\r\noptical networking, such as 1/f noise, phase noise (frequency domain\r\nsideband and time domain jitter), and linearity, have not been researched\r\nas a function of the device structure, or optimized for\r\nthese performance targets.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal is aimed at systematically examining the impact of\r\nbandgap engineering and scaling on all of the device figures-of-merit that\r\nare of interest to both wireless and optical communication IC's, and use\r\nof these results to optimize the SiGe profiles and geometries for next\r\ngeneration SiGe HBTs. We expect the design tradeoffs to be much more\r\ncomplicated than in first generation SiGe HBTs, because of aggressive\r\nvertical and horizontal scaling to achieve high speed operation (as high\r\nas 200GHz cutoff frequency and maximum oscillation frequency). In the\r\nprocess, we will answer scientifically intriguing and technologically\r\nimportant questions, such as why SiGe HBTs with a nonlinear I-V can have\r\nexcellent linearity. This is a brand new area of SiGe device research, and\r\nhas a high potential payoff given the exploding industry interest in\r\napplying SiGe technology to wireless and optical networking systems. The\r\noutcome will include a scientific understanding of important open\r\nquestions on SiGe HBTs, a modification of the design approach and\r\nmethodology, as well as data of the key device figures-of-merit as a\r\nfunction of SiGe profile. Given the enormous amount of interest in\r\napplying SiGe technology to both wireless and optical networking\r\napplications, we will develop an advanced course on SiGe HBTs, so that the\r\noutcome of the proposed research can be remotely accessed by graduate\r\nstudents and practicing engineers in industry.\r\n",
