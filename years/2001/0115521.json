 "awd_abstract_narration": "The legal practice world is undergoing significant change: the changing demographics of American society and of law school applicants, combined with escalating student loan debt, the proliferation of \"alternative\" forms of practice in multinational and multidisciplinary organizations, and widening gaps between private sector and public sector salaries and between corporate and public interest law firms. The proposed research is a longitudinal study that will follow a national cohort of law school graduates, all of whom joined or passed the bar in calendar year 2000, for ten years following graduation. The researchers will rely on mailed surveys to track the careers of over 5000 lawyers, and will conduct in-depth interviews with 500 lawyers. The study draws on a capital assets approach, which is a multidimensional concept integrating work that examines legal careers though the concepts of human and social capital. This approach suggests that law graduates with particular capital assets may be able to maximize their career opportunities and determine their career trajectories more easily than graduates with lesser capital accumulations. By examining individual choices and how they are rewarded, this project will provide crucial information about the forms of capital that are valued and rewarded within the legal profession, any geographic variation in this professional valuation, and how these processes of opportunity and reward may be changing over time. This emphasis on the career trajectories of lawyers will provide a research base that is critical to understanding the future of the legal profession, while also providing data to explore how, in different legal markets across the US, lawyers build their careers in different ways.",
