Students will work directly with faculty and research associates in the department of Astronomy and Space Sciences on a variety of projects including optical, infrared, radio/radar, planetary and high-energy astrophysics topics.  The students' research at Cornell will also provide them the opportunity to participate in astronomical observations at facilities used by Cornell researchers, such as Palomar Observatory, Arecibo Observatory, and other National Astronomy Centers.  Opportunities and funding for students to travel to scientific meetings will be made available.  Students will attend a lecture seminar twice a week by the Astronomy faculty on a wide range of astronomical topics.  The students will be encouraged to present their research findings in a department research forum at the end of their term.  The Undergraduate Observational Astronomy research program will continue to emphasize those students who are women and underrepresented groups and whose own institutions do not provide this type of research experience.  Special efforts will continue to facilitate the logistical and cultural aspects of the students' research experience at Cornell.\r\n***\r\n",
