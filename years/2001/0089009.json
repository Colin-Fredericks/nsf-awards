 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) \r\nWe are developing a radical recombination and restructuring of introductory level computer science courses that pools resources, differentiates knowledge levels in each subject area to fit the needs of different students, allows variable paced learning (not \"self-paced\"), and uses IT both as a teaching tool and to handle course administration.\r\n\r\nWe are developing Web-based learning modules covering the course material at three Bloom's taxonomy levels of technical knowledge: a more minimal level suitable for the needs of information systems and digital media majors; a more technical level for computer engineering majors; and the highest technical level for computer scientists.\r\nThese modules engage students in active, participatory learning activities in a supervised\r\nenvironment. Simultaneously we retain many traditional elements in course delivery, such as group problem-solving sessions and supervised labs, office hours, and weekly deadlines. Course management tools are used to organize on-line materials, track student work at varying levels and paces, and provide student feedback through automated quizzes, surveys, and data mining. Online submission of homework and return of graded homework minimizes the administrative efforts involved in administering large courses and allows faculty to focus more on the students and their learning.\r\n",
