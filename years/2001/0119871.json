 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nEnhancing Diversity in Buffalo, New York, Area Geoscience Programs\r\n\r\nA consortium of three State University of New York Institutions, led by the University at Buffalo, is developing a comprehensive program for the attraction of underrepresented groups to their geoscience programs and for the retention of these students. The program begins with the offering of new earth science courses at Erie Community College (ECC), and then leads either to the earth science education program (BSEd/MSEd) at Buffalo State College (BSC) or to the geology BA/BS program at the University at Buffalo (UB).  ECC's City Campus serves a student population that includes over 50% underrepresented groups. It is the most common destination of students from the Buffalo Public Schools, whose student body is comprised of over 70% individuals from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe UB program includes: a continuing research program in which every student participates in ongoing research in one of the laboratories in the department; a research development seminar in which preparation of proposals and presentation of results is emphasized; a weekly seminar which includes attending professional talks, plus attendance at selected professional meetings, and discussion of the talks; a summer course in field techniques, including soil and hydrologic methods used in the consulting industry;  a program of regular mentoring and tutoring for all participants; and participation in geology department/club activities on a regular basis. The program is designed to prepare the student to continue on for a Master's degree and potentially for a Ph.D.  At BSC the program includes participation in ongoing research in the department plus a summer transition program and a field experience in a secondary education course. Students in the program may also continue graduate work at UB.  The program is fully integrated with the extensive existing programs for students from underrepresented groups at each institution.\r\n",
