 "awd_abstract_narration": "The consortium between Michigan State University and Florida State\r\nUniversity proposes the construction of a highly efficient,\r\nlarge-area neutron detector for the detection of high-energy\r\nneutrons to be used in experiments with fast rare isotopes at the\r\nNational Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). This\r\nconsortium is joined by Ball State University, Central Michigan\r\nUniversity, Concordia College in Moorhead, Minn., Hope College,\r\nIndiana University at South Bend, Millikin University, Western\r\nMichigan University, and Westmont College, each of which will\r\nassemble and test one complete layer of the detector.\r\n\r\nThe proposed detector consists of 144 horizontal blocks of plastic\r\nscintillator arranged in 9 layers of 16 detectors each, covering an\r\narea of 2.0 m wide by 1.6 m high.  The detector is position\r\nsensitive and features multi-hit capability.  The addition of\r\npassive iron converters enhances the detection efficiency for\r\nneutrons with energies above 100 MeV for an average efficiency of up\r\nto 70%.  The high detection efficiency will allow the investigation\r\nof very neutron-rich nuclei that can only be produced with small\r\nintensities.\r\n\r\nThe detector will be used in connection with the new sweeper magnet\r\nwith its focal plane detectors in stand-alone mode as well as with\r\nthe combination of sweeper magnet and the S800 magnetic\r\nspectrograph.  It will therefore be essential for the experimental\r\nprogram at the coupled cyclotron facility. The detector can be\r\noptimized for even higher beam energies with only minor\r\nmodifications due to its modular design.  It could be the first\r\ndetector to be used for fast fragmentation beams at the Rare Isotope.",
