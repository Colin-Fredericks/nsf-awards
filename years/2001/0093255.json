The PI will conduct research to link microbial species with ecological function by measuring the synthesis of ribosomal RNAs. This grant will support research that establishes a new approach to understanding microbial activities in nature.  By measuring the incorporation of 13C into species-specific ribosomal RNAs, it will be possible to assign activities to natural microbial populations.  This tool will be used to understand the ecology of methane oxidizing bacteria.  These organisms are responsible for slowing the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from acidic northern wetlands.  Some methanotroph genera (Methylomonas, Methylococcus) appear to be adapted to high oxygen and low methane concentrations, while other species (Methylosinus, Methylocystis) prefer the converse.  13C-capture probing will be used to investigate the activity of methanotroph populations in nature.  By better understanding the ecology of these organisms, it will be possible to predict and perhaps control the release of methane from a globally significant source.\r\n\r\nThis is a CAREER award and the PI will develop novel courses and devote a significant effort toward community outreach.  The PI will use cooperative learning as an alternative teaching approach to maximize student interaction and increase achievement and retention.  This grant will provide leadership training to promote cooperative learning in science education.  Course improvements will act as a catalyst for reform across the curriculum.  This grant will create a research and education infrastructure to attract and build relationships with a growing biotechnology industry in the region.  This grant will also support active recruitment and mentoring of underrepresented student groups to retain them in the sciences.\r\n",
