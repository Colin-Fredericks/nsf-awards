This grant will support  the largest effort to date to solve the major questions in the  evolution of the arthropods.  The arthropods --  which include  insects, shrimp, centipedes, horshoe crabs, spiders and ticks --  represent more species than the rest of the animals combined.  Despite more than a decade of molecular work, the relationships of  these major groups of arthropods are not known. This grant will use  information from the three completely sequenced animal genomes  (human, worm, and fly) to help us obtain a giant dataset of nuclear  protein coding sequences from 85 representative arthropod species.  This dataset will include approximately 50,000 base pairs of DNA  sequences per species, which is more than 10 times larger than the  largest existing dataset.\r\n\r\nThis project will not only decide the  relationships of the major groups of arthropods, but will tell us  which group of marine crustaceans (shrimps , lobsters and crabs) are  the closest relatives to the insects, which represent the most  successful invasion of land by any animal group.  This grant will  also support development of new statistical methods to estimate the  dates of the major events in arthropod evolution, and, includes an  innovative plan to develop teaching modules to expose underprivileged  K-12 students in the Los Angeles region, and elsewhere in the country, to the evolution of the charismatic Arthropoda.\r\n\r\n",
