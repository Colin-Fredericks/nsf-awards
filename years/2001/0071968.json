 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award is to a senior professor for a project dedicated to a comprehensive study of the phenomenon of \"exchange bias.\"  The project consists of state of the art growth, structural, chemical and magnetic characterization, and measurement of physical properties using a broad range of techniques.  The aim is to develop an increased understanding of the phenomenon that occurs when two dissimilar magnetic materials are placed in contact with each other.  The exchange bias forms the basis for a number of applications that use the so called \"spin valve\" technology for magnetic storage and sensors.  Although the phenomenon is used in many applications, a basic understanding is lacking.  Issues that will be addressed by this research include, the influence of structural and magnetic parameters, and the effect of interfacial parameters such as roughness and interdiffusion.  Through a thorough experimental attack, a better understanding of the phenomenon should be obtained.  This will have a direct impact on related technologies.  Students and postdocs working on this project will acquire technical and fundamental knowledge and skills that can be lead to careers in basic or applied research in academia, industry, or government laboratories.\r\n%%%\r\nThis individual investigator award is to a senior professor for a project dedicated to the study of a phenomenon known as \"exchange bias\", which occurs when two dissimilar magnetic materials are in contact with each other.  This phenomenon appears in a variety of material configurations (i.e. thin films, small particles, etc.) and is an important ingredient in a number of sensor applications.  Although the phenomenon is used in a 55 billion dollars industry, there is little basic understanding of its origin.  Basic research along these lines may have an important effect on the development of novel sensors and improved magnetic storage.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are essential collaborators in this work.  They will not only help in advancing our understanding of this important phenomenon, but will also acquire a broad range of technical skills that will serve them whether they are interested in careers in academia or  the sensor and storage industries.  This is an ideal area of research in which basic research can have a direct, relevant impact on industries and technology of crucial importance to the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
