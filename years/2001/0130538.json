The compute server (Microway, Inc.) is a cluster computer containing 64 Intel Pentium III microprocessors and 16 GB of memory organized into 32 nodes connected by 100 Mb Ethernet.  The visualization workstation (Sun Microsystems) is a workstation with one 900 MHz UltraSPARC-III microprocessor, 1 GB of memory, and the intermediate level of Sun's three levels of 3-D graphics hardware accelerators.\r\n\r\nThis equipment will support 3 projects which concern computational mathematics including multi-dimensional quadratures, transforms, and numerical optimization.  The unifying theme is numerical optimization, especially global optimization.  The projects are divided according to application and include 3-D reconstruction problems in structural biology and systems design problems for nonlinear communication channels.  The main application is structural biology, in particular, the structural biology of viruses.  The problems of particular interest are 3-D signal reconstruction problems for computing the dynamical behavior of viruses from a variety of biophysical measurements.\r\n",
