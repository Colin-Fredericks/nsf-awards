 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extremely halophilic archaea inhabit brine pools containing 3-5 M NaCl, which are\r\nextraordinarily diverse and dynamic with respect to salinity, pH, temperature, pressure, nutrients,\r\netc.  In addition to their obligately halophilic character,some are also acidophilic, alkaliphilic,\r\npsychrophilic, barophilic, or slightly thermophilic. Extreme halophiles are easily cultured in the\r\nlaboratory and are excellent experimental systems with well-developed genetic tools. However,\r\nthus far, only a single genome from an extremely halophilic archaeon, Halobacterium species\r\nNRC-1, has been sequenced. In order to study the genomic diversity of extreme halophiles, we\r\nplan to sequence the genome of Haloarcula marismortui, a metabolically versatile halophile with\r\na high-resolution ribosome structure. If time and resources permit, additional genomic analysis\r\nwill be conducted on diverse strains, including Natrialba asiatica, a non-pigmented alkaliphile.\r\nHalorubrum lacusprofundi, a psychrophile capable of growing at temperatures down to 4oC,\r\nHalosimplex carlsbadense, a likely ancient halophile recently isolated from a Permian brine\r\ninclusion, which appears to be a genetic chimera, and Halobacterium species GRB, a closely\r\nrelated strain to NRC-1.  Sequencing will be conducted at the Institute for Systems Biology and\r\nannotation will be done at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, Center of Marine\r\nBiotechnology. This project will provide better understanding of biodiversity among extreme\r\nhalophiles, including genome structure and evolution, adaptation to extreme environments, and\r\nlateral gene transfer. In the long term, the proposed work should provide novel applications in\r\nbiotechnology, e.g. engineering salt tolerance in crop plants and development of new antibiotics. This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative program between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems.",
