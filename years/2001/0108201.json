 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitochondrial phylogenomics:  Investigation of fish phylogeny and nucleotide character sampling in large-scale phylogenetic analysis\r\n\r\n\tMolecular systematics employs variation in DNA to reconstruct historical\r\nrelationships among organisms and investigate evolutionary processes that\r\nhave given rise to the earth's biodiversity.  The growing volume of DNA\r\nsequence data and the increasing number of characters and/or species that\r\nmay be included in evolutionary investigations have placed greater\r\nimportance on methods of phylogenetic analysis and experimental design.  It\r\nis intuitive that the more data that can be applied to a phylogenetic\r\nquestion, the greater the probability of recovering an accurate estimate of\r\nthe phylogeny.  Although phylogenetic accuracy may be positively correlated\r\nwith the number of species sampled from a particular group, a fundamental\r\nquestion in molecular systematics remains: How many nucleotide characters\r\nare required to resolve the phylogeny of a given number of species,\r\nparticularly when all (or most) of the extant members of a group have been\r\nsampled?  This project will employ a large, robust phylogeny to investigate\r\nthe sensitivity of phylogenetic analysis to nucleotide character sampling.\r\n\r\nThe ray-finned fishes (class Actinopterygii) exhibit extreme diversity\r\nwith more extant described species than all other vertebrate groups\r\ncombined and are of major ecological and economic importance.  Despite\r\nextensive morphological study, phylogenetic relationships among many\r\nactinopterygian lineages remain unclear.  This project will compile a data\r\nset of complete mitochondrial genomes from 73 species of ray-finned fishes,\r\nincluding representatives of 32 (out of 42) orders and extensive sampling\r\nfrom the two largest orders, Cypriniformes and Perciformes.  Mitochondrial\r\ngenomes are small chromosomes that are inherited independently of the\r\nmajority of DNA found in the nucleus.  The clonal, maternal inheritance of\r\nmitochondrial DNA makes it particularly useful in phylogenetic studies.  \r\n\t\r\nMitochondrial genome sequences, along with nuclear gene sequences, will be\r\nused to generate a robust hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships among\r\nthe most important lineages of ray-finned fishes.  This data set will\r\nreveal patterns of diversification among fishes and provide important\r\ninsights on the evolution of early vertebrates.  The mitochondrial data, in\r\nconjunction with the best phylogenetic hypothesis, will then be used to\r\ninvestigate nucleotide sampling properties in phylogenetic analysis.\r\nSub-samples of different numbers of species will be drawn from the group of\r\n73 species.  For each sub-sample, the number of nucleotides required to\r\nrecover the correct phylogeny, with various levels of support, will be\r\ndetermined.  The influence of several important evolutionary parameters on\r\nphylogenetic accuracy will be investigated.  These parameters include a)\r\nthe frequency of variable nucleotide sites in the sample; b) the amount of\r\nevolutionary divergence among taxa; c) the amount of evolutionary rate\r\nvariation among included lineages; and d) the extent and distribution of\r\nnucleotide compositional bias among sampled taxa.  The results will provide\r\na deeper understanding of the behavior of nucleotide data in phylogenetic\r\nanalysis and should identify a range of nucleotide sample sizes required\r\nfor accurate estimation of phylogeny as a function of the number of taxa\r\nunder investigation and relevant evolutionary conditions.  Such objective\r\ncriteria for experimental design will be of practical benefit to the field\r\nof molecular systematics by providing guidance in budgeting and allocation\r\nof resources and by improving the efficiency and accuracy of molecular\r\nphylogenetic studies.\r\n\r\n",
