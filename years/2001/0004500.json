Theofaneous, University of California Santa Barbara\r\n\r\nThe current use of magnetic resonance imaging is mostly found in static medical situations where proton nuclear spin polarization is exposed to an applied magnetic field. The resulting changes in polarization yield, through reconstruction analysis, a mapping of the surrounding state properties, especially density and velocity fields. Limitations of this technique appear in the case of large, low density media, where signal to noise ratios become excessively low (e.g. gases, multiphase).\r\nThis proposal means to substitute to the protons (1H) a hyperpolarized noble gas (such as 129Xe), which will yield much stronger signals, and therefore better accuracy. Similarly, increased pressures (and therefore, densities) will help make gas-phase imaging a possibility. It is noted that strong applied magnetic fields are less critical in the hyperpolarized cases since their polarization is externally supplied. Thus the practicality of low field imaging would be another opportunity for large dimension systems.\r\nThe PI proposes to explore the potential of this hyperpolarization approach, as applied to multiphase, large size flows. The experimental effort will aim at establishing the broad limits of this technique. It will include in particular the design of a laser enhanced device for the optical pumping of highly polarized gases. There exists now, in the PI's lab, an extensive experimental apparatus, directly usable in the proposed research. The quality of the team under Dr. Theofanous is outstanding. It is expected that such work will lead to a clear definition of desirable directions for multiphase diagnostics research.\r\n\r\n",
