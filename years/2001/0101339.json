 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Focused Research Group is composed of pure\r\nmathematicians, computational mathematicians, and\r\nneuroscientists.  They develop implementations of discrete\r\nconformal mapping for multidisciplinary use, both within\r\nmathematics itself where complex analysis is being reinvigorated\r\nby new discrete techniques, and in the larger scientific context\r\nwith visualization and analysis of scientific data.  The Riemann\r\nMapping Theorem guarantees unique conformal maps between any pair\r\nof conformal 2-discs (or conformal 2-spheres); the conformal\r\ngeometry preserved by such maps carries valuable mathematical\r\nstructure.  Such surfaces arise naturally in many scientific\r\ncontexts as piecewise flat (from data) or smoothly embedded (from\r\ntheory) surfaces in 3-space.  Recently the new computational\r\ntechnique of circle packing has allowed computational\r\napproximations to these conformal maps.  Implementing such\r\napproximations for large scientific datasets faces both\r\ntheoretical and computational challenges.  The investigator and\r\nhis colleagues work on three related topics: theoretical\r\nsuperstructure of the circle packing technique, refinement and\r\nparallelization of the circle packing algorithm for use on large\r\ndatasets, and the application of these conformal maps to\r\nvisualization and analysis of scientific data.  The main\r\napplication focuses on conformal flattening of human brain\r\ncortical surfaces.  The investigators use uniqueness of conformal\r\nmaps to install surface-based coordinate systems on these\r\nsurfaces; these coordinate systems allow localization of\r\nactivation foci in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and\r\nfunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain scans.\r\nConformal flattening has wider applicability as a visualization\r\nand graph embedding technique, and these connections inform the\r\nresearch.\r\n     This Focused Research Group develops algorithms to bring a\r\nclassical mathematics theorem (the Riemann Mapping Theorem, 1854)\r\nto bear on problems of visualization of data.  The Riemann Mapping\r\nTheorem guarantees the existence of unique conformal\r\n(angle-preserving) maps between surfaces, but does say how to\r\ncompute these maps.  Modern computers and new algorithms have\r\nchanged all that, because our new computational ability can\r\nbreathe life into classical existence theorems of mathematics,\r\nturning theory into computational tools.  This project develops\r\nalgorithms to implement the computation of conformal maps on\r\ncomplex spatial surfaces.  The main application is the flat\r\nmapping of human brain cortical surfaces.  The brain surface is\r\nhighly convoluted and folded in space, and most of the brain\r\nsurface is folded up and hidden from view.  If one flattens the\r\nsurface, one can simultaneously see down into all the folds.  The\r\nmathematically unique conformal maps produced by the algorithms\r\nallow surface-based coordinate systems to be computed on the\r\nbrain surface so that surface positions can be precisely\r\ndetermined.  Moreover, if one puts foci of functional activation\r\nonto the flattened surface, one can then visualize and measure\r\nthe relationship between brain function and brain anatomy.  These\r\nnew surface-mapping techniques and their application to the brain\r\nsurface permit biomedical researchers and clinicians to rapidly\r\nand accurately map and compare the locations of physiological and\r\npathological \"events\" in the brains of research subjects and of\r\npatients with a variety of neurological and psychiatric\r\ndisorders.  The project is supported by the Computational\r\nMathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Geometric Analysis programs\r\nand the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and by the\r\nComputational Neuroscience program in BIO.\r\n",
