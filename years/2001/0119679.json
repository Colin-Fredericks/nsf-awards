 "awd_abstract_narration": "Submitted under the guidelines for Centers for Learning and Teaching, the Appalachian Collaborative Center for Learning, Assessment and Instruction in Mathematics (ACCLAIM) is a five-year project designed to build a mathematics infrastructure in the Appalachian regions of Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.  ACCLAIM is a collaborative partnership among the University of Kentucky (UK), Ohio University (OU), the University of Tennessee (UT), and Marshall (MU) with the Appalachian Rural Systemic Initiative (ARSI).   The mathematics infrastructure in Appalachia will be enhanced through:\r\n(a) advanced degree programs in mathematics and mathematics education, \r\n(b) job-embedded teacher preparation and professional development programs, and \r\n(c) education research in a rural context. \r\n\r\nThe two goals are to: \r\n(a) build mathematics capacity and expertise in the Appalachian regions of Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia through advanced degree programs in mathematics education and through research that connects mathematics and rural education; and \r\n(b) improve the quality of mathematics teaching at the middle and high school levels in the Appalachian region through the development of collaborative networks and innovative delivery systems.  \r\n\r\nTo meet these goals, ACCLAIM will create and implement four interconnected initiatives: \r\n\r\n1.  Capacity Building:  Doctoral cohorts of 20 students every two years, masters/specialists cohorts of 30 students every year.\r\n2.  Professional Development:  Professional Development Teams in middle and high schools.\r\n3.  Teacher Education:  Appalachian Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators -- (AAMTE) fall and spring conferences and a listserv, needs assessment of teacher education  programs, and undergraduate courses online and telelink.\r\n4.  Research:  Research agenda focused on mathematics education in rural contexts:  a) stimulate research, b) oversee and coordinate data collection and analysis, c) publish or disseminate best practices, d) serve as a clearinghouse for research findings, publish a newsletter -- \"The Rural Mathematics Educator.\"\r\n",
