They plan to investigate novel computing systems, which can be configured into one of several different parallel system organizations in order to meet the diverse requirements of software programs.  A simulation-based model of the hardware will be developed and used to evaluate how diverse multimedia, scientific, commercial database, and business programs can be accelerated with this architecture.  Key to this effort will be the development of compilers that can analyze application software characteristics so as to select the optimal hardware configuration for each phase of program execution.\r\n\r\nScope: The proposed research will leverage the expertise of the US team in developing high performance adaptive architecture, and the Egyptian team in designing parallel software and compilers.  This collaboration is expected to significantly benefit research in the information technology area in each country.  The project will involve a US graduate student who will gain an experience in international scientific collaboration.  The proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.",
