The conference series, which \r\nwill rotate among these institutions on an annual basis, would provide \r\nboth a venue for the presentation of problems in industrial and \r\ninterdisciplinary mathematics and a forum for the discussion of ways to \r\nbroaden the traditional curriculum in order to prepare mathematicians for \r\nindustrial and interdisciplinary positions. The conferences would bring \r\ntogether researchers from both academia and industry, enabling cross-\r\nfertilization between the programs in the Intermountain/Southwest \r\nregion, and providing a venue for the students to present their work and \r\ninteract with other students, faculty, and representatives from industry.\r\n\r\nThe first of these annual meetings will be held at Utah State University \r\nin Logan, UT in February 2002. The two-day meeting will include \r\nsessions for invited talks by researchers from academia and industry, a \r\nround-table discussion involving faculty and industry representatives, \r\nsessions of shorter contributed talks and/or poster sessions, a special \r\nsession involving only graduate students, and an informational session \r\nfor undergraduates. The round-table discussion would focus on (a) \r\nintegrating the needs of local industry into the mathematics curriculum \r\nand (b) current research activities in the region. For the first meeting, \r\nrepresentatives from the Boeing Company have already agreed to attend \r\nand individuals at Motorola, Intel, IBM, and Hewlett Packard have been \r\napproached.  Participation is also expected by faculty members from \r\ndepartments of physics, electrical and computer engineering, computer \r\nscience, and industrial engineering. Faculty and students from other \r\nuniversities in the region and from broader areas will be invited to \r\nattend.\r\n\r\nThis conference series will be jointly supported by the Applied \r\nMathematics Program and the Infrastructure Program of the Division of \r\nMathematical Sciences and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities \r\nof the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n",
