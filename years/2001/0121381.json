 "awd_abstract_narration": "A group of Mechanical Engineering Department Heads proposes to hold a 2-day workshop to develop new ideas by which to broaden the basis upon which mechanical engineering profession has relied.  The goal of the workshop is the redefine the field of mechanical engineering by increasing the breadth of mechanical engineering from one that is traditionally based on physics to one that is based also on other fields of science and engineering, such as biological sciences, information technology, material science, and medicine.\r\n\r\nThe changing nature of engineering, one that no longer has clear demarcations or boundaries with other disciplines and technologies, requires new emphasis in mechanical engineering on areas of research and education that have not been considered as part of the traditional discipline.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the workshop is to explore ways by which we can make mechanical engineering education and research more responsive to the changes in other technologies and disciplines, and also make it more attractive to the best and the brightest, including women and traditionally underrepresented, groups of students and faculty.\r\n",
