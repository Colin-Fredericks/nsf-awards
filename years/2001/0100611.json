 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nRecently, we observed that organic semiconductor device shows strong bistable states with remarkably differing electrical conductivities when it is structure right.  The transition from an electrically insulating state to a conducting state in the device is accompanied by a drastic increase in injection current by as much as six orders of magnitude.  The retention of the high conductivity state was observed even after switching off the power.  Furthermore, the low conductive states can be re-established by applying a negative voltage pulse.  These discoveries pave the way for potential applications such as low-cost, large-area, electrically addressable high-density data storage devices, organic switches, and sensors.  This newly invented organic device is significant for two reasons.  First, this device uses organic insulators as the active material, thereby providing new options for organic electronic devices, which have been traditionally associated with organic semiconductors.  Second, electronic memory is a very important component in all electronic devices such as computers, cell phones, PDAs etc.  It is anticipated that the successful development of this device as memory cells will have a tremendous impact in the electronic industry.  Unfortunately, the mechanism of this device, for example the sudden change in electrical conductivity at ~3V; and the reason behind the retention of the high conductivity state even after switching off the power, is not yet clearly understood.  Our goal of this project is to gain the understanding of the organic bistable device, from both experimental and theoretical modeling approaches.  Based on the obtained results, we will try to further improve device performance and to realize other applications.\r\n",
