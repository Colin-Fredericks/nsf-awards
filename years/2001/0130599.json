Michael Traffic Operations Laboratory in the area of experimental wireless communications research and intelligent transportation systems. \r\n\r\nFour research projects will be directly enhanced by the availability of the above resources: 1) Wireless ad-hoc networking for dedicated short range communications applications in intelligent transportation systems, 2) Reduced complexity receivers for continuous phase modulations, 3) Reduced-dimension decision feedback equalizers for high-speed wireless communications, and 4) Embedded signal processing for intelligent transportation systems.\r\n\r\nThe communications research involved in the projects above is focused on synchronization, channel estimation and equalization, and low complexity receivers for both linear and non-linear modulations. End-to-end network performance is also considered, as is the design of simplified protocols for use in ad-hoc networking. The signal processing research is largely experimental involving the integration of different intelligent transportation subsystems including communications and embedded signal processing for traffic signal control and weigh-in-motion.\r\n",
