 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improving the publics\" understanding of the scientific enterprise and improving scientific\r\nliteracy have been identified as critical goals in the United States. Science learning\r\noccurs in formal (i.e. classroom) as well as in informal (i.e. backyards) settings and there\r\nare likely to be, at least, qualitative differences in outcomes between these learning\r\nenvironments. It is critical that scientists collaborate with professional science educators\r\nnot only to identify the components of scientific literacy, but also to understand how\r\nlearning occurs in these different settings and to help provide this information to other\r\nscientists and educators who will be ultimately responsible for the education of the\r\npopulation in both formal and informal settings. This proposal seeks funding to continue\r\nand complete the important research that I began as a National Science Foundation\r\nPFSMETE Fellow and to support the preliminary research and development of two other\r\nprojects that have resulted directly from my post-doctoral position. For the former, I am\r\nproposing to analyze, present and publish my ongoing work on understanding the factors\r\nthat most affect student attitudes and motivation in an established Student/Scientist\r\nPartnership, Forest Watch. The new projects include a study of the effects of a\r\ncommunity data collection program called Neighborhood Nestwatch on scientific literacy\r\nin participants, and the development and implementation of two environmental education\r\ncourses at Paul Smith's College that will be the cornerstones for the creation of an\r\nenvironmental science education emphasis within the Natural Resource Bachelor of\r\nScience degree.\r\n",
