 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hanin\r\n0109895\r\n     The goal of the project is to gain a new quantitative\r\ninsight, on the basis of advanced mathematical methods, into\r\nkinetics of biological processes in irradiated cell populations.\r\nThe investigator formulates and analyzes a comprehensive\r\nmechanistic mathematical model of these processes, including\r\nformation of radiation-induced lesions and their repair,\r\nmisrepair and fixation, cell cycling and cell death.  Mathematical\r\nmodeling techniques include general age-dependent branching\r\nstochastic processes, queueing systems, stochastic simulation,\r\nand modern methods of statistical inference.  Parameters of the\r\nmodel are estimated from experimental data on kinetics and\r\nsurvival of cells in synchronized cultures of S3 HeLa and V79\r\ncells exposed to continuous irradiation at various dose rates.\r\nParameter estimation is based on a comprehensive stochastic\r\nsimulation model of the underlying biological processes and on\r\nmethods of stochastic optimization in the maximum likelihood\r\nsetting.  The model is applied to stationary and exponential cell\r\ncultures that serve as experimental counterparts of tumor cell\r\npopulations at different stages of tumor development.  The\r\ndistribution of the number of surviving clonogenic cells at the\r\nend of radiation exposure, obtained from the comprehensive\r\nsimulation model of cell population kinetics, is compared with\r\nexplicit formulas for this distribution within simpler birth and\r\ndeath Markov models that resulted from the preliminary studies.\r\nThe most important biological outcome of this work consists of\r\nthe set of estimates of unobservable model parameters, which are\r\ninterpretable in biologically appealing terms of repair processes\r\nand cell kinetics.  The project has a significant impact on\r\nevaluation, prediction and optimization of the efficacy of\r\nradiation cancer treatment and associated methods of cure rate\r\nestimation.\r\n     A remarkable progress in cell biology and radiation biology\r\nsince the 1920's has resulted in a prodigious amount of\r\nexperimental data comprising all aspects of cell responses to\r\nionizing radiation.  These data represent an invaluable source of\r\ninformation for furthering our knowledge about intracellular\r\nprocesses in normal and irradiated cells.  However, to a large\r\nextent, this gold mine of experimental findings amassed over\r\nyears remains unclaimed.  The investigator and his collaborators\r\nattempt to understand and describe mathematically the most basic\r\nprocesses in normal and irradiated cells.  This is accomplished on\r\nthe basis of advanced mathematical, statistical and computational\r\nmethods applied to the original experimental data describing\r\nresponses of several cell lines to radiation exposure at variable\r\ndose rate.  The project was triggered by and has far-reaching\r\nimplications for cancer radiotherapy.\r\n",
