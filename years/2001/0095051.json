The researchers will combine the genetic models and tools for diploid wheat, Triticum monococcum, developed at Davis with the characterization procedures for frost tolerance and vernalization developed at Martonvasar.  Their goal is to determine how to cone the genes responsible for frost tolerance in wheat.\r\n\r\nUsing a combination of positional cloning and differential display approaches, their joint research plan includes: 1) construction of a detailed chromosomal map for a new found gene affecting frost tolerance in wheat, Fr-Am2, on the chromosome 5AmL of T. monococcum; 2) mapping the regulatory loci of winter hardiness, cor14b, a cold-inducible expression on T. monococcum; and 3) mapping the stress induced genes, identified by differential display and deletion and substitution of chromosome 5A in hexaploid wheat.  Successfully identified cDNA clones will be incorporated into T. monococcum maps.\r\n\r\nMolecular markers tightly linked to the frost tolerance genes will be used to screen the Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library of T. monococcum to characterize the complete genes and their regulatory elements.  Results are expected to relate controlling loci to inducible genes.  If successful, the new information may contribute to our basic understanding of the physiological and biochemical bases for freeze tolerance, which is an agriculturally important plant trait. \r\n\r\nThis international project in plant genome research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
