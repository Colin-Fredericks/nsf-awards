 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on Ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), an anthropogenic chelating agent widely used in industrial processes, household cleaners, and consumer food and health products. EDTA can persist in the environment when biodegradation by microorganisms is slow. Environmental effects of chelating agents have not been fully explored while uses (particularly in chlorine free bleaching applications) are increasing rapidly. The plan focuses on understanding the interactions of chemistry and biology that control the fate of EDTA and on expanding public understanding of environmental systems and non-biodegradable contaminants.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the plan are as follows:\r\n   Evaluate the effect of co-contaminant metals on the biodegradation of EDTA.\r\n   Investigate the effect of intermediate formation on the biodegradation of EDTA.\r\n   Increase understanding of the knowledge and skills of environmental engineering among\r\n       undergraduate and graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University.\r\n   Enhance the awareness of secondary teachers to the fundamentals of environmental  \r\n       engineering and the scientific method.\r\n   Encourage women and minority students to pursue environmental engineering.\r\n   Develop a national reputation as a strong researcher and dedicated educator.\r\n\r\nThe research, education, and outreach objectives are designed to be integrative. Results in the laboratory and in modeling methodologies will be used as examples and case studies in undergraduate classes, as problems in advanced graduate classes, and as discussion points in outreach activities with secondary teachers. The interactions with teachers and students during outreach activities will be used to raise the awareness of future engineers about their role in advancing scientific literacy. The P.I.'s training and experience as a high school teacher will allow the use of interactions with educators at all levels to enhance teaching skills and continue development of creative classroom activities.  Activities that are unique to this project include development of a course module on the use, regulation and environmental effects of anthropogenic chelating agents, and hosting high school teachers for summer research in my laboratory.\r\n\r\n",
