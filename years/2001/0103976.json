Recent\r\nsuccesses with topological 4-manifolds suggest the time is ripe\r\nto try to formulate surgery obstructions for arbitrary\r\nfundamental groups. Improved understanding of handlebody\r\nstructures and a new construction of topological field theories\r\nin dimension 4 offer hopes for combinatorially-defined invariants\r\nof smooth 4-manifolds. In the controlled area recent work with\r\nRanicki has provided a proof of an elusive stability theorem for\r\ncontrolled surgery obstructions. This may point the way to a full\r\ndescription of the groups as generalized homology, analogous to\r\nearlier descriptions of the end and controlled h-cobordism\r\nobstructions. Such a description would have applications ranging\r\nfrom local structure in stratified sets to sharpening 2-torsion\r\nconclusions in some cases of the Novikov conjecture.\r\n\r\nThis project explores the boundary between the discrete and\r\ncontinuous worlds. Geometry and analysis (continuous points of\r\nview) have revealed strange behavior in dimension 4. In terms of\r\nthe mathematics used in physics, other dimensions are \"classical\"\r\nwhile dimension 4 seems to be \"quantum.\"  Topologically\r\n4-dimensional objects are described in terms of 3-dimensional\r\nbuilding blocks (a discrete point of view), particularly knots\r\nand links in 3-space. One objective is to bridge the gap between\r\nthese two views, and in particular understand the quantum\r\nbehavior from the topological point of view. In higher dimensions\r\nalgebraic and qualitative topology (e.g.  surgery theory) are\r\ndiscrete points of view. Twenty years ago the PI bridged the gap\r\nbetween this and local continuous topology in one case,\r\n\"pseudoisotopy.\" This has had numerous applications. Many more\r\napplications await a widening of this bridge to include other\r\ncases, for instance algebraic K-theory and surgery, but the\r\nmethods are complex and intensely technical and have so far\r\nresisted extension. The other objective of the project is to\r\ncarry through these generalizations.\r\n",
