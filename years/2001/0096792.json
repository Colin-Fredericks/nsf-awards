 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for standard reference materials in the ocean sciences has become recognized as a high priority issue by the scientific community.  This recognition stems from the fact that standards provide a means of quality control for analytical measurements that are made by an increasing number of laboratories not only in the United States but abroad.  For this reason, the PI will set up a committee of 12 members to: (1) compile a list of important oceanographic research questions that may benefit from reference standards; (2) create a comprehensive list of reference materials currently available for oceanographic studies; (3) identify and prioritize the reference materials needed to study the identified research questions; (4) determine for each priority analyte whether reference materials and/or analytical methods should be standardized; and (5) identify the most effective means for developing and producing standard reference materials for ocean sciences.  Members of the committee will be selected from scientists in the four major oceanographic disciplines (biological, chemical, physical, geological), as well as from individuals outside the realm of the ocean science community such as analytical chemists already involved in the development and production of reference standards.  The committee will meet four times, convene one workshop and solicit input from the scientific community via a World Wide Website or via direct communications with investigators in the ocean sciences field.   Three separate products will results from this study.  Initially, a suggested list of standard reference materials needed by the ocean research community will be provided.  Secondly, an assessment of responsibilities for who will produce the reference material and the cost associated with production of these standards will be documented.  Lastly, the committee will make a recommendation of which analytical methods need to be standardized.",
