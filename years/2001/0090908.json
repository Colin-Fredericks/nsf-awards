 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFilamentous fungi grow as a cellular syncytium where individual cells are\r\ninterconnected by perforate crosswalls. Cell lysis in these systems triggers a rapid\r\nmechanism of septal pore sealing that is mediated by a dense-core vesicle known as the\r\nWoronin body. The Woronin body has been observed in over 50 species but its origin in\r\nthe peroxisome and function associated with the cellular response to cell lysis have only\r\nrecently been defined at the molecular level (Jedd and Chua, 2000). In the model system\r\nNeurospora crassa, the Woronin-body core is comprised of Hex1, a protein that is both\r\nnecessary and sufficient for Woronin-body core formation. Deletion of the HEX1 gene\r\neliminates the Woronin body from the cytoplasm and produces hyphae that bleed\r\ncytoplasm following cell lysis. Thus, Hex1 defines a novel peroxisomal vesicle that\r\nfunctions in the cellular response to cell lysis.\r\nThe goal of this research is to understand basic mechanisms of Woronin body\r\nbiogenesis and function. As part of this effort, the following specific aims will be\r\naddressed. i) Woronin-body associated proteins will be identified. The Woronin body\r\nwill be biochemically purified and associated proteins identified by amino acid\r\nsequencing. Corresponding genes will then be cloned and analyzed to assess their role in\r\nthe biogenesis and function of the Woronin body using genetic, biochemical and cell\r\nbiological techniques. ii) The conservation of Woronin body structure and function will\r\nbe determined by analyzing HEX1 and recently identified HEX1 alternative-splicing\r\nvariants in several model ascomycetes using genetic and cell biological techniques. iii) A\r\nmechanism of Woronin body formation will be determined by analyzing the phenotype of\r\nWoronin-body-associated protein deletion strains and by reconstituting Woronin body\r\nformation in yeast cells using heterologous expression of Hex1 and protein interactants. In\r\naddition, the crystal structure of Hex1 will be determined and used to identify amino acid\r\nresidues that mediate Hex1 self-assembly. Mutations in these residues will then be used to\r\ndetermine how Hex1 self-assembly influences Woronin body biogenesis. iv) The\r\nimportance of the Woronin body for the pathogenicity of disease-causing fungi will be\r\ndetermined by deleting HEX1 from the genome of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe\r\ngrisea. The deletion strain will then be examined with respect to infection-related\r\nmorphogenesis and host colonization.\r\nResults from this study will enhance our understanding of basic mechanisms\r\ngoverning vesicle formation and define a previously unrecognized pathway for protein\r\nsorting in the peroxisome. In addition, the possibility that the Woronin body functions as\r\na pathogenicity factor in disease-causing fungi may define new strategies for combating\r\nfungal pathogens in both plants and humans.",
