 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nJarvis Christian College, ``the college with the personal touch and where \r\ndreams come true,'' proposes an aggressive and comprehensive model Historically \r\nBlack College and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), engaging a \r\ncommunity of academic partners working together to significantly increase minority \r\nparticipation and access to science careers. The Program goal is to develop, \r\nimplement, evaluate and institutionalize a program that will achieve and sustain a \r\nhigh quality and competitive science, mathematics, engineering and technology \r\n(SMET) education program. The comprehensive program proposed for Jarvis \r\nemphasizes the following four elements: Pre-College Outreach Programs; \r\nUndergraduate Student Scholars; Faculty Development Opportunities; and \r\nCurriculum, Equipment and Laboratory Development. The specific objectives are: \r\n(1) to implement a summer enhancement and skills development summer workshop \r\nfor rising high school students who have demonstrated an interest and aptitude in \r\nthe science areas that will ensure that 80% of the participants will complete the \r\ntwelfth grade and enroll in college as a SMET major; (2) to implement a summer \r\n``bridge'' program for students entering Jarvis in the Fall that will impact 90% \r\nsuccess rate during the first year; (3) to develop an implement a Scholars program \r\ncustomized to achieve 90% undergraduate retention and graduation rates and \r\nresult in at least 70% enrollment in graduate or professional SMET programs; (4)to \r\ndevelop and implement a comprehensive faculty development program, develop \r\nnew curricular offerings and expand existing courses for improvement and (5) to \r\nincrease diversity and the number of SMET majors by 20% annually. \r\nAll proposed activities support the mission of the National Science \r\nFoundation, ``to provide access to quality science education for all students'', and \r\nthe mission of Jarvis Christian College, ``to provide a quality education to increase \r\nthe competitiveness of its students in post-baccalaureate efforts.'' The extensive \r\nevaluation process and the involvement of the total college community and the \r\ncommunity partners will insure its success. This proposed Jarvis Program \r\nrepresents the model for ``Creating Windows of Opportunity for Success in the \r\nSMET areas.'' \r\n\r\n",
