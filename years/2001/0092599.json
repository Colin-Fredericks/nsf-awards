While two types of leaves, simple and complex, \r\ncan arise from any given shoot apex, the developmental and \r\nevolutionary basis of these divergent leaf morphologies is not known. \r\nThe phylogenetic relationships in higher plants suggest that complex \r\nleaves arose multiple independent times during the evolution of land \r\nplants.   Do simple and complex leaves differ at the level of some \r\nbasic cascade of processes or are new genes and regulatory networks \r\ninvolved in generating each independent event of leaf complexity? \r\nThe role of well-defined genes like the KNOTTED-Like HOMEOBOX Class 1 \r\ngenes (KNOX1), LFY. PHAN in the generation of leaf complexity needs \r\nto be defined.  Further, as yet unknown loci that regulate the \r\nprocess also need to be identified.  The proposed research will \r\nutilize gene expression analyses in unrelated families with complex \r\nleaves, differential gene expression analyses in clonal individuals \r\nexhibiting contrasting leaf forms, and the cloning of factors that \r\nregulate leaf complexity in related species.  The goal of this \r\nresearch is to identify the genes that regulate leaf shape and form, \r\nand to help us understand how leaf form is developed to uniquely suit \r\nthe photosynthetic function that leaves perform.\r\n\r\n",
