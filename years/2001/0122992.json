 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing scholarships to students who enroll in one of the following associate degree programs: Mechanical Design Technology, Electrical Engineering Technology, Bio-Medical Electronics, Electromechanical Technology, Electronics Technology, Programmer/Analyst, Microcomputer Specialist and Network Specialist programs. The objectives of the project are:\r\n(1) Over the course of four years, to award approximately 160 scholarships, 15% of which are awarded to minority students and 40% to women.\r\n(2) To have 75% of Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM) scholars participate in at least one student support service.\r\n(3) To assure that 97% of the graduates in the CSEM scholarship program obtain employment related to their program or continue on to a four-year college.\r\n\r\nRecruitment of students for the project includes (a) incorporation of an interactive web page to motivate women towards occupations in mechanical design and electronics; (b) provision to the pre-college minority student program information about the mechanical design, computer science and electronics programs and the scholarships available; (c) distribution of brochures advertising the project and scholarships; (d) direct mailings about the scholarships to program students; (e) classroom presentations and distribution to college counselors and instructors, high school counselors and high school math and science instructors information and scholarship brochures; (f) visits to the high school math and science classes by college program instructors to recruit students and distribute CSEMS brochures; and (g) distribution of brochures and scholarship applications to high school students visiting the college on fieldtrips.\r\n\r\nSupport and career placement services include the college's Academic Success Center, case management, specialized tutoring and retention services for students; technical support in the electronics, math, or computer labs; designated counselor/instructor/scholar appointment; scholar study groups; scholar mentorship program; computer science peer tutoring program; internships; and special recognition at the annual Foundation Scholarship Dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
