 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate quantitative theories of backward visual masking; the project results will promote development of new experiments and theories of cognition and perception.  Backward visual masking is used throughout cognitive and clinical psychology as a tool to interrupt various stages of cognitive processing.  Because masking is used in virtually all areas of experimental psychology, it is important to understand how it works.  Previous work has identified three general methods of masking that account for important aspects of experimental data.  The project will use mathematical theorems and computer simulations to identify fundamental properties of systems that use these methods.  These properties will be connected to existing data and to existing models of backward masking.  The fundamental properties will also be used to generate predictions under new backward masking conditions.  The project will test these predictions with new experiments that are able to compare alternative general methods of backward masking.  An additional analysis will explore current mathematical models of backward visual masking to determine how these models behave relative to the general methods.  This analysis will identify which part of a model's behavior is due to its use of a general method and which part is due to the specific attributes of that model.  The project will provide a better understanding of the types of mechanisms that are involved in backward visual masking.  Such understanding will allow experimentalists to develop more precise tests of cognitive systems and will allow modelers to develop more accurate theories of cognition and perception.  In addition, the research project will provide information about backward masking that will be applicable to any situation where people interact with a rapidly changing world.  Thus, results from the project will apply to situations where people are, for example, driving cars, reading text, flying planes, and working on computers.",
