They propose to study abrupt climate shifts during the declining phase of the last interglacial.  Between about 120 and 105 thousand years ago the climate of the Earth which was similar to today moved into a glacial state.  The mechanism of this transition still remains unknown.  The investigators will study in detail how fast the environment changed during that time in Western Europe.  They will analyze thin sediment cores from lake beds of La Grande Pile in France.  The US and French investigators bring to this collaboration complementary expertise and will conduct joint mineralogical, geochemical and palynological investigations of these cores currently stored in France. \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator.  CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of the causes of climate transition, and provide information on natural climate variability on  long-time scales.\r\n",
