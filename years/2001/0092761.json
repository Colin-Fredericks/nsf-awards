 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past fifteen years, researchers have developed new algorithms\r\nfor machine learning (computer programs that learn from experience)\r\nthat have excellent theoretical guarantees on their error.  These\r\nso-called multiplicative weight update algorithms receive inputs (like\r\nan image taken by a robot), and make a prediction as to whether or not\r\nthat image came from a particular location.  The theoretical error\r\nbounds imply that the number of mistakes made by these algorithms is\r\nguaranteed to be very small.  However, many applications of these\r\nalgorithms require an enormous amount of time to learn and predict.\r\nThus special techniques must be employed to make them efficient.  The\r\ninvestigators study new, general, theoretical techniques to make these\r\nalgorithms faster.  This research also involves empirically evaluating\r\nsuch algorithms in new areas, including computational biology, which is\r\nstudied extensively at the investigators' university.  Applying\r\ntheoretical techniques to real problems creates a better understanding\r\nof the real-world problems and helps direct future theoretical work,\r\nguiding the transfer of results from theory to practice.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the investigators study multiplicative weight-update\r\nalgorithms such as Weighted Majority (WM) and Winnow, which have\r\non-line mistake bounds with a logarithmic dependence on N, the total\r\nnumber of features.  This attribute efficiency allows them to be\r\napplied to problems where N is exponential in the input size, yielding\r\ngreat flexibility in their application areas.  Such areas include\r\npruning decision trees, pruning ensembles of classifiers, learning\r\nfinite geometric concepts, learning DNF formulas, and using\r\npseudo-Bayesian predictors over finite hypothesis spaces.  However, a\r\nlarge N requires techniques to efficiently compute the weighted sums of\r\nthese algorithms.  This research explores methods to overcome this\r\ndifficulty, including exploiting commonalities among the features, and\r\nthe more general approach of using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\r\nmethods to estimate the total weight contribution without the need for\r\nspecial structure in the problem.  The investigators also are applying\r\ntheir algorithms to various problems in computational biology,\r\nincluding drug activity prediction, analyzing microbial population\r\ndynamics, and identifying special types of human genes.",
