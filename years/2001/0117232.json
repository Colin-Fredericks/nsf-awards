The co-organizers are Dr. Issa Batarseh, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, and Dr. Sadeq Hamaed, Faculty of Engineering, University of Jordan, Amman.  The workshop will include sessions on power electronics curriculum development, hardware and software laboratory support, possibilities for joint research collaboration projects, and academic-industry relations in both countries.  It is expected that at least 25 US and Jordanian scientists from academic institutions will participate.  Representatives from Jordanian industries will be invited.  A publication of the proceedings is planned. \r\n\r\nScope:  This project enables eight US scientists to attend this workshop to discuss with Jordanian scientists the changes taking place in the engineering curriculum for training power electronics engineers in the two countries.  With its focus on discussions of detailed course offerings, at both undergraduate and graduate levels, the workshop will explore the current industry needs for power electronics engineers.   \r\n",
