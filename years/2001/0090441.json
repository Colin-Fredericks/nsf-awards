 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Michael Krische of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of the University of Texas at Austin will design and synthesize conjugated macromolecular structures formed by interstrand hydrogen bonding.  Co-facial alternate stacking of bis-thiophene and fluorene chromophores will produce stable conducting materials with efficient charge transport properties.  Using other starting materials, duplex macromolecular materials may be synthesized for applications in molecular storage devices, catalysts and self-replicators.  Planned centralized organic chemistry centers with 'virtual' (on-line) and 'real' accessibility will provide the undergraduate students with instructional materials and career development opportunities including graduate programs and job openings.\r\n\r\nAbiotic duplex polymer structures modeled after DNA will be synthesized using different starting materials.  These macromolecular structures formed by inter-molecular hydrogen bonding will be useful as conducting materials with high charge transfer properties.  Centralized learning centers in the chemistry department with on-line accessibility will be a new instructional tool to students in materials chemistry. \r\n",
