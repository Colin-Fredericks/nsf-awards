 "awd_abstract_narration": "The female reproductive system is sensitive to its environment, and ovarian function is often suppressed when confronted with a stressor. Suppression of  reproductive function is generally proposed to be an adaptive response in that it channels resources towards vital functions while diminishing the likelihood of conception at a time when a successful reproductive outcome is marginal.  But while such an effect is well documented for energetic stresses such as low dietary intake, high physical activity or both, the evidence in support of a direct effect of psychological stress on ovarian function is inconclusive.  Although some studies have found a relationship between psychological stress and suppression of ovarian function, this interaction could be mediated by energetics, that is, by changes in activity or eating patterns that result from the psychological stress.  This project is designed to determine if psychological stress influences ovarian function independent of energetic stress. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project is designed to investigate 1) the relationships between psychological and energetic stress and 2) the individual and combined effects of psychological and energetic stresses on bio-markers of metabolism and ovarian function.  Behavioral (food intake and physical activity), physiological (urinary c-peptide, salivary estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol), psychological (anxiety, depression and perceived stress) and anthropometric data will be collected and analyzed to investigate the relationships between psychosocial stressors, energetic stressors, metabolism and female reproductive physiology over the menstrual cycle.\r\n",
