Colleges and universities engage students in evermore sophisticated research efforts, yet seldom offer adequate instruction in how to communicate these efforts to the larger scientific community. An interdisciplinary team-planned/team-taught course is combining the expertise of a chemistry professor and an English professor to introduce chemistry majors to the genres of scientific writing and associated scientific literacy skills. The outcome of the project is a pedagogical approach to scientific writing that moves the student beyond generic laboratory reports and develops writing as a vehicle for organizing, interpreting, and communicating research data. Initiatives in scientific writing, when coupled with initiatives in undergraduate research, are ensuring the highest quality education for students, and are better preparing science majors for the research and writing challenges they will face as career scientists.\r\n",
