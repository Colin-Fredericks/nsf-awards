 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two major well-recognized difficulties in numerical simulation of waves\r\npropagating over unbounded domains are the accumulation of error during \r\nlong time intervals and necessity to truncate the domain and subsequently \r\nset the artificial boundary conditions (ABCs) at the external artificial\r\nboundary. These two issues turn out to be closely related. In the previous\r\nwork of the PI with collaborators that has been done in the framework of\r\nthe scalar wave equation, we have used the inherently three-dimensional \r\nphenomenon of lacunae and developed a methodology that modifies any \r\nappropriate discrete scheme so that the long-term error buildup is fully \r\neliminated while all of the original properties of the scheme (e.g., order \r\nof accuracy) are preserved. Moreover, the procedure allows one to replace \r\nthe original infinite domain by a finite computational domain, which leads \r\nto obtaining highly accurate non-local unsteady ABCs. These ABCs are built \r\ndirectly for the discrete formulation of the problem, their temporal non-\r\nlocality is fixed and limited, and they possess full geometric universality. \r\nThe key objective of the proposed project is to extend the aforementioned \r\nmethodology to wave-type models of practical interest, in particular, the \r\nMaxwell's equations (electromagnetic waves) and the linearized Euler's and \r\nfull-potential equations (acoustic waves). The attainability of this goal \r\nis accounted for by the fact that the solutions to these equations have \r\nsharp aft fronts of the waves (manifestation of lacunae), which is the \r\nexact same behavior as displayed by the solutions to the wave equation.\r\n\r\nNumerical simulation of waves on unbounded domains has numerous applications \r\nthat range from scattering of electromagnetic waves from aircraft and ground \r\nvehicles (radar technology) to antenna design to calculation of the acoustic\r\nfields produced by the airframe and airplane's jet engines for the purpose of \r\nreducing the noise levels around airports, as well as inside the passenger \r\ncompartments. The results that we expect to obtain are going to benefit the \r\nforegoing applied areas. Indeed, we anticipate the creation of a universal \r\nframework that would allow one to modify a wide class of already existing and \r\nproven methods so that to enable two additional crucial capabilities -- long-\r\nterm integration and accurate computation of infinite-domain wave fields on \r\ntruncated domains. Besides, as the proposed research unfolds, it will \r\nnecessarily include communication and collaboration with physicists and \r\nengineers, as well as preparation of course materials and training young \r\nresearchers.\r\n",
