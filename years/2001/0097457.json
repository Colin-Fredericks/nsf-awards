 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Georgia proposes to host an REU site for students interested in conducting research in various areas of physics.  The interdisciplinary research projects feature the techniques and methods of traditional physics research applied to problems which overlap with astronomy, aeronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, and genomics.  Several of the projects involve computation of systems important for condensed matter physics and nuclear physics; other projects involve computational physics techniques applied to problems in genetics or biology; and there are also projects which involve less computation and more laboratory physics or observational astronomy techniques.  The purpose of the program is to expose undergraduates to real scientific research.  At the end of the summer, the REU student will have a clearer idea of what is involved in a scientific career and thus will be better able to decide if this is a suitable career path.  The number of students projected for the first year is 10.  Funds will be available for presenting the project at a future professional meeting or conference.",
