ZnO is a multifunctional material possessing unique\r\nelectrical, optical, acoustical, and mechanical properties. Semiconductor ZnO has a wide and direct\r\nenergy bandgap (~3.3eV). ZnO can be grown at low temperatures, in contrast with the other wide\r\nbandgap materials, such as GaN and SiC. Its ternary compounds, formed by alloying ZnO with CdO and\r\nMgO, permit bandgap tuning from ~2.8 eV to ~4 eV. Doped ZnO ternaries can be made magnetic or\r\nferroelectric, extending its applications beyond the traditional semiconductor confines. In this exploratory\r\nresearch, we will study growth mechanisms and conduct substrate engineering for selective growth of\r\nZnO nanotips and nanotip arrays on various substrates, including R-plane sapphire, Si, silicon-on-sapphire\r\n(SOS), and GaN-on-sapphire. Feasibility studies of ZnO nanotip applications will focus on field-emission,\r\ntwo-dimensional photonic bandgap (PBG), and fine instrumentation such as atomic force\r\nmicroscopy and scanning tunneling optical microscopy. We will also explore the feasibility to form CdO\r\nquantum dots in ZnO using the activated alloy phase segregation mechanism, which may be proved as a\r\nviable alternative to the Stranski-Krastanov mechanism. These quantum dots have potential applications\r\nin UV lasers and integrated UV optoelectronic chips. The proposed work will extend the research on\r\nnanoscale structures and devices into the field of wide bandgap semiconductor nanoscale science and\r\nengineering. The research and development of nanoscale structures in ZnO and its ternaries will lead to a\r\nfundamentally new class of devices, which integrate multi-phenomena and posses unprecedented multi-functional\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n",
