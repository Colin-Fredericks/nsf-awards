The institution will purchase accessories allowing thermal measurements in an existing platform system. The award will support Rowan University to continue improving the quality and importance of research performed by undergraduate faculty, adding to the local research environment, and promoting the integration of research and education. The instrument will support research involving important outstanding questions in materials research in the areas of magnetic, superconducting and thermoelectric materials. Specifically, the requested specific heat probe will be used to investigate theoretical predictions for metamagnets and colossal magnetoresistive materials. The thermal conductivity capability will be adapted for Nernst effect measurements of superconducting multilayers with varying interlayer coupling. The thermal conductivity and Seebeck voltage will be measured for materials, which are candidates for thermoelectric devices. Student researchers will be involved in each of these activities. The instrumentation will enhance existing Advanced Laboratory and Chemistry/Physics Research courses. Many students will benefit from first-hand and original observation of the interplay between the various physical properties demonstrated by the systems under investigation.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow Rowan University to enhance experimental capabilities in the solid state sciences at a primarily undergraduate institution.
