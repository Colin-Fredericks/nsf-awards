 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NER) grant is to  develop a nano-manufacturing protocol based on the combination of a novel nano-lithography process and an ultra precision motion control technology. This instrument is capable of economically producing well-defined pores or channels in the nanometer scale (10~100 nm) on thin polymer layers.  Exploratory research to prove the design concept will be carried out in this project.  If the concept is successfully demonstrated, the investigators  will write a follow-up proposal for fabrication, characterization, and testing of a prototype manufacturing instrument.  The nano-scale transport phenomena (i.e. nanofluidics) using the well-defined features generated by this instrument will also be studied.\r\n\r\nThe application of nano-fabrication technology to create precisely designed miniature devices represents an exciting research challenge.  Strategies that have been explored for fabricating patterned nanostructures include lithography with photons (X-ray or EUV), particles (electron or ion beams) and scanning probes. X-ray and electron beam lithography (EBL) are expensive and high energy techniques.  For large-throughput manufacturing like microprocessors and memories in the IC industry, they may be affordable. However, for markets with very broad product needs and relatively short product lifetimes as in the bio-medical field, the development of cost-effective methods that are capable of writing and replicating nanostructures in a wide range of materials is essential. The scanning probe lithography (SPL) and associated replication methods represent the most promising technology that may have economics superior to those based on photons or particles. These emerging lithography technologies are aimed at micro-electronic applications in which only a low aspect ratio is needed and bio-compatibility is not an issue. For many medical and chemical applications, there is an urgent need to develop new manufacturing methods that can fabricate polymer and metal devices with a high aspect ratio and nano-sized features.\r\n\r\n",
