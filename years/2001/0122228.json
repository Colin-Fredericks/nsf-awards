 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for construction of housing and docks at two remote field stations that are part of a group of stations operated by the Fisheries Research Institute of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of Washington. The stations are located on two nearly pristine lake systems within or adjacent to parks and preserves; their use has  helped provide information on the carrying capacities of salmon spawning and rearing environments and interactions between salmon and other aquatic species. Research at these field stations has expanded in the last decade beyond the historical focus on sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to include a range of new topics including cycling of marine-derived nutrients from salmon carcasses into aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, behavioral and evolutionary ecology, and effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems.  As part of the research, long-term datasets have been maintained for juvenile and adult fishes, zooplankton, phytoplankton, temperature and other biological and environmental variables, some for over 50 years. An intensive field course for undergraduate students that covers the methods and principles of aquatic ecology is taught each summer.\r\nThe support is intended to improve the infrastructure of these field stations so that their teaching and research missions can be expanded. In conjunction with funds from the University of Washington, the funds will support construction of a multipurpose laboratory/classroom/dormitory facility at the Porcupine Island station as well as new docks at both Porcupine Island and the Aleknagik station.  These improvements will permit the stations to accommodate a larger number of visiting scientists and students, provide space specifically designed for teaching, and improve safety by separating laboratories from sleeping quarters. \r\n",
