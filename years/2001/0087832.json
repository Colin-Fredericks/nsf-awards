 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to foster and study the process by which designers, researchers, and practitioners work together, in the same project, but with different schools, geographic areas, and partnerships.  These collaborations among researchers will be likely to produce flexible curriculum that other teachers can then customize for use.  One goal is to allow the average teacher the ability to make these units work in her classroom; another is to understand the process of abstraction and accumulation of knowledge and practice across education research projects in general.  The project would then support the development of a SCALE web portal and two summit meetings of developers, plus work with teachers in using the materials.  Each year, the project will support 2-3 small projects.",
