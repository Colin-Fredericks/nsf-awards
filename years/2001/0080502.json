 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to produce and organize high-quality materials supporting software engineering education. First, a framework will be developed which serves as a taxonomy for the areas of knowledge comprising software engineering. The framework will build on the work of the ABET program criteria for software engineering education and the classification proposed by the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) project sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Computer Machinery. Four areas of particular importance to undergraduate software engineering - design, quality, requirements, and process - have been selected as the most appropriate starting points for developing curricular materials.\r\n\r\nEach of the above four areas will be further subdivided into modules, each encompassing one to six lecture hours of material.  The goal of the proposal is to provide tested materials that can be adopted, modified, and enhanced by engineering educators across the nation. The modules serve simply to organize these materials - data sets, program samples, lab activities, etc. - in a coherent fashion. The repository thus created will be a dynamic, evolving clearinghouse to which all members of the software engineering community can add new and improved materials.\r\n\r\n",
