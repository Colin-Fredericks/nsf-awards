 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate in actual field tests the novel room temperature dewatering process. In the Phase I project, Compact Membrane Systems, Inc. (CMS) demonstrated a stable osmotic distillation (OD) process on orange juice, grape juice, and coffee.  In typical applications, solids levels were increased from approximately 10% sugar to approximately 70% sugar. Taste tests showed no significant difference between original juice and re-diluted OD product. Process stability was demonstrated by  obtaining equivalent product when operating temperature was increased to 40C and  maintaining performance after multiple juice dewatering and cleaning cycles.  Product stability was demonstrated by leaving OD juice concentrate open to air with no microbiological growth due to very low water activity in the juice concentrate.  In the OD process the solution to be dewatered is placed on one side of the hydrophobic membrane and a high salinity feed is placed on the other side. Water vapor then moves from the solution to the high salinity side.  While OD has been around for 15 years, no significant commercial products have been developed due to these hydrophobic microporous membranes rapidly wetting out. This project will demonstrate a novel, non-porous perfluoromembrane that eliminates wet-out while maintaining high water vapor transport. \r\n\r\nPotential commercial applications include beverages, pharmaceuticals, neutraceuticals, and industrial chemicals. \r\n",
