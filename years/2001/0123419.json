 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore new connections between fundamental concepts in quantum theory, developed\r\nfor use in nuclear physics, with areas of practical application in optical communication.\r\n\r\nOn the theoretical side, the proposal will extend recent research on three-dimensional topological solitons or \"skyrmions\".   Existing theories describe the electron either as a kind of pure point of infinite energy (which leads to many well-known mathematical problems) or as a vibration of a string or membrane in an 11-dimensional space (which leads to rather intractable computations). In nuclear physics, skyrmion models have made it possible to describe basic particles as stable whirlpools of force in three dimensions, whirlpools whose properties can be  computed and predicted more easily than those of vibrating strings. As part of this proposal, a leading expert in skyrmions will try to apply this approach to develop a new theory of how the electron behaves. The behavior of the electron is fundamental to all of electronics.\r\n             \r\n On the application side, the proposal will also use skyrmion mathematics and concepts to try to develop\r\n\"optical bullets\" for high-speed optical communications. Simpler one-dimensional soliton mathematics have\r\nbeen used already in optical communications, but the success so far - while significant - has been limited by the severe approximations used in that mathematics. It is hoped that the use of more complete and exact three- dimensional theory will lead to more powerful and more reliable design of new optical communication systems.  Furthermore, because optical experiments and technology depend on the details of the interaction between light and electrons, it is hoped that new experiments on these interactions, designed around the concept of skyrmion, will enrich both the applications side and the theoretical side, together.",
