 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellular electrical activity controls neuronal activity.  Multi-subunit\r\nmembrane proteins called ion channels are directly responsible for cellular\r\nelectrical activity.  In addition to ion channels, many other proteins are\r\ncomposed of multiple subunits.  Multi-subunit proteins have evolved to\r\nexhibit regulation by mechanisms that include phosphorylation.\r\nStoichiometric analysis refers to the study of how the relative number,\r\ncomposition, and structure of different subunits influences the activity of\r\na multi-subunit protein.  Such analysis has been applied spectacularly to\r\nthe study of the oxygen-carrying blood protein hemoglobin.  Our\r\nunderstanding of hemoglobin provides a vivid example for introducing\r\nstudents to the beautiful intricacies of the relation between protein\r\nstructure/function and physiology.  In contrast to our deep knowledge of\r\nhemoglobin, relatively little is known about the stoichiometric behavior of\r\nmulti-subunit ion channels.  Thus, such approaches applied to the study of\r\nion channels may provide a deeper understanding of how these important\r\nproteins work.  An powerful array of molecular and computer-based\r\nbioinformatic tools has been combined here to reveal answers to\r\nevolutionary and physiological questions of how ion channels work.  The\r\nthrust of this CAREER proposal emphasizes the unity of biology on many levels,\r\nthus benefitting both classroom and laboratory inquiry.  New information\r\ngathered in the laboratory will be carried into the classroom.  In turn,\r\nteaching helps inform which questions to ask in the laboratory.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
