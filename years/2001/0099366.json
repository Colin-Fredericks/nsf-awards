 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe geometry of a separable infinite dimensional Banach space\r\nX can be studied and better understood through a study of its spreading\r\nmodels and  asymptotic structure (those finite dimensional bases that\r\ncan be found inside X, but arbitrarily spread out).  Knowledge of these\r\nstructures does not always pass through to infinite dimensional information\r\nabout X but sometimes, surprisingly, it does.  The author will study a\r\nnumber of open problems of this nature using the tools of infinite\r\ncombinatorics, analysis and logic. For example if a Banach space has only\r\none spreading model, must it contain a copy of one of the classical Banach\r\nspaces?\r\n\r\n\tThis project concerns the study of the geometry of normed linear\r\nspaces.  The easiest example of such a space is ordinary three dimensional\r\nEuclidean space.  However one may, even in two or three dimensions, have\r\nother geometries than Euclidean.  For example in the \"taxicab\" space\r\ndistances between points in the plane are computed by traveling the\r\nshortest route along roads that run only horizontally or vertically.  In\r\nthis geometry the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point is\r\ndiamond shaped rather than a circle.  Applications of such alternate\r\ngeometries are numerous in physics, engineering, signal processing and\r\nmany other sciences. The state of a system or a signal may be given by a\r\nsequence of numbers and one may have to have a way of computing the\r\ndistance between two states or signals to see how close they are. And in\r\nthese applications one has to often use finite dimensional spaces of\r\nlarger dimension than three or even spaces of infinite dimension.  The\r\nauthor will be exploring the latter  case by studying the \r\n\"asymptotic\" structures of these alternate geometries. This is a method of\r\nlinking finite and infinite dimensional structure.  The techniques to be \r\nused are a combination of analysis, infinitary combinatorics and\r\nlogic.  The problems that arise could also impact and motivate development\r\nin these latter areas as well.\r\n",
