First, she will continue her work on developing the\r\ntheory of finite type invariants for knots and links in arbitrary\r\n3-manifolds by using techniques from the theory of atoroidal\r\ndecompositions of 3-manifolds.  She also plans to work on\r\nrelating the Vassiliev knot invariants to properties of Seifert\r\nsurfaces spanned by the knots and to intrinsic invariants of the\r\nknot complement. This will extend classical results about the\r\ntopology of the Alexander polynomial to the Jones polynomial and\r\nits generalizations. Finally, the PI plans to search for\r\nrelations between the Jones polynomial of a knot and the\r\nfundamental group of 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on the\r\nknot.\r\n\r\nThe research of the project lies in the area of 3-dimensional\r\ntopology the central objects of study of which are spaces called\r\n3-manifolds. A 3-manifold is an object that locally looks like\r\nthe ordinary 3-dimensional space but whose global structure can\r\nbe complicated.  A main goal of 3-dimensional topology is to\r\nunderstand these structures and achieve a classification of\r\n3-manifolds. An important part of 3-dimensional topology is also\r\nthe study of knots (loops embedded in some tangled way in\r\n3-manifolds) and their classification. One of the ways that\r\ntopologists have been approaching these problems is through the\r\nuse of ``invariants\". In the recent years, ideas originated in\r\nphysics, lead mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of\r\ninvariants of knots and 3-manifolds.  The central theme of the\r\nPI's project is to understand the properties of these invariants,\r\nusing ideas from traditional 3-dimensional topology and from\r\nphysics, and to look for applications to the aforementioned\r\nclassification problems.\r\n",
