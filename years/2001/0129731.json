Birge\r\nSyracuse University\r\n\r\nTitle: Optimized Bacteriorhodopsin Proteins for Photonic and HolographicMemory Storage\r\n\r\nThe protein bacteriorhodopsin is being optimized for bioelectronic and photonic applications through site directed mutagenesis, random mutagenesis and directed evolution. The native protein has many characteristics that make it a nearly optimal photonic material, but further optimization is necessary to achieve competitive performance in computer applications. The goal is to generate protein variants that are optimized for holographic associative memories and large scale volumetric memories.  The former memory system is based on Fourier-transform holography, and the protein will be optimized for thermal stability, quantum efficiency and holographic efficiency. \r\n\r\nThe large scale volumetric memory is based on a branching reaction out of the main photocycle.  The protein is being optimized for this application by increasing thermal stability, branching efficiency and long-term stability of the branched photoproduct.   Genetic engineering is the best method for achieving all three goals simultaneously, and directed evolution is being studied as one possible method of rapidly achieving these goals simultaneously. This is a collaborative project involving researchers at the W. M. Keck Center for Molecular Electronics at Syracuse University and molecular biologists at the University of Connecticut.\r\n\r\n",
