 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Developmental Studies Center (DSC) will implement \"Home, School and Community:  AfterSchool Math for Grades 3-5,\" a program that targets at-risk and low income children in afterschool programs.  AfterSchool Math trains youth workers to help students in grades 3-5 better understand measurement and geometry concepts, building on the success of the NSF-funded Home, School and Community mathematics program for grades K-2 (ESI #97-05421).  The project develops, field-tests and evaluates thirty math games and ten story guides, which support the social and mathematical development of children, while emphasizing cooperative learning.  The content for all materials will be aligned with national standards in mathematics.  A 12-hour professional development workshop for youth workers and an 18-hour workshop for facilitators or youth worker leaders are also planned.  Two training videos and a facilitator manual will be produced to support this aspect of the project.  Field testing will occur in Kansas, Louisiana and Missouri.  This proposal has been augmented to include a special emphasis on rural communities which doubles the number of field test sites from 50 to 100.  A Rural Outreach Specialist will conduct focus group meetings to determine needs unique to rural programs and lead the field testing in these communities.  It is anticipated that over 3,200 youth workers will be trained and a national cadre of more than 300 youth worker leaders will be created.",
