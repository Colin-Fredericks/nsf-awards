 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sin Nombre Hantavirus (SNV) is a highly virulent, rodent-borne virus that causes the often fatal Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in humans.  The highest frequencies of this disease are found in the US Southwest.  The rodent vector of the pathogen is the common deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus.  The antiquity of the virus, and the high frequency of HPS in the Southwest, raise questions about its role in human prehistory in the region.  Prehistoric populations of the region were sedentary, high population density maize agriculturalists.  Grain storage and processing practices of the time would have increased human-mouse contact.\r\n\r\nThis exploratory project will use established ancient DNA methods to attempt to recover diagnostic nucleic acids of Sin Nombre Virus from archaeologically recovered remains of P. maniculatus in the US Southwest.  Samples are expected to be 1,000-2,000 years old and will be directly dated using carbon-14.  In addition to ancient DNA methods, immunohistochemical and immunoflorescent methods for the detection of antigens and antibodies specific to SNV will be attempted.  The purpose of the project is to document the presence of SNV as a potential disease vector during Southwestern prehistory.  Demonstration of SNV presence as a disease vector in antiquity has a variety of implications for prehistoric population dynamics in the region.\r\n",
