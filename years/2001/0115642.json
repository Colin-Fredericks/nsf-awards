 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRice blast disease, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, is a leading constraint to rice production and is a serious threat to food security worldwide. The goal of this project is to elucidate the basis of plant resistance through a comprehensive analysis of the molecular events that occur during pathogen-host recognition and the subsequent defense responses. Our ultimate goal is to design durable disease resistance. Rice blast is a compelling experimental system for conducting such analyses. A complete understanding of the interaction requires knowledge of the genes in both pathogen and host. In this project, a set of crucial ESTs involved in rice defense will be identified. This information, along with other data, will be used for functional genomics studies, specifically microarray analysis and gene knockout, to uncover many of the early events in host-pathogen recognition from the perspectives of both the pathogen and host. As a result, major new resources for distribution and long term use by the plant, cell and pathogen biology research communities will be created. To facilitate access to resources and research data, a new database (MGOS) will be developed that will serve as a bridge between plant and pathogen research communities. An interactive educational component \"Genomics and Food Security\" will be designed and developed for high school students founded on the research. The project includes a major component to promote research experiences for undergraduates from underrepresented groups including the formation of a Genomics Club that will integrate other Plant Genome projects at North Carolina State University.\r\n\r\nDeliverables:\r\n\r\n1.      50,000 mutants with corresponding phenotype information, digital photographs, and genomic DNA \r\n2.      Identification and cloning of mutated genes shown to affect fungal penetration and pathogenesis\r\n3.      Putatively secreted proteins, plant responses, and their deduced functions\r\n4.      Micro-arrays and the results of transcriptional profiling experiments looking at gene regulation in the rice host and the fungal pathogen\r\n5.      SAGE libraries from infected rice tissue\r\n6.      35,000 ESTs from different rice tissues infected and non-infected\r\n7.      Public database (MGOS) housing all data generated during the course of this project.\r\n8.      Teaching module \"Genomics and food security\" for high school teachers and students\r\n \r\nContact Information for Deliverables:\r\n \r\n1.
