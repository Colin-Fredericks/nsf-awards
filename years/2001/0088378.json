 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59) \r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this program is to unify the dynamic systems and controls courses of chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering while still allowing some discipline- specific specialization. The project seeks to create a modern integrated curriculum and laboratory learning environment that promotes critical reasoning and problem solving skills, and applies them to the modeling, analysis, design, measurement, control and management of complex dynamic systems. In developing this curriculum the investigators are seeking to adapt and implement concepts and practices from NSF- supported coalitions, particularly the Foundations and Synthesis Coalitions, as well as other NSF funded CCLI grants. The specific focus of the program is on the development of a common required course, Process & Systems Dynamics, for chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering students, and three discipline- specific laboratory courses. The discipline- specific required courses -- Unit Operations Laboratory for chemical engineering, Automatic Controls for electrical engineering, and Engineering Synthesis Laboratory for mechanical engineering -- allow specialization at the advanced level, but preserve an interdisciplinary perspective by sharing experiments and projects. Students should emerge from the sequence with a firm understanding of the physical principles underlying engineering processes, and practical experience in the design, fabrication and testing of tangible products that synthesize multidisciplinary features. \r\n",
