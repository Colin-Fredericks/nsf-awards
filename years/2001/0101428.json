 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program concerns several topics in stochastic control\r\ntheory and related areas of applied probability and nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations. One topic is risk-sensitive control on an\r\ninfinite time horizon, motivated by problems of robust feedback\r\ncontroller design for nonlinear systems. Another application of\r\nrisk-sensitive control is in mathematical finance, including dynamic\r\nportfolio allocation problems on long time horizons. Yet another\r\nresearch topic concerns first order partial differential equations of\r\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type. While such equations are nonlinear in the\r\nusual sense, they are linear with respect to max-plus algebra\r\noperations. This allows for approximate solution via max-plus basis\r\nexpansions. Finally stochastic control models for economic growth and\r\ndebt which arise in international finance are being studied.\r\n\r\nStochastic control provides a framework for modeling and analysis of\r\ndynamic decision making in the presence of uncertainty. The method of\r\ndynamic programming provides a way to obtain optimal stochastic control\r\npolicies by solution of corresponding nonlinear partial differential\r\nequations. The research funded through this grant is motivated by a\r\nrange of applications in engineering and financial economics, including\r\nrobust feedback controller design, nonlinear estimation and filtering\r\nand optimal dynamic investment allocation. In international\r\nfinance,growth/debt models are considered in which the goal is to choose\r\nnational investment and consumption policies which optimize a suitably\r\nchosen criterion subject to imposed constraints. The model performance\r\nunder optimal control may provide benchmarks to suggest whether actual\r\ncurrent account deficits and levels of foreign debt are sustainable\r\nunder current policies.\r\n",
