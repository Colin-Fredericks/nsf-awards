 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site program is designed to prepare undergraduate students for the revolution in biological research. The emphasis of this program is placed on the interfaces between discovery science and biocomputing with hypothesis-driven science. The overall objectives of this program are to provide students with rich and rewarding research experiences and to encourage participating undergraduates to remain in science and technology.  This program will recruit 10 students based on GPA, interest statement, and a letter of reference. Special emphasis is placed on students from institutions with little or no research facilities and students from typically underrepresented demographic populations.  Each student will be paired with a mentor and a specific project based on student interests and background for the 12 week summer internship.  The design of the individual projects and the one-on-one interactions between the students and their mentors will foster the students' independence and confidence.  Students will be expected to participate in weekly group meetings and an end of summer student symposium. Program alumni will receive yearly e-newsletters and continued interaction between mentors and former participants will be strongly encouraged.",
