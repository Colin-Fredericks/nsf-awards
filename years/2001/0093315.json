 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ensuring that high assurance systems meet their reliability requirements \r\nprior to deployment is essential.  The research focuses on combining the \r\nstrengths of formal verification methods and program testing.  The cornerstone \r\nof this unified, quantitative software reliability assessment framework is \r\nthe use of Bayesian inference. Subjective probabilities of software failures \r\nare obtained through formal or informal verification.  Statistical testing \r\ncan either corroborate that the required reliability level is met, or it \r\nindicates that the subjectively established failure probabilities are not \r\nrealistic, prompting the need for rework and improvement.  Several \r\ncombinations of verification techniques and statistical testing are \r\nbased on program structure.  Research objectives include the identification \r\nof program designs, which make software reliability assessment feasible, \r\nand demonstration of their suitability for high assurance applications. \r\n\r\nEducational activities accompanying the research theme include research \r\nexperience for undergraduate and graduate students, and curriculum \r\ndevelopment. The goal of educational activities is to expose students \r\nto the development and assurance of complex systems through their \r\nparticipation in experiments and case studies.  Participating students \r\nform multidisciplinary teams including computer science, computer \r\nengineering and electrical engineering majors.\r\n",
