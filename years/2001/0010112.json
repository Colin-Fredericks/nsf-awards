The purpose of this research is to develop and implement the general methodology and to test it on a set of benchmark RC frames.  The awarded project will merge state-of-the-art techniques in nonlinear frame analysis with state-of-the-art methods in sensitivity and reliability analysis to develop a general methodology for assessing the effects of propagation of uncertainties in nonlinear dynamic analyses of reinforced concrete buildings for performance-based engineering. The following sources of inherent and epistemic uncertainties will be considered in the study: (a) intrinsic variabilities/randomness in the  material properties; (b) inherent and epistemic uncertainties in the \"global\" seismological variables (earthquake magnitude M, site-to-source distance R, and local site condition S); (c) intrinsic variabilities/randomness in the earthquake loading history; and (d) modeling uncertainties associated with the nonlinear RC frame models and the stochastic earthquake excitation model.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
