 "awd_abstract_narration": "I propose to initiate a lending program to share science resources and equipment with\r\npre-service and in-service teachers and schools in the Monterey Bay region. K-12 teachers\r\nhave a great need for access to scientific equipment and for support in using scientific\r\nequipment in their teaching. The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) is well\r\npositioned to increase the access of regional schools to its own scientific equipment\r\nthrough its outreach wing, the Educational Partnership Center (EPC), and its Division of\r\nNatural Sciences. My Post-doctoral Fellowship in Science, Math, Engineering, and\r\nTechnology Education (PFSMETE) involved the acquisition of a basic set of scientific\r\nequipment useful for various kinds of environmental monitoring by K-12 students. The\r\nlending program I propose would use this existing equipment to provide follow-up support\r\nfor teachers with whom I worked on environmental monitoring projects during my\r\npost-doctoral fellowship. It would also serve as a seed project for a larger\r\nuniversity-based equipment-sharing programs.\r\n",
