 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scholarships for low income, academically talented students, including twenty- five (25) undergraduate students majoring in Mathematics, Computer Science or Information Technology (MTH/ CSC/ IT) and fifteen (15) graduate students enrolled in the Master of Science in Computer Information Science Program (M. S. CIS). The twenty- five (25) undergraduate recipients include ten (10) new students transferring into La Salle's MTH/ CSC Department as juniors from community colleges or from the University's unique associate degree program for Latino students (the BUSCA Program) and fifteen (15) returning MTH/ CSC/ IT majors who are entering their junior years at the University. The fifteen (15) M. S. CIS students include six (6) new students entering the program and nine (9) students already enrolled as Master's degree candidates. At least 30% of the funded students are women, and at least 10% are minorities. In addition to scholarship assistance for the student recipients, funds are also used for project management, for tutorial assistance for the undergraduate CSMES recipients, and for a special Career Exploration series of guest speakers who are employed in professional positions in Mathematics, Computer Science and/ or Information Technology.",
