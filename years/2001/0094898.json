 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides 44 scholarships to outstanding and underrepresented undergraduate students of Computer Science, Engineering Technology, and Mathematics, as well as graduate students of Computer Science and Mathematics. In addition to providing scholarships that enables students to successfully attain degrees, the project also provides and requires of each recipient of an NSF Scholarship group research experiences that enables them to be more successful as students and after graduation. Scholars are required to work 10 hours per week on a research project; work with a project faculty member, who serves as the student's mentor, for a semester research assignment; attend a bi- weekly research colloquium; present at least one progress report per semester at a bi- monthly colloquium to other scholars and mentors; and submit a written report at the end of each semester of funding. Additionally, these students are encouraged to present papers or posters at regional and/ or national conferences. The University also commits to finding a technically related job on campus for every undergraduate NSF Scholar who wants a job during his/ her senior year. The Department commits to placing every graduate student in the program in either a graduate assistantship or funded research assistant position until completion of degree.",
