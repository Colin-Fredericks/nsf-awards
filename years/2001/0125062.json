 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2001 International Conference on Solid-State Sensors and Actuators represents an\r\nimportant opportunity to capture a perspective on the current state of the art in microstructure\r\nfabrication and the development of MicroElectroMechanical Systems. The 11th International\r\nConference on Solid-State Sensors and Actuators (Transducers '01) will be held in Munich,\r\nGermany, from June 10-14, 2001.\r\nTransducers is a biennial conference focusing on theory, design, fabrication, and\r\napplication of solid-state sensors, actuators, and microsystems. It is an interdisciplinary gathering\r\nwith participants from university, government, and industrial laboratories representing diverse\r\ncross spectrum of fields: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science,\r\nbiomedical engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and microelectronics.\r\nWe propose to partially sponsor travel for student authors of papers from North America\r\nto this conference. These student authors have been selected from a very competitive pool of\r\nabstract submissions, and represent the most talented young members of the MEMS community.\r\nThese students will travel to the conference to present their own work, and then spend the\r\nremainder of the week attending presentations and discussions, gathering information on the\r\nmost important breakthrough technologies revealed at the conference. Much of the fabrication\r\nand integration technology is of direct relevance to technologies and applications funded through\r\nNSF Electronics and Controls Systems office. Each of these students will write a brief report\r\ndescribing the important technologies they learned about at the conference, and these will be\r\ngathered into a summary report to NSF highlighting new trends in this community, important\r\nthrusts initiated by other countries, and areas where the US technological base holds advantages\r\nor disadvantages.\r\nThe funding that we request will allow partial travel support for approximately 12 student\r\nauthors from various institutions in North America.",
