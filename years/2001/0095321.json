 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAn important recent application of economic theory has been to the design \r\nof markets. For example, the design of the spectrum auctions in the United \r\nStates and around the world has been much influenced by recent developments \r\nin auction theory and the theory of mechanism design. However, much of the \r\ntheory has been developed with a simplified view of (1) how different \r\nmarket participants value the objects for sale; and (2) what they believe \r\nother market participants' beliefs. Such simplifying assumptions have been \r\nmade for the sake of tractability and the resulting theories have been \r\nhighly successful. However, one concern of practitioners and theorists \r\nalike has been that the \"optimal\" mechanisms derived from theory are \r\nsometimes too complex to be implemented in practice, which has lead for a \r\nsearch for simpler mechanisms that seem to be more robust to the underlying \r\ndescription of the environment. Our project will use new developments in \r\ngame theory, allowing for richer \"types\" of market participants (including \r\nricher beliefs) to provide a theoretical justification for the use of \r\nsimple mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses two separate but linked objectives. First, we examine \r\nhow robust received mechanisms are to allowing the richer type spaces. In \r\nparticular, researchers often argue that solution concepts stronger than \r\nBayes-Nash equilibrium, such as dominance solvability and ex post \r\nequilibrium, are desirable because they are \"robust,\" although the exact \r\nnotion of robustness is not always described. One way of formalizing \r\nrobustness is to examine whether results continue to hold on richer type \r\nspaces. In our proposal, we discuss various type spaces in between the \r\nnaive type space and the universal type space, and examine how different \r\nmechanisms' performances vary as we vary the type space.\r\n\r\nOur second objective is to develop new optimal mechanisms for particular \r\ntype spaces, intermediate between the standard space of all payoff-relevant \r\ntypes and the universal type space. Optimality in this context refers to \r\nthe objective of the mechanism designer, which may coincide with social \r\nefficiency or simply be a revenue maximization problem for the designer. \r\nWhen the objective of the mechanism designer requires him to maximize an \r\nexpected value, it will be appropriate to consider subspaces of the \r\nuniversal type space, which can be generated from a prior distribution \r\nfunction.\r\n",
