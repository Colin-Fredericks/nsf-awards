They plan to devise new capabilities for complex-problem solvers by utilizing two technologies, the knowledge-based system technology, which is a mature technology, and the intelligent agents technology which is emerging and is still evolving.  They plan to develop a distributed knowledge-based intelligent architecture for cooperative problem solving, and to test the new system in an application dealing with agricultural (wheat) production management. \r\n\r\nScope: The project supports collaboration between a US scientist and an Egyptian scientist in a research project that is timely and which has significant potential applications.  The two PIs are currently collaborating on a project for the management of irrigated wheat in Egypt.  That project is generating a working set of applications that will be utilized as a test bed for the distributed knowledge-based intelligent architecture developed in this research.  Such architecture will be useful in many similar problems where the data sources and computer tools are geographically distributed.  The research will involve one US graduate student and two graduate students from Egypt.  This project meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
