We intend to \r\ndevelop and refine two pieces of software which have been \r\nwritten by members of our research group, ISOMAP (Tenenbaum) \r\nand PLEX (de Silva-Carlsson).  ISOMAP is a tool for dimension \r\nreduction and parameterization of high dimensional data sets, \r\nand PLEX is a homology computing tool which we will use in \r\nlocating and analyzing singular points in data sets, as well \r\nas estimating dimension in situations where standard methods \r\ndo not work well.  We plan to extend the range of \r\napplicability of both tools, in the case of ISOMAP by \r\nstudying embeddings into spaces with non-Euclidean metrics, \r\nand in the case of PLEX by building in the Mayer-Vietoris \r\nspectral sequence as a tool  Both ISOMAP and PLEX will be \r\nadapted for parallel computing. We will also begin the \r\ntheoretical study of statistical questions relating to \r\ntopology.  For instance, we will initiate the study of \r\nhigher dimensional homology of subsets sampled from \r\nEuclidean space under various sampling hypotheses.  \r\nThe key object of study will be the family of Cech \r\ncomplexes constructed using the distance function in \r\nEuclidean space together with a randomly chosen finite \r\nset of points in Euclidean space.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop tools for \r\nunderstanding data sets which are not easy to understand \r\nusing standard methods.  This kind of data might include \r\nsingular points, or might be strongly curved.  The \r\ndata is also high dimensional, in the sense that each \r\ndata point has many coordinates.  For instance, we might \r\nhave a data set whose points each of which is an image, \r\nwhich has one coordinate for each pixel.  Many standard \r\ntools rely on linear approximations,  which do not work \r\nwell in strongly curved or singular problems.  The kind \r\nof tools we have in mind are in part topological, in \r\nthe sense that they measure more qualitative properties \r\nof the spaces involved, such as connectedness, or the \r\nnumber of holes in a space, and so on.  This group of \r\nmethods has the capability of recognizing the number \r\nof parameters required to describe a space, without \r\nactually parameterizing it.   These methods also have the \r\ncapability of recognizing singular points (like points \r\nwhere two non-parallel planes or non-parallel lines \r\nintersect), without actually having to construct \r\ncoordinates on the space.  We will also be further \r\ndeveloping and refining methods we have already \r\nconstructed which can actually find good parameterizations \r\nfor many high dimensional data sets.  Both projects will \r\ninvolve the adaptation for the computer of many methods \r\nwhich have heretofore been used in by-hand calculations \r\nfor solving theoretical problems.  We will also initiate \r\nthe theoretical development of topological tools in a setting \r\nwhich includes errors and sampling.  \r\n\r\n",
