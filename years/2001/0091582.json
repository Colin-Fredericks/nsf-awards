 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue to develop a solder self-assembly process that was the concept explored in Phase I. It will build upon the successful Phase I results that demonstrated the use of solder to self-assemble two-dimensional surface micromachined Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) into useful three-dimensional structures. This concept is a next step in the evolution of MEMS assembly. The overall objective of Phase II is to move the technology from the lab environment to a commercial production process that is well understood and has excellent yield. Research personnel from industry and education are involved and state-of-the-art equipment will be utilized.\r\n\r\nA number of promising commercial applications have been identified and discussions with potential commercial partners suggest interest in commercializing this technology.\r\n",
