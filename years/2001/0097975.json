 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Telluride Workshops arose from a strategic decision by the NSF to\r\nencourage the interface between Neuroscience and Engineering. The\r\nrecommendation was for NSF to organize and fund a hands-on workshop to draw\r\ntogether an international group of scientists interested in exploring\r\nneuromorphic engineering. This new field seeks to design and fabricate\r\nartificial neural systems, such as vision systems, head-eye systems,\r\nauditory systems and autonomous robots, whose architecture and design\r\nprinciples are based on those of biological nervous systems.\r\n\r\nThe three-week long Telluride Workshops, have been held annually since then\r\n(cf. the Telluride homepage at http://www.ini.unizh.ch/telluride2000/). The\r\nworkshop includes background lectures, practical tutorials on analog VLSI\r\ndesign, hands-on projects, and special interest groups. There are two daily\r\ntutorials covering general material. Participants are free to explore topics\r\nof their own choosing in the afternoon; while  projects and interest groups\r\nmeet in the late afternoons, and after dinner.\r\n\r\nAbout 60 people are invited to the workshop. Participants are from academia,\r\ngovernment laboratories, and industry. Backgrounds span physics, robotics,\r\ncomputer science, neurophysiology, electrical engineering, and computational\r\nneuroscience.  The workshop provides background material in cellular and\r\nsystems neuroscience, all aspects of analog VLSI design, simulation, layout,\r\nand testing as well as sensorimotor integration and active vision systems.\r\nWorking groups are established in a variety of areas such as robotics and\r\nCentral Pattern Generators, sensorimotor interactions, inter-chip\r\ncommunications, active vision, audition, and spatial localization using\r\nvision and audition together, attention and selection, locomotion and\r\nindustrial applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
