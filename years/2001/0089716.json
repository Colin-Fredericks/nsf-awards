 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the evolutionary forces that lead to genetic variation within populations and the genetic differences between species.  Genetic variation within populations, which is often manifest as observable differences between individuals, is due to a delicate balance of forces: mutation injecting variation into populations and natural selection and/or random factors removing variation.  Genetic differences between species are due to these same forces, although natural selection is the only cause of evolutionary adaptations.  The proposed research will explore the nature of these forces, focusing in particular on the random factors that remove variation, on the mutations that caused physical differences between individuals, and on the mutations that cause different species to produce sterile or inviable offspring.  The methodology for this research involves the mathematical analysis and computer simulation of models of evolution followed by a comparison of the properties of these models to data that has been obtained by others.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of this work concerns our understanding of the implications of genetic variation in such important human traits as disease susceptibility and in agricultural traits of economic importance.  In addition, this work will have a profound impact on our understanding of human origins and the recent patterns of human migration.\r\n",
