 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposer will work on Operator Theory problems,\r\nproblems related to invariant subspaces and to\r\nstability. The proposer has developed a new technique\r\nto construct invariant subspaces by using different\r\nkinds of extremal vectors. This has, so far, led to\r\nnew and unified constructions of invariant subspaces \r\nfor large classes of operators, including operators\r\ncommuting with compact or normal operators. It has \r\nalso led to strengthenings of so called Two Sequences\r\nTheorems, which are connected to invariant subspaces.\r\nThere are several directions to refine and improve this\r\ntechniques and the proposer intends to do so. \r\nThe study of stability under perturbations of cyclicity,\r\nsupercyclicity or hypercyclicity is still in its\r\nbeginning, both for operators and vectors. This is\r\nstrongly connected to the study of which properties are\r\ncarried by large resp. small classes of operators. The\r\nproposer intends to carry these studies further.\r\n\r\nThe study of operators and their invariant subspaces can\r\nbe seen as a generalization of linear algebra, where \r\nmatrices and their eigenvectors are studied. Although\r\nthese are problems in \"pure\" mathematics, they are\r\nclosely connected to the many applications of linear\r\nalgebra to Physics, Biology, Genetics, Economics and other \r\nsciences as well as to the applications in industry. \r\nOperators can be seen as infinite matrices and are a suitable\r\ntool for the study of large and complex systems depending on an\r\nunbounded number of parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
