 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support in the amount of $30,000 for an eighteen-month study and report on material flow accounting of natural resources. Support is also being requested from the following federal agencies: Department of Energy, Department of Defense, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. Geological Survey.  Materials flow accounting, which can be used to track the flow of a material from the time it is extracted to its ultimate disposal, provides a means for making better economic and environmental decisions at all process stages.  This study will examine (1) the usefulness of creating and maintaining materials flow accounts for developing sound public policy on the environment, materials, and energy; (2) the technical basis for materials flow analysis; (3) the current state of materials flow information, including what data are collected, where it resides, quality, scale and completeness of the data, formats, accessibility, and the tools and methods available for analyzing the data; (4) the ways the public and private sectors are currently using this information and how materials flow accounts can be improved through partnerships or access to additional data; and (5) who should have institutional responsibility for collecting, maintaining and providing access to additional data for materials flow accounts.",
