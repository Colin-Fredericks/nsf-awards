 "awd_abstract_narration": "Error correcting codes were originally invented to increase the\r\nprecision of retrieval, storage and communication of data.\r\nThe investigator's goal is to study and develop codes\r\nwith new features added on top of the error correcting property,\r\nsuch as  checkability, identifiable parent property (IPP), or\r\nquantum-error correcting property. In spite of the\r\nimportance of designing codes with added features,\r\nthere has not ben a comprehensive study of them up to date, and each\r\ndesign is treated as an isolated case. The investigator\r\nwants to put the designs under one umbrella (whenever\r\nit is possible) so that their properties\r\ncan be compared and further improved upon.\r\nAmong the benefits such improvement can bring about\r\nare better non-approximability results in complexity theory,\r\nbetter means to trace pirates of electronic images,\r\nand new algorithms for quantum computers.\r\n\r\nThe investigator was the first to\r\nobserve that constructs in the theory of probabilistically checkable\r\nproofs can be viewed as error correcting codes with added features.\r\nThe best parameters for these codes and their kins are\r\nstill not known, and they are the primary\r\ntargets of the proposed investigation in the first year.\r\nThe investigator also plans for a study that\r\nwould lead to a general checkability theorem for product codes,\r\nwith a surprise application in circuit complexity,\r\nand recommends a simplified look at Raz's parallel repetition\r\ntheorem. A different thread of the the proposed research\r\nis motivated by questions about schemes\r\nthat protect a multi-media publisher against piracy of\r\nelectronic images. The publisher can use words of a code\r\nto mark electronic copies of an image. Then, if the code is\r\nappropriately designed, any image forged by combining pieces of two legally\r\ntraded images, contains sufficient amount of information to trace\r\nthe identity of at least one of the source (parent) images.\r\nHere the problem is to build efficient codes that can identify one of\r\nthree or more source images. Other research targets include\r\nefficiently decodable quantum codes, and\r\ncomplexity lower bounds for dynamic problems via unusual codes.\r\nThere is a general framework in which\r\nthe investigator plans to do the research. This entails:\r\n1. The study and exploration of the relation in\r\nbetween different unusual codes;\r\n2. Their classification and axiomatization;\r\n3. Search for novel applications of unusual codes\r\nin the theories of lower bounds and pseudo-randomness,\r\nand in other walks of computer science;\r\n4. Building a 'family tree' of code properties, and finding a match\r\nin between properties and applications.\r\nThe methodology should embrace and extend classical coding theory.\r\n",
