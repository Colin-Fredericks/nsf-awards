 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the development of a new database of science and engineering\r\ndepartment chairs and the development and administration of a comprehensive survey of\r\ndepartment chairs. The department chairs survey will collect information about the respondents'\r\npersonal and professional background, their career-related perceptions and attitudes, and the\r\ninstitutional setting of their department. This data will support detailed multivariate analysis\r\nexamining the determinants of women's entry into, or lack of movement into, positions of\r\ndepartmental leadership. \r\n\r\nThe lack of demographic data on department chairs and the processes by which they are chosen represents a significant gap in the knowledge about the progress of women in assuming a key academic leadership position. To address this gap in knowledge, project objectives are to develop and implement a department chairs survey and to construct a new database of demographic and career-related information on science and engineering department chairs.\r\nThis study will help to achieve significant change by bringing to light the criteria and processes\r\nused to select chairs. Institutional accountability and presence of public data on the proportions\r\nof female chairs can make a profound difference in the level of attention paid to the\r\nappointments. Systemic change must include not only increasing leadership diversity in the\r\nupper administrative levels, but also at the local level (i.e., the department). The chair is also\r\ncritical to initiating other change within the department.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program and the National Institutes of Health. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.\r\n",
