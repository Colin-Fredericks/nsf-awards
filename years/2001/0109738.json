The investigators\r\norganize a workshop to consider mathematical structures with\r\napplication to specific problems in fields increasingly connected\r\nto mathematics, for example the global geometry of macromolecular\r\nfolding, including both proteins and RNA.  Recent mathematical\r\nresults allow for a treatment of the full spatial folding\r\nproblem: how do the physico-chemical properties of macromolecules\r\ndetermine their spatial folding characteristics?  Roughly,\r\nfolding can be modeled as a family of weighted arcs, each arc\r\ncorresponding to a chemical bond, the weight the Boltzmann\r\nstrength of the bond.  The graphs formed from combining these\r\nweighted ars give a space of weghted graphs representing all\r\npossible foldings.  Can an appropriate energy functional be found\r\non such a space to study the gradient flow minimizing the total\r\nenergy?  Several participants use this approach to understand\r\ndynamic folding.  Related spaces of graphs in biology are those of\r\nphylogenetic trees formed by speciation.  Though the global\r\ngeometry of these spaces is understood, the nature of the local\r\ngeometry is not known; some of the participants study these\r\nquestions.  A recent discovery in string theory is the exotic\r\nstructure of an \"operad\" associated with spaces of graphs.  Some\r\nof the researchers at the workshop investigate these higher order\r\nstructures, and their possible use in biology.\r\n     Graph theory is a branch of mathematics dealing with objects\r\ncalled graphs.  A graph consists of a set of points or vertices\r\nthat are connected by links or edges.  An ordinary map, for\r\nexample, is a graph whose vertices are towns and whose edges are\r\nroads.  Although graphs are abstract objects, they have been used\r\nto represent a wide variety of real objects or processes.  A\r\nfamiliar use of graphs is to represent the evolutionary\r\nrelationships between a group of organisms -- family trees.  It is\r\na testimony to their great versatility and usefulness that graphs\r\nhave been used in fields as diverse as biology, economics, and\r\ncomputer science.  In the field of biotechnology, there has been\r\nan explosion in the use of graphs to represent the complex\r\nphysical structure of the basic proteins produced by DNA.  This\r\nwork has important applications in understanding genetic diseases\r\nand in designing medicines to cure them.  Because methods based on\r\ngraph theory have been developed independently in many fields, it\r\nis extremely likely that sharing problems and results between\r\nfields will lead to advances.  The purpose of this workshop is to\r\nbring together mathematicians and biologists working on problems\r\ninvolving graph theory to describe and discuss their work in an\r\ninterdisciplinary setting.\r\n",
