The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between two known approaches to managing the complexity of software systems:  composition and refinement of components.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in compositional reasoning of software systems.  This is complemented by the French investigator's experience with feature interactions in telecommunication systems.  The project takes advantage of French expertise in theorem provers, model checkers and systems for abstract interpretation.  The project will also benefit from interaction with European industry which tends to be ahead of the US in utilization of formal approaches to system design.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator.  The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of component based development of software systems and may lead to new understanding about the refinement and composition approach to managing complex and huge software systems. \r\n",
