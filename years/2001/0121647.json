 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the construction of a multi-use housing facility that will diminish overcrowding in the housing provided to students participating in summer laboratory research, and enhance the ability of the laboratory  to accommodate students, teachers and investigators attending courses, conferences, and symposia year round. The Laboratory provides access for visiting students and scientists who study the unique marine ecosystems of coastal Maine and use cold water marine species for the purpose of investigating basic biological mechanisms such as osmoregulation, cell division, reproduction and the function of vertebrate organs.  The laboratory also offers educational programs for students at various levels from high school to postdoctoral. The ability of MDIBL to accommodate participants in its various activities is currently limited by the quality and quantity of available housing, in particular the housing for undergraduate students during the peak summer season, student/faculty groups taking marine related short courses during the academic year, and investigators seeking short stays for research during the winter months. These funds will be used to help construct the second of two housing units whose design was chosen to maximize flexibility of current and future use, economy of construction and harmony with the surrounding land and community. This unit will be insulated and heated to provide much needed accommodations in the colder months.",
