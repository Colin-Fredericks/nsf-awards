 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely recognized that linear control laws are inadequate to account for\r\nsevere nonlinearities and uncertainties that many physical systems possess.\r\nTwo examples of such systems, that will be studied in this project,\r\nare underactuated mechanical systems and communication networks.\r\nThe issue of designing performance-aimed nonlinear controllers\r\nwith robustness to significant uncertainties has drawn attention of\r\nmany researchers in the last 20 years.\r\nPhase I of this project will continue the study of nonlinear systems with\r\ndynamic uncertainties, initiated in our earlier work, and provide further\r\ninsights into the inherent limitations on achievable performance\r\ncaused by (input) dynamic uncertainties.\r\nDespite many elegant results in the recent literature of nonlinear control,\r\ntheir direct application to decentralized nonlinear systems with complex\r\ninterconnecting structures seems to be limited from a practical point of view. \r\nOn the basis of the new framework of nonlinear ISS (input-to-state stability) \r\nsmall-gain theorems, we will develop nonlinear feedback design tools for \r\nimportant classes of decentralized nonlinear systems\r\nwith applications to communication networks.\r\n\r\nPhase II of this project is to address some interesting nonlinear\r\ncontrol problems in communication networks. The study of hard saturation\r\nnonlinearities and time-varying uncertain propagation delays in such systems\r\nwill generate new decentralized/nonlinear control problems as applications\r\nfor the basic research in Phase I.\r\nWe expect that our contributions from the nonlinear control perspective\r\nwill enhance the NSF's existing investment in this active application area.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe educational element of this CAREER development plan is closely linked to\r\nthe research work. We will enhance the current control curriculum at Polytechnic\r\nby incorporating ``nonlinear'' thinking into the classical feedback control \r\ncourses where ``linear'' methods are now the focal point, and by developing \r\nWeb-based educational tools and tutorials.\r\nThe specific goals of the educational plan include:\r\n(1) developing a new graduate course {\\em Nonlinear Systems Theory}\r\nto report on recent developments in nonlinear systems and control;\r\n(2) setting up a Laboratory for Robust Nonlinear Control for research and \r\neducation,\r\nwhich strengthens the Department's activities in control;\r\n(3) promoting hands-on experiments and involving undergraduate students in \r\nresearch-oriented and application-driven projects; and\r\n(4) developing interactions with practicing engineers for technology transfer \r\nand dissemination of new theory through seminars, workshops and continuing \r\neducation programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
