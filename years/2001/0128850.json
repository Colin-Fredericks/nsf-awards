 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Information Technology Association of America (ITAA), the nation's leading IT association representing more than 500 corporate members from the information technology industry, proposes a pilot initiative to establish a framework for substantial engagement of its member companies with a core group of minority-serving institutions representing the more than 105 Hispanic Serving Institutions, 203 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and 32 Tribal Colleges and Universities across the U.S.  This effort will be directly responsive to the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and Technology (CAWMSET)  with respect to improving access to and the quality of higher education for groups underrepresented in science, engineering, and technology.  \r\n\r\nThe broad goal is to link the resources and expertise of ITAA and its members with those minority-serving institutions demonstrating the commitment and capacity to improve the technological and pedagogical infrastructure devoted to student learning, faculty and student research, and administrative processes.  \r\n\r\nThrough this initiative, ITAA will pursue two major activities:\r\n\r\n1. Assist in developing and implementing customized campus technology plans for specific schools through:\r\na) Identification, assessment, and refinement of user needs;\r\nb) Recommendation and technical assistance in procurement of baseline systems and technology\r\n\r\n2. Provide knowledge enhancement activities through:\r\na) Student and faculty internships in ITAA member firms\r\nb) Recommendation of specific curricular and research activity enhancements\r\nc) E-mentoring of students, faculty, and administrators\r\nd) ITAA practitioners-on-loan as potential academic and administrative consultants\r\n\r\nThe ITAA project will complement other NSF grants, including EDUCAUSE (Award # 9980537) and the Council on Competitiveness (Award# 0110028).  This project will also build upon the quality assurance provided by merit review of proposals submitted to the HBCU-UP and TCUP programs at NSF.\r\n",
