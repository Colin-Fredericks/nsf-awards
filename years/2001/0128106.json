The task of the workshop will be to produce a document for the US CLIVAR Scientific Steering Committee, presenting priority research and sustained observational activities within the Southern Ocean that reach Clivar objectives.  Four themes are presented to help guide the process:  (1)  Ocean circulation and overturning within the circumpolar belt, including the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, intermediate water, and subantarctic mode water production.  (2)  Ocean circulation and overturning within the Antarctic zone and regional sea-air\r\nfluxes, including processes leading to ventilation of the deep ocean.  (3) Large scale variability of the Southern Ocean and its relationship to global climate phenomena, including the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave.  (4)  Ocean circulation and its regulation of air-sea partitioning of carbon dioxide.  The workshop participants will also consider new observational techniques applicable to the Southern Ocean environment, particularly those that require special ship capable for handling of new observing platforms (e.g. autonomous vehicles).\r\n\tThe Southern Ocean is the major site of interocean exchange and ocean overturning. It\r\nprovides a heat source for the atmosphere, regulating to a significant degree the distribution of sea ice and perhaps even affecting glacial ice mass balance. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current and descent of \"antarctic\" waters shape much of the global ocean stratification. Interannual and lower frequency variability within the Southern Ocean has been linked to patterns of global climate variability. The CLIVAR SSC has endorsed the convening of this workshop, recognizing that the  Southern Ocean clearly has relevance to CLIVAR goals.\r\n***\r\n",
