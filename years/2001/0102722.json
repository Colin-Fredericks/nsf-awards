 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of the District of Columbia plans to establish a Science, \r\nMathematics, Engineering and Technology (SMET) Research and Training Center\r\nto develop and implement strategies to teach and retain students in SMET \r\ncourses. Specific objectives for organizing the Center are to: 1. Modify the\r\ncontent of entry level (gate-keeper) science, mathematics and engineering courses\r\nfor undergraduate students to enable them to improve their performance and \r\nretention rates in these programs, to improve performances on graduate and \r\nprofessional school standardized tests,and increase their competitiveness for\r\nemployment opportunities; 2. Develop procedures that will be used to improve\r\nscience, mathematics, engineering, and technology capabilities of faculty and\r\nstudents by identifying and planning activities such as seminars, symposia,\r\nand workshops to expose them to current trends in the various disciplines; and \r\n3. Obtain information on the current status of teaching and research facilities \r\nin the Biological and Environmental Sciences, Chemistry and Physics, Mathematics\r\n, and Engineering programs in order that a strategy can be developed to improve\r\nlaboratory infrastructure which includes obtaining equipment and adequate space \r\nthat will enhance faculty and undergraduate student research. The SMET Center is \r\ndesigned to improve the academic performance and increase student retention. \r\nEntry level (gate-keeper) science, mathematics and engineering courses in the\r\nSMET curricula will be revised to add a research component to the laboratory\r\ncourses in order to emphasize reasoning skills and stimulate logical thinking. \r\nThis activity is designed to develop a long-term dynamic curricula that can adapt \r\nto changing technologies. One hundred freshman students will be randomly selected\r\nto participate in the center. Fifty students will have declared majors in one of the\r\nSMET disciplines and 50 will be undeclared majors. The participants will be followed\r\nthrough graduation to determine the impact of the SMET Center activities on course\r\nattendance and completion rates, passing rates, research activities, grade point \r\naverages, graduation rates, enrollment in graduate and professional schools and\r\nemployment. The Center administrators will consist of the principal investigator\r\n, two co-principal investigators and an administrative assistant. The administrators\r\nwill plan and implement Center activities with the advice and support of the advisory \r\ncommittee. The principal investigator will have the primary responsibility of \r\nsupervising all aspects of the program with the co-principal investigators assuming \r\nthe day-to-day operations of the Center, such as, organizing, conducting and, \r\nimplementing the activities. An advisory committee consisting of scientists and\r\nadministrators (7), as well as, two consultants will complete the administrative\r\ncore. All faculty in the SMET disciplines will be invited to participate in the center.\r\nThey will participate in enrichment activities (research, workshops etc.), \r\nimplemented by the Center. These activities are expected to produce energetic\r\nfaculty, committed to teaching and research. They will utilize improved teaching\r\ntechniques and computer technology to make courses interesting and stimulating. \r\nThe status and availability of research and teaching facilities in the SMET disciplines\r\nat UDC will be assessed by consultants. The consultants (2), selected from UDC faculty,\r\nwill inventory current equipment and available space in the University for teaching\r\nand research. Additionally, the consultants will provide information concerning \r\navailable research facilities in government, industry, and research-intensive \r\nuniversities in Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n \r\n \t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
