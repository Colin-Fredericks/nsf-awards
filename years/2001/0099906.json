However, the goal of learning is often to obtain a model providing minimal prediction risk, i.e. error for (unknown) future data. It is well-known that for a given training sample there exist a model of optimal complexity corresponding to the smallest prediction (generalization) error for future data. Hence, any method for learning from samples need to have some provisions for complexity control. Existing implementations of complexity control include penalization (or regularization), weight decay (in neural networks), and various greedy procedures (i.e. stepwise regression).\r\n\r\nThere are three (generic) problems common to all methodologies for complexity control. First, one needs to define a meaningful complexity index for a set of (parameterized) functions (admissible models). Second, one needs to estimate the prediction risk from the (known) empirical risk; such estimates are known as model selection criteria in statistics. Third, there is a problem of finding a global minimum of the empirical risk (or penalized empirical risk).  This project will attempt to extent Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory in order to provide a principled solution to these problems.\r\n\r\nThis research is intended to improve theoretical understanding of signal estimation and to develop new practical methods for signal denoising.  The PI shall develop new methods for estimation/denoising of 1D and 2D signals (images) and compare them with existing wavelet denoising methods.\r\n",
