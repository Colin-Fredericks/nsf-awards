 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physiological and molecular studies of the diageotropica (dgt) mutant of tomato have demonstrated that plants have a single gene that is involved in regulating  many different aspects of growth, development, and responses to environment, including lateral root initiation, stem growth, leaf and vascular tissue differentiation, fruit development, and responses to gravity and light.  All of these processes are controlled by the plant hormone auxin and dgt mutant plants exhibit reduced sensitivity to auxin.  This project will complete the map-based cloning of the Dgt gene and begin characterization of it's function.  Using similarities with the Arabidopsis genome that was recently completely sequenced, we have used molecular markers to pinpoint the location of the Dgt gene to a single 15 Kb region of DNA.  We plan to completely sequence this region of the genome and use comparisons between normal and mutant genes as well as repair of mutant plants with the intact gene to confirm the identity of the Dgt gene.  Characterization of the DGT gene product following sequencing will have a large impact on our understanding of the interaction of other hormones with auxin in regulating environmental and developmental responses.  In addition, this research will explore the potential for the use of similar DNA regions between Arabidopsis and tomato to clone genes and provide validation for using the information emerging from the Arabidopsis genome project for studies of other plant species.\r\n\r\n",
