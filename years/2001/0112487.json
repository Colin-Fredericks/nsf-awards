 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n  Computer Scientists have been challenged by the existence of\r\nremarkable algorithms that work well in practice, but whose\r\ntheoretical analyses suggest that these algorithms should perform\r\npoorly or are inconclusive.  The root of this problem is that\r\ntraditional theoretical analyses measure the performance of\r\nalgorithms on their worst inputs.  This research analyzes the\r\nperformance of algorithms using smoothed analysis, a new measure of\r\nthe performance of algorithms that can better predict practical\r\nperformance.  Using smoothed analysis, this research aims to explain\r\nthe good practical performance of some algorithms that are famous\r\nfor outperforming pessimistic worst-case analyses.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In particular, algorithms that take real or complex inputs, such as\r\nthose that usually occur in scientific and engineering applications,\r\nare examined under random perturbations of their worst-case inputs.\r\nThe most famous of these, the simplex method for linear programming,\r\nwas the subject of the paper introducing smoothed analysis.  Yet, this\r\nwork only investigated one rarely-used pivot rule.  This research\r\nattempts smoothed analyses of the simplex method under more commonly\r\nused pivot rules.  It also considers smoothed analyses of interior\r\npoint methods and algorithms for convex programming.  An attempt is\r\nbeing made to extend this analysis to algorithms that take discrete\r\ninputs.",
