 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polymer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst (Umass) is supported by the Chemistry Division, the Division of Undergraduate Education, and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities under the \"Research Sites for Educators in Chemistry\" (RSEC) program.  The Prinicipal Investigator,. Thomas McCarthy is joined by Sandra Burkett of Amherst College, Wei Chen of Mount Holyoke College, and Kate Queeney of Smith College.  This Western Massachusetts RSEC will integrate their research efforts.  The planned research themes are (1) rational heterogenation of homogeneous catalyst, (2) molecular imprinting of polymeric materials, (3) surface modification to control wettability and biocompatibility, and (4) control of protein adsorption through chemistry and topography.  To expand the RSEC, the program will focus its attention on nine other two- and four-year institutions in the local area.  One of the goals of this RSEC is to increase the number of undergraduate chemistry majors at the participating institutions by injecting polymer and materials chemistry into existing courses at all levels, and by developing a one-semester course in polymer chemistry complete with notes and instructor's guide.  Central to the formation of these collaborations is a series sabbaticals, and summer research appointments for faculty and undergraduate students at the four core institutions.  This RSEC will be managed by a Director and an Advisory Board made up of representatives from each participating institution.  There will also be an Executive Advisory Board made up of administrators from the institutions and outside experts in polymer research.\r\n\r\nResearch Sites for Educators in Chemistry bring together the faculty of participating two-year colleges, baccalaureate colleges, and master's universities with faculty at research universities within a geographic region, for the purpose of enhancing the research and educational opportunities for all participants.  Academic and research institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.  RSECs such as this one at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst provide mechanisms for disseminating the knowledge, skill, practices and ethics of research to a broader community, including those from underrepresented groups; assist in developing viable, sustainable research programs at participating institutions; and involve faculty and students at the participating institutions with a broader cross-section of faculty and students.\r\n\r\n",
