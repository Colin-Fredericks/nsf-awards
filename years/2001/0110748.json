 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to improve the understanding of phosphorous storage and use in wheat and barley seeds.  Approximately 75% of the phosphorous in wheat and barley seeds is in the form of phytic acid, which makes the phosphorous unavailable in diets of humans, poultry, swine, and fish.  As a consequence, much of the phosphorous consumed is excreted, which  creates a significant environmental problem in animal waste management.  Moreover, humans consuming a primarily grain-based diet may suffer mineral\r\ndeficiencies because of the ability of phytic acid to form tightly-bound complexes with minerals.  The enzymes involved in phytic acid accumulation in seeds are  not fully characterized.  Low phytic acid wheat and barley selections have  been identified.  Using these mutants and techniques of genetic analysis,  this project will further the understanding of this important metabolic  process in cereal seeds.  The goal is to identify, clone, and  characterize genes associated with the synthesis of phytic acid and related  phosphorous biochemical pathways (specifically inositol monophosphatase and  inositol kinase), to better understand this pathway's role in plant biology,  and ultimately to improve world grain crops to reduce animal-derived  phosphorous pollution and improve mineral nutrition of humans and  domesticated livestock.",
