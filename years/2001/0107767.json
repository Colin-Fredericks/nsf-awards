The current methods, such as dredging, may not be successful in ice-covered waters, so the Principal Investigator is proposing to design, test and build a new rock sampler.  He is also proposing to retrofit a hydrothermal monitor, known as the miniature autonomous plume recorder (MAPR).  The MAPR was developed by the Pacific Marine Environmental Lab to increase opportunities or collecting hydrothermal plume data along mid-ocean ridge and volcanic systems.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is appropriate for consideration under the SGER program because the rock sampler has not been developed.  Neither the rock sampler nor the retrofitted plume recorder have ever been tested under ice.  Therefore, the instruments meet the SGER criterion, \"preliminary work on untested and novel idea.\" If one or all of the instruments perform successfully under ice, then the Arctic program will have several new and inexpensive sampling devises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
