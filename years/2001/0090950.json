 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium Signalling in the Regulation of Flagellar Beating in Sperm\r\nIn mammals, fertilization takes place deep within the female reproductive tract, in the\r\nampulla of the oviduct. When sperm are recovered from the ampulla and observed swimming\r\non microscope slides, they swim vigorously in circles. This swimming pattern is termed\r\nhyperactivation. In the environment of the oviduct, hyperactivation is not so useless as it might\r\nseem; in fact, it assists sperm in reaching the oocyte and in penetrating the cumulus matrix and\r\nzona pellucida. Hyperactivation is switched on by an increase in Ca 2+ at the flagellar axoneme in\r\nthe core of the flagellum. The goal of this project is to determine how Ca 2+ reaches the axoneme\r\nto switch on hyperactivation. Pharmacological agents that induce release of Ca 2+ from intracellular\r\nstores (thapsigargin, thimerosal, and caffeine) were found to initiate hyperactivation in bull sperm.\r\nThere are two families of Ca 2+ stores in cells, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor stores (IP3 R)\r\nand the ryanodine receptor stores (RyR). Antibodies against IP3 R revealed the presence of a store\r\nin the flagellum. This store may be the redundant nuclear envelope (RNE), an organelle located at\r\nthe base of the flagellum. The RNE arises during spermiogenesis, when condensation of the\r\nnucleus of the spermatid leaves behind excess nuclear envelope. Rather than being discarded, as\r\nare all other superfluous cytoplasm and organelles, the RNE is retained and packaged neatly as a\r\nscroll of membranes at the base of the flagellum. It is proposed that the RNE is retained to serve\r\nas a Ca 2+ store. In addition to providing Ca 2+ to the base of the axoneme, the RNE could release\r\nCa 2+ to mitochondria to stimulate ATP production. The RNE is quite closely associated with\r\nmitochondria at the base of the flagellum. These mitochondria are terminal members of the tightly-wrapped\r\nhelix of mitochondria that surrounds the axoneme in the flagellar midpiece. The helix\r\nforms a barrier in the midpiece between the plasma membrane and axoneme; therefore, the\r\nmitochondria are also in a position to regulate Ca 2+ in the axoneme.\r\nGiven this unique organization of RNE and mitochondria with respect to the axoneme, the\r\nfollowing 4 hypotheses were developed to test how these organelles play a role in initiating\r\nhyperactivation. Bull sperm (Bos taurus) will be used to test the hypotheses.\r\nHypothesis 1: The intracellular store that provides Ca 2+ for hyperactivation is gated by both IP3\r\nand ryanodine receptors. Our preliminary evidence implicates both types of receptors in releasing\r\nCa 2+ to initiate hyperactivation. Highly specific agonists of the receptors will be used to confirm\r\nthese findings. If the hypothesis is correct, it would mean that the amount of Ca 2+ released can\r\noccur at two or three levels, depending upon which receptor is activated: IP3 R alone, RyR alone, or\r\nthe two in combination. Such a mechanism can control the intensity of hyperactivation, such as to\r\nincrease flagellar bending during penetration of the zona pellucida.\r\nHypothesis 2: The intracellular Ca 2+ store in the flagellum is the RNE. It is proposed that this\r\nunique structure, which has been ignored in the past, is responsible for providing Ca 2+ for\r\nhyperactivation. Localization of the IP3 R and/or RyR to the RNE should tell us whether this\r\nhypothesis is correct.\r\nHypothesis 3: A Ca 2+ rise in mitochondria is involved in switching on hyperactivation. The\r\npicture of Ca 2+ signalling that has been emerging for other cells is that mitochondria pick up Ca 2+\r\nreleased from intracellular stores and respond by increasing ATP production. ATP levels are\r\ndoubled in hyperactivated guinea pig sperm. Therefore, experiments are proposed to test whether\r\nrelease of Ca 2+ from intracellular stores results in increased levels of Ca 2+ , NADH, and ATP in\r\nflagellar mitochondria.\r\nHypothesis 4: Mitochondria regulate flagellar Ca 2+ and hyperactivation. The tight wrap of\r\nmitochondria around the flagellar axoneme separates it from the plasma membrane; therefore,\r\nmitochondria are in a position to affect Ca 2+ levels at the axoneme in the site where the flagellar\r\nbend develops. Blockers of mitochondrial release of Ca 2+ will be applied to sperm before using\r\npharmacological initiators of hyperactivation to determine whether hyperactivation can be prevented.\r\nThe testing of these 4 hypotheses should provide a picture of how Ca 2+ turns on this\r\nmovement pattern that is essential to fertilization.\r\n",
