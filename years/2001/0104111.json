Johnston\r\n\r\nPolygonal knot theory studies the isotopy classes of embedded\r\npolygons in three space where the number and length of edges are\r\nfixed throughout the isotopy.  The PI and co-author have found\r\nthe first examples of polygons which are topologically unknotted,\r\nbut for which the isotopy class of embeddings is nontrivial. The\r\nPI and student collaborators will investigate questions such as\r\nwhether or not there are any such examples for equilateral\r\npolygons. Surgery theory studies the set of manifold structures\r\nwithin a given homotopy type. The Bryant-Ferry-Mio-Weinberger\r\nsurgery exact sequence for homology manifolds has been used by\r\nthe PI to prove that up to s-cobordism many of the geometric\r\nproperties of manifolds also hold for homology manifolds. The\r\nNovikov conjecture and related coarse Novikov conjecture are keys\r\nto our understanding of surgery theory.  The PI has developed\r\nsome techniques for attacking the coarse Novikov conjecture for\r\nunusual non uniformly contractible spaces. Controlled and bounded\r\nsurgery theory will be used to further investigate homology\r\nmanifolds and the coarse Novikov conjecture.\r\n\r\nUp to now, topologists have studied well-behaved spaces such as\r\nmanifolds.  Yet singular spaces arise more and more frequently in\r\nsubjects such as analysis, algebraic geometry and physics.  The\r\nnon-resolvable homology manifolds studied in this project are so\r\nsingular that they have no points whatsoever with Euclidean\r\nneighborhoods.  Perhaps these strange spaces will someday account\r\nfor the extra dimensions of the universe predicted by string\r\ntheory. Coarse geometry, and the coarse homology of John Roe are\r\nways of separating the large scale behavior of spaces from the\r\nlocal information.  The invariants of coarse geometry and\r\ntopology depend only on the large scale behavior of the\r\nspace. Better understanding of these objects and their invariants\r\nwill help topologists to classify the different types of singular\r\nspaces, which appear throughout modern physics. In polygonal knot\r\ntheory, a new twist on the classical study of knots, a different\r\ntype of singular spaces is studied. This new theory is modeled by\r\nsticks joined end to end by universally flexible joints (rubber\r\ntubing perhaps) to form a closed loop. The PI has produced the\r\nfirst examples of configurations which are stuck (cannot be\r\nunraveled), but only because they are made of sticks.  If the\r\nsame configurations were made of string they could be unraveled.\r\nKnot theory of strings has been applied to the study of protein\r\nand DNA molecules.  For a small number of atoms each bond can be\r\nrepresented by a stick in the model discussed here, This is a\r\nricher and more appropriate model for small molecules than the\r\nstring which has been used in the past.\r\n",
