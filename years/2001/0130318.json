 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Museum of Science in Boston is proposing to work with eight other science centers to investigate how science centers might collaborate to enhance the public understanding of research.  The purpose of the planning effort is to identify and elaborate on promising approaches to increase the public understanding of the nature of scientific research, the process of technological innovation, and the interaction between science and technology and societal issues.  Planning will be conducted in the context of three topics (tentative):  global climate change, alternative energy sources, and genetically modified foods.  Questions to be explored include:\r\n\r\nwhat it would take for each science center to offer exhibits and presentations on all three topics,\r\nhow can the exhibits be kept current,\r\nwhat is the best mechanism for keeping science centers informed about current research,\r\nwhat would motivate visitors to return in order to follow a single line of research,\r\nhow can visitors best continue their connection with the science centers after their visits,\r\nwhat will science centers change in the way they develop exhibits and programs in order to present current science and technology,\r\nwhat costs and logistical factors will need to be taken into consideration,\r\nwill \"one size fit all\" or will different designs be needed for different science centers, and\r\nhow might the exhibits and programs be designed to encourage the incorporation of local resources.\r\n\r\nThe project will be coordinated with other media that are developing efforts to convey on-going science to the public.  Evan Hadingham, Science Editor for NOVA at WGBH, will bring the perspective of television production; Rob Semper from the Exploratorium will represent the Internet; and Bruce Lowenstein, Editor of Public Understanding of Science, will represent print.  The science centers participating in the planning effort include:  \r\n\r\nMuseum of Science, Boston\r\nNew York Hall of Science\r\nScience Museum of Minnesota\r\nArizona Science Center\r\nTech Museum of Innovation\r\nCalifornia Science Center\r\nThe Exploratorium\r\nPacific Science Center\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History\r\n",
