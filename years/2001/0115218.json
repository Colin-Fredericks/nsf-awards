 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project between Michigan Technological University (MTU) and Southwest Texas State University (SWT) focuses on the fabrication and testing of waveguide photonic crystals in magnetic oxides for novel integrated photonic device prototyping.  The project responds to the growing interest in photonic crystals for device applications based on their unique optical band gap properties.  While various novel optical band gap structures have been fabricated in non-magnetic dielectric media for highly efficient waveguiding, filtering and resonator applications, very little work has been done on photonic crystals in magnetic systems and no work exists on monolithic planar magnetophotonic crystals.  This project will focus on the electron-beam patterning of magnetic photonic crystals on ferrite waveguides for a new generation of integrated optical isolator devices.\r\n The non-reciprocal properties of magnetic oxides, such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG), make these materials a unique choice for optical isolator and circulator fabrication.  Optical fiber telecommunications have developed to the point where the monolithic integration of different optical components is a serious issue to reduce costs in local area networks and long-distance data transmittal.  However, conventional systems utilizing non-planar geometries are both bulky and expensive.  Photonic crystal structures provide a novel alternative to address this problem since they can significantly enhance the Faraday response, making it possible to build smaller and cheaper isolators and circulators, a generation beyond the types of integrated isolators being explored at present. \r\nThe proposed program will concentrate on the fabrication of patterned ridge waveguides on rf-sputtered bismuth-substituted YIG films, with special emphasis on achieving superior optical isolation by minimizing birefringence. It will also explore the fabrication of flat top transmission devices.  By establishing the practical implementation of magnetic photonic crystals on chip, the project will also contribute to the development of optical filters, highly efficient Kerr reflectors for magneto-optic recording and mode converters.\r\n\r\n",
