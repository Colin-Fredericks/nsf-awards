 "awd_abstract_narration": "The summer undergraduate research program in the Department of Physics at the University of Connecticut, supported by a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Award, is intended to expose a diverse group of talented undergraduates to an exciting research environment (including Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, Nuclear Physics and Particle Theory) and to inform them in weekly seminars about the frontiers of physics and about careers in physics.  Departmental social gatherings, a final poster session for presentation of research results, and assignment of a graduate student mentor as well as a faculty advisor are included to enhance the participants' sense of community with the other members of the department.  Our program attracts outstanding students on a nationwide basis, including talented women and both under-represented and other minority undergraduates, as well as students from primarily undergraduate institutions with less access to a comprehensive research environment.  The program encourages these participants to pursue careers in physics.",
