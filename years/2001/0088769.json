The capstone course provides students with opportunities to explore issues experimentally, design realistic experiments, collect data and draw conclusions based on the results. Experimental exploration, the centerpiece of the traditional scientific method, can provide new insights, eliminate unproductive approaches and validate theories and methods. The course materials are centered around a textbook that has two types of chapters, content chapters that develop experimental design concepts and project chapters that apply these concepts to particular problems. The project chapters are in the form of paper case studies or simulation. This approach provides a much needed introduction to computer science research in the undergraduate curriculum. The most extensive projects are based on simulations of different aspects of computer system performance, because this venue allows the student the most flexibility in forming and testing hypotheses. Interactive simulations are written in Java and run through a standard browser. The materials are disseminated through presentations and workshops at computer science conferences and via the Web. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
