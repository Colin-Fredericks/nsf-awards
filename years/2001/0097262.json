 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Harvey Mudd College (HMC).  Shenda Baker is the site's Program Director. Eight faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2001-2003), eight students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  Only female students will be recruited and accepted. No more than one-half of the participants may be from HMC.  The research projects offered are in the areas of analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, physical, and theoretical chemistry. Summer research activities will be supplemented with workshops on careers in chemistry and scientific ethics, seminars, and a plant tour to an operating chemical facility.  Program assessment will include tracking the students' major upon graduation, publications, career path and eventual degree obtained. An anonymous program evaluation form will also be used to provide feedback on ways to improve the students' summer research experience. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
