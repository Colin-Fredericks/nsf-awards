The paleomagnetic equipment will complement paleomagnetic instruments and equipment (spinner magnetometer, impulse magnetizer, portable drill and orientation equipment) already acquired by GMU. The paleomagnetic equipment will be utilized primarily by the principal investigator, Stephen S. Harlan and his students, but will also be available for use by individuals from universities and government agencies in the regional Virginia-Washington, D.C.-Maryland area. The Spinner Kappabridge, in particular, will be unique to this region. Current research projects by the principal investigator include the paleomagnetism and geochronology of Proterozoic rocks in the western U.S. and Canada, the timing of fold and thrust belt deformation in the Cordilleran orogenic belt, the nature and origin of magnetic phases in modern and ancient soils and their parent materials, and paleomagnetic, rock magnetic, and magnetic fabric studies of silicic volcanic rocks in the eastern Snake River Plain and Yellowstone National Park. Support for the acquisition of this equipment is shared by the NSF Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program (EAR/IF) and by George Mason University.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
