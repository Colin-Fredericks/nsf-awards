Shreve\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nWork is proposed in two areas.  The first is the analysis of queueing\r\nsystems with deadlines under heavy traffic conditions.  Consider a\r\nqueueing system with renewal process arrival streams.  Suppose that\r\nupon arrival, each customer is assigned a lead time, the amount of time\r\nuntil the customer's deadline for service elapses.  One can model the lead\r\ntimes of the customers in queue at a station as a counting measure on the\r\nreal line, the location of the point masses corresponding to customer lead\r\ntimes.  Research will address the convergence of these measure-valued\r\nprocesses under heavy-traffic scaling.  Research will also be directed to\r\nmathematical models for finance.  On such model is for an option on a\r\ntraded account.  For the simplest of these, an account trading one\r\nunderlying geometric Brownian motion and a constant-interest-rate money\r\nmarket, there is a strikingly simple optimal rule: hold the geometric\r\nBrownian motion long when the account value is negative and short when\r\nthe account value is positive.  For an option on two geometric Brownian\r\nmotions, there is a conjectured optimal rule, which is supported by\r\nnumerical analysis.  The proof appears to require the development of new\r\nmathematics.  A second mathematical finance problem concerns the\r\ndevelopment of a unifying model for risk-neutral pricing of credit\r\nderivatives.\r\n\r\nThis research has two parts.  The subject of the first part, queueing\r\nsystems with deadlines, arise in communication networks, especially\r\nnetworks used to transmit digitized video or audio signals.  Data which\r\nare too long delayed can cause unacceptable disruption  of the signal.\r\nThe proposed research  will provide a basis for performance analysis of\r\nheavily-loaded communication networks which take deadlines into account.\r\nThe subject of the second part, mathematical models for finance, builds on\r\nthe revolution in finance begun by the Black-Scholes option pricing \r\nformula.  The particular work proposed here  is concerned with proper\r\npricing and usage of financial instruments whose purpose is to insure\r\nagainst loss, either due to drastic reduction in market value (options on\r\na traded account) or default (credit derivatives).",
