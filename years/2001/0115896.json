This workshop is held every four years under the auspices of the U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and this year it will be hosted by the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  It will provide a setting for exchanging ideas, cultivating friendships, renewing acquaintances, building networks, and educating graduate students.  Key and distinguished individuals from industry, academe, and government, from all over the world will be invited to give keynote lectures and presentations in the workshop. A special emphasis will be placed on the emerging fields of nanoscience, wave propragation in heterogeneous media, fluid-structure interaction and Mechanics Education.  Every effort will be made to select both an ethnically and scientifically diverse group of students to represent all areas of theoretical and applied mechanics.",
