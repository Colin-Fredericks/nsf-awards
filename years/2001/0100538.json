 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four projects on the mathematical theory of dynamical systems are\r\nproposed. Each project contains a cluster of problems with a common \r\ntheme. The first pertains to strange attractors with strong dissipation \r\nand a single direction of instability. Extensions of a general theory \r\ndeveloped under a previous grant to arbitrary phase-dimensions are \r\nproposed, as are applications to concrete problems such as nonlinear \r\noscillators. The second project concerns the statistical behavior of \r\ndynamical systems with predominantly hyperbolic behavior. The focus of\r\nthe proposed research is on mechanisms leading to various rates of \r\ncorrelation decay in both discrete and continuous times. The topic of \r\nthe third project is lattice dynamical systems. A systematic analysis \r\nof the aggregate behavior of large numbers of dynamical systems coupled \r\ntogether is proposed. The final project proposes dynamical systems \r\nmethods of solution for three unrelated problems on the Schrodinger \r\noperator, kinematic fast dynamo and Navier-Stokes equations.\r\n\r\nAs a branch of mathematics, dynamical systems is concerned with \r\nthe time evolutions of processes governed by certain underlying laws.\r\nA primary goal of the subject is to develop unifying mathematical\r\ntheories to explain observed phenomena and predict future occurrences. \r\nIn this proposal, the investigation of a number of models amenable to \r\nmathematical analysis and with potential applications to the physical \r\nand biological sciences is proposed. It has been known for some time \r\nthat relatively simple laws can lead to complicated dynamics. The \r\nfirst part of this proposal focuses on systems with chaotic behavior. \r\nTwo topics are proposed: an analysis of strange attractors and a \r\nstatistical theory of mixing. (Strange attractors are highly complex \r\nobjects which capture the long term behaviors of dissipative dynamical \r\nsystems; they have been observed frequently in nature and in simulations \r\nbut have thus far resisted rigorous analysis.) Other projects proposed \r\ninclude the relations between aggregate properties of large dynamical \r\nsystems and those of their individual components, and a few problems \r\nfrom physics and hydrodynamics which the principal investigator \r\nbelieves can be solved by the methods of dynamical systems.\r\nFour projects on the mathematical theory of dynamical systems are\r\nproposed.
