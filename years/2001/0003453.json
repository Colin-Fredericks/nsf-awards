Metamorphic processes are an integral part of the long-term cycles that control the distribution of elements among the solid earth, oceans, and atmosphere.  This research examines the application of reflectance spectroscopy in the visible and near infrared wavelength region (350-2500 nm) as an alternative method for characterizing the mineralogy of metamorphic rocks and generating maps of mineral distribution.  Spectroscopic methods offer two distinct advantages relative to conventional mapping methods:  1) acquisition of spectra is rapid and inexpensive, and 2) measurements can be made in the field with portable spectrometers or remotely with aircraft or satellite based imaging spectrometers.  In this project, methods are being developed to map the distribution of metamorphic minerals using advanced airborne and satellite-based remote sensing data, which are being provided through a unique partnership with NASA.  Mapping methods being developed under this research project, however, can be applied to address many other earth science problems and are currently being implemented in studies of mineral deposit exploration, vegetation classification and land cover change, and forestry resource monitoring.  \r\n",
