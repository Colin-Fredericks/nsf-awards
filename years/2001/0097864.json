 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-REU Site in Physics at San Jose State University, a modern comprehensive California State University campus,  has operated on a year-round basis since 1989, has high minority and female participation, and draws from a large pool of well-qualified undergraduate Physics majors.  Most of the ongoing research projects are in the areas of optics, condensed matter, and computational physics - areas that represent the major scientific focus in high-tech Silicon Valley surrounding our campus.  These on-going projects provide both experimental and theoretical research experiences for undergraduates in Physics.  Our summer program serves under-represented students from universities other than San Jose State, and part of our program provides support for students in industry-university partnerships.  These partnerships consist of a Physics faculty member, a physicist from an industry or government laboratory, and an NSF-REU student participant.  This part of our program fosters important collaborations and facilitates technology transfer to the commercial sector.  Research results are reported with, in some cases, student participants as co-authors.  In addition, formal presentations by students are made at weekly REU meetings of students, faculty, and industrial scientists. \r\n\r\n",
