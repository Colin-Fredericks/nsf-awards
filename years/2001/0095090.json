 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0095223 and OCE-0095090\r\n\r\nThe process of dissolved organic matter (DOM) transport toward export regions has been inferred mostly from a  few sections showing surface accumulation of enhanced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and penetration to  depth.  Decomposition during flow from source regions to export sites has not been studied, nor  has the accompanying transport of dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus (DON and DOP).   In this project, researchers at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences will observe the transport of accumulated DOC, DON and DOP during the  spring phytoplankton bloom in the NE Atlantic Ocean, the region previously studied in the  JGOFS North Atlantic Bloom Experiment.  They will track the transport and simultaneous  decomposition of both the overwintering and newly-produced DOM as it flows through the NE  Atlantic toward a site of bottom water formation to the northeast of the U.K. in the Norwegian  Sea. This project will take advantage of an opportunity to participate on a detailed hydrographic survey of the  NE Atlantic in spring 2001 aboard the U.K. research vessel RRS CHARLES DARWIN  with colleagues from the George Deacon Division of the Southampton Oceanography Centre  (SOC), U.K. A principal cruise objective is to calculate volume transports, from which mass  transport of DOM can be estimated.   \r\nWhile the broad outlines of these processes have now been sketched in, there have been  no detailed studies in which DOM transport has been explicitly studied in the relevant  hydrographic framework, and none in which simultaneous estimates of underway decomposition  have been determined. This study, a collaboration among biogeochemists,  microbial ecologists, and physical oceanographers would be the first  to provide synoptic data on DOC, DON and DOP concentrations, volume transports and decomposition rates, from which mass transport of DOM components can be assessed.  \r\n",
