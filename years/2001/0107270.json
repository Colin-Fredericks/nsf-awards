The Program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral research fellowship for \r\nDr. Anthony Aufdenkampe to work with Dr. Reynaldo L. Victoria and Dr. Alex V. Krusche of CENA and Dr. Ron Benner of the University of South Carolina.  Support for this project is coming from the Ecosystem Studies Program of the BIO Division and the U.S.-Brazil Program in the Division of International Programs.\r\n\r\nThese experiments are designed toward two objectives: (1) Develop empirical relationships of river metabolism as a function of water composition, discharge hydrograph, and sub-basin characteristics, to be immediately applicable to the first parameterization of the ROMBUS model.  (2) Interpret microbial organic matter transformations in rivers from the more detailed perspective of bioenergetics, which is the first step toward a more mechanistic parameterization of these processes.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to explore controls on rates of organic matter remineralization within the Amazon River system.  The benefit of this project is that it will advance the knowledge of our understanding of Amazon River basin, and river ecology as well as provide us with a better understanding of river metabolism and water composition.  \r\n",
