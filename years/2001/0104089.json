 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for DMS - 0104089\r\n\r\nThe focus of the proposal is on the research of locally Hermitian symmetric\r\nspaces of non-compact type, considered as special complex manifolds of \r\nnon-positive sectional curvature.  Complex hyperbolicity can be considered as \r\na weak notion of negative curvature.  From analytic point of view, the \r\nprincipal investigator proposes to work on the rigidity of tangent bundles \r\namong the moduli space of vector bundles of locally Hermitian symmetric spaces.\r\nFrom the uniformization point of view, he proposes to work on characterization of \r\narithmetic lattices in complex two balls.  He proposes to investigate the analogue\r\nof Fijita's conjectures concerning very ampleness of pluricanonical line bundles \r\non such manifolds, relating to algebraic geometry.  He proposes to understand and \r\nestimate the growth of Betti numbers on a tower of coverings naturally associated \r\nwith the manifolds, relating topology to geometry.  In the direction of number \r\ntheory, he proposes to study the question on finiteness of rational points on \r\nmodels of two ball quotients defined over an algebraic number field.  He also \r\nproposes to work on several other problems in the area of complex hyperbolicity\r\nand  Kaehler geometry, relating to his earlier research directions.\r\n\r\nIn mathematics, people are interested in models which on one hand are elegant \r\nand relatively simple to describe and on the other hand display rich mathematical\r\nstructures.  Locally Hermitian symmetric spaces are such nice geometric models for\r\nwhich different disciplines of mathematics meet.  The main purpose of this \r\nproposal is to understand several geometric and arithmetic aspects of such models\r\nand explain their interrelationships.  Understanding of the various properties\r\nand problems proposed will enhance the knowledge of the subject and other \r\ndisciplines of mathematics involved.\r\n",
