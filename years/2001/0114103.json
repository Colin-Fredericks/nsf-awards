The investigators will assemble one of the world's most powerful FTIR imaging systems that will have unprecedented sensitivity and speed for spatially resolved spectroscopic measurements and be a uniquely powerful technique for studying all types of polymer diffusion in various materials including nano-networks and nanocomposites and for studying phase separations and confinement effects. The acquisition of the proposed instrument will provide the timely training of a future generation of scientists skillful in vibrational spectroscopic imaging that will soon replace the existing 5,000 infrared microscopes in the world.  The research will provide a novel learning experience in polymer science and engineering, enabling the largest interdisciplinary polymer program at University of Akron to be the first to possess this emerging technology for research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports instrument acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared Imaging System for Multicomponent Polymer Dynamics Research and Student Education at the University of Akron.
