 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Professor Wilfred Tysoe of the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee is jointly supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Civil and Mechanical Systems Program in the Engineering Directorate.   The goals of the research project are 1) to elucidate the relationship between the surface chemistry of tribological films, 2) to characterize the film structure and 3) to define the film's tribological properties.  Prior research by this investigator has shown that tribological films grown in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions are identical to those formed under tribological conditions.  A fundamental understanding of the friction and wear behavior of the thin films will lead to safer, more effective lubricants.\r\n\r\nThe research project demonstrates an excellent integration of education and research.  This fundamental research could have direct impact on society in the immediate future by providing lubricant chemists information needed for improving lubricant formulations.  Additionally, the current additives used in lubricants are being phased out due to environmental regulations and it is critical to discover new, effective additives.  Lubricants are used in metal working processes to reduce waste, optimize final product and increase productivity.  Thus this research is significant and timely.",
