The investigators will work on 3 research projects.  First they will complete an experimental calibration of the recrystallized grain size piezometer for the 3 recrystallization mechanisms and corresponding dislocation creep regimes previously identified in quartz, and will test them with application to a natural shear zone which spanned a wide temperature range including all 3 regimes.  Second, they will complete an experimental study of the processes by which a relatively small amount of weak mica in a quartza-feldspathic aggregate becomes interconnected and dispersed, leading to profound strain weakening and localization into ductile shear zones.  Third, they will complete a reconnaissance experimental study of the variation in deformation mechanisms and strength across the plagioclase solid solution series.  Based on that study the investigators will choose 2 or 3 key compositions for further stepping experiments in a molten salt assembly to determine flow law parameters.\r\n",
