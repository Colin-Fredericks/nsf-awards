 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mischaikow\r\n0107396\r\n     The goal of this project is to better understand the\r\nrelationship between dispersal rates and the spatio-temporal\r\nheterogeneity of environments.  In particular, the investigator\r\nwould like to understand if there are any fundamental\r\nrelationships upon which a framework for this theory can be\r\ndeveloped.  Therefore, to minimize extraneous effects the\r\ninvestigator continues to study what is perhaps the simplest\r\ncontinuous model that explicitly incorporates a spatial variable:\r\na system of reaction diffusion equations with Lotka-Volterra\r\nreaction terms, where the reaction term of each species is\r\nidentical, and where the birth rate is spatially and temporally\r\nheterogeneous.  This model allows for a variety of perturbations\r\nthrough which one can study the impact of various factors in the\r\nevolution of dispersal rates.  Of course, this model has several\r\nlimitations.  The first is the assumption that leads to the\r\ndispersal being represented as simple diffusion.  The investigator\r\nwishes to understand the effects of taxis on the relationship\r\nbetween dispersal rates and spatial heterogeneity.  On a more\r\ngeneral level the investigator intends to replace diffusion by an\r\nintegral kernel.\r\n     That ecology and evolution are fundamentally influenced by\r\nthe spatial characteristics of the environment is well accepted.\r\nAs an example of this one may consider the paradox of diversity.\r\nSimple mathematical models that do not include any spatial\r\ncomponent give rise to the principle of competitive exclusion:\r\nwhen two species compete for the same limited resource one of the\r\nspecies usually becomes extinct.  On the other hand it is commonly\r\nobserved that in a wide variety of habitats a multitude of\r\nspecies coexist.  This can be explained, at least in part, by\r\nincluding spatial effects.  Of course, once spatial components are\r\nintroduced, dispersal rates become a central feature.\r\nUnfortunately, our understanding of cause and effect in this more\r\ngeneral situation is poor.  The reasons for this appears to be\r\nfourfold.  First, the number of variables in realistic ecological\r\nand environmental models is enormous.  Second, spatial\r\nheterogeneities occur at all scales of the environment.  Third,\r\nobtaining precise data for these variables from field studies is\r\nextremely difficult.  Finally, current mathematical techniques for\r\nhandling models that incorporate both spatial and dynamical\r\nproperties seem to be inadequate.  Given this state of affairs, a\r\nsimple model is thoroughly investigated in the hopes of\r\nelucidating the basic biological principles and identifying the\r\nfundamental mathematical issues.\r\n\r\n",
