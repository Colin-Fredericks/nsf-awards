 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to aid in purchase of an automated DNA sequencer and related equipment and software needed for sample preparation and data analysis.  Use of the instrumentation in research and training efforts will be shared by a large group of  faculty, students and postdocs.  Research areas to be addressed include regulation of surface proteins in various protozoa, gene-flow in tropical trees, yeast gene regulation and variability in flower color.  Many research questions in biology now require use knowledge of genotypes as a basic unit of observation. These questions span diverse fields and include hypotheses related to protein structure and function, gene regulation, genome organization, relationships within and among species, spatial and temporal organization of genetic polymorphism and the exchange of gametes among populations or individuals.  Automated approaches to DNA sequencing and fragment genotyping are faster and more accurate than the manual methods they replace, increasing the quantity and quality of data. In addition to use in research, the faculty plan to employ the instrument in hands-on laboratory exercises, now technically beyond their laboratory capabilities, for both undergraduate and graduate courses.",
