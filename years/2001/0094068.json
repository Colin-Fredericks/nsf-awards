 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Dr. Marcey waters in the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.   The work consists of a series of studies to better understand the role of pi-pi stacking interactions in macromolecular recognition in both DNA and proteins.   She will measure the rate constants of rotation around biaryl bonds using NMR line-width analysis, and will also use NMR NOESY measurements to determine the extent of beta-sheet formation and assess pi-pi stacking interactions in a two stranded beta-peptide.  These systems will probe the roles of electronic effects, solvent, surface area, and heteroatoms in the aromatic rings.\r\n\r\nThe research and  teaching goals of this proposal are to understand biological structure and reactivity through physical organic chemistry studies, particularly using nuclear magnetic resonance methods.   The relationship between biological systems and nonbiological organic molecules will be emphasized at both graduate and undergraduate levels, including experiments in sophomore organic chemistry laboratory.\r\n\r\n",
