 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and his colleagues use an\r\nexperiment-based computational approach to model blood flow in\r\nlarge stenotic arteries and investigate critical flow and artery\r\nwall behaviors that may lead to artery compression, plaque cap\r\nrupture, stroke and heart attack.  Dynamic properties of the\r\nstenotic arteries with plaque stiffness and geometry variations\r\nare determined experimentally using hydrogel tubes whose\r\nmechanical properties are close to those of bovine carotid\r\narteries.  This leads to a series of 3-D nonlinear computational\r\nmodels with fluid-wall interactions based on the experimental\r\nmeasurements.  Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation is used\r\nto deal with free moving boundaries.  Implicit methods including\r\nthe SIMPLER algorithm and fully coupled methods based on\r\nmesh-free generalized finite differences with staggered grids,\r\nupwind techniques, and a consistent physical interpolation\r\ntechnique are used to solve the fluid model.  A sequence of\r\nexperiment-based thin- and thick-wall models are introduced to\r\nmodel the dynamic nonlinear properties of the stenotic tube wall\r\nwith large strain, deformation, compression and collapse.  An\r\nincremental boundary iteration method and an under-relaxation\r\ntechnique are used to handle the fluid-wall interactions.\r\nValidated by experimental data, results obtained are\r\nphysiologically relevant and may provide information helpful for\r\nearly detection, diagnosis and prevention of related\r\ncardiovascular diseases.  The models and numerical methods\r\ndeveloped are applicable to a wide range of problems with\r\nfluid-structure interactions and can be extended to include mass\r\ntransfer, structures of arteries and plaques, endothelial\r\nresponses, and arterial remodeling.\r\n     Stenosis, a constriction in blood vessels, is one of the\r\nleading causes of death in the western world.  The investigators\r\nand their colleagues couple experiments with computations to\r\nmodel blood flow in large stenotic arteries and investigate\r\ncritical flow and artery wall behaviors that may lead to artery\r\ncompression, plaque cap rupture, stroke and heart attack.  The\r\nproblem is difficult because of the high complexity of artery\r\nstructure and its nonlinear mechanical properties, strong blood\r\nand artery interactions, and critical flow conditions caused by\r\nsevere stenosis.  Dynamic properties of the stenotic arteries are\r\ndetermined experimentally using bovine carotid arteries and\r\nhydrogel tubes, whose properties are close to those of bovine\r\ncarotid arteries.  A series of 3-D nonlinear computational models\r\nwith fluid-wall interactions, based on the experimental\r\nmeasurements, are solved by a novel numerical method to quantify\r\nconditions under which artery compression and plaque cap rupture\r\nmay occur.  Validated by experimental data, these results can be\r\nhelpful for early detection, diagnosis and prevention of related\r\ncardiovascular diseases.  The models and numerical methods\r\ndeveloped are applicable to a wide range of problems with\r\nfluid-structure interactions and complex geometries.  The models\r\ncan be extended to include mass transfer, structures of arteries\r\nand plaques, grafts and stents, endothelial responses and\r\narterial remodeling.  As applications of biotechnology, the\r\nresults obtained can be used to improve the design of medical\r\ndevices such as grafts and stents.",
