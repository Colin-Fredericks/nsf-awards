 "awd_abstract_narration": "\t\t\t\t\t\t \r\nThis project is (a) providing students the technical background and information they need to choose the dual enrollment option to attend the community college and to receive college credit while still in high school, (b) enabling substantial numbers of high school students to take college courses beyond a prescribed introductory course, (c) preparing students to matriculate to one of the community college's Engineering Technology programs, (d) allowing selected students to enroll in Miami University's two plus two bachelor's degree program being offered by distance on the community college campus, and (e) graduating an estimated 50 students as skilled engineering technologists with associate degrees. The project includes enhancement of the curriculum at the high schools, through the development of new courses and the infusion of SMET content in grades 11-12 coursework. TEAM (Technology, Engineering and Manufacturing) academies are being organized in the high schools with the collaboration of the partners. Ultimately, the project is demonstrating a workable pipeline in which students flow through from the high school, through the community college, into four-year college, into technician careers or engineering careers. Partners include two inner city high schools (Columbus East High and Marion Franklin High) and Miami University. \r\n",
