 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photon counting histogram (PCH) is a recently introduced technique that exploits\r\nfluorescence fluctuations to distinguish molecules by their intrinsic fluorescence brightness. For\r\nexample, a homodimer A2 will appear twice as bright as its monomer A, if each protein A carries\r\none fluorescent label. The main focus of this proposal is the development of dual-color PCH.\r\nAdding a second detection channel and splitting the photons between both channels according to\r\ncolor will increase the sensitivity and capability of the PCH technique tremendously. Dual-color\r\nPCH combines the benefit of separating photons of different molecules by color with the intrinsic\r\nability of PCH to distinguish the brightness of molecules. To illustrate this point, consider two\r\nproteins A and B with differently colored labels. A mixture of their homodimers, heterodimers\r\nand monomers (A2, B2, AB, A and B) is resolvable by dual-color PCH. A single measurement\r\nwill determine the brightness of each component together with their concentrations. Currently,\r\nno other technique promises to deliver comparable performance. The second goal of this\r\nproposal is the application of dual-color PCH to study subunit interactions of an oligomeric\r\nenzyme. The association and dissociation of individual subunits is directly observed by dual-\r\ncolor PCH analysis and allows the determination of protein assembly paths under varying\r\nexternal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe existing theory of PCH for a single channel will be modified to describe dual-channel\r\ndetection. The algorithms and software programs to analyze the data will be developed and the\r\nperformance of the dual-channel detection system will be characterized on a two-photon\r\nmicroscope. The practical resolvability of a mixture by dual-color PCH is from an experimental\r\npoint of view of crucial importance. This project will address and answer this question by\r\nanalyzing the influence of the photon count statistics on dual-color PCH. Another important\r\nconsideration is the emission spectrum of a fluorophore. Most pairs of fluorophores have\r\noverlapping emission spectra and a perfect separation of the two fluorophores by color is not\r\npossible. Optical filter combinations that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of dual-color PCH\r\nfor dyes with overlapping emission spectra will be determined and tested. The experimental\r\ncharacterization of dual-color PCH will start with binary mixtures and will continue with\r\nmixtures of increasing complexity to determine the capability of dual-color PCH. In addition,\r\ndual-color PCH with excitation at multiple wavelengths will be implemented to further increase\r\nthe performance of PCH.\r\n\r\nThe subunit interactions of phosphofructokinase (PFK) will be studied by dual-color PCH.\r\nSpecifically, the subunit exchange between hybrid tetramers and the dissociation and association\r\nof the oligomeric protein will be examined. Individual subunits of PFK will carry specific\r\nfluorophores, which allow PCH to distinguish the subunit composition and population of each\r\nfraction by color and absolute brightness. It is important to stress that dual-color PCH will have\r\napplications well beyond the study of oligomeric enzymes. The impact of this new technique will\r\nbe felt in many other biological research fields. The association of proteins to form complexes is\r\na general concept encountered in most regulation processes of cells. Dual-color PCH can detect\r\nand identify protein association on the single molecule level. An important and pressing task of\r\nthe post-genomic era is the identification of the function of a large number of unknown proteins.\r\nDual-color PCH can assist in this task by mapping out their protein-protein interactions.",
