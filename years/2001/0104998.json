 "awd_abstract_narration": "Landscapes, both natural and human-altered, are a mosaic of habitat types. The success of an individual in finding high quality habitat within this mosaic will affect both its survival and the dynamics of whole populations. This investigation examines the interaction between individual behavior and population dynamics across a landscape by studying the eastern painted turtle. The researchers ask how pond quality, size, and location and the types of intervening habitat influence the movement of turtles between ponds. Measuring growth rates and reproductive output will assess the impact of movement on individuals.  The effects of these movements on population processes (birth, death, immigration, and emigration rates) for each pond and across the landscape will then be determined. \r\n\r\nOne of the consequences of current land use practices is an increase in the fragmentation of habitat. Habitat areas suitable for supporting wildlife are becoming smaller and more distant from each other. Information on how species react to and cope with small, isolated habitats embedded in unfavorable landscapes is needed in order to conduct proper management. This research is one of the most detailed examinations into individual behavior at the landscape level yet to be conducted. It will provide concrete evidence for the importance of integrating behavior and population dynamics. \r\n",
