Lerch of the American Physical Society and Dr. Cylon Goncalves da Silva, Director of the Brazilian Association for Synchrotron Light Technology (ABTLuS).  This workshop on the Use of Synchrotron Radiation for Research will be held at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) in Campinas, Brazil in February 2001 and includes a Symposium on Nanotechnology.  The scientific participants come from the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, as well as from countries outside the Western Hemisphere.  The workshop will be short, focused and research-oriented in specific areas of synchrotron research and nanotechnologies. Two or more specialized symposia are organized around atomic and molecular spectroscopy, surface physics and catalysis, soft matter and polymers, x-ray structural studies, and nanotechnologies.  The symposium will be used to train several postdoctoral students from the hemisphere and also bring in more users to the LNLS facility. \r\nWorkshops such as this nurture future international collaborations and help unify the global community.  They also expose young scientists to international science and expand their horizons.  This workshop will help increase the user base in Latin America for the seven major synchrotron facilities in the U.S.\r\n\r\n",
