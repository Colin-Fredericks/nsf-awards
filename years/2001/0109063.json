 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past 20 years have seen the discovery of strongly correlated electron phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, exotic non-Fermi liquid metals, intrinsically inhomogeneous electronic and magnetic phases, and novel moment configurations in a broad array of seemingly distinct material families. This award provides support for the International Conference on Strongly Correlated Electron Systems (SCES 2001), to be held August 6-10,2001 in Ann Arbor, MI. The conference will explore the most recent experimental and theoretical developments, in addition there will be overview talks assessing the current status of the field. The topics for the conference include: heavy fermions, Kondo physics, and mixed valence, the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism, non-Fermi liquid phenomena and quantum criticality, correlations in low dimensional metals, novel f- and d- electron materials, and low carrier density systems.  Additionally, the conference includes emerging topics such as time resolved spectroscopies of correlated materials, hidden and orbital ordering, and spin-charge separation.  The NSF support will help ensure the continued vitality of this field by providing financial assistance to graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty who are attending the conference for the first time. In addition, it will foster new collaborations among established researchers from India and Eastern Europe with other conference participants by providing travel support. \r\n%%%\r\nStrong electron correlations are the origin of such technologically important phenomena as superconductivity and magnetism, and can even render a material to be electrically insulating when it would otherwise be a metal. By its nature, the strongly correlated electron problem is a central intellectual theme that cuts across traditional physics, chemistry, and materials science boundaries. The pre-eminent international conference in this area is Strongly Correlated Electron Systems (SCES), and for the first time in almost 10 years it will convene in the United States in Ann Arbor, MI  from August 6-10, 2001.  It is the aim of this conference to identify and explore common issues of both experimental and theoretical importance in a variety of different classes of correlated electron materials. This award provides support to the conference to help ensure the continued vitality of this core research field in the United States by supporting the participation of young scientists - graduate students, postdocs, and new faculty. In addition, the conference will foster new collaborations between established US scientists and their counterparts in India and Eastern Europe through a satellite workshop. This award will also supplement the travel funds of these participants. \r\n***\r\n",
