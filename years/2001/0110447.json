 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop advanced magnetorheological fluids for various damping applications.  The Phase I project focused on a microwave plasma synthesis technique (NANOGENTM) and chemical precipitation technique; both techniques were successfully used to synthesize nanoparticles of iron, cobalt and iron oxide.  NANOGENTM was selected as one of the 100 most innovative technologies in 1998 when it won the prestigious R&D 100 Award.  MR fluids were prepared from these fluids and preliminary results on their damping behavior was found to be comparable with commercially available fluids.  The Phase II project will scale-up the production of nanopowders and will conduct testing of their damping characteristics to help foster the development and application of MR fluids in key technology driven areas.\r\n\r\nThe possible commercial applications will be in automobile suspensions, hybrid actuator valves, semi-active vibration control in turbines and bridges as well as for seismic damping. \r\n",
