 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds a one-year renewal for support of the US Committees for the bioscience unions that are part of the  International Council for Science (ICSU) and  administered through the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).\r\n\r\nThe U.S. biology community is represented by NAS in five international scientific unions:  the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS),  the International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS), the International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB), the International Union of Microbiological Sciences (IUMS),  and the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB).  There are two overarching issues to which the five committees of U.S. scientists who represent U.S. interests in these international organizations have assigned high priority.  The first is the need for new, inclusive, multidisciplinary, and integrative approaches to biological questions.  The second is the need to build human and research capacity in developing countries.  This award will permit the NAS to continue to manage U.S. participation and assert U.S. leadership in these bioscience unions.  Further it provides dues have to the five international organizations and funds to support the activities of the five corresponding U.S. National Committees.  This award will also fund a new US National Committee for DIVERSITAS, an international cooperative research program on biological diversity under the sponsorship of the IUBS.  \r\n",
