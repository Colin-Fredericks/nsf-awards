 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prop : AST-0097616\r\nInst: Florida Institute of Technology\r\nPI : Matthew Wood\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA) provides a collaborative effort involving 6 southeastern United States universities for a NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program.  The consortium includes Florida Institute of Technology (FIT), East Tennessee State University (ETSU), Florida International University (FIU), the University of Georgia at Athens (UGA), Valdosta State University (VSU), and Clemson University.  The program emphasizes the preparation of students for careers in science and engineering through one-on-one collaboration with faculty who are experienced undergraduate student research mentors.  Over a dozen research projects are offered ranging from space weather, to spectroscopic studies of minor planets, to the determination of the Galactic disk age from white dwarf stars, to target of opportunity observations of active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst optical counterparts.  At least 12 REU students annually will use the SARA Observatory in Arizona during the course of their 8-10 week summer research activities.  In addition, multi-day workshops will expose each of them to astronomy as practiced at 2-3 SARA institutions during their summer internships.  Continuing collaboration and the presentation of papers at national meetings after the summer program is also supported. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
