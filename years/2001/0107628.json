 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleague study computational\r\naspects of various geometric problems in two directions: (1)\r\nDesign and implementation of efficient algorithms for the\r\napproximation of various convex and nonconvex objects in\r\nmultidimensional space by polytopes, and research of the\r\ncomputational complexity as well as practical efficiency of these\r\nalgorithms. (2) Application of high performance computing as a\r\ntool to solve or advance toward a solution of open theoretical\r\nproblems in convex geometry, among them, Kneser's problem\r\nconcerning the relationship between volumes of intersections or\r\nunions of balls in multidimensional Euclidean space and their\r\nmutual distances.  Because of its practical importance in many\r\napplication areas, the approximation of both convex and nonconvex\r\npolytopes by \"simpler\" polytopes is given special attention, and\r\nfully constructive solutions are developed for these cases.\r\nExtensions and variants such as approximation under various\r\nmetrics, requiring the approximating object to enclose or be\r\ncontained within the approximated object, and finding minimal\r\nenclosing polytopes of a specific type (like parallelotopes, for\r\nexample), are also considered.  Some of these variants find\r\nimportant applications in mobile computing and multidimensional\r\ndatabases.\r\n     The investigators develop efficient computational solutions\r\nfor the problem of approximating multidimensional bodies by\r\npolytopes (solids formed by flat faces) of a prescribed size.\r\nSuch approximation is an important tool in many disciplines,\r\nincluding molecular modeling, optimal control, computer-aided\r\ndesign, and computer visualization.  They also investigate the\r\nproblem of enclosing and approximating multidimensional bodies by\r\npolytopes of a prescribed type, such as \"boxes\" (parallelotopes),\r\nfor example.  Solutions to these problems find important\r\napplications in the rapidly growing areas of mobile computing and\r\nmultidimensional databases.  Furthermore, due to their simplicity,\r\npolytopes are by far the most widely used form of model\r\nrepresentation.  Thus, the work is also important because it\r\nfacilitates the use of the large body of methods already\r\navailable for polytopes, provided that the resulting\r\napproximation is good and can be performed efficiently.\r\nDevelopment of these algorithms produces tools of high\r\nperformance computing.  The investigators use these tools in turn\r\nto study long-standing geometric problems.",
