The American Astronomical Society (AAS) administers the awards on the behalf of all participating institutions: the National Science Foundation, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP), the International Amateur-Professional Photoelectric Photometry (IAPPP), and the American Astronomical Society.   The Priscilla and Bart Bok Awards, awarded jointly by the AAS and the ASP, and the Richard D. Lines Special Award in Astronomy, sponsored by the IAPPP, are used by students to further their education and research efforts.  Each student's school also receives a modest amount that can be used by their science departments to enhance their science programs. \r\n\r\nThe annual ISEF is the culmination of a series of local, county, regional, state and national science fairs conducted in over 40 countries and involves several million students annually.  Originally sponsored by the Westinghouse Corp, which also sponsored the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, these two competitions are now jointly sponsored by the Intel Corporation. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
