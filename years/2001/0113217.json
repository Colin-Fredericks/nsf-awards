 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of designing or upgrading a large-scale broadband\r\ncommunication infrastructure involves solving several optimization problems, including\r\nthe problems of optimum topology design, server placement, distribution\r\nand replication of data between the servers, and fair division of\r\nlimited network resources (e.g. bandwidth, CPU cycles, etc.) among the users. As\r\nnetworks become larger and more complicated, it becomes imperative to\r\nuse mathematically sound, scalable methods for solving the above problems.\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop and implement such methods.\r\n\r\nOne of the main thrusts of the project is development of new approaches\r\nfor network design and sizing. In particular, the project focuses on\r\ndevelopment of optimization techniques where the goal is to construct a low cost\r\ntopology, choose optimum locations (and sizes) for servers (e.g. web\r\ncaches, application servers, wireless hubs, etc.), and decide how to\r\nreplicated the data.  A related problem is network\r\nexpansion/augmentation, where the goal is to decide (online) where to\r\nplace new equipment and to choose which new links to lease in order to\r\nsatisfy the increased demand. Due to economies of scale, topology design\r\nand augmentation problems have concave costs structure and hence can not\r\nbe solved by classical flow-based approaches. The investigators work on\r\ndeveloping principled approaches for solving the above problems and on\r\ndesigning and implementing a set of tools that can be used in the\r\nplanning and network management process.",
