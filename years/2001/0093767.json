The specific problems are the steady and pulsatile converging flows containing solid or      deformable particulate suspensions. These flows are important in biological fluid mechanics and in applications of micro-fabrication.  The PI is well qualified for this work and has most of the required equipment in his laboratory.  The issues that are to be addressed by the proposed research can serve as the foundation for the PI's professional development.  In addition, The PI has proposed an excellent educational plan including an introductory engineering course with weekly lectures and experiments taught by faculty and graduate students of various discipline and people from industry, the use of internet-based remote-control fluid mechanics laboratories, and high school outreach programs.\r\n",
