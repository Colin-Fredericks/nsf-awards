On the\r\ntopological side, the areas of study include Heegaard splittings,\r\nunknotting tunnels and related topics; the geometric side deals\r\nwith issues related to orbifolds, the construction and melding of\r\nsurface subgroups, developing an understanding of higher\r\ndimensional hyperbolic manifolds, as well as some interactions\r\nwith other areas, for example algebraic number theory.\r\n\r\nManifolds play a central role in physics, mathematics and to some\r\nextent in other sciences, since they are objects which on small\r\nscales look like Euclidean space of dimension n.  For example,\r\nthe space that we live in is a three manifold and space-time is a\r\nfour manifold.  For this and other reasons, these dimensions have\r\nattracted a good deal of attention in mathematics and physics.\r\nOne basic unsolved problem is exactly which manifold is the\r\ncorrect model for the universe - there has been some speculation\r\nthat it falls into the class of so-called hyperbolic manifolds, a\r\ncertain class of three dimensional spaces which in some sense\r\nappear to be generic.  Cosmological theories about the origins of\r\nthe universe put constraints on the shape of space-time and hence\r\nconstraints on which manifolds could occur.  One of the goals of\r\nthis project is refine current methods (which have already ruled\r\nout many possibilities) to narrow the search down further.  There\r\nare also other applications of geometric ideas which are less\r\nobvious but still, in fact, directly important.  It is no\r\nexaggeration to say that almost any problem which can be\r\nformulated qualitatively can be studied with geometric methods\r\nand as a result the powerful tools developed over the last thirty\r\nyears in low-dimensional topology can be brought to bear upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
