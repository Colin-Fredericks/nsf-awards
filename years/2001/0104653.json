 "awd_abstract_narration": "As it developed its guide on Enhancing the Postdoctoral Experience of Scientists and Engineers, the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP)--a joint committee of the National Academy of Science, National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine--found that action was needed by postdocs, postdoc advisers, administrators, funding organizations, and disciplinary societies and developed a set of recommendations for each.  It also found tht more dialogue was needed amongst all these parties in order to enhance the postdoctoral experience.  Therefore, COSEPUP decided to host a Convocation on Enhancing the Postdoctoral Experience of Scientists and Engineers to bring all these parties together to facilitate dialogue, highlight best practices, and encourage action on the part of all.  This convocation will take place on March 2, 2001.  The National Academies are requesting $25,000 to provide travel support for postocs to attend the Convoation.",
