 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Allegheny College will acquire a 300 MHz Fourier-Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) development of new methods for the synthesis of sulfones; b) synthesis of natural products; c) study of active centers in metalloproteins; d) development of models to predict the stability of RNA structure from sequence; e) development of novel complexes to catalyze oxidation reactions of biological, chemical and environmental relevance.  This instrument will be used for undergraduates in their research and also within the curriculum.   \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including environmental chemistryand biochemistry.\r\n\r\n",
