 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The primary goal of the project is the improvement of learning for all students who take undergraduate physics. To help achieve this goal, the Physics Education Group will produce a suite of mutually reinforcing instructional materials for: (1) introductory physics courses for science and engineering majors (calculus-based and algebra-based), (2) lower and upper division courses for physics majors, (3) physics courses for future K-12 teachers, (4) physics courses for non-science majors, and (5) courses for students underprepared in science and mathematics who aspire to science-related careers (especially those from underrepresented minority groups).\r\n\r\nThe project consists of three interdependent components: (a) development and assessment of curriculum, (b) research on the learning and teaching of physics, and (c) faculty development. The first component consists of the development of two interrelated types of instructional materials: \"Tutorials in Undergraduate Physics\" and \"Physics by Inquiry.\" Both draw upon and expand on previous curriculum developed by the group that have been shown to be effective with different student populations in a variety of instructional settings. \r\n\r\nThe project responds to the need for additional tutorials for undergraduate instruction in physics and modules for the preparation of K-12 teachers. The primary materials in the tutorial part of the project are: versions of \"Tutorials in Introductory Physics\" suitable for the algebra-based, calculus-based and honors physics courses; \"Tutorials on Problem-solving in Introductory Physics;\" and \"Tutorials beyond Introductory Physics.\" The primary materials in the part of the project that pertains to the preparation of K-12 teachers are based on topics in the National Science Education Standards that are not included in the published version of \"Physics by Inquiry.\" The new modules include topics in classical physics and physical science, revisions of existing modules, and new modules on topics in modern physics. Secondary instructional materials are being developed concurrently that increase the adaptability of the primary materials to different student populations and instructional settings.\r\n\r\nOngoing assessment of student learning will characterize every stage of the curriculum development process. Results from research will not only inform the development of curriculum in this project but will also contribute to a research base that serves as a national and international resource. Commercial publication will ensure that the curriculum produced will be nationally distributed. Systematic faculty development will enhance dissemination of the materials and provide assistance to instructors in adopting the materials.\r\n\r\n",
