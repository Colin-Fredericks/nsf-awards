 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) \r\r\nThe Colleges of Ceramics and Liberal Arts and Sciences at Alfred University and Alfred State College of Technology are extending their interactions through a multi-institutional and multi- disciplinary collaboration. An extended materials characterization laboratory is the support mechanism for the collaboration. The project is adapted from the \"Extended Physical Chemistry Laboratory\" project that has been established between the University of South Carolina at Spartansburg, Wofford College, and Converse College (NSF DUE 9950296, NSF DUE 9452453 and NSF DUE 9751605). The goal of the project is to promote interaction between materials science, chemistry, geology, and environmental science for students and faculty through shared laboratory modules specifically designed to fit into each curriculum. Students with different educational backgrounds are working in problem solving situations in a team setting. The project challenges students to be organized in their interpretation and communication of data. The newly developed laboratory modules are based on experiments utilizing a remote sensing fiber optic module for Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, a simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA), and a gel permeation chromatography unit. Cross-disciplinary experiments are being developed based on examples of other NSF funded programs such as the Incorporation of Environmental Sciences with Chemistry (NSF DUE 9551773 and NSF DUE 9950832), which are being extended to include materials science. Materials science students are being combined with chemistry students in one classroom, similar to the program at Oberlin College, which set up a program to introduce materials thermal analysis into their chemistry laboratories (NSF DUE 9980925).",
