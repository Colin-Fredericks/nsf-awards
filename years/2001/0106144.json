 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hart\r\n0106144\r\n\r\nThis project is an integrated field, geochronologic, geochemical, and petrologic investigation of circa 17 to13 Ma volcanism associated with the initial late Cenozoic manifestations of the Yellowstone-Newberry hotspot system and with lithospheric extension in the Nevada - Oregon border region. The area under investigation, the Santa Rosa-Calico volcanic field, lies within the northwestern projection of a major late Miocene continental rift regime and is located between two other Oregon Plateau volcanic fields that typically are identified with the emergence of the Yellowstone-Newberry hotspot system.  The field and analytical strategy is designed to provide a comprehensive view of the Santa Rosa-Calico volcanic field. Techniques to be employed include GPS/GIS assisted field mapping; air photo and satellite remote sensing interpretations; petrographic, chemical and isotopic characterization of eruptive products and petrogenetic processes; and absolute eruptive history assessment via Ar-Ar age determinations.  Using the Santa Rosa-Calico volcanic field as a case study this research will test and provide new constraints on hypotheses for [1] the origin of intermediate magmas in extensional settings, [2] the role of basaltic magmatism in the formation and evolution of evolved magmas, [3] the role of crustal melting and open system differentiation processes in the evolution of compositionally diverse magmatic suites, and [4] the role that pre- and syn-magmatic extension plays in controlling the location, eruptive style(s), and compositional diversity of multi-vent volcanic fields.\r\n",
