 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops efficient cryptographic tools which offer provable security guarantees. Such tools rectify the widely-recognized deficiency associated with extant provably-secure cryptosystems: their prohibitive computing demands.  Indeed, despite the highly amplified security offered by provably-secure systems, efficiency considerations have prevented their widespread adoption; as a result, tools in common use typically involve ad-hoc methods designed with speed, rather than security, as their first priority.  This re-search resolves this difficulty, constructing cryptographic tools (like encryption engines, digital signature schemes, and pseudo-random generators) which can simultaneously boast provable security guarantees and competitive efficiency. This program is undertaken in concert with an educational initiative which develops security and general information technology course material at the University of Connecticut.  Security in provably-secure constructions is generally accumulated by repeated application of some underlying cryptographic primitive (a one-way function, for example). For a fixed underlying primitive, the computing time required to \"generate enough security\" to, say, encrypt a long message, depends essentially\r\non (i.) the quantity of security which can be quickly extracted from a single application of the underlying primitive, and (ii.) the total quantity of security necessary for the encryption process.  This research ad-dresses both of these issues, developing provably-secure frameworks for cryptography which fully exploit the security capacity of underlying primitives and utilize this distilled security in the most effective manner.\r\nIssue (i.) is addressed by the development of quantitative bounds for the security capacity of one-way functions and bounds on the computational complexity of extracting security from general one-way functions.  Issue (ii.) is addressed by the development of a new family of cryptographic primitives, balancing provable security and competitive efficiency. For encryption, a focal point of the research, this is attained by coupling strong (information-theoretic) pseudo-random constructions with semantically secure encryption machinery. Such methods have direct applicability to encryption, cryptographically strong hashing, and pseudo\r\n",
