 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)\r\nWhile qualitative field-based observation remains fundamental to the science of Geology, a more complete understanding of the earth system and its processes, as well as related environmental problems, requires a multi-disciplinary approach including the collection, interpretation, and application of quantitative geochemical data. Students in Geology and Environmental Studies are able to undertake major and trace element analyses of, and explore compositional relationships in, solid rock, mineral, sediment and soil samples by using an automated Wavelength Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer with element mapping and spot analysis capabilities, along with associated sample preparation equipment. Adapting exemplary models from Albion College, Dickinson College, Furman University, and Middle Tennessee State University, and from the literature, we are incorporating inquiry-based exercises using these analytical techniques into courses in Physical Geology, Mineralogy, Petrology, Environmental Geology, Geochemistry, and Chemical Analysis of the Environment. In so doing, we are (1) increasing the involvement of our students in the process of modern scientific investigation, with progressive preparation for independent and student-faculty cooperative research through Independent/Directed Study and the Environmental Studies Senior Seminar; and (2) enhancing student understanding of fundamental relationships between chemical composition, mineralogy, rock-type, tectonic setting, and global biogeochemical cycling. An important component of our project is site visits by a team of experienced external evaluators, providing information exchange and assistance in formative and summative evaluation. \r\n",
