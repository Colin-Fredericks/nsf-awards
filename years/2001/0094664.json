The inhabitants of Chevak are connected to three archaeological village sites that have been sequentially occupied by many of the present members and direct ancestors of Chevak residents. Preliminary archaelological and oral historic data have indicated changes between the sites in general settlement pattern and location, specifically the loss of the men's house and intra-site tunnels, and changes in storage facility size and distribution. It is hypothesized that the shifting patterns reflect socail and economic transitions as a result of European contact. This dissertation research will use both archaeological and ethnographic methods to document and explain settlement pattern variation at the three village sites.",
