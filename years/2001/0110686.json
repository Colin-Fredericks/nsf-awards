 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular compounds in the brain called neuropeptides often regulate physiological functions, acting similarly to hormones.  A new member of the family of neuropeptides known as galanins recently has been isolated in mammals and called galanin-like peptide (GALP).  Preliminary evidence suggests that GALP plays a role in the neuroendocrine regulation of pituitary functions, but little is yet known about the functions of this compound. This project uses neuroanatomical, physiological and molecular biological techniques to reveal the anatomical circuitry of the cells containing GALP, to discover how and where the expression of GALP occurs, and to develop a mutant mouse model with a targeted deletion of the GALP gene to reveal physiological functions.  Results of these studies should provide a novel understanding of possible roles for this molecule in physiological processes such as regulation of metabolism, body weight, reproduction, lactation and growth.\r\n   This exploratory project has both high risk and high potential impact.  It remains unknown what the specific discoveries will be, but novel data are likely to have major importance, extending beyond neuroendocrinology to regulatory physiology and developmental biology.  Graduate and postdoctoral training will also be done in a laboratory with a long record of excellence.\r\n",
