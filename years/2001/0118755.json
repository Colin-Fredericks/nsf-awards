 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to solicit support for exchanging experience in civil infrastructures for a group of prospective participants from the United States at the International Conference and Exhibition on \"Extending the Life of Bridges, Civil and Building Structures,\" London, United Kingdom, July 4-6, 2001. The focus of the conference is on bridge investigation and repair, concrete and composites, and buildings and civil structures All these topics are important issues pertaining to the performance and safety of civil infrastructure systems in the United States. It is expected that the conference will help identify potential cooperative research topics between the participants from the United States and the United Kingdom on advancing both the state-of-the-art and  the state-of-the-practice in performance evaluation, safety assessment and life-cycle management of civil infrastructure systems. Research is needed in these fields to enhance our understanding of the performance of civil infrastructure systems, to improve current methods for design and safety assessment of new and existing structural systems, and to permit an optimal management of the civil infrastructure systems in the United States.",
