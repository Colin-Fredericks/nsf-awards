 "awd_abstract_narration": "gThe collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris) lives on rocky outcrops in the Ozarks called glades.  Suppression of forest fires has destroyed many glades and has transformed the surrounding forest from an open woodlands into a forest with a dense understory.  By 1980 no populations of collared lizards existed within or nearby the Stegall Mountain Natural Area.  Between 1984 and 1989, we translocated three populations of collared lizards onto restored glades in this natural area.  All three flourished, but we observed no animal dispersing between glades and no colonization of new glades up to 1993.  In 1994 the Missouri Department of Conservation began prescribed burns in this area.   Under fire management, genetic interchanges began to occur between glades, 44 glades were colonized, and the population size increased over10-fold.  We propose to (1) continue to document the lizards' range expansion and characterize its genetic consequences, (2) quantify the amount of extinction and recolonization on glades under fire management, (3) measure the amount of genetic interchange among glade populations, and (4) monitor the genetic health of the populations. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe rarely have the opportunity to observe drastic alterations in a species' population structure.  Here we can. Conservation biology places great importance upon interchange among local populations, and here we can directly test whether or not landscape-level management affects such interchanges.  Another basic tool of conservation biology is effective population size, which can be used to monitor the rate of loss of genetic diversity and the rate of accumulation of potentially deleterious inbreeding.  Because we know the initial state (the original three translocated populations), we can estimate effective sizes with unprecedented accuracy and compare our estimates to those based on the commonly used approximations.  Such a comparison is long over due given the importance of effective size in conservation, and we are in a unique position to do it.\r\n",
