 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is designed to advance the recent progress on nonlinear\r\nHamiltonian PDE towards three goals:\r\n1. Extend the local-in-time initial value methods to solve more complicated \r\nPDE.\r\n2. Adapt the initial value techniques to treat initial-boundary value \r\nproblems. \r\n3. Construct a global-in-time theory of nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE.\r\nThe proposal identifies specific problems whose solutions contribute \r\nto the three goals for which there are \r\nmethods of attack emerging from the last decades' spectacular progress.\r\nThe studies for Goal 1 aim to extend the sharp 1-dimensional calculus \r\ntechniques for proving multilinear estimates in Bourgain's Xs,b spaces \r\nby carrying out an incremental research plan, involving\r\nsmall Xs,b denominators, spatial anisotropy and vanishing parameters.\r\nA technique for recasting initial-boundary value problems as initial\r\nvalue problems with boundary forcing has recently been developed, in\r\ncollaboration with Kenig. The range of applicability of this method is\r\nthe main topic of the proposed investigations toward Goal 2. A \r\nreinterpretation of the L^2 conservation law for the KdV equation, obtained \r\nin collaboration with Keel, Staffilani, Takaoka and Tao, has led to a new \r\nmethod for showing global wellposedness by constructing almost conserved \r\nquantities using multilinear harmonic analysis and the local wellposedness \r\nmachinery. The third thrust of the proposed research will exploit these \r\nquantities to understand the long-time behavior of nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE.\r\n\r\nNo specific scientific or engineering application motivates the proposed \r\nstudies; rather the intention is to contribute toward a general rigorous \r\ntheory of nonlinear phenomena including turbulence, singularity formation, \r\nscattering and recurrence. The widespread applicability of Hamiltonian PDE, \r\nacross diverse fields of current scientific and technological significance,  \r\ndemonstrates the central prominence of the proposed research to our \r\nscience and engineering infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is designed to advance the recent progress on nonlinear\r\nHamiltonian PDE towards three goals:\r\n1.
