 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell walls are carbohydrate and protein structures that surround and separate plant cells.\r\nAs plant cells expand in a regulated fashion they must necessarily modify and enlarge\r\ntheir cell walls to permit the subsequent increase in volume. The cell wall itself might\r\ninfluence this expansion process. Thus the cell has the potential to influence almost every\r\naspect of plant function simply because of its position and physical properties. For this\r\nreason many have speculated on its role in a plant's development and response to the\r\noutside world. Cell growth can occur in many dimensions, such as the polarized\r\nexpansion of a pollen tube tip, the creation of elongated cells characteristic of many\r\nvegetative tissues, the establishment of a meristem, or even the jigsaw-like arrangement\r\nof cells at the leaf surface. Currently the understanding of how cell wall architecture is\r\ncoordinated with programmed and hormone regulated cell expansion events during\r\ndevelopment is not well understood in angiosperms.\r\nRecent studies have identified a number of proteins at the cell surface that could\r\ndirectly regulate cell wall functions, and the Cell Wall Associated Kinases, or WAKs, are\r\namong these. There are five cell wall associated kinases in Arabidopsis and\r\nrepresentatives in other angiosperm families. WAKs each have a cytoplasmic\r\nserine/threonine protein kinase domain, span the plasma membrane and extend a domain\r\ninto the cell wall. WAKs physically link the plasma membrane to the carbohydrate matrix\r\nand are unique in that they have the potential to directly signal cellular events through\r\ntheir kinase domain.\r\nThe WAK extracellular domain is variable between the five isoforms, and collectively\r\nthe family is expressed in all organs. WAK1 and WAK2 are the most ubiquitously and\r\nabundantly expressed of the five tandemly arrayed genes, and their messages are present\r\nin vegetative meristems, junctions of organ types, and areas of cell expansion. They are\r\nalso induced by pathogen infection and wounding. The WAK1 but not WAK2 cell wall\r\ndomain binds to a glycine rich protein (GRP) of the cell wall in in vitro assays. WAK1\r\nand GRP can be co-immunoprecipitated from leaf or seedling extracts, and this WAK is\r\nphosphorylated. Recent experiments demonstrate that antisense WAK expression leads\r\nto the loss of cell expansion, and preliminary results indicate that antisense GRP\r\nproduction causes an enhancement of cell expansion (and eventual cell death). Thus GRP\r\nmay be a negative regulator of WAK activity. A large amount of WAK is also covalently\r\nlinked to pectin, and most of WAK that is bound to pectin is also phosphorylated. The\r\ndata support a model where WAK1 is bound to GRP as a phosphorylated kinase, and also\r\nbinds to pectin. How WAKs are involved in signaling from the pectin extracellular matrix\r\nin coordination with GRPs will be key to the understanding of the cell wall's role in cell\r\ngrowth.\r\nWAKs are poised to provide a direct signal from the cell wall to the cytoplasm of many\r\ncell types during the development of Arabidopsis. In order to characterize the\r\nassociations and roles of GRPs and WAKs in plants it will be necessary to generate\r\nadditional (partial) loss of function alleles of the two predominant WAKs and of GRP.\r\nThese alleles can then be used to determine the relationship of WAK mediated cell\r\nexpansion to other known signaling pathways. WAK kinase substrates will be also\r\nidentified and used to assay the activation of WAK by wall components and\r\ndevelopmental cues, and eventually mutant alleles of these substrates will help in the\r\nanalysis of WAKs and cell elongation. The goal is to understand how WAKs in\r\nassociation with GRP and pectins regulate cytoplasmic components so that the cell wall\r\nis coordinated with processes of cell growth.\r\n",
