 "awd_abstract_narration": "Toxic contaminants continue to persist in the environment, threatening the health of humans and ecosystems. For example, the United States has a stock pile of 30,600 tons of chemical warfare agents (NRC, 1996). These chemical agents are extremely hazardous and the Army is under law to dispose of the stockpile by 2007. However, the baseline technology, incineration, faces considerable organized opposition due to air pollution concerns forcing the Army to look at alternative technologies.  Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) show considerable promise as a potential solution to these problems because, similar to incineration, pollutants are destroyed eliminating future risk, yet no air pollution is formed. However, development of AOPs that are less costly and more effective for the degradation of pollutants at relatively high aqueous concentrations is needed.  \r\n\r\nIn this project, photoactivated periodate will be explored generally as a potential AOP and particularly for the destruction of chemical warfare agents. This study will investigate the kinetics and mechanism of destruction of a range of pollutants with differing expected reactivities with radicals formed by photoactivated periodate. Detailed studies of the organic decomposition products and inorganic iodine stable and transient intermediates formed will be used to gain insight into the pathways of degradation. \r\n\r\nFor the education component of this proposal, the PI plans to stimulate learning by emphasizing the bridges between research and teaching and incorporating real world case studies into courses.  Mentoring school aged and pre-freshman female students is another important component to be cultivated by involvement in summer workshops at OSU. The Women In Engineering Summer Workshop brings 50 pre-freshmen women to campus in the summer to orient them to engineering principles and the different disciplines of engineering. Hosted for a day of environmental engineering, they are guided in an experiment to determine nitrate and phosphate removal by wetlands. With funds from this proposal, the PI will develop a similar week-long workshop for eighth-grade girls. Undergraduate students and faculty will be recruited to participate in guiding girls while they explore various facets of engineering. Both mentoring activities are expected to increase enrollment and retention of women in engineering.\r\n",
