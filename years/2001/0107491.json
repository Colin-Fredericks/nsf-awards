 "awd_abstract_narration": "In diverse world regions such as the Americas, Europe and South \r\nAsia, free-market policies have forced small-scale farmers to transform \r\ntheir productive strategies or face economic ruin.  Peasant and \r\nsmall-farmer organizations that once were oriented almost exclusively \r\ntoward national-level efforts to obtain local-level benefits are now \r\nincreasingly seeking allies across national borders, attempting to affect \r\nglobal forces which impact their rural livelihoods.  In some cases this has \r\nresulted in violent actions such as the French peasants' destruction of a \r\nMcDonalds restaurant in a protest against \"fast food\"; and Indian farmers \r\nburning a field of genetically modified cotton as a protest against \r\nagribusiness. This anthropological project studies a new international \r\npeasant and small farmer organization called Via Campesina, or Peasant \r\nRoad, which was founded in 1993 and has affiliates in about sixty \r\ncountries.  The project will interview small farmer activists and donor NGO \r\npersonnel in five sites: Brussels, the headquarters of the European peasant \r\nconfederation; Saskatoon, Canada, where the network's Technical Secretariat \r\nis based; Tegucigalpa, Honduras, headquarters of the network's \r\nOrganizational Secretariat; Managua, Nicaragua, the base of a Central \r\nAmerican small farmers' network that helped found the Peasant Road; and \r\nBangalore, India, home of one of the most active of the network's \r\nconstituent organizations. In each site the interviews and analysis of \r\ndocumentary materials will focus on the political formation of activist individuals, the histories of \r\norganizational consolidation, and the mobilization of resources and \r\nalliances. The project will examine what movements defending economically \r\nmarginal constituencies gain and lose by forming part of global civil \r\nsociety, as well as how new varieties of transnational politics have shaped \r\npeasant and small farmer identities, both within the agriculturist \r\norganizations and in relation to their NGO backers and antagonists. The new \r\nknowledge generated by this proposal will advance our understanding of how \r\ncomparable grass-roots and global organizations function.\r\n",
