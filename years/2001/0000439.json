This work must be approached experimentally rather than theoretically due to the difficulty in designing and implementing analytical models which are complex enough to inform the design of real world systems. The design of hardware and software elements concurrently should lead to greater integration and higher performance by several orders of magnitude than the design of either element separately.\r\n",
