 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texas Southern University (TSU) proposes a Science and Technology Enhancement \r\nProgram (STEP) One-Year Planning Grant to the NSF Historically Black College and \r\nUniversity Undergraduate Program (HBCU UP). The objective is to increase the \r\nrecruitment, retention and graduation rates of students in undergraduate programs\r\n in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) areas through quality\r\n enhancements of teaching and student learning at the University. The TSU STEP\r\n will achieve this overall objective through four (4) programmatic thrusts: \r\nStudent recruitment and retention for academic success, Faculty development \r\nin teaching and scholarly achievements, Curricular reforms through use of \r\ntechnology, and Assessment and evaluation for sustainability beyond NSF funding.\r\n These programmatic thrusts will have measurable goals and timelines to achieve\r\n the overall objectives of the TSU STEP. \r\n\r\nDuring this one-year planning period the TSU STEP will develop a comprehensive\r\n recruitment and retention plan for science and technology. Industry will become an\r\n integral part of the S&T programs trough establishing a Corporate and Professional\r\n Advisory Committee for the College of Science and Technology and a discipline\r\n specific one for each department. Comprehensive plans to assist faculty teaching \r\nwith technology and enhancing their research capacity will be developed. Each\r\n undergraduate academic program will recommend improvements in their curriculum\r\n to enhance the quality of the education. An assessment and evaluation plan will be\r\n developed such that the TSU STEP will be sustainable after NSF funding has expired. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
