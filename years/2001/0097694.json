 "awd_abstract_narration": "The features of the Maria Mitchell Observatory (MMO) REU site are the student participation in guided research in astronomy and astrophysics (star formation, circumstellar disks, turbulence, comets, variable stars) along with intense involvement in public outreach in astronomy and features students immersion under dedicated professional supervison in research from project selection through the preparation of talks and publications.  On-campus living arrangements ensure collegial team building and research experience.  The MMO possesses a unique photographic archive and an 8-inch telescope with CCD detector for routine observations.  It also has guaranteed time on the 31-inch NURO telescope at Flagstaff, Arizona.  during the past several years, observing time for student research projects has also been obtained on large national astronomical facilities.  Each REU student participates in these projects.  During the last four years, every student has presented a paper at an American Astronomical Society meeting or at other national and international meetings.  Every student co-authors a paper in a respected peer-reviewed journal",
