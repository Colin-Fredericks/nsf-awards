 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statement of Objectives. The Fort Berthold Community College Technology and\r\nInstruction Enhancement Project is proposed to increase the numbers and persistence of\r\nAmerican Indian SMET majors and potential majors\r\n\r\n- The technology infrastructure of the college will be strengthened by expanded band width\r\n and high tech access for students, faculty and staff.\r\n- The SMET curriculum will integrate constructivist methods and technology applications\r\n to improve SMET student learning outcomes and persistence rates.\r\n- The college faculty and staff will build teaching and learning capacities through\r\n constructivist methodologies and techniques and technology applications.\r\n- American Indian SMET students persistence will be increased by 10% per year through a\r\n student retention model called Family Based Education.\r\n- SMET students will have expanded internships and community service placements,\r\n workforce placement and transfer opportunities through formal community outreach\r\n relationships.\r\n\r\n Methods to be Employed. The Technology and Instruction Enhancement Project of \r\nFort Berthold Community College will focus on the recruitment and retention of American \r\nIndian Students toward graduation and transfer or workforce placement. First, the\r\ntechnology infrastructure will be expanded by improving the band width to speed up and \r\nbroaden technology capacities. The student access to high tech equipment and applications\r\nwill include the additionof high tech laboratories for student learning Web-conferencing \r\ncapacities will be installed in theMentor Sites in three remote satellite campus locations. \r\nSecond, constructivist teaching/learning methods and techniques that heightened student\r\nexperiential learning and active discovery based activity; and increased technology \r\napplications will be integrated across the curriculum. The computer science networking \r\nprogram will deliver professional certificationsand two full time faculty members will \r\nmake this a technology centerpiece in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n Third, the curriculum and college services will be vastly improved through faculty and \r\nstaff development opportunities in constructivist teaching/learning methods and technology \r\napplications. Faculty development opportunities will include individual professional \r\nconferences and mini-grants for research projects that involve SMET student interns as\r\nassistants. Fourth, to improve student retention rates, the student services division will \r\nacquire a full time retention officer to implement an aggressive, pro-active retention \r\nstrategy called the Family Based Education Model. Pressure points in the family based\r\nAmerican Indian students lives are identified and through a team analysis, referral and \r\nintervention strategies are prescribed to each student itat-risk.ln Community outreach \r\nwill expand SMET student opportunities for internship and community service placements.\r\n\r\nProject Outcomes. The project outcome will be increased American Indian SMET\r\nstudent retention rates, 10% increases annually during the project period. The technology\r\ninfrastructure will advance according to campus-wide plans. The faculty and staff will have\r\nlong term capacities and skills reflecting constructivist methods and technology\r\napplications. The Family Based Education Model will have intervened with at-risk SMET\r\nstudents, to heighten retention rates. Broad-based community relationships will support\r\nSMET majors and graduates and the college as an educational institution.",
