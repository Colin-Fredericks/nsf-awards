 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a Solvated Metal Atom Dispersion (SMAD) synthesizer for high rate production and eventual commercial adoption of metal nanoparticle materials.  Several high value applications (from magnetic tapes to highly reactive catalytic materials) have been identified with corresponding significant commercial interest expressed, yet development of innovative, scalable processes has been a sizeable barrier for commercialization of these important nanotechnologies. During Phase I, several key technical parameters will be optimized including vaporization of multiple precursors, solvent recovery and recycling, as well as nanoparticle formation, separation and purification technologies.  At the completion of the Phase I Research, a conceptual design for a continuous scalable synthesizer will be developed.\r\n\r\nMetallic, bimetallic, organometallic and encapsulated nanoparticles produced by the SMAD process meet a wide range of high value critical needs. Specifically, initial applications of the technology include superior catalysts, magnetic materials including information storage, improved transformer cores, radiation shield and coatings, and ferrofluids, as well as tracers for advanced systems.\r\n",
