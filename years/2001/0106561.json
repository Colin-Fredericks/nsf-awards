 "awd_abstract_narration": "0106561\r\nWilcock\r\n\r\nBed surface coarsening, broadly termed armoring, is a pervasive feature of\r\ngravel rivers. Armoring strongly influences channel hydraulics, determines\r\nthe population of grains available for transport, and defines the habitat\r\nfor aquatic invertebrates, salmonid spawning, and juvenile fish. A general\r\nand predictive understanding of flow, transport, and benthic ecology in\r\ngravel-bed rivers requires an ability to predict the bed surface\r\ncomposition as a function of water and sediment supply. In general, the bed\r\nsurface is not in equilibrium with contemporary conditions, so cause and\r\neffect cannot be deduced from simple correlations of field observations.\r\nInstead, we turn to the laboratory for controlled observations and to\r\ncomputational models to capture the varied and transient conditions in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nObservations of armoring have been made for decades and algorithms capable\r\nof predicting armoring have been developed. Key elements are missing in\r\nboth data and models, however, and the empirical and the theoretical have\r\nnot yet merged into a complete model. This work aims to bridge that gap by\r\nbuilding from both sides. On the empirical side, we will use a laboratory\r\nflume to make coupled observations of flow, transport, and bed surface\r\ncomposition in order to describe the evolution of surface and subsurface\r\ngrain sizes with unprecedented spatial and temporal detail.  On the\r\ntheoretical side, we will develop a transport and armoring model that\r\nincludes size-dependent vertical transfer of grains between surface and\r\nsubsurface (kinematic sorting). This mechanism can be incorporated in\r\ncurrent models, but the necessary transfer functions remain undefined and\r\nwill be identified using the data from the experimental portion of this\r\nproject.  Testing of the model will be based on internal comparisons\r\nbetween different sediment supply configurations and a set of runs with\r\nprogressive bed aggradation and degradation.  The result will be a\r\nphysically-based, tested model capable of predicting transport and armoring\r\nunder the complex, transient conditions typical of the field.\r\n",
