The\r\napproach in this project moves away from a pure graph-theoretic approach,\r\nbased purely on routing, to consider network capacity using an algebraic\r\nframework. Capacity is considered as the characterization of  the set of\r\nconnections that can be supported by a network in which the nodes are not\r\nonly capable of traditional routing functions, but can also perform\r\nprocessing of the data that arrives to them. Such processing is considered\r\nas a code over the network. Coding is also applied to recovery to maintain\r\ncertain connections in a network even after failure of a portion of the\r\nnetwork, for instance after the disappearance of a link in the network. The\r\nsecond part of the project considers robustness in channels where fading\r\nvaries over both time and frequency, especially over ultra wide frequency\r\nbands. The goal of this part of the project is to establish theoretical\r\nresults that relate capacity, peak power, energy, bandwith and probability\r\nof error in such a way as to characterize the practical achievable\r\nperformance in wide band wireless systems.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this project investigates the reliability of networks\r\nunder normal and  failure conditions when coding is used to ensure\r\ncontinuity of connections. This project shows that traditional methods of\r\nrecovery in networks, such as rerouting, are subsets of network coding and\r\nestablishes coding methods to increase the realibility of networks under\r\nfailure conditions. Moreover, the projects investigates the issue of network\r\nmanagement, where network management represents the information needed to\r\nmodify the behavior of the network, defined as the code of the network, in\r\nresponse to failures. The algebraic approach taken in this project allows\r\nsome characterization of the fundamental limits of the number of bits\r\nrequired to effect changes on the network code and of the portions of the\r\nnetwork that require knowledge of failures. The second part of the project\r\nconsiders capacity of very wide band channels and the applicability of\r\ndifferent types of signals and codes to achieve performance at or near the\r\ntheoretical maximum. In particular, it explores to what extent very high\r\npeak power symbols, which are known to achieve capacity in the limit of very\r\nlarge bandwidths, are necessary to achieve capacity. The project also\r\nexplores the ranges of bandwidth in which ultra-wideband results are\r\nachievable. This work bridges the theoretical limits of the channel\r\n(capacity) with the applicability of the techniques that achieve capacity by\r\nproviding an explicit bound to the probability of error in terms of rate,\r\nbandwidth and peak power of the signal. Finally, the project consider the\r\napplicability, in the range of moderate to large bandwidths, of traditional\r\nspread spectrum approaches, such as direct-sequence code-division multiple\r\naccess, that perform poorly in the limit of very large bandwidths.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
