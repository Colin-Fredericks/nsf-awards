 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a scholarship program for Computer Information Systems, Engineering and Industrial Technologies, and Mathematics majors at the associate degree level. Faculty and staff are working together across institutional divisions to meet students' educational needs and facilitate their success. The program builds upon a current Sinclair NSF project aimed at increasing participation in engineering technology programs: Image and Marketing of Engineering Technology Education (DUE 0071103).\r\n\r\nThe program is increasing the number of students obtaining associate degrees or transferring to four-year institutions in the areas of computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics (CSEMS). It also support students entering the workforce in CSEMS disciplines. The program has three primary goals:\r\n1. To increase the success of CSEMS students through scholarships and the provision of\r\nsupport services that promote full-time enrollment and the attainment of Associate\r\nDegrees in CSEMS disciplines.\r\n2. To assist student transfer to four year institutions to continue their education in a CSEMS\r\ndiscipline.\r\n3. To increase the participation of low-income, academically talented students in CSEMS\r\ncareers, especially students of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe project is meeting a growing demand for entry-level technicians in computer science and engineering disciplines. It is being led by a collaborative team of faculty from the Computer Information Systems Division, the Division of Engineering and Industrial Technologies Division, and the Mathematics Department. To support these efforts, these faculty are drawing upon the expertise of four Senior Personnel of the Financial Aid Office, Student Support Services Program, and Academic Counseling Services. \r\n\r\n",
