 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this career development plan is two-fold. Research in\r\ndeveloping fast and accurate high-level energy-estimation tools and their use in designing new software and architectural techniques for energy efficient Java execution. The PI will also concentrate on formulating and developing an educational plan to provide a strong foundation in interaction of hardware and software systems and hardware system design for undergraduate and \r\ngraduate students.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will provide an understanding of how to design energy-efficient systems from a holistic viewpoint considering both hardware and software components.  In particular, it will provide new insights into exploiting the interaction of \r\nhardware and software optimizations in reducing energy consumption. The first part of this research will focus on developing high-level energy estimation tools that are essential for designing the energy-efficient architectures and energy-conscious software components to support Java execution. The second part of this research will focus on providing a set of architectural techniques to reduce the energy consumption. The final part of this research will provide techniques for designing the software components of the Java runtime system to better exploit any energy-saving features present in the underlying hardware.\r\n\r\n",
