 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will investigate the structure of atomic nuclei at the extremes of stability, angular momentum, and energy.  The studies will include nuclear systems beyond the proton drip line and at the\r\nlimits of stability to fission. Techniques will be developed to study light-ion transfer reactions on nuclei far from stability using radioactive ion beams.  This proposal also addresses, via measurements of magnetic moments of excited states,  the the microscopic description of nuclear wavefunctions as a function of energy and spin, the study of residual nucleon-nucleon interactions, and the interplay of single particle configurations with an underlying spherical or deformed core.  A new technique, combining the traditional transient field method with the newly developed approach involving Coulomb excitation of {\\it beams} in inverse kinematics, will be explored in order to measure magnetic moments of excited states with\r\nsubpicosecond lifetimes in nuclei close to shell closure.  The structure of the proposed activities is designed to have great impact on the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as postdoctoral associates involved with these experimental research activities.\r\n\r\n",
