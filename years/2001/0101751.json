 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is combining traditional surveying techniques with training in high-technology spatial data acquisition and manipulation in the Geomatics Technology Program. The program provides training in industry-standard applications including GIS, GPS, land information systems, remote sensing and traditional surveying. In this project, the scope and resources in the program are being expanded. The project's five major goals include improving teacher and faculty knowledge in geographic information technologies; developing a local mapping and surveying workforce; enhancing the technical experience for students; improving laboratories; and promoting careers in mapping, surveying, and geographic information technologies.\r\n\r\nActivities include developing cooperative education and internships, providing more hand-on experiences for students with industry standard equipment, job shadowing for college faculty, summer workshops for high school teachers and college instructors, a fast-track program for industry professionals, and a short video to market Geomatics Technology to high school and non-traditional students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
