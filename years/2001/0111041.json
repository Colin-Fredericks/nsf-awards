 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nScientists at the Kansas State University Plant Resistance to Insects\r\nLaboratory have identified several molecular markers linked to genes\r\nexpressing resistance to the Russian wheat aphid, a serious pest of cereal\r\ngrain crops in Africa, North America, and South America.  In order to\r\nconduct more detailed research, the Principal Investigator of this Minority Career Advancement Award, Dr. Smith, will obtain hands-on research training\r\nin the use of RFLP marker linkage analysis, cDNA cloning, and cDNA and BAC\r\nsequencing.  The specific new skills to be acquired will be plant RNA and\r\nplasmid DNA isolation, Southern and Northern blotting and hybridization,\r\nconstruction of a subtractive cDNA library, and sequence analysis of DNA\r\nclones. Experiments will be conducted during the training that will provide\r\ninformation about the linkages of various RFLP loci to the Dn6 Russian wheat\r\naphid resistance gene, and initial information about possible DNA sequences\r\nrelated to Dn6.  Thus, this information will serve as a starting point for\r\nfurther research on aphid resistance gene sequences.  Dr. Smith will also\r\nattend a course in bioinformatics at Kansas State University and attend two\r\ncontinuing education conferences which emphasize bioinformatics.  Knowledge\r\ngained from these educational activities will be used to update three\r\ncourses dealing with plant resistance to pests in which Dr. Smith serves as\r\ninstructor or co-instructor.  Information and experience derived from the\r\nresearch and training objectives of the current proposal will provide\r\nstudents enrolled in these courses current information on plant genomics,\r\nbioinformatics, and gene sequencing.\r\n\r\nRFLP - restriction fragment length polymorphism; cDNA - complementary DNA;\r\nBAC- bacterial artificial chromosome\r\n\r\n",
