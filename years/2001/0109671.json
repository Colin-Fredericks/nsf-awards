 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop integrated, wireless transceiver Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits for neuron based data acquisition (DAQ) systems. Currently available multi-channel neuron DAQ systems require a tethered connection for the surgically implanted analog head stage electronics. This wired connection limits the subject's freedom and motion. If a low power, wireless connection were possible, these limitations are eliminated. Furthermore, a wireless connection broadens the use of DAQ systems to clinical possibilities with humans. The critical design parameters for the wireless head stage transceiver circuits are 4 Million Bits per second (Mbs) data rate and 1mWatt power dissipation. The first is needed to meet the 16-channel bandwidth requirement.The second is required because of the miniature size and lightweight constraints of the battery power source needed for a wireless connection. The specific objective of the project is to design the most efficient wireless transmitter and receiver for the neuron DAQ system. Two protocols, namely, minimum Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) will be considered and evaluated. This comparative evaluation, also involving Bluetooth radio chip sets, will be conducted on the basis of efficiency, layout area, noise and process immunity. Integrated CMOS filters, mixers and oscillators with off chip antennas will be simulated, designed and extracted to meet the 4Mbs and 1mWatt benchmark.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in the area of neuroprosthetics to restore sensory and motor function in patients with neural damage.\r\n",
