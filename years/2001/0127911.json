DeMarco\r\nInstitution: University of Wisconsin-Madison\r\nDate: July 21, 2001\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our nation's needs in critical infrastructure have been examined in the wake of Presidential Decision Directive 63, a number of forums have identified enhancement of U.S. university programs to prepare suitably trained researchers and technical professionals as a key area for further effort. Graduate training and research experience relevant to critical infrastructures has a strong interdisciplinary component. Accomplishing interdisciplinary work in the traditionally specialized departmental structure of graduate programs at the U.S. universities has long presented a challenge. The goal of this workshop is to present perspectives from a disparate set of disciplines on critical infrastructures, share experiences of interdisciplinary research and graduate education, and identify and disseminate mechanisms to further cultivate and improve this work to include the programs of NSF and other agencies which provide support for these efforts.\r\n\r\n",
