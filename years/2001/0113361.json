 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of mobile autonomous system of nodes connected\r\nby wireless links with multi-hop communication and no underlying infrastructure. Research in the field of\r\nMANET is receiving unprecedented attention due to their profound impact on human life. The most\r\nimportant problems in MANET are Routing, Quality of Service, Security, Power management and Traffic\r\nand Mobility modeling and we plan to address many of these issues.\r\nIn a MANET, when a mobile node has a packet to send, it first consults its route cache to determine\r\nwhether it already has a route to destination, else it initiates route discovery by broadcasting. Once a route\r\nis established, its continuation and maintenance is of prime concern for efficient communication. A route\r\ncould be broken by mobility and is determined by route error packets. Rather than employing a\r\nconventional way of global re-flooding for a new route search, we address this by Local Route Repair\r\n(LLR) approach and achieve re-connectivity with minimum overhead. Further work is needed to extend\r\nour scheme by increasing the length of patch-up part. We expect this to yield a higher amount of savings\r\nin terms of routing overhead and delay when unidirectional links are present. We also plan to define an\r\nanalytical framework for different protocols and determine their performance.\r\nThe need for scheduling in a MANET arises primarily due to limited availability of resources. We plan to\r\nstudy the impact of packet level scheduling strategies that transmit packets based on a metric derived\r\nfrom characteristics of the data being transmitted, like the length of the packets or the length of the route\r\nbeing traversed by the packets or even the priority of the packets. We plan to test other routing schemes\r\nand define and formulate an analytical model for packet queue at each node so that we could determine\r\nend-to-end delay of different types of packets.\r\nEffective operation of MANETs is dependent on maintaining appropriate routing information in a\r\ndistributed fashion. Confidentiality of routing information is important so that not only the payload data\r\nbut also the routing message headers carrying, the location information of the mobile nodes can be\r\nexchanged securely. We have defined an authentication scheme that can prevent the external attacks. We\r\nminimize substantial overhead by performing mutual authentication using challenge-response mechanism\r\nalong the reply path only when the route reply is received. We plan to propose a distributed intrusion\r\ndetection system to handle them. We will build these systems based on traffic profiles that we would\r\nobtain after extensive study of the traffic patterns. We are planning to perform a detailed simulation to\r\nobtain metrics that would help us in differentiating valid and malicious data.\r\nWireless sensor networks can be easily deployed without any installation costs or pre-planned\r\norganization. To increase fault tolerance, thousands of these sensors might be employed. The traditional\r\nrouting protocols defined for wireless ad hoc network do not scale well for sensor networks as they are\r\ndata centric and application-specific unlike traditional networks. Most protocols for sensor network\r\ncollect data periodically from environment. We feel that there exists a need for networks geared towards\r\nresponding immediately to changes in the sensed attributes. Very recently, we have proposed a protocol\r\ncalled TEEN for such networks. We are also looking at ways to combine the best features of both\r\nproactive and reactive protocols to form a hybrid network. We also believe that sensor networks should\r\nprovide the end user with the ability to control the three-way trade-off between energy efficiency,\r\naccuracy and response time dynamically. In brief, the proposal research will have a long-term impact on\r\nthe robustness and security of MANETs and sensor networks.",
