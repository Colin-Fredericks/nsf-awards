The award will support a workshop organized by Dr. Phillip Cole of the University of Texas at El Paso, Dr. David Ernst of Vanderbilt University, and Dr. Efrain Chavez of the Instituto de Fisica at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.  This award is partially supported by the Physics Division of NSF.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will cover a wide range of timely and important issues in nuclear physics such as heavy ion reactions in the low to medium-energy range, exotic nuclei, as well as photo- and electron-nuclear physics.  The meeting seeks to promote dialog between faculty members of North American and Latin-American institutions by finding common interests in research and through this effort strengthen existing links and forge new ones within the broad scope of the international nuclear physics community.  Strengthening this link between the United States and Latin America will foster the recruitment of high-caliber graduate-level students to pursue research at U.S. institutions and laboratories.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
