 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to provide all students with a research-rich instruction and learning environment, to enhance student interest in and increase excitement about learning and practicing chemistry and to strengthen the students' problem- solving skills. Experiential learning is enhanced by (a) increasing early exposure to FT-NMR spectroscopy in courses for science majors; (b) giving every science major extensive, direct experience with FT-NMR instrumentation; (c) integrating research opportunities, using a comprehensive variety of experiments, into the chemistry curriculum; and (d) integrating FT-NMR, along with other instrumental techniques, into at least one course for non-majors that focuses on molecular structure and reactivity. Purchase of an Anasazi Instruments EFT-60 system to complement an existing high-field, multinuclear FT-NMR spectrometer and use of experiments adapted from standard literature allow hands-on instrumentation use by science majors at all levels. A course designed for non-science majors also includes a research-rich, hands-on laboratory component using the newly acquired instrumentation. A workshop for local high school teachers and talented high school students is offered, during which participants have the opportunity for hands-on operation of the FT-NMR spectrometers. This exposure to instrumentation at the high school level results in better preparedness for the college-bound science student, increased interest in pursuing a science-related career, and an increased excitement among students about science in general.",
