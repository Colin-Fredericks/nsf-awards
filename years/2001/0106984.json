 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multicasting has become increasingly important for real-time applications since it is the inherent mode of\r\ndelivery in several of them, e.g. teleconferencing, audio and video broadcasting, etc. The Internet, however,\r\ndoes not provide end-to-end bandwidth or delay guarantees for unicast or for multicast data. As a result, a\r\nnumber of multiple scale encoding schemes for real-time voice and video transmission have been developed;\r\nthese schemes allow adaptation both to the available bandwidth and to the receiver capabilities by varying\r\nthe number of levels of the information stream and therefore the corresponding bit rates. Thus, bandwidth\r\nand receiver adaptation of multi-level information streams, in multicast delivery in particular, is an issue\r\nof prime importance for the successful, large-scale deployment of those real-time applications. We propose\r\nto investigate and develop methods for bandwidth sharing and adaptation in the context of multicast-\r\nbased real-time applications. A set of fairness criteria based on which the performance of different schemes\r\ncan be quantified and compared is introduced. A methodology for finding bandwidth allocations that are\r\noptimal or suboptimal with respect to the different criteria is proposed. Scalability with the network size,\r\namenability to distributed implementation in terms of required control information and speed of convergence\r\nare adopted as prime criteria, in addition to optimality, in the evaluation of the different algorithms. We\r\npropose an approach for the design of the algorithms that allows the trade-off between optimality with\r\nrespect to the performance objective and practicality with respect to the other attributes (i.e. scalability\r\netc.). A methodology for network control in multicasting in the case of unknown traffic and/or network\r\nconditions is proposed as well. It involves explicit back-pressure based congestion notification feedback and\r\ndynamic per ow scheduling. Finally we propose a method for the design of congestion control policies\r\nwith the objective of maximizing an aggregate network utility. A relative comparison between the two\r\napproaches (fairness based and aggregate utility maximization) is also proposed in order to be able to select\r\nthe most appropriate one in each case.",
