 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot project proposes to interview principals in young knowledge-based firms in the Madison, Wisconsin area. Half will be firms that depend on university-generated science, typically involving faculty members. Data will be gathered to generate new inductive insights into how and when these firms use improvisation (in contrast to more traditional action modes of planning followed by execution, or following organizational routines) as an action mode in key behavior. Data will also be used to assess feasibility and develop measures to assess (1) setback incidents; (2) whether and when a firm switches to or from an improvisational action mode; (3) changes in the firm's network of key advisors; (4) other theory and control variables. The feasibility and measurement work will lay the groundwork for the design of a systematic study of related formal hypotheses. The pilot project is part of a long-term project to increase understanding of how improvisation can either help or hurt the prosperity of knowledge-based start-ups, and how key advisors moderate these processes.\r\nContemporary entrepreneurship correctly emphasizes planning skills, which are essential. However, there is also some evidence that improvisation can represent a valuable organizational competency, especially for firms in high risk, high tech settings. Understanding and codifying knowledge about improvisation will encourage the development of theory as well as more sophisticated curriculum development in the area of entrepreneurship.\r\n",
