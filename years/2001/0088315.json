 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56) \r\r\n\r\nIn this project, concepts of engineering graphics, mechanical design, numerical simulation, rapid prototyping and product testing are integrated in project experiences performed by interdepartmental teams of sophomores, juniors and seniors. The project also provides faculty development in the area of interdisciplinary teaming leading to improved integration of engineering courses. The project includes acquisition and installation of an abrasive waterjet machine tool and a three dimensional printer, both of which can easily import CAD designs for the manufacture of prototype parts. The use of these systems is integrated into interdepartmental team projects in several courses in Mechanical and Industrial/Manufacturing Engineering. This project represents an adaptation of several recent NSF supported projects investigating the use of rapid prototyping technologies in undergraduate courses. By integrating the use of these technologies with multidisciplinary team projects involving prototype design, analysis, manufacturing and testing, students experience concurrent engineering and the product realization process.\r\n\r\n The project assessment is performed by a committee of administrators, faculty, students and industrial representatives who review the project assignments, samples of student work, results of student questionnaires and feedback from course instructors. Several documents are being developed including an overview of project activities, examples of assignments, tutorials for the use of the prototyping software and hardware, and examples of student work. Internal dissemination includes sharing of course materials, faculty development enrichment seminars and laboratory demonstrations. Dissemination to other institutions includes distribution of project documents via a project web page, presentations at conferences, and publications in educational journals.",
