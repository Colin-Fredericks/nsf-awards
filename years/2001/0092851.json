Specifically, the research will focus on the most important component of the most widely used wastewater treatment process: the separation of solids from the effluent in the activated sludge process.\r\nThis separation leads to the production of a clear effluent in activated sludge and depends on the intricate balance between the populations of filamentous and floc-forming bacteria. However, despite over 80 years of experience with the process, the main parameters affecting the microbial selection of floc-formers over filaments are not thoroughly understood. Consequently, methods\r\nfor controlling excessive filamentous growth that causes settleability problems (bulking) are empirical. A unified theory of microbial selection is thus necessary to provide a sound basis for designing control technologies  The research component of this project will combine molecular, modeling, and reactor studies to integrate theories of microbial selection of floc-formers over filaments and develop design guidelines for reactor design and operation. \r\nThe education component involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the\r\nprinciples and practices of molecular techniques, the integration of treatment process modeling\r\nin graduate water quality courses, the development of a teaching module on applications of\r\nmolecular methods in environmental engineering, the integration of full-scale treatment plant\r\nexposure experiences in undergraduate and graduate courses, and participation in the Video-\r\nBased Engineering Education program at North Carolina State University. ***\r\n",
