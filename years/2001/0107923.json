 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the 13th International Congress on Nitrogen Fixation (to be held July 2-7, 2001 in Hamilton, Ontario) is to bring together scientists from throughout the world to discuss current research needs and fundamental research findings related to all aspects of biological nitrogen fixation. Subject areas to be discussed include: genetics of microsymbiont and host plant, ecology (competition, chemotaxis, survival, etc.), agricultural implications of biological nitrogen fixation, chemistry of nitrogenase and metal complexes, international programs, physiology of nitrogen fixing microorganisms, regulation of nitrogen fixing genes, genome structure of nitrogen fixing microorganisms, physiology of nitrogen fixing symbiotic partners, etc.  The objectives of the meeting are: 1:To identify factors that limit nitrogen fixation and design research approaches that will help overcome these limitations. 2:To review the status of current research efforts relating to biological nitrogen fixation.  3:To foster collaborative research efforts on common subjects. 4:To characterize the genomic structure of nitrogen-fixing species. 5:To provide a convenient arena for graduate student and postdoctoral participation in meetings. 6:To identify research goals for the first decade of the 21st century. And 7:To identify and discuss recent advances in the chemistry of nitrogen fixation and the potential for these discoveries for practical use. Funds are requested to partially support the participation of US scientists, postdoctoral associates and graduate students in the Congress. Scientists designated as plenary speakers and workshop leaders were selected based upon several criteria; including evidence of current, high quality research, evidence of success as an effective communicator, broad knowledge related to the subject matter, and geographical distribution. Postdoctoral and graduate student participants will be chosen based on need and evidence that they will present a poster presentation at the meeting. A meeting proceedings will be published that will contain review, original research contributions and poster abstracts for all presentations. The organizers, along with other members of the local organizing committee, will edit the proceedings for publication.",
