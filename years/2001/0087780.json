PI will compare megafossil floras preserved in the sediments of early and middle Eocene lakes from North America (West Branch Creek and Green River floras, western US), western Europe (Messel and Eckfeld, Germany), and Eastern Asia (Fushun and Huadian, China).  The ages of each these assemblages are established through correlations of associated mammal faunas and/or radiometrically dated volcanic ashes.  Paleoclimate of each of the sites will be compared based on foliar physiognomic analyses to give approximations of mean annual temperature and precipitation.  Intra- and intercontinental floristic comparisons will be made to determine the relative proportion of shared vs. endemic taxa between each pair of continents in the early and middle Eocene.  The resulting observations will: 1) provide approximations of the mean annual temperature and precipitation of these widely separated lake basins, 2) indicate the relative importance of different routes of intercontinental dispersal in the early and middle Eocene, and 3) facilitate comparison of dispersal patterns in plants with those observed in mammals during the early Tertiary.\r\n",
