 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure Program provides support for 25 American scientists to participate in a US-UK Workshop on Grid Computing.  The purpose of the workshop is to: 1) identify Grid research, development, and deployment activities that could be carried out jointly by researchers from the United States and the United Kingdom; 2) explore common interests in both applications and infrastructure (middleware, networking) that would warrant, and benefit from, the creation of a high-speed transatlantic testbed, and 3) if  such a testbed is desirable, begin to develop the technical agenda for a high-speed transatlantic testbed.  The workshop will be held on August 4-5, 2001 in San Francisco just prior to the tenth High-Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC-10) Conference.  This workshop award will pay travel expenses for US participants.  The US co-organizers are Carl Kesselman (USC-ISI) and Paul Messina (Caltech).",
