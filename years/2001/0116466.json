 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:  A grant has been awarded to Dr. Whittemore at Keene State College to improve the ability to detect the presence, as well as to predict the effects, of pollutants on aquatic environments for the effective management of our valuable water resources.  Daphnia magna, a freshwater crustacean species, has long been used an indicator of freshwater quality.  It has been well-demonstrated that these invertebrates are highly sensitive to a wide variety of aquatic contaminants.  The bulk of the toxicological studies using bioassays based on Daphnia rely on measurements of the effects of contaminant exposure on survival, growth, and reproduction. The results of such studies are often difficult to detect and quantify and are not reliably reproduceable.  There is a need for bioindicators of water quality that can be easily and rapidly measured and that demonstrate sensitivity to sublethal toxicant exposures. The long-term objective of our research is to further the effectiveness of this valuable bioindicator species through the identification and quantification of genes that are expressed upon exposure to specific contaminants.  \r\n The grant will be used to acquire a real-time PCR system and a differential display system to further our investigations concerning the molecular physiology of stress in Daphnia magna.  The differential display system will greatly enhance the efficiency with which we are able to identify genes that are expressed in Daphnia following sublethal exposure to specific aquatic contaminants. The expression of these genes will then be quantified using real-time PCR methodology with the objective of developing these genes as sensitive molecular markers of contaminant exposure. \r\nThe PI, Susan Whittemore, a physiologist, and the co-PI, Scott Strong, a molecular biologist, are faculty members at a small public liberal arts college, Keene State College.  The requested equipment will greatly enhance the collaborative integrated research/education efforts of these two faculty members. The project provides KSC undergraduates state-of-the-art training opportunities in the field of molecular biology. Engaging in faculty-mentored research enhances the desire and ability of our undergraduates, many of whom are from underprivileged backgrounds and/or are women, to pursue post-graduate training in biology.\r\n",
