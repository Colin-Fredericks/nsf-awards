 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0104162\r\nGunnar Carlsson\r\n\r\nThis project includes several different directions of \r\nresearch.  Carlsson will study a homotopy theoretic model \r\nhe has constructed for the algebraic K-theory spectrum of \r\na field, which is built out of the representation theory of \r\nthe absolute Galois group of the field.  He will try to prove \r\nthat the model is indeed equivalent to the K-theory of the \r\nfield, as well as to work out the consequences of this result \r\nfor the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjectures and the relationship \r\nbetween this result and the Bloch-Kato conjecture. He will \r\nalso investigate potential applications of algebraic topology \r\nin high dimensional data analysis.  He expects to improve \r\nsoftware which he and V. De Silva have developed for homology computation, with the goal of identifying features such as \r\nsingular points as well as global topology for data sets of \r\ndimension greater than three. He also plans to study homotopy \r\ntheoretic issues which arise in computational questions, \r\nrelating to sampling subcomplexes from large simplicial \r\ncomplexes.  Kiem plans to compute intersection numbers for \r\nsingular moduli spaces of curves.  This is an important \r\nproblem since the intersection numbers in this case are \r\nrelated to well-known geometric invariants, such as the \r\nCasson invariant.\r\n\r\nOne of the great themes in mathematics over the last two \r\ncenturies is the strong relationship between arithmetic \r\nand geometry.  The study of this theme was initiated by  \r\nAbel and Galois in the early 19th century, and in this \r\ncentury its further development has resulted in our \r\nobtaining very precise information concerning sets of \r\ninteger or rational solutions to systems of equations.  \r\nThe goal of this project is to explore another manifestation \r\nof this theme, in the form of the so-called algebraic \r\nK-theory of fields.  Algebraic K-theory is a geometric \r\nconstruction attached to arithmetic objects, called fields. \r\nFields are arithmetic objects in which one can add, \r\nmultiply, and divide.  Algebraic K-theory attaches \r\ngeometric objects to these fields, and in such a way \r\nthat already well understood invariants of fields can \r\nbe extracted easily.  Algebraic K-theory also contains \r\nmany less well understood invariants as well, and the \r\ngoal of understanding these invariants has been one \r\ntoward which topologists have been striving since the \r\nearly 1970's, when Quillen defined higher algebraic \r\nK-theory.  Two important conjectures have been \r\nformulated concerning algebraic K-theory, the \r\nQuillen-Lichtenbaum and Bloch-Kato conjectures.  \r\nThey would relate the algebraic K-theory of a field \r\nto properties of its \"absolute Galois groups\", an \r\nobject which incorporates all possible symmetries of \r\nsets of solutions of sets of equations over the field \r\nin question.  This project aims to understand very \r\nclearly how algebraic K-theory is built out of \r\ninformation of this large group of symmetries,  \r\nand to use this understanding to approach the \r\ntwo central conjectures mentioned above.  \r\n",
