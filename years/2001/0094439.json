The objectives of this scholarship program are to increase the number of low income, academically qualified students obtaining undergraduate degrees in computer science and mathematics and to increase the number of advanced study and career and employment opportunities for participants in the program. The target group of candidates for this scholarship program is transfer students from community colleges. Support includes services provided by the Learning Center, Career Center, the Director of New Students and Retention and the Office of Multicultural Affairs. The Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics, in conjunction with various campus offices, provides one-hour seminars each semester for participants on topics related to academic life and planning and preparing for entry into a career or advanced study.",
