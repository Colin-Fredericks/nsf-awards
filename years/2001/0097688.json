These students are expected to come from a variety of majors, including biology, computer science, geography, and physics and will be divided into teams to work with faculty and graduate student researchers on problems in computer science, geographic information systems, materials science, and pharmacy.  Each week except for the first and last week of the summer program, students will work on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays with researchers on specific disciplinary research projects.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays they will attend half day training sessions on specific VE technologies and tools, work in the VE Lab, and participate in a weekly research seminar involving all participants, undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty. \r\n\r\nAfter each summer program in 2001, 2002, and 2003, three students will be selected from that year's participants to work in the Virtual Systems Laboratory at Gifu University in Japan during the following summer.  The program will provide Japanese language and culture training for these selected participants during spring before their summer experience in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
