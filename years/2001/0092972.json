 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop and implement new and\r\nefficient optimization methods for robust and discrete optimization\r\nproblems. The applications of interest to us are in the fields of\r\nfinancial engineering and network design. The robust optimization\r\nframework is an attempt to correct for the modeling uncertainties\r\nthat are inevitable in engineering. Optimization problems are\r\nespecially susceptible to modeling errors since, in trying to exploit\r\nthe constraints, the optimal solutions typically amplify the errors\r\nseveral fold. In the robust framework, the perturbations are modeled\r\nas unknown, but bounded, and optimization problems are solved\r\nassuming worst case behavior of these perturbations. Robustness to\r\nmodeling and estimation errors is an issue of critical importance for\r\nfinancial optimization problems because of the serious consequences\r\nof making wrong bets! Surprisingly, however, robust optimization has\r\nnot been widely explored in financial engineering. The research\r\nproposed here formulates robust dynamical models for financial\r\nproblems and develops semidefinite rogramming based methods for\r\nsolving them. These models systematically account for parameter\r\nuncertainty and robustly update error-bounds as more information\r\nbecomes available over time. In addition, the project extends the\r\nsemidefinite relaxation methodology to probabilistically robust\r\noptimization problems that naturally emerge in the financial context.\r\nThe other research focus of this proposal is on developing\r\nsemidefinite models for graph theoretic problems such as the\r\ntraveling salesman problem and network design. These models employ\r\nlinear matrix inequalities (LM ) to represent  geometric\r\nconstraints, such as graph connectivity, specified number of\r\nedge/vertex disjoint paths, etc. The optimization problems resulting\r\nfrom these LM models are, typically, mixed integer semidefinite\r\nprograms, i.e. semidefinite programs where some of the decision\r\nvariables are constrained to be integers. Currently, mixed\r\nsemidefinite programs are appproximately solved by relaxing the\r\nintegrality constraints. However, as computational ower increases and\r\nthe interior point methods for solving semidefinite programs become\r\nmore efficient, the PI expects that there would be a push for\r\ndeveloping systematic methods of tightening the relaxations - as in\r\nthe case of linear programming relaxations of mixed integer programs.\r\nAs a first step in this direction, the PI proposes to develop several\r\ncutting lane strategies for mixed semidefinite programs. Although the\r\nproblems of interest to the PI belong to disparate application areas,\r\nthey are linked in that linear matrix inequalities and semidefinite\r\nprogramming provide the necessary tools to efficiently model and\r\nsolve them. The education component of this proposal includes\r\ndeveloping a sequence of graduate courses on engineering applications\r\nof optimization. These courses would fill an important gap in the\r\ncurriculum of the Deppartment by providing students with a firm\r\ntheoretical and practical grounding in optimization. The World Wide\r\nWeb will be extensively used in these courses. All the teaching\r\nmaterial will be available on the web. The PI will develop Java-based\r\napplets for all the examples used in the courses which would allow\r\nstudents to experiment with these examples in real time. Also, the\r\noptimization resources on the web will be integrated into the\r\ncurriculum. This should be particularly useful to students from\r\nindustry who would take the courses over the Video Network. To expose\r\nundergraduate students to research, the PI plans to organize an\r\ninterdisciplinary research program in optimization and its\r\napplications. To facilitate industry outreach, the PI plans to\r\nimplement the results of the proposed research into a software\r\npackage and publish expository articles on the applications of the\r\nnew techniques. The PI expects that the availability of a user\r\nfriendly software will spur further applications and encourage\r\nindustrial collaboration.",
