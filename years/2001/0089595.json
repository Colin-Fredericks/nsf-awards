 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Olivier De Montmollin, Mr. Roberto Lopez Bravo will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct archaeological excavation at the site of El Lacandon located in Mexico's Peten Peninsula. This site dates to the Classic Period when Mayan polities reached their greatest areal extent and, while not a major center itself, is important because of it's ties with Palenque located 18 km away. Epigraphic and archaeological data indicate that during Classic times Palenque expanded and established control over a large region which included El Lacandon. Because the latter existed as an independent entity before Palenque's expansion it is possible to determine how social, political and economic organization was altered after incorporation into Palenque's sphere and to reconstruct the method of governance. While many large Mayan kingdoms have been studied, archaeologists do not agree on the means of political integration employed. Some believe that outlying areas such as El Lacandon were controlled through direct intervention and that tight centralized authority was exercised. Under this scenario such regions were tightly integrated into a broader economic system. Other archaeologists however postulate a much looser arrangement in which pre-existing local elites, if they recognized their secondary status, were allowed to remain in power and that, other than the payment of tribute, pre-existing systems remained essentially unchanged. To examine this question, Mr. Bravo will excavate a series of both \"commoner\" and \"elite\" habitation areas which incorporate both pre and post Palenque periods. He will also excavate in central ceremonial areas to determine whether a period of new construction coincides with the power structure change. The patterns he observes will provide insight into the structure of El Lacandon - Palenque relations.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on the functioning of one of the largest Mayan prehistoric kingdoms and provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
