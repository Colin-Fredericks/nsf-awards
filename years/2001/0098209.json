 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless communication systems must inevitably deal with the \r\nsevere effects of fading, the phenomenon whereby received signals fluctuate \r\nover very wide ranges as the propagation environment changes in time.  \r\nVarious forms of diversity are commonly employed to combat the effects \r\nof fading.  In various scenarios, it is possible to achieve diversity by \r\ntransmitting a signal that is redundant in time or frequency, by using \r\nmultiple transmit antennas and/or multiple receive antennas.  While techniques\r\nfor achieving time diversity, frequency diversity, and space diversity \r\nthrough multiple receive antennas are well known, developing techniques\r\nfor achieving diversity through the use of multiple transmit antennas is\r\na relatively new area which is currently of great practical and theoretical \r\ninterest.  This research involves the design of improved modulation and coding\r\ntechniques for the so-called space-time systems, i.e., those with multiple \r\ntransmit antennas.  One main goal of this project is to maximize improvement \r\nin what is in some sense the worst case scenario where the number of receive \r\nantennas is either one or a very small number and also where the channel is\r\nfading in a very slow (i.e., quasi-static) manner.  In this environment, \r\ntransmitter diversity and possibly frequency selectivity may be the only \r\nsources of potential diversity.\r\n\r\nThis research studies the potential of improving on existing techniques\r\nby overcoming two flaws that plague many existing or proposed space-time \r\nsystems: 1) Space time codes have difficulty providing both diversity and \r\nsignificant coding gain,  Many space-time codes must use up all their redundancy \r\nto provide diversity and actually provide little or no coding gain.  By \r\nsplitting the jobs of providing diversity and coding gain between either two \r\nseparate codes or between the coding and modulation formats, this research \r\nproduces a more effective space-time communication system.  2) Space time codes \r\nwhich promise significant coding gain often do not produce it in a quasi-static \r\nfading channel (QSFC).  The currently accepted design rules for space-time \r\ncodes are in fact shaky when applied to a QSFC.  By forming a more solid \r\nfoundation for designing codes for QSFCs, this research produces better design \r\ncriteria and ultimately better space-time coding techniques.\r\n",
