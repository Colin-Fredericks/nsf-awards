Dr. Cao  \r\nintends to continue his work on Gromov's  \r\nminimal volume gap conjecture jointly with  \r\nhis coauthors. Using the F-structure theory developed  \r\nby Cheeger and Gromov and the heat flow, he  \r\nwould like to study the  minimal volume gap  \r\nconjecture for complete aspherical  \r\nmanifolds. The investigator hopes to  \r\nshow that if a compact nonpositively curved  \r\nmanifold $M$ is homotopy equivalent to a generalized  \r\ngraph-manifold, then $M$ must be a generalized  \r\ngraph-manifold with vanishing minimal volume as well.   \r\nIn addition, Cao plans to continue  \r\nhis study of the sign of the Euler number of  \r\ncompact aspherical manifolds. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the study of global  \r\ngeometric shape of aspherical spaces. The examples  \r\nof aspherical spaces include flat tires and surfaces  \r\nwith more than two holes, such as pretzels. There are  \r\nalso examples of higher dimensional aspherical  \r\nspaces. Our universe can be viewed a 3-dimensional  \r\naspherical space. Dr. Cao is trying to investigate  \r\ndiameter, volume, spectrum and other geometric data  \r\nof those spaces. Cao has also been interested in the  \r\nstudy of the shortest closed curves on non-positively  \r\ncurved spaces. He has already shown that two such surfaces  \r\nwith possible cusps are isometric if and  \r\nonly if the data of lengths of all shortest closed curves on  \r\nthe two surfaces are identical. The data of lengths  \r\nof all shortest closed curves on a closed  \r\nsurface M is called the marked length spectrum  \r\nof the space M. The study of marked length spectrum on  \r\nspaces with boundaries has a number of applications  \r\nin modern industry and geological sciences.  \r\n\r\n",
