 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019.\r\n\r\nThe  project involves blending of molecular biology, polymer chemistry, and materials physics, in an attempt to create a new class of spin-tronic functional nanostructures.  A  new architecture is proposed to create  \r\nspin-tronic magnetic devices, using a biologically modified, metal coated, polymer nanotube process. The advantages of spin-tronics include higher speed, greater storage density, low power dissipation, and non-volatility. The proposed  architecture uses a form of molecular self-assembly based on biological models. The magnetic nano-wires are formed from a tubular polymer backbone, that can be coated with various metallic layers. By functionalizing the ends of the tubes with special molecules, the nano-tubes become what we call \"Smart Wires\". Smart-Wires are at the center of our proposed new architecture for nanoscale device fabrication, since the instructions for \"wiring\" the circuits are built into the molecular nanostructures \r\nthemselves, rather than having to be imposed afterwards using a patterning process. The \"Smart-Wires\" use molecular recognition, modeled after the biological antibody-antigen bonding reaction, to attach the wire ends to the appropriate substrate structures.  Under this  project metal coated nano-tube will be fabricated and the work will be extended to include the \"Smart Wire\" functionalization and bonding, and also metallic \r\nmultilayer coatings.  A  full range of sensitive magnetic and electronic probes will be used  to measure the nano-tube properties, using methods perfected in a previous NSF project to study epitaxial spin-valve structures. The research team plans to develop a prototype of a magnetic nano-tube assembly with a switchable magnetic state.\r\n",
