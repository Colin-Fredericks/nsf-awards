 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of ultra ductile, strain-hardening Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC), instead of brittle concrete, can overcome limitations in brittle shear and reinforcement buckling of standard R/C members. The advantage of combining ECC and reinforcement is that the deformation of the structural member can be distributed along its length, and therefore require less localized deformation of the longitudinal reinforcement.  The present research focuses on the enhancement of seismic response of R/C structures by exploiting the unusual behavior of ECC and its interaction with reinforcement. Novel design concepts are introduced. Specifically, detailed investigations and analyses will be performed on the interaction of candidate reinforcement materials and ECC. Subsequently, column and beam members will be designed and tested. Finally, R/ECC column and beam elements will be assembled into moment resisting frames and tested. The overall objective is to develop a structural frame system with superior seismic resistance with an intrinsic, materials-based safety mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
