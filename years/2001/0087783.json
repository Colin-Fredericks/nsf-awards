 "awd_abstract_narration": "MONEY is a traveling exhibition using the familiar and fascinating subject of money to build math skills and promote economic literacy.  The exhibit will provide an engaging and relevant context in which to explore mathematics using experiences such as making change, comparing prices, saving, balancing a checkbook, paying bills or budgeting -- which are all direct applications of math.  This exhibit will address the needs of children and their families for economic literacy as they make decisions that shape their futures.\r\n\r\nThrough a mix of hands-on interactives, audio and video components, computer-based activities, graphics, text and artifacts, the exhibition emphasizes the mathematical skills, concepts and problem-solving strategies necessary for economic literacy.  Areas in the exhibit will address the history of money, how it is made, prices and markets, and world trade.  Within these contexts, visitors will develop computational skills and gain an understanding of concepts such as operations, patterns, functions, algebra, data analysis, probability and mathematical representation.  The concepts are highly correlated with -- and build upon -- the NCTM National Standards in mathematics.\r\n\r\nFamilies, children and learners of all ages will be able to experience the exhibit during its national tour.  There will be ancillary resources in the form of family take-home activities, a teacher's guide with classroom activities, and an exhibit website.\r\n",
