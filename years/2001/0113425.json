 "awd_abstract_narration": "Internet is undergoing an overhaul unprecedented in size, diversity, and reach, with profound im-\r\npact in all aspects of our scientific, social, economic and political life through the integration of\r\nnetworks of communication, transportation, entertainment, utilities, and finance. The stability\r\nand robustness of this vital infrastructure demands a rigorous theory to understand the current\r\nprotocols and evolve them to meet emerging challenges. We propose to develop such a theory for\r\nTCP congestion control, and use it to drastically improve the stability, robustness and optimality\r\nof the current protocols.\r\nA key insight is to view congestion control as a distributed asynchronous computation to maxi-\r\nmize aggregate source utility over the Internet; different TCP and active queue management (AQM)\r\nschemes correspond to different utility functions and different algorithms to maximize them.\r\nOur research hastwo components. First, we will develop a new theoretical model of TCP\r\ncongestion control based on duality in optimization and multivariate robust control. The theory will\r\nclarify the role of source algorithms, such as Tahoe, Reno and Vegas, and active queue management,\r\nsuch as DropTail, RED and REM, in the control of networks and establish performance limits of\r\nthe current protocols; it will explain the effect on stability when delay, topology, capacity, and load\r\nscale up; and it will provide conditions under which the feedback stability ofTCP/AQM algorithms\r\nare invariant to these effects. Indeed, such a theory is already emerging from our recent works.\r\nEven in its currently preliminary stage, it already provides a fundamental understanding on some\r\nwidely observed performance and fairness behavior of the current protocols, and uncovers new and\r\nsurprising stability problems. For example, it shows that the current protocols become unstable and\r\nexhibit bifurcation when network capacity increases. Moreover, maintaining stability as capacity\r\nscales up arbitrarily imposes severe constraints on how sources adjust their rates (TCP) and what\r\ncongestion information is fed back (AQM). The current protocol does not satisfy the condition\r\nfor such stability invariance, and hence may be ill suited for future networks where, pulled by\r\napplication demand and pushed by technological advances, the capacity will be large.\r\nThe second component of our research is the design of practical TCP and AQM protocols\r\nbased on the theory, and the development of prototypes and experiments to demonstrate their\r\neffectiveness. We will use the theory to identify the sources of instability in the current protocols\r\nwhen delay, network size, capacity, and traffic load scale up. We will design both enhancements that\r\nincrementally evolve the current protocols, and drastically new protocols that have the strongly\r\nrobust stability property promised by theory. As a concrete application of our algorithms, we will\r\napply them to improve TCP performance over wireless links, both because they are ubiquitous and\r\nbecause they are likely to remain the most important bottlenecks in future networks.\r\n",
