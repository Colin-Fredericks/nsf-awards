This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow the University of Michigan-Dearborn to acquire a variable pressure scanning electron microscope (VP-SEM) and with a energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) to support ongoing research and education in engineering and science. The long-term objective of the college is to establish a world-class manufacturing education base. Significant amounts of experimental data are being generated in currently existing centers at the University. However researchers are seriously limited in their ability to examine the microscopic phenomena dictating physical behavior. A scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive x-ray analytic tool will help overcoming some of the most troublesome bottlenecks in understanding the microscopic phenomena and their impact on physical behavior. This new equipment will benefit a broad range of research involving polymers, metals, composites, electronic materials, geological sciences as well as biology. The university has committed in matching funds to make this facility. A user-fee system will be set up to cover expenses for expendable supplies and maintenance. This equipment will be located within the engineering laboratory building of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. The instrument will be integrated into several courses for education and training of students. Local industry will indirectly benefit.  \r\n\r\nThe University of Michigan-Dearborn is a non-PhD granting institution.
