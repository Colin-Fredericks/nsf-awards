This course is oriented toward\r\nfemale high school students. This program will be offered in the summer of \r\n2001, and will be open to qualified young women who have\r\njust completed their third year of high school. Particular encouragement\r\nwill be given to young women who are members of minority groups; who are\r\nfrom low-income families; and who lack strong role models in science and\r\ntechnology. \r\n\t\r\n     Upon conclusion of the program, the participants will be able to:\r\n- Describe, apply, and analyze principles of molecular biology; \r\n- Use the Internet, Microsoft Office, and Bioinformatics tools; \r\n- Use problem-based learning techniques; \r\n- Distinguish the outcomes of their data entries and manipulations; \r\n- Comprehend Bioinformatics as a field of study; \r\n- Know the roles that women can achieve in science and information \r\n    technology; and \r\n- Value group process as a means of learning .\r\n\t\r\n     In the program, participating young women will live on campus during\r\nthe five-week program period; take courses during the day; participate in\r\nhands-on lab work; work together as members of small teams; benefit from\r\npresentations from and discussions with working professionals in the field;\r\nand travel to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government\r\nlaboratories, and other sites to complement their coursework, and learn how\r\nBioinformatics is used in the scientific field. The program will use the\r\nNSF-funded Biology Student Workbench (BSW) program as the part of the\r\ncurriculum, and the program organizers will work closely with the staff of\r\nthat project in order to implement it appropriately. Using a problem-based\r\nlearning approach, the investigators will teach via student-centered group\r\ninteraction, and will create specific scenarios for student research. \r\n\r\n     The program will be designed to encourage young women to pursue \r\nBioinformatics as a field of study, and ultimately as a profession. Participants \r\nwill strengthen their general computer skills and their ability to use the\r\nInternet as an interactive tool. By working in teams they will increase\r\ntheir problem solving abilities, communication skills and ability to\r\ninteract with others. \r\n\r\n     Upon conclusion of the program, information will be\r\ndisseminated to encourage the replication of the program at other sites\r\nnationwide through presentations and publications, as well as work with\r\nBioQuest and the Biology Student Workbench team. The program organizers\r\nexcept to extend the benefits to other high school students and teachers,\r\nand encourage many young women to enter computer technology, mathematics,\r\nand science fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
