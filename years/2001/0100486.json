 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is directed at topics in several complex variables on\r\nentire holomorphic maps, interpolation problems, and value distribution theory.\r\nThe principle investigator proposes to continue his study on the well-known\r\ntranscendental Bezout problem about the growth of the volume of entire analytic\r\nsets and find sharp estimates on the counting functions of zeros of entire\r\nholomorphic maps. He also proposes to study interpolation problems for weighted spaces of entire functions, one of fundamental and central problems in several complex variables. In particular, he wishes to characterize interpolating\r\nvarieties geometrically, which is closely tied with his study on the Bezout\r\nproblem. In the third direction, he would like to continue his research on value\r\ndistribution theory with a special attention given to the refined  Nevanlinna\r\nsecond fundamental theorem for slowly moving targets and its relations to other\r\nproblems such as uniqueness problems of meromorphic functions and meromorphic solutions of partial differential equations.\r\n\r\nThe above problems are important not just from the point of view of several\r\ncomplex variables, but also from their relations and applications to other\r\nsubjects such as harmonic analysis, transcendental number theory, systems theory and engineering. For instance, many important problems like finding and\r\nrepresenting solutions to partial differential equations or systems of\r\nconvolution equations arising in signal processing, image compression, materials\r\ntesting, etc. are equivalent to interpolation problems for entire functions in\r\nweighted spaces. The proposed research aims at developing and advancing both\r\ntheories and applications for the above areas in several complex variables.\r\n\r\n",
