 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ubiquity of communications technology is becoming more evident\r\nevery day. As the number of customers grows within each market, along\r\nwith their demand for higher and higher data rates, the need to use \r\navailable resources such as power and bandwidth as efficiently as possible \r\nbecomes paramount. Typically a communications system that is operating near \r\ntheoretical limits requires a receiver whose computational complexity\r\nis prohibitively large. To reduce complexity, it is common to linearize\r\na portion of the receiver but this can severely reduce system performance\r\nrelative to theoretical potential. However, there is a class of nonlinear\r\nreceivers known as decision-feedback receivers whose complexity is essentially \r\nno more than that of linear receivers but whose performance is often much \r\ncloser to that of optimal receivers.  This research explores the \r\ndecision-feedback receiver structure as a practical means of realizing \r\nresource-efficient communications systems.  The research is also integrated \r\ninto educational activities at all student levels. Aspects of the research \r\nare purposefully  introduced to undergraduate students in the classroom,\r\nduring summer work programs, and through senior-level thesis advising. \r\nThis prepares them both technically and motivationally to enter industry\r\nor to pursue further studies in graduate school. Graduate students are\r\nprovided an environment conducive to doing quality research in the exciting \r\nfield of communications, whether they choose careers in industry or academia.\r\n\r\nThe technical aspects of the research involve three components. First, it \r\nis determined, at least in principle, how to combine a decision-feedback \r\nreceiver with error-control coding for a variety of important communications \r\nchannels. Then, within these decision-feedback frameworks analytical \r\nrelationships between available resources and system requirements are derived, \r\nand  resource-efficient systems are designed. Lastly, the transition is made \r\nfrom theoretical random codes to actual encoders and decoders that are \r\nsimulated in software.  Together these investigations provide communications \r\nsystems that are  highly efficient in regard to their conservation of \r\nresources, yet with low enough complexity to be amenable to implementation. \r\n\r\n",
