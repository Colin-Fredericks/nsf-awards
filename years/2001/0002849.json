 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling Material Failure in High Strain Rate Problems\r\n\r\nR. C. Batra\r\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University\r\n\r\nAn hyperbolic heat equation along with the equations expressing the\r\nbalance of mass, linear momentum and moment of momentum for\r\nthermoviscoplastic materials will be used to delineate the initiation\r\nand propagation of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) during high strain rate\r\ndeformations of such materials.  An ASB is a narrow region of intense\r\nplastic deformation that usually precedes the ductile failure of most\r\nmetals and some polymers deformed at high strain rates.  The heat\r\ngenerated due to plastic deformations of the material, heat conduction\r\nand thermal stresses induced will be accounted for.   The finite element\r\nmesh will be refined adaptively and the time increment used to integrate\r\nthe coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations obtained by the\r\nGalerkin approximation of the governing equations will be adjusted\r\nadaptively so as to compute the stable solution within the prescribed\r\naccuracy.  The energy dissipation rate within the shear banded material,\r\nrate of energy conducted out of the edges of the band, and the energy\r\nused to raise the temperature of the shear banded material will be\r\ncomputed during the development of the shear band.  Its speed will be\r\nascertained by locating its edges at different times.\r\n\r\nBy modeling an ASB as a singular surface, we will determine its speed of\r\npropagation and compare it with that computed above numerically.  It\r\nshould be noted that an ASB is not a wave in the classical sense and it\r\npropagates edgewise rather than normal to its surface.  This speed will\r\nbe related to the state of deformation of the material within and\r\nadjacent to the edge of the ASB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
