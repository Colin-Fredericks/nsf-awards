The Board on Earth Sciences and Resources is considering whether there is a need for modification to the name and task statement for the USNC/RM.  Consultations with sponsoring agencies and the community are continuing, with the expectation that a committee with a broader scope and task statement will be in existence by the end of 2001.  There is an expectation that a more broadly-based committee will encompass the full range of geological and geotechnical engineering disciplines, and that the new committee will concentrate to a greater extent on producing advisory studies and reports at the request of federal agencies.  This proposal is seeking support for this wide-ranging consultation process.",
