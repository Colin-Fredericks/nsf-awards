 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \r\nGeneral chemistry students at Western Washington University (WWU) were introduced to important quantitative analytical laboratory techniques in the third quarter of the three-quarter general chemistry sequence. This experience was not extensive but it did allow the students to experience and understand quantitative techniques. However, one analytical experience was completely missing for these students. Instruments used in this laboratory allowed only for single analytical measurements. Further, there was no networking capability for the sharing of analytical data. Analysts in modern industrial, environmental, and pharmaceutical laboratories rely on analytical instruments that are configured to provide high sample throughput and are networked to allow wide access to the obtained information. High sample throughput is necessary because of the number of quality control samples which must be analyzed with every \"real\" sample. \r\n\r\nTo introduce our students to Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), we are using two atomic absorption spectrometers equipped with auto-samplers and networked to allow easy sharing and export of data. Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) is an attractive technique to introduce in general chemistry given the simplicity of the principle, the importance of this modern technique, and its ability to measure metal concentrations in real world and environmentally important samples. Auto-sampling allows samples from an entire class to be interspersed with quality control standards and analyzed overnight. Networking allows students to access and transport all the data into a spreadsheet, prepare control charts to judge reliability, and draw professional conclusions regarding samples. The project is adapting a series of experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education so that they reflect this emphasis on QA/QC. \r\n\r\nThe introduction of QA/QC in general chemistry is beneficial to students and faculty in several additional courses and programs. Some students continue in chemistry taking Analytical Chemistry and Instrumental Analysis. Others are environmental chemistry majors in Huxley College of Environmental Studies at WWU. The students in these courses and programs are able to advance their understanding and use of QA/QC given their introduction in general chemistry laboratory. In addition, significant improvement in laboratory experience is realized in these higher-level courses because more advanced instrument use and more sophisticated experiments are being carried out. For use in these advanced courses, one of the AAS units is equipped with a Graphite Furnace unit with auto-sampler. \r\n\r\nThe total number of students affected is over 900 per year. In addition, the project is strengthening the ties between the Chemistry Department in the College of Arts and Sciences at WWU and the Environmental Chemistry Program at Huxley College of Environmental Studies at WWU. \r\n\r\n",
