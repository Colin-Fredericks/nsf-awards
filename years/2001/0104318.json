The goal of \r\nthis is to solve central problems in homotopy theory involving classifying spaces, as well as to discover new relations\r\nto problems in group theory and representation theory. \r\nA further goal is to produce results in related fields \r\nsuch as in the theory of group actions, equivariant \r\ncohomology, and group cohomology. The project centers\r\naround developing the homotopy theoretic group theory \r\nof the classifying space BG, or rather of its p-completion. \r\nThis involves examining the induction theory, p-local theory, representation theory as well as the more general actions \r\nof these objects. The methods used come from modern unstable \r\nhomotopy theory, developed since the solution of the \r\nSullivan conjecture, combined with ideas and techniques \r\nfrom modern group theory.\r\n\r\nForming the classifying space BG of a group of \r\nsymmetries G is a way of geometrically or topologically \r\nencoding the \"symmetries\" present in G. Geometric spaces \r\nof this form and generalizations thereof are ubiquitous \r\nin topology, and hence form an important class of \r\nspaces to study.  Furthermore, the less rigid structure \r\nof the classifying space BG, compared to that of\r\nthe group G, makes certain techniques available in \r\nthe study of the former which were not available when \r\ndealing with the later directly. Hence, studying the group\r\ntheory of BG provides an interesting and useful way of \r\nstudying the original group G.\r\n",
