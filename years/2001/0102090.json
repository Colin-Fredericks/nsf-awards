 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2001.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. \r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Using the Tools of Molecular Biology and Chemistry to Characterize Pigment Biosynthesis in the Chestnut Blight Fungus.\"  The goal of this research is to analyze the pathway for production of polyketide pigments in the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica.  Genes required for biosynthesis of emodin and other related anthraquinone compounds are being cloned, sequenced, and characterized from an ordered cosmid library and by PCR amplification of PKS genes.  These approaches will permit analysis of genetic diversity within a conserved pathway present in numerous fungi and plants.\r\n",
