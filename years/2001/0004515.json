 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nThe main objective of the proposed research is to develop novel\r\nSoftware-Implemented Fault Tolerance (SIFT) techniques for increasing\r\nthe dependability of the distributed and networked environments based on\r\nCOTS.\r\nThe issues of dependability will be addressed by the design and\r\nimplementation of (SIFT), dynamic reconfiguration in distributed systems\r\nand high-speed computer networks. Novel fast dynamic reconfiguration\r\ntechniques for various irregular network topologies will be developed and\r\nanalyzed. An analytical method is proposed for evaluating the reliability\r\nimprovement by using  SIFT for any size of distributed systems .\r\nThe  goal of this research  is to identify and develop new key building\r\nblocks\r\nfor reliable distributed systems built with inexpensive off-the shelf\r\ncomponents. The platform consists of computing nodes connected via\r\nmultiple interfaces to networks configured in fault-tolerant topologies.\r\nThus, the research community and a large number of users will have the\r\nopportunity  to build reliable distributed systems based on COTS in a user\r\ntransparent way.The goal will be to achieve a high reconfiguration rate\r\nand a small recomputation overhead in the presence of faults in the\r\ndistributed\r\nsystems and high-speed computer networks in a way transparent to the user,\r\nwhich will provide a high dependability.\r\nThis research project will have a positive impact on a large community\r\nimplementing applications in distributed and network environments such as\r\n: e-commerce, telepresence, telemedicine, Internet data centers,\r\ndistributed applications running concurrently across",
