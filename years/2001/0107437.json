The purpose of this conference is to examine fundamental issues of the corrosion process in order to understand and improve material performance in high-temperature applications. The conference includes the following sessions whose topics are considered timely for discussion and where significant recent developments have been made: 1. Effect of Water Vapor; 2. Fundamentals of the Oxide/Metal Interface; 3. Initial Stage Oxidation; 4. Bond Coat Oxidation; 5. Stresses in Scales and Coatings; 6. Stresses and Scale Failure; 7. High Temperature Coatings; 8. Corrosion in Aggressive Industrial Environments; and 9. Oxide Scales in Bio-Materials.  Nine sections are planned for the conference, each led by a scientist familiar with the subject area to facilitate discussions. Speakers are invited by the chair for their expertise and recent progress in areas deemed to be at the frontiers of science. Ample time is allowed after each presentation for extensive discussions between the speaker and the audience. Graduate students have been encouraged to attend and present posters. The poster sessions further broaden the program and create more opportunities for the exchange of ideas. The award is used to support graduate students so that they can have an opportunity to meet and interact with experts in their field in this unique environment.\r\n%%%\r\nThe Gordon Research Conferences were established with the aim of bringing together scientists in a particular area and permit them to discuss in depth all aspects of the most recent advances in the field and to stimulate new directions for future research. This goal is met today by the selection of highly qualified speakers with a meeting format that promotes interactions and discussions.\r\n***",
