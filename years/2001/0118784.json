 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of efficient wireless communication systems relies on a\r\ndeep understanding of the basic characteristics of the underlying\r\nchannel.  The most fundamental and unique characteristic of wireless\r\nchannels is the random time-variation of the channel strengths, a\r\nphenomenon known as fading.  Communication over fading channels has\r\nbeen a topic of study since the 60's.  A very different view of the\r\nproblem, however, emerges from recent research.  The traditional view\r\nof fading is that it is a source of unreliability that has to be\r\ncompensated for by various diversity techniques.  The modern view is\r\nmuch more\r\npowerful and considers fading as a source of randomization from nature\r\nthat can be exploited to get very significant capacity boost.\r\n\r\nThe research project addresses several key problems within this\r\nmodern paradigm. They will be centered around two areas: 1)\r\nopportunistic communication : the dynamic rate and power allocation\r\nover the dimensions of time, frequency, antennas and users\r\nso that transmission is done when and where the channel is strong;\r\n2) multi-antenna communication: the use of  multiple transmit and\r\nreceive antennas to increase the number of degrees of freedom available\r\nfor communication in richly scattered fading environments. The issues\r\nstudied are focused on how the random fading can be exploited even in\r\nthe face of\r\nchannel uncertainty, and the interplay between the modern and\r\ntraditional views of channel fading.\r\n\r\n",
