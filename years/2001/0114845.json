 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference of the recently formed Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology is one of an annual series.  The relatively small meeting is strongly interdisciplinary, with approaches ranging from molecular biology in the lab to behavior in natural environments.  This scope gives an integrated view of the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology, and the hormonal mechanisms that regulate behavior.  The small size promotes interactions between attendees, fostering active discussions about research outside the formal talks.  About a third of the 600 SBN members are student members, so there is substantial impact of this annual conference on advancing the field by promoting interactions among young investigators.  This year is the first meeting in the West, to help balance regional representation, and it includes a new initiative to publish student abstracts and to get the best student posters into manuscripts for publication in a major journal.  A special panel on 'Balancing Career and Family: Not for Women Only' also will discuss issues important to young investigators.\r\n     The promotion of students to attend this conference will have a substantial impact on their careers by exposing them to the latest discoveries and approaches, and making more senior investigators aware of their individual research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
