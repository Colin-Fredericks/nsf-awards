 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \r\nAs environmental awareness has grown, modern chemical research and development has increasingly focused on the discovery of methods for environmentally benign chemical synthesis and processing (\"Green Chemistry\"). Through this project, educational materials are being developed which bring modern green chemical approaches, techniques, and thought processes to the large-enrollment undergraduate organic chemistry teaching laboratory. With the extensive involvement of undergraduate students at the University of Oregon and at selected institutions across the country, new experiments teaching the essentials of practical organic chemistry, complementing the content of typical organic chemistry lecture courses, and illustrating the principles of green chemistry, are being devised and tested. These materials will be disseminated internationally through a variety of vehicles, including a published green organic chemistry laboratory textbook, workshops for teachers from all levels of educational institutions (K-12, community college, four-year college, and university), a Web-centered database of green chemical experiments, and versatile complementary materials for organic chemistry lecture courses. Both development and evaluation of experiments, as well as evaluation of written pedagogical materials, are being assisted through collaborative arrangements with four-year colleges, community colleges, and high schools. An international panel has been organized to provide periodic advisory input. The project is funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education within the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, with significant co-funding from the Chemistry Division within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
