 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nebraska EPSCoR, in cooperation and collaboration with research universities in\r\nthe state of Nebraska, seeks to build research infrastructures in several areas of\r\ninformatics. The effort will be directed at three primary areas that are consistent\r\nwith the Nebraska EPSCoR Strategic plan as well as plans and strategic\r\ndirections of the participating universities including: (1) development of wired and\r\nwireless network technologies that will more effectively link ongoing inter-campus\r\nefforts within a secure distributed information infrastructure, (2) development of a\r\ntest-bed to research next generation Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\r\nsystems architectures that are viable and efficient for e-commerce through\r\ncollaboration with the private sector, (3) development of inter-campus capabilities\r\nin newly emerging research areas of bio-informatics and computational biology.\r\nThe proposed infrastructure initiative in informatics complements the developing\r\ninformation technology industry in the state, involves scientists and engineers\r\nfrom four university campuses (University of Nebraska, Lincoln (UNL), University\r\nof Nebraska Medical Center, University of Nebraska, Omaha (UNO), and\r\nCreighton University. It provides for an integrated plan to accomplish goals that\r\nare considered crucial for establishing competitiveness in computational-based\r\ninformatics research within the state of Nebraska. In addition to the major\r\ndevelopment effort for the interdisciplinary informatics infrastructures, the\r\nproposed project will greatly enhance the computational capabilities available to\r\na broad range of fields of research and instruction.\r\nAdditional components of the project will support educational activities and\r\nresearch experiences for underrepresented groups, internships for science and\r\ntechnology students to work in private industry, a small grants program for faculty\r\nearly in their careers, technical assistance and faculty travel, and outreach to\r\nother Nebraska colleges and universities.\r\n",
