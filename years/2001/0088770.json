 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Systems Science (40)\r\n\r\nMultidisciplinary environmental problems associated with urban/suburban growth are\r\nincreasingly being addressed at a watershed-integrated level. Consistent with this theme, the\r\nproposed project involves undergraduate students using a comprehensive network of automated water quantity and water quality instrumentation to investigate environmental impacts in a rapidly-developing watershed (the Bushkill Creek Watershed) adjacent to campus. Hydrologic and chemical data are collected and analyzed as part of exercises within existing engineering and geoscience courses and undergraduate research and honors theses. These exercises enhance our students' abilities to critically evaluate a variety of interdependent watershed-based processes that may affect environmental quality. The project is a cooperative effort among faculty from engineering and the geological sciences; however, other faculty teaching courses with environmental content have an interest in using the facilities and the databases generated by the project. \r\n\r\nThe general objectives of the project are: to provide relevant hands-on data collection\r\nand analysis experiences for undergraduates in science and engineering, to establish a central\r\ntheme of assessment and management of a rapidly developing watershed for a variety of\r\ncurriculum projects across campus, to develop a detailed digital database on hydrologic impacts of land use in the watershed, and to disseminate results through the internet, conference presentations, scholarly publications, and local community meetings.\r\n\r\nThe project is patterned after similar watershed-based curriculum projects at a number of\r\nsmall colleges and universities in the northeast U.S. (Hluchny 1997, 1998; Heins and Walker,\r\n1998; Woltemade and Blewett, 1999; Salvage and Graney, 1999, 2000). Unique to this project are: (1) the comprehensive monitoring network and full watershed scale (200 km 2 ); (2) strong geologic and land use contrasts, and rapid development within the basin; (3) cooperation and collaboration between engineering and geological science students and faculty; (4) emphasis on enhancing undergraduate education in practical multidisciplinary issues such as watershed-based planning and land use decisions, and storm water management policy; and (5) the high level of involvement of the local community and local government in watershed management.\r\n\r\nReferences Cited\r\n\r\nHluchy, M., 1997.
