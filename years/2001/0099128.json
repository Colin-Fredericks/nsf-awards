 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first workshop of a planned workshop series. Its objective is to stimulate and focus interest in the emerging area of data management for context-aware, mobile computing environments. As wireless bandwidth becomes more widely available, the communication infrastructure will be heavily wireless oriented. It will provide adaptive connectivity among immobile systems and portable devices such as cell phones, laptops, and other such future devices. Under this platform the computing will begin to migrate away from the desktop toward these devices consequently it will become necessary to managed data more carefully.  Industry and academia recognized wireless devices as an important area for development, however, the problems of data management have not been addressed in a coordinated manner. This workshop aims to fill this gap by providing a forum for leading researchers from both industry and academia in the areas of infomation management, wireless networking, communications and signal processing systems to set the research agenda for the future.  This workshop will lead to a more cohesive research community and will result in a quicker development and adoption of technologies for this new area. It will facilitate the development of new standards and will provide the synergy necessary for the US technical community to become a dominant player in this field.  The results of the workshop will be made available online through web site (http://www.cstp.umkc.edu/nsfmobile/wshop.html/ or http://www.cs.brown.edu/nsfmobile/wshop.html/) and will be reported in periodicals (e.g., ACM and IEEE) and relevant conferences, workshops or meetings.",
