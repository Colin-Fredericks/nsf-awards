 "awd_abstract_narration": "0089809.  Earl Werner.  Interactions multiple species create and sustain natural communities.  Trophic cascades, species diversity, and community vulnerability to exotic invaders can be indirectly influenced by predator-prey interactions.  This project builds upon and extends a substantial database gathered on the interactions between odonate predators (Anax and Tramea), bullfrog and green frog tadpole prey, and the detritus/periphyton resources the tadpoles rely on.  Each species (e.g., predator, prey, parasite) plays a complex role in food webs, and exhibits behaviors that are influenced by interactions with the environment, and with other species in the community.  Understanding these interactions is one of the most fundamental objectives in ecology.  For example, competition between predators can affect the traits and behaviors of prey, such as prey foraging rates.  Such predator-mediated modifications of prey feeding behaviors can have short and long-term effects on food web dynamics.  To investigate these community interactions, this project will use field experiments and modeling to test the central theory that phenotypic variation in trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) can have profound and unexpected effects on the community. This project has strong theoretical and empirical components and blends modeling with hypothesis testing at multiple temporal and spatial scales.  Although this work is focused on how predators affect food webs, the underlying principles are applicable for investigating diverse types of functional relationships between species. \r\n\r\n",
