 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is Information Technology Research award to develop an innovative approach by which scientists and engineers can gain access to remote instruments and data sources.  This capability enables more general access to remote instrumentation that can be used for training and education without the unnecessary burden of placing students or researchers in the field.  The need for such a mechanism is fundamental as each instrument deployed to a remote field site contends with similar issues of remote data storage, retrieval, transport, and control.  The investigators will develop an integrated set of IT tools that will move data to and from the remote field site, irrespective of the communications link, in a reliable and robust manner.  It will also quickly facilitate the exchange of data among researchers, provide data storage, and publish web-based displays.  The approach is founded on an Internet-based system call Network New Transport Protocol (NNTP) that noninvasively retrieves data from instruments over a variety of communication links.  The system delivers data from the remote instrument to the end user's home institution while transparently handling network outages and low-bandwidth situations.  These capabilities enhance the science by notifying researchers of unique and interesting events, allowing the researcher to modify their instruments to record data optimally, providing more ready access to other instrument users, and working quickly with other researchers during real-time events.  For engineering activities, the data transport service would serve to check the health and status of the instruments continuously and enable instrument control.  This enabling technology would then facilitate student training and education within classroom and laboratory environments.",
