 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMicro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) have grown from scientific speculation to\r\ncommercial success. Still, a number of technical challenges remain which cannot be\r\naddressed by the private sector. One of these challenges is the integration of the power\r\nsupply into the MEMS device. It is a further challenge to build the power source, using\r\nonly the processing technology that was used to build the micromechanical elements and\r\nthe electronic elements of the device. We address the technical issue of obtaining energy\r\nfrom the environment to power MEMS devices, rather than powering the device through\r\nexternal batteries or power supplies. Examples from horology provide inspiration for\r\nscavenging both mechanical motion and thermal energy. While a number of energy\r\nscavenging schemes based on capturing vibration have been proposed, we intend to take\r\nadvantage of the high potential energy densities of thermal systems. We will develop\r\nscaling and design methods for thermally scavenged systems, and demonstrate a\r\nmechanical micromachine actuated by changes in ambient temperature. This technology\r\nmay be used in the future development of autonomous microrobots or microsatellites.\r\nA problem facing higher education and high technology industry is the dearth of students\r\nand graduates. This is an especially acute problem for interdisciplinary fields such as\r\nMEMS. Upper-division students require cross-disciplinary education to become skilled\r\ncontributors to MEMS research, and there are not enough upper-division students. We\r\ntherefore must attract more students into the technical fields. The NSF CAREER\r\nprogram leverages on existing curriculum development efforts by turning curriculum\r\ndevelopment into science/engineering outreach. Project-based courses will have their\r\nfinal presentations in secondary schools, where high school students will have the\r\nopportunity to evaluate engineering projects. Similarly, we will develop sections of\r\nproject-based engineering courses targeted for science teachers, with the objective of\r\nintegrating teachers into engineering development teams. New courses will be\r\nmodularized, so that topics can be offered as short courses or tutorials, and published\r\nwith distance education technology. NSF funding will enable students to actually\r\nfabricate and test the designs their teams have designed and simulated through the NNUN\r\nor other multi-user foundries.\r\nThe research results, and the research program needs, are intertwined with the\r\neducational development. Research findings and educational assessments will be used to\r\nrevise and refine curriculum development and teaching methods. Similarly, project ideas\r\nfor the courses will be drawn from the research problems.\r\nAll of these efforts are leveraged through existing programs designed for outreach to\r\ndisadvantaged and underrepresented groups in the sciences at the University of New\r\nMexico and in New Mexico.\r\n\r\n",
