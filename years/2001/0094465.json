 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to support  two workshops on the important topic of Secure Campus Infrastructures.  Security in general and secure campus systems in particular is a topic that has been discussed for years.  It is now becoming critical to information flow into, across,  and out of the campus network infrastructure that some consensus be reached on some security solutions and a basic implementation strategy be defined and executed.  The goal of the workshop will be to combine information dissemination with design and practice collaboration to meet the following objectives:  (1)  To facilitate communication between schools at the forefront of implementing these new technologies with those schools in the beginning or planning stages, (2) To engage in dialogue leading to a consensus of an initial set of best practices and policies in the design and development of authentication and authorization services, and (3) To facilitate communication with content providers of core and complementary academic and research resources to ensure interoperability and usage of leading resources and applications.",
