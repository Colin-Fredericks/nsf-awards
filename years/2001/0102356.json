 "awd_abstract_narration": "0102356\r\nBeale\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is concerned with the development of improved \r\nmethods for computing singular or nearly singular integrals, and with \r\napplications to numerical methods for simulating fluid flow with moving \r\nboundaries.  In many scientific problems, quantities of interest can be \r\nwritten in terms of integrals such as a double layer potential on a \r\nboundary. When such an integral is evaluated near the boundary, usual \r\nquadrature rules are inaccurate because of large derivatives in the \r\nintegrand. It is desirable to calculate such values in a way that is simple \r\nand efficient, without requiring a special choice of quadrature points. The \r\npresent approach uses regularization of the singularity and a standard \r\nquadrature rule, followed by local corrections derived from asymptotic \r\nanalysis.  This technique will be used to design an alternate version of the \r\nimmersed boundary method of C. Peskin, a computational method which \r\nhas been used to model various biological processes. In this method \r\nviscous, incompressible fluid is influenced by a membrane or interface \r\nwhich exerts a force on the fluid.  In two dimensions, the force can be \r\nexpressed in terms of nearly singular integrals to which the proposed \r\napproach can be applied.  It is hoped that this modification will extend the \r\nusefulness of the immersed boundary method in realistic applications.  \r\nApplication may also be made to methods for computing flow with \r\nmoving boundaries separating different fluids.  The technique for nearly \r\nsingular integrals will be extended to surface integrals in three-space, \r\ngeneralizing work already done for marker points on surfaces.  Related \r\nwork will concern interfaces in inviscid, potential flow using improved \r\nregularizations of boundary integrals.\r\n\r\nMany scientific processes involve moving boundaries, for example, the \r\nboundary of a drop of one fluid moving through another, or a membrane in \r\nliving tissue.  Numerical models of such processes encounter special \r\ndifficulties, since it is simplest to compute quantities at a set of points \r\nwhich are regularly spaced and unchanging.  There are presently several \r\nnumerical approaches which avoid changing fundamentally the way the \r\nregion is approximated at each new time. In some cases important \r\nquantities can be written as integrals over boundaries.  These integrals \r\narise as solutions of differential equations and are usually singular, or \r\nnearly singular; that is, large values appear, representing the strong \r\ninteraction of nearby points, as in the inverse square law of gravity.  \r\nSpecial techniques are needed to calculate such integrals accurately and \r\nefficiently.  This proposal is concerned with the development and \r\napplication of methods of this type.  The use of integral representations to \r\nmodify the design of existing methods for computing fluid motion with \r\nmoving boundaries might improve the ability of these numerical methods \r\nto make reliable predictions.\r\n",
