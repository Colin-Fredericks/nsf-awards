 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for a workshop that will introduce decision theory to engineering design faculty.  The goals of the workshop are to acquaint engineering faculty with the mathematics of decision theory, to ground them in the mathematics necessary to correctly apply decision theory to engineering design and other decision making processes in engineering, and to provide an exportable version of the workshop that will enable the workshop to have a broader impact than just for the faculty who can attend.  The workshop will be conducted in a tutorial fashion, with invited experts representing mathematics, economics and the decision sciences, and will provide ample time for interaction between the attending faculty and the experts.  Topics that will be covered include decision making under uncertainty, decision procedures, game theory, probability theory and elements of engineering microeconomics appropriate to engineering design.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the outcome of this workshop will be a heightened awareness of the principles of decision theory and its applications to engineering.  This will likely affect the entirety of engineering education and practice, and will ultimately result in improved decision making across all engineering fields.",
