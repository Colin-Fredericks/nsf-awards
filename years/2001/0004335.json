 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Bureau of the Census enters into a partnership with a Consortium. The new data center is called The Chicago Research Data Center (Chicago RDC) and would be housed in a secure site at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in downtown Chicago. The member institutions of the Consortium have pledged space, administrative support, and funding of $1,063,000 for the first three years of the Center conditional on support from the National Science Foundation (NSF). We propose that NSF provide an additional $300,000 over three years to cover the remaining costs of establishing and operating the Center.\r\n\r\nThis award helps cover the costs of establishing and operating The Chicago Research Data Center (Chicago RDC).  The Chicago RDC was established through a partnership between the U.S. Bureau of Census and a Consortium consisting of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to establish a Research Data Center in Chicago.  The Chicago RDC is housed in a secure site at the Federal Reserve Bank in downtown Chicago.  The member institutions of the Consortium have pledged space, and administrative support and most of the funding necessary to establish and run the center.   The extremely large and accomplished research community that is within easy commuting distance of the proposed location ensures the Center's high quality research output and long-term viability. In addition to important substantive results, the projects undertaken by these researchers should make substantial improvements in Census Bureau data programs. Furthermore, the Chicago Fed and other member institutions have a long track record in dealing with confidential data.  The Chicago RDC is positioned to attract large numbers of high-quality projects while adhering to the strict standards of confidentiality required of an RDC.  These projects include research on energy and the environment; corporate finance; labor markets; crime; health and childcare; and survey methods.\r\n",
