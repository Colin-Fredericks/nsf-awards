 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59) \r\n\r\r\nAn overview of solid waste management is an important component of most undergraduate civil and environmental engineering curriculum. The solid waste field encompasses a wide range of principles derived from mechanical engineering, economics, optimization, chemistry, mathematics, hydraulics, hydrology, geotechnical engineering, etc. Traditionally it is taught using a combination of lectures, homework exercises, engineering design experiences, and the very occasional field trip. However, the concepts involved are best grasped through actual experience with the processes. \r\n\r\nThis project is enhancing learning of engineering principles and fundamentals through the development of supplementary electronic/digital teaching materials. Specifically, we are developing a compact disc containing video and audio clips, slides and other visual aids demonstrating management strategies for municipal solid waste, and providing students with hands-on learning experiences responsive to diverse learning styles. In addition, we have formed a collaboration among the College of Engineering and Computer Science, College of Education, and K-12 at-risk schools to engage students in learning about MSW management.\r\n\r\nThe compact disk will also be made available to engineering programs adopting a new text, Solid Waste Engineering, through a distribution plan to be arranged with Brooks/Cole, Inc. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
