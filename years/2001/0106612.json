The Chapman Conference is entitled \"State-of-the-art in hillslope hydrology,\" and will occur in October, 2001.  It is already approved by AGU and cosponsored by the Hydrology and Biogeoscience Sections.  This conference will focus on a review and assessment of our current knowledge in hillslope hydrology, with an emphasis on the processes by which water enters and moves through hillslope systems and into a receiving stream.  Major subtopics for which we will solicit papers will include mechanisms and patterns of water input and output from hillslopes, the distribution and dynamics of flowpaths, spatial patterns of surface and subsurface soil moisture and soil hydraulic properties, methods of measurement or inference of these processes and states, and their representation in models. This focus has important implications for the formation of hillslope and watershed hydrographs at the storm to seasonal time scale, the transformation and export of sediment and chemical load to streams, the distribution and dynamics of the vegetation canopy, and land/atmosphere interactions.  The conference will bring together internationally recognized researchers in the field with younger scientists and students and will promote an extensive exchange of research finding, outstanding questions and developing theories and techniques.  The conference format will include invited plenary presentations in the morning, followed by poster sessions and moderated discussion in the afternoons, and an additional plenary talk and discussion in the evening.  Sufficient free time during the afternoon will be reserved to allow both recreational activity and smaller group discussion.  One day will be devoted to a field trip to the HJ Andrews Experimental Watershed for brief presentations and a half day field trip revolving hillslope hydrology related research at the site.  Peer review research papers will be solicited for publications of the proceedings, either as an AGU Monograph or as a special issues of Water Resources Research.\r\n",
