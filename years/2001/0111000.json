 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leucine zippers are formed when a pair of short alpha -helices in a pair of protein molecules bind in a\r\nconfiguration called a coiled coil. Leucine zippers and other coiled coils are abundant in nature;\r\nthey are found in about 10% of all proteins encoded in typical genomes, including many important\r\ntranscription factors. The project addresses two complementary questions about leucine zippers.\r\nFirst, how do the subunit interactions in the context of a specific leucine zipper from the yeast\r\ntranscription factor GCN4, control the specificity and stability of zipper assembly. Different\r\ninteractions will be engineered into the GCN4 leucine zipper and characterized by biophysical\r\nassays including equilibrium and stopped-flow circular dichroism, sedimentation equilibrium, and\r\nX-ray crystallography. In addition, new biophysical assays for leucine zipper assembly will be\r\nimplemented based on analytical ultracentrifugation and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.\r\nSecond, the project will explore the diversity of coiled coils in a whole genome. Using powerful\r\ngenetic methods, the project will examine the specificity of interactions among hundreds of\r\nnaturally occurring, predicted coiled-coils from the yeast genome that must coexist in the same cell.\r\nBecause of their small size and simple, repetitive structures, leucine zippers have provided useful\r\nmodels for studying general issues in how proteins fold. By combining research on specific\r\ninteractions with genome-wide studies of the properties of many zippers, this project will test\r\nwhether our understanding of protein foldin is sufficient to illuminate the biology of a large and\r\nwidely distributed class of important proteins.",
