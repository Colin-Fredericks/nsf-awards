Miller, Department of Metallurgical Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah and Dr. Ahmed Yehia, Mineral Benficiation Department, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute, Helwan, Cairo, Egypt.  They plan to study the fundamental aspects of wastepaper deinking in the presence of modern surfactants, fatty alcohol ethoxylates.  The adsorption of these compounds on the surfaces involved in wastepaper processing will be studied at the molecular scale using soft-contact atomic force microscopy.  Understanding of interaction forces between wastepaper components in the presence of fatty alcohol ethoxylates, necessary for further improvement in deinking technology, will be achieved by colloidal probe atomic force microscopy study.  These results will be correlated with agglomeration tests, microcolumn flotation and bench-scale flotation of wastepaper pulp in a Denver-type cell.  Also the relationship between molecular structure of the fatty alcohol ethoxylates and the conditions necessary for optimization of industrial deinking processes will be established.\r\n\r\nScope: The project supports collaboration between two very active groups in the area of materials processing and beneficiation.  The University of Utah team is well qualified and has high-tech instrumentation facilities that are needed for the project, while the Egyptian team will conduct flotation experiments using model components and real wastepaper pulp, as well as analysis of fiber brightness, recovery and yield during flotation.  Dr. Yehia also has the means to test the developed technology in the industrial setting in Egypt.   The results will be helpful in dealing with the problem of wastepaper.  It is likely to have more economic impact in countries with few pulp resources such as Egypt.  The proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. \r\n",
