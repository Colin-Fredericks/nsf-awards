The most striking examples are constructed\r\non suitable spheres, where one of the members of an isospectral pair\r\nis a homogeneous metric, while the other is locally inhomogeneous. \r\nThis demonstrates the surprising fact that no information about the \r\nisometries is encoded in the spectrum of the Laplacian acting on functions. \r\nThese investigations also extend to the Laplacian spectrum of forms. \r\nRelated questions are also considered. One of them is construction of \r\nBrownian-motion-equivalent spaces (Isothermal Metrics). \r\nThis equivalence relation is much stronger then the isospectrality property,\r\n yet it does not determine the local geometry. The same statement is true \r\nregarding the metrics with equivalent density functions (Isodasyc Metrics).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old argument between Relativity and Quantum Physics is easily discovered \r\nin the depth of these questions. In Relativity, the whole Physics is derived \r\nfrom a curved space. Actually, Physics is identified with the complete Geometry \r\nof this curved space. Einstein put his idea this way: \"There is no such thing as \r\nPhysics. Everything is Geometry.\" Contrary to Relativity, the Quantum Physics \r\nuses only particular aspects of Geometry such as the spectra of several operators \r\nor the Brownian Motion defined by a metric space. Einstein suggested, however, \r\nthat the Brownian Motion may determine the complete local geometry.  \r\nThis reflects the extent of the confusion about the\r\nfollowing question: \"How much Geometry is used by the Quantum Physics?\"\r\nThe proposed investigations demonstrate, for the first time, how little\r\ninformation about Geometry is used by Quantum Physics. For instance,\r\nQuantum Physics completely ignores the isometries of the spaces, \r\nwhich otherwise form the central piece of a theory developed in Geometry. \r\n \r\n",
