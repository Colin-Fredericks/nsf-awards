 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: The Last of First: Completing Our View of the Radio Universe\"\r\nAST-0098355\r\n\r\n\r\nA ten-year program to use the world's most powerful radio telescope to provide\r\nFaint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) is nearing its goal of mapping the\r\nentire northern sky outside the Milky Way with a resolution and sensitivity that exceed previous surveys by a factor of fifty or more. Over three-quarters of\r\na million radio emitters have been detected to date, ranging from nearby active\r\nstars to the most distant quasars known. The images and source catalogs are all\r\navailable on the World-Wide Web, and have been used to date by more than\r\nthree hundred astronomers.\r\n\r\nThe FIRST team is pursuing a number of major projects with this massive new\r\ndatabase. Matching the radio catalog to the near-infrared sources cataloged\r\nby the 2MASS survey, they have discovered a number of highly obscured quasars --\r\nobjects emitting a thousand times the energy of the whole Milky Way from a tiny\r\nregion in a distant galaxy core that is so dust-ridden that no visible\r\nlight escapes.  Another major project is using the entire set of radio images to attempt to\r\ndetermine the distribution of the mysterious dark matter in the Universe.\r\nRecognizing Einstein's dictum that mass bends light, they look for the slight\r\ndistortions in the shapes of distant radio galaxies caused by the passage of\r\ntheir radio waves through the mass distribution of the intervening space.\r\nWhile optical astronomers have been conducting such \"weak lensing\" experiments\r\non patches of sky the size of the full moon and smaller, this research will study the\r\nclumpiness of the dark matter on scales ten to one hundred times larger,\r\nthus making a direct connection between the galaxy distribution in the local \r\nUniverse and the fluctuations seen in the cosmic background radiation which\r\ntells us the distribution of matter at the earliest times.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
