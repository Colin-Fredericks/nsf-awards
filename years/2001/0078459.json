 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the development of a prototype flywheel energy storage system (FESS) utilizing the innovative passive, non-contacting bearing developed in the Phase I project.  This new type of passive magnetic support and damping (PMSD) system consists of integrated stiffness and damping elements in a configuration that overcomes the most significant problems of previous systems.  The new bearing technology will result in a more efficient, more reliable, and less expensive FESS than is currently available.  The resulting FESS will facilitate the use of alternative energy systems in remote and/or hostile environments.  Phase II efforts will focus on 2 objectives: (1) The refinement and experimental validation of design equations predictive of PMSD performance; and (2) The development, installation, and testing of PMSD systems in a prototype FESS.  The FESS system for the prototype will be a commercial unit provided by the commercialization partner, and modified to accommodate the new technology.  The partner currently manufactures FESS for commercial power quality and uninterruptible power supplies applications.  Follow-on funding commitments and other agreements have been secured from the Alaska Science and Technology Foundation and from the commercialization partner to pursue additional technical work and for Phase III commercialization.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to providing storage for alternative energy systems, there are numerous commercial applications for FESS incorporating the PMSD technology including utility load leveling and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).  The commercialization partner expects that the combination of technical and cost advantages demonstrated in Phase I would enable rapid market acceptance and encourage application of FESS in new markets.  The PMSD technology is also applicable to turbo-molecular pumps (TMPs).  These are used in the manufacture of silicon chips and in scientific instrumentation requiring high vacuums.  Predicted market penetration into these areas is in excess of 18,000 units per year by 2005 and in excess of 30,000 units per year by 2009. \r\n",
