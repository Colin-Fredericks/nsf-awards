 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sonya Franklin, Department of Chemistry, University of Iowa, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program, Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, through a Career Award for her work on the design of artificial endonucleases as biological probes of gene regulation and transcription that will lead to an understanding of embryonic developmental processes. Specifically, small metalloproteins, chimeras of the Ca-binding EF-Hand motif, and the helix-turn-helix motif of homeodomain transcription factors will be designed as selective and tunable endonucleases. In the educational area, a new graduate level bioinorganic special topics course will be developed, modern bioinorganic experiments will be incorporated in upper-level undergraduate laboratory courses, and freshman and sophomore students will be exposed to a survey of bioinorganic chemistry.\r\n\r\nExploiting the well-established recognition of DNA-binding proteins to deliver hydrolytic metals for site-specific cleavage will have significant and broad-reaching potential in molecular biochemistry. Students will gain experience with oral and written presentation of literature and research topics in group meetings and at scientific conferences; bioinorganic chemistry will be the basis to expose students to lateral thinking, to thoughtful analysis, to gain confidence in problem solving, and to improve communication skills.",
