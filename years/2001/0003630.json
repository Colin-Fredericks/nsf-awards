 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Independence Seaport Museum will create \"Boat Building:  Art and Science,\" a 3,000-square foot permanent exhibit that is designed to educate visitors about the science of boat building and design.  Concepts such as buoyancy, water displacement, turbulence and drag will be explored through interactives, maritime artifacts, models and oral histories of tradesmen.  By using the principles identified by the Family Science Learning Research Project of the Philadelphia/Camden Informal Science Education Collaborative (PISEC), the exhibit will be user-friendly for families with young children.  Visitor workstation topics may include boat building, floating, buoyancy, sails, wind and boat shape.  Visitors will use science processes while learning through open-ended play and exploration.  Creative programs for families and school groups, as well as curriculum materials will support the exhibit.  A website and technical training manual will also be produced.  Four phases of evaluation are planned, and include front-end analysis which will incorporate focus groups with children ages 7-12, and formative evaluation using prototypes of interactives.  Remedial evaluation will be carried out once the exhibit opens, and summative evaluation will use tracking and exit interviews to assess learning and understanding.  The estimated annual audience of over 130,000 visitors will be expanded by replicating and traveling various components to other maritime museums in partnership with the Association of Science and Technology Centers.  Evaluation of traveling components will also be undertaken to determine if they present an appropriate model for maritime-based exhibits.\r\n\r\n",
