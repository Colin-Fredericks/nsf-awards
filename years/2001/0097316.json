 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0097316\r\n\r\nA major achievement of the last decade of oceanic observations by the Joint Global Ocean Flux  Study (JGOFS) and World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) has been the dramatic improvement in  our ability to use observations to estimate the oceanic inventory of anthropogenic carbon. This  improvement has been driven both by increased data and by the development of improved techniques for  analyzing the observations. An important role has been played by the rapid development of ocean general  circulation models that are now being used routinely to do tracer simulations and provide estimates of  anthropogenic carbon uptake. However, despite the great progress that has been made, there remain many  important issues that need to be resolved.\r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers at Princeton University will conduct model sensitivity studies to examine several hypotheses for model  differences.  They would make use of measurements from the JGOFS and WOCE surveys to  determine which model gives a more realistic simulation, and to improve estimates of the oceanic uptake  and storage of anthropogenic CO2, bomb radiocarbon, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC).  The goal is to advance both the  development of reliable ocean models and the estimation of oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from  observations with the aim of improving estimates of the oceanic carbon sink and our understanding of the  ocean carbon cycle.   First, the team plans to examine model simulated tracer-tracer relationships of anthropogenic CO2, bomb  14C,  and CFCs to evaluate aspects of model physics that believed to be important in determining  tracer distributions.   They will then attempt to improve the estimates of anthropogenic CO2 inventories by making use of the  model simulations in conjunction with observations to critically examine ways of separating  the anthropogenic CO2 from the background total CO2 and by exploring alternative  methods using the distributions of CFCs, bomb  14C, and CCl4.  A coordinated examination of these tracers that historically have been examined in relative  isolation promises a better understanding anthropogenic CO2, bomb  14  C, CFCs, and CCl4 uptake in ocean  models and in the real ocean.  \r\n\r\n",
