 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey, (1931 to present) is the only long- term and ocean basin wide operational survey of plankton in the world. There has been an increasing recognition of the value of this multi-decadal time series as a 'barometer' against which to assess environmental change. There is a growing awareness that the quality of marine ecosystems is subject to a wide range of anthropogenic impacts from pollution stress, eutrophication, and loss of biodiversity, to over exploitation of fishing resources. Evaluating and quantifying the scale and effects of such issues is becoming increasingly important as an ecosystem approach is applied to environmental management. Superimposed on the above issues are the potential effects of climate change on oceanic ecosystems that appear to be linked to increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases and global temperature.  Operated by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) in the North Atlantic, this survey is supported by an international consortium of funding. . The USA as a member of this consortium has played a key role in helping to underpin the survey since SAHFOS was established in 1990. As a long term program, the main objective is to maintain the spatial and temporal integrity of the survey and to continue to add further years to the time series. The Survey already comprises close to 200,000 samples analyzed into ~400 different taxa of zoo- and phytoplankton. This resource provides opportunities for study of pelagic ecosystems at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. As the survey expands into other regional seas and oceans comparative ecological studies between different Large Marine Ecosystems will be possible. High potential exists for calibration with multispectral satellite products. The results have already demonstrated highly significant relationships with hydroclimatic variability represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and hold considerable promise as input to a new generation of ecosystem based fishery models. Other objectives include: the development of an improved understanding of mechanisms behind observed decadal and shorter period spatial and temporal variability and the interpretation of hydrobiological variability and biodiversity within the context of global and climate change in marine ecosystems. Central to the aims of SAHFOS is the promotion of the CPR approach within international programs such as GOOS, GLOBEC and LMEs.",
