The objective of this project is to synergistically develop the research and educational components in a mutually beneficial way. \r\n\r\nThe research component of this project consists of the development of new improved methods and instrumentation for biomedical applications of near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging.  The research field devoted to the optical study of tissues has recently lead to a number of clinical pilot studies in areas such as optical mammography, optical imaging of the brain, tissue oximetry, and diagnosis of vascular diseases.  This project aims at further advancing the field by developing novel experimental and instrumental approaches aimed at (1) improving the spatial resolution of diffuse optical imaging, and (2) performing accurate and quantitative tissue spectroscopy over a wide spectral region covering the visible and near-infrared.  Our long-term goal is to exploit these new developments towards novel and more powerful applications of optical spectroscopy and imaging for the biomedical field.  One initial application, namely the spectral characterization of tumors in an animal model in vivo, is planned during the course of this five-year project.\r\n     \r\nThe proposed research plan is complemented by the educational component of this project, which consists of: (1) the development of a new course on the principles of medical imaging; (2) the design and implementation of new teaching laboratory experiments for two courses on medical optics; (3) the development of short-term research projects suitable for undergraduate summer internships; and (4) the implementation of active and collaborative learning approaches.  With regards to the multi-disciplinary nature of this project, our vision is that engineers who have a good scientific knowledge of the targeted application will be most effective at devising innovative instruments to advance the field.  Conversely, clinicians who understand the technical capabilities and limitations of the instrumentation they use, will be in a better position to excel.\r\n\r\n",
