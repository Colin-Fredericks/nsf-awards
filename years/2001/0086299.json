 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study the effects of gravity wave packets on the chemical exothermic heating in the mesopause region.  Chemical exothermic heating is an important heat source in the mesopause region, and there is much evidence that gravity waves interact with hydroxyl nightglow emissions.  A detailed, time-dependent study including fully nonlinear chemistry required to understand and quantify these wave effects has yet to be performed.  The investigators will use state of the art models specifically designed for these tasks, including the Spectral Full-Wave Model, which simulates a time-dependent gravity wave packet, and a time-dependent, nonlinear, 2-D chemistry model that solves the coupled continuity equations of chemically active minor species.  Hydroxyl chemistry will be included in the modeling to better understand the complex interplay between dynamics and airglow emissions.  The main thrust of the research will be to understand the forcing of the mean state minor species distributions and associated chemical exothermic heating due to waves.  The results are relevant to global climate modeling used to study the effects of global change on the middle atmosphere.",
