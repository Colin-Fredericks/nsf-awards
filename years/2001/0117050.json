 "awd_abstract_narration": "A coupled modeling and empirical approach to the study of the life history and\r\nphysiological ecology of cold seep vestimentiferans and communities.\r\nSeep vestimentiferans and their symbionts are primary producers that provide complex\r\nhabitat structure in a non-toxic setting for a diverse assortment of seep-endemic and non-endemic\r\nheterotrophic species. As such, they are arguably the most important keystone species\r\nin widespread areas of seepage on the continental slope. Recent work has demonstrated that one\r\nspecies (at least) of seep vestimentiferan is extremely long-lived and can support its autotrophic\r\nlife style with the uptake of dissolved gasses across buried portions of its body. Thus, in many\r\nways, the seep vestimentiferans are analogous to long-lived, ecosystem-structuring, woody plant\r\nspecies in a terrestrial environment.\r\nWe will develop models to address resource acquisition and allocation, life histories, and\r\ncommunity productivity of cold seep vestimentiferans that will guide and focus field and\r\nlaboratory studies of cold seep vestimentiferan communities. We propose to work on the upper\r\nLouisiana Slope of the Gulf of Mexico at a depth range of 540 to 1,000m and will include\r\ncommunities on both hard substrata and sediment that are exposed to a range of sulfide\r\nconcentrations. We will use empirical studies and comparative methods to develop, test the\r\npredictions of, and refine, Dynamic Energy Budget models, while at the same time addressing\r\nspecific hypotheses concerning vestimentiferan aggregation physiology and ecology.\r\nOur in situ work will be guided by these mathematical models and interfaced with very\r\nefficient and quantitative collection methods that will maximize the information gleaned from\r\neach collection and provide material for future studies, thereby minimizing our short and long-term\r\nimpact on the communities. Growth rates of thousands of individuals will be measured and\r\nthese data used to estimate the longevity and to calculate the resources allocated to growth by\r\neach vestimentiferan species. We will determine whether \"roots\" (posterior extensions that can\r\nbe used to mine sulfide from within sediments) are a general feature of seep vestimentiferans and\r\nwhether they are environmentally induced. The models will be used to explore the relative\r\nimportance of root sulfide uptake to the sustenance of aggregations in different situations and the\r\nimplications of vestimentiferan sulfide demand on biogeochemical models of sulfide production.\r\nTo facilitate this, environmental concentrations of sulfide and diffusion distances across root\r\ntubes and tissues will be measured, and concentrations and sulfide binding properties of the\r\nhemoglobins in the different species will be determined. The biomass, size frequency,\r\ndistribution, and reproductive state of the vestimentiferans will be determined for intact\r\naggregations and collections processed so that the species richness and biomass of all associated\r\nfauna in each collection can also be determined. This will allow us to formulate life history\r\nmodels, to scale up the models of individuals to the levels of aggregations, and to model excess\r\nproduction and its use by associated fauna.\r\nFisher has extensive experience with the Gulf of Mexico seep communities and has visited\r\nthe sites. Shea is a theoretical ecologist with experience in life-history modeling of terrestrial\r\nand aquatic autotrophic systems. The proposed approach will significantly increase our\r\nunderstanding of these widespread and productive deep-sea communities and their impact on the\r\nsurrounding deep sea, and will provide a modeling framework to focus related and future\r\ninvestigations. The proposed studies will yield basic insights on the ecology, physiology and\r\nreproductive biology of deep-sea systems in general and chemoautotrophic systems in particular.\r\nThey will also provide new theory, and tests for existing theory on the evolution of life history\r\nstrategies.\r\n",
