Some aspects of\r\nthis part of mathematics are extremely classical, since the\r\ndifferential equations used by Newton to describe motion under\r\nthe force of gravity lead to a dynamical system.  Although these\r\nmodels are entirely determined by starting conditions and the\r\nrules for evolution over time, detailed prediction is difficult\r\nand we are obliged to seek qualitative understanding.  Over the\r\nlast twenty-five years much attention has concentrated on systems\r\nwhose evolutionary rule is defined by a polynomial function of a\r\ncomplex variable, and on the behavior of these systems as the\r\npolynomial's coefficients are changed.  This class of systems has\r\nbeen found to be a universal model in some ways for the behavior\r\nof families of dynamical behavior depending upon a parameter, but\r\ndespite their simplicity of definition much remains mysterious\r\nabout holomorphic dynamical systems.\r\n",
