 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Chemical (53) \r\n\r\nThe pedagogy of teaching chemical reaction engineering is continually advancing through the use of new computational tools such as POLYMATH and MATLAB; interactive computer applications; and a new emphasis in textbooks on relating theory to industrially relevant chemical reactions. What is currently lacking in this area are chemical reaction engineering experiments that employ realistic reaction engineering systems. Nearly all of the reaction engineering experiments reported in the literature employ simple experiments that can be described using a single overall reaction. In addition, most laboratory experiments do not examine the process fluid mechanics of the reactor and how this effects the product distribution. As a result, students only visualize reactors through theory and do not experience realistic reactor systems in their undergraduate courses. This lack of experience eliminates a major engineering challenge in designing and troubleshooting a reactor in which the yield and selectivity are optimized along with the process economics. \r\n\r\nThis project is developing several experiments that employ the following features currently not being addressed in published reaction engineering experiments: 1) byproduct formation, 2) green engineering, 3) scale-up fluid mechanics and 4) equilibrium limited reactions. A series of experiments is being adapted from the research and educational literature using two chemical and one biological reacting systems. Specific adaptations are based on experiments developed by Wang at the University of Maryland, Bourne at the University of Birmingham, and Keyes at the University of Illinois, among others. These experiments are being vertically integrated through the following series of courses: chemistry, organic chemistry, process fluid transport, chemical reaction engineering, industrial process pathways, biochemical engineering, and unit operations.",
