 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses inorganic and organic interfaces composed of inorganic films resulting from key microelectronics reactions of oxidation and nitridation of Si (SiO2 and Si3N4 and SiOxNy) and organic polymer films (poly o-methoxyaniline (POMA), poly p-phenylenevinylene (PPV) and the hererocyclic polypyrrole and derivatives that have interesting electronic and optical properties with semiconductors (Si, Ge and GaAs) metals (Au, Al, Ir, ITO) and insulators (SiO2 and Si3N4). The fundamental materials science aim is to understand the nature and extent of interface reactions. The key research strategy is to follow the evolution of interface formation in real time. The approach is to use in situ real-time ellipsometry along with in situ real-time characterization methodologies in a configuration that can provide interface and film formation dynamics, chemical composition, and structure and optical properties. Additional interface sensitive characterization techniques include: spectroscopic immersion ellipsometry, Fractal analysis, and Fowler-Nordheim tunnel current oscillations. Interface and thin film preparation processes include: thermal (rapid and conventional), electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma and ion sputtering for inorganic interfaces and chemical and electrochemical solution methods for organic films. Interface reaction models to be used for ellipsometric data analysis can be compared in both the inorganic and organic materials systems. In both systems metal oxide/insulator semiconductor (MOS) devices can be used as electronics properties test vehicles with similar electronics characterizations. Comparisons that are not usually made are a feature of the approach. \r\n%%% \r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. These studies will improve the fundamental understanding of dissimilar materials interfaces, which are key to advanced microelectronics and photonics. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. \r\n*** \r\n",
