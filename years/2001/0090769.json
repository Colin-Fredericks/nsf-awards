 "awd_abstract_narration": "Survival of the mammalian neonate is highly dependent on its ability to\r\nprocess sensory information and then adapt to changes by choosing an\r\nappropriate behavioral and physiological condition.  Because the mother\r\nnormally comprises the prime source of sensory input, she essentially\r\ndetermines the infant's psychobiological state.  Previous work from this\r\nlaboratory has shown that the loss of certain tactile cues from the mother\r\ninitiates in the rat pup and human infant a shift from a growth strategy to\r\none of energy conservation and growth suppression until contact with the\r\nmother is re-established.  Overall the specific goals of this project are\r\n1) to define the roles of CNS Bata-endorphin and bombesin in mediating how\r\ntactile stimulation by the dam regulates cell development in the pups and\r\n2) to determine the molecular mechanisms by which maternal tactile\r\ndeprivation (MTD) suppresses peripheral organ responsivity to the\r\ngrowth-promoting hormones GH and prolactin.  Growth-related molecular\r\nparameters i.e. DNA synthesis and expression of the ornithine decarboxylase\r\n(ODC) gene in developing organs will be assessed and used as indices of the\r\naltered maturation resulting from MTD.\r\n\r\nThe similarities between MTD syndrome in rat pups and human babies suggest\r\na common etiology.  Hence, identifying the underlying mechanisms by which\r\nmaternal-infant interactions optimize growth potential in the neonate is\r\nessential in order to advance our understanding of the basic principles\r\ngoverning normal mammalian development.  As ODC activity is obligatory for\r\nnormal cell replication and differentiation, these mechanisms represent an\r\nimportant control point at which \"nurturing touch\" regulates neonatal\r\ndevelopment.  Such a mechanism can explain the maladaptive consequences of\r\ndisrupting mother-infant tactile interactions as occurs in isolated\r\npremature and in non-organic failure to thrive human infants.\r\n\r\n",
