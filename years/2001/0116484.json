 "awd_abstract_narration": "0116484\r\nde Wet\r\n\r\nThis grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, provides partial support for costs of acquiring a Thermal Jarrell Ash IRIS Advantage Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma Spectrometer (ICAP) with Extended Wavelength Range Dual Plasma. This equipment includes settings for both a vertically oriented (radial plasma) torch and a horizontally oriented (axial) torch. Such a dual system is a significant improvement over earlier types of ICP spectrometers that contained a fixed, radial plasma torch orientation because low wavelengths can be measured more accurately using the axial orientation. Long wavelength analysis is optimized using the vertically oriented torch configuration. This instrumentation provides maximum flexibility for an undergraduate institution servicing diverse research and teaching needs. This increased flexibility increases our user base and ensures maximum access to the equipment. Funds are also allocated for microdrilling equipment, specifically a New Wave Research Micromachining System with a high speed precision drill. The microdrilling system enhances small scale sampling by combining speed and precision relative to hand-held devices that are prone to user error. Both the ICAP and micromachining system work in conjunction to produce data more accurately, more precisely, at a faster rate, in a more user-friendly manner. This is important in undergraduate research where students have less time to devote to their research, but where solid research methodologies and techniques are first learned. Instrumentation that facilitates the learning process, with fewer frustrations and set-backs, is important in retaining students in science and encouraging them to continue with graduate research. Specific research areas that will benefit from the new instrumentation include: diagenesis of Cambrian microbial carbonates; trace element geochemistry of Devonian reefal carbonates from the Canning Basin, Australia; trace element distribution in igneous feldspar growth zoning; minor element chemistry of watershed and wetland sites (soil and water); and interdisciplinary studies in Archeology (local artifacts and chert provenance), and Art History (paint fleck analysis). \r\n***\r\n",
