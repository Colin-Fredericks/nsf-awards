 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the mitigation of  multipath interferences\r\nin a frequency-selective fading channel. As broadband digital wireless\r\ncommunications is more demanded than ever, such as wireless image/video\r\nweb browsing and wireless data transmission, the technical challenges\r\nare exponentially increasing. One of such challenges is that, when the\r\nbandwidth of a channel becomes wider, there are more severe multipaths\r\nin a wireless system. This implies that the multipath interference\r\nmitigation becomes more important than ever.\r\n\r\nModulated coding (MC), a convolutional coding defined on the complex\r\nfield, has been recently proposed by the PI to optimally mitigate\r\nintersymbol interferences (ISI) when the ISI channel is known at both\r\nthe transmitter and the receiver. The advantage of MC is that, since\r\nthe arithmetic operations of both MC and ISI are over the complex field,\r\nthey can be naturally combined together, which provides the convenience\r\nof the optimal MC study for a given ISI channel. Since the encoding\r\nsimplicity of the MC, it is also convenient for further adding a\r\nconventional error correction coding (ECC) before the MC. It has been\r\nshown that the combined MC and turbo coding of an ISI channel may\r\noutperform the AWGN channel capacity at low SNR. As an example, for the\r\ntwo tap ISI channel [0.7071,0.7071], the bit error rate is 0.00001 at the\r\ncode rate 1/4 and the SNR E_b/N_0=-1.15 dB, which is above the AWGN\r\nchannel capacity. The disadvantage of the previous MC study is that the\r\ntransmitter needs to know the ISI channel, which although may be possible\r\nfor some applications, such as storage channels and  wireline channels,\r\nmay not be practical for some other applications, such as wireless\r\nchannels. The aim of this proposal is to optimally design and update MC\r\nwithout the full knowledge of the ISI/multipath channel at the\r\ntransmitter with applications, in particular, in wireless communication\r\nsystems. Due to the simple structure of MC, the MC update at the\r\ntransmitter is possible, which is unlike the existing coding schemes.\r\n\r\n",
