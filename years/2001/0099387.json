 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the research activities of two professors,\r\ntheir graduate students and a Senior Research Associate at Kent State\r\nUniversity in the area of experimental medium-energy nuclear physics. \r\nThe general objectives are the study of the structure of the nucleon\r\n(neutron or proton) and the nature of the nuclear force.  This group is\r\ninvolved in experiments being performed, or to be performed at the\r\nJefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jlab) in Virginia and at the\r\nRelativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) on Long Island, New York.  An\r\nexperiment is in progress at Jlab to determine the charge distribution\r\ninside the neutron.  The neutron, while neutral overall, is known to\r\nconsist of objects with both positive and negative charges.  These\r\nobjects are called \"quarks\".  The quarks are held together by the\r\nexchange of particles called \"gluons\".  Exactly how the quarks combine,\r\nmove, and interact inside the neutron is not known.  A precise\r\nmeasurement of the charge distribution, called the Electric Form Factor,\r\nwill provide one of the most sensitive tests available of various models\r\nof the neutron structure.  These measurements are only recently possible\r\nand require the electron beam characteristics now available at Jlab and\r\ninvolve the use of a large-volume neutron polarimeter developed by this\r\ngroup in experiments performed during the last decade at other\r\naccelerator facilities.  The development, installation, calibration, and\r\noperation of the polarimeter represents the unique contribution of this\r\ngroup to this important experiment.  This group plans also to perform\r\nanother experiment at Jlab to study short-range correlation between\r\nnucleons inside nuclei.  Such short-range correlations are known to\r\nexist, but the exact nature and strength of such correlations are only\r\npoorly determined.  This group will bring its expertise with neutron\r\ndetectors to help study such correlations involving neutrons.\r\n\r\nThis group has recently joined an effort planned to study interactions\r\nbetween colliding beams of polarized protons using the \"STAR\" detector\r\nat RHIC (STAR stands for Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC).  The object of\r\nthis study is to determine the exact origin of the intrinsic angular\r\nmomentum, or spin, of the proton.  The spin, like the charge\r\ndistribution, arises from the existence, interactions and movements of\r\nthe constituents of the proton, generally believed to be the quarks and\r\ngluons.  To date, only the contributions from the quarks has been\r\ndetermined;  this project offers the possibility of determining the\r\ncontribution to the spin of the proton due to gluons.  In order to\r\nmeasure these contributions, it is necessary to observe hadronic jets\r\nproduced at relatively small angles in the collisions.  This group,\r\ntogether with a collaboration of other researchers from Indiana\r\nUniversity, Argonne National Laboratory, and others, will construct a\r\nnew \"end-cap calorimeter\" to be installed at one end of the present STAR\r\ndetector at RHIC.  It will be this group's responsibility to provide\r\ncharacterizations and calibrations of the multi-anode photomultiplier\r\ntubes used for particle detection in this new calorimeter.\r\n\r\n",
