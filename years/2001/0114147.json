 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis research project consists of two, related but independent parts: (1) Modeling demographic evolution; (2) Evaluating the intergenerational aspects of the Welfare State. The issues addressed are of great social relevance. We are debating the implications of demographic changes and population aging for our society; at the same time we are considering the opportunity of reforming our social security, public health and public education systems. The two research projects are meant to study and quantify fundamental economic factors behind the working of such systems. The first project should improve our understanding of the long-run interactions between public health, fertility decisions, population growth and capital accumulation. It aims at building a quantitative model for evaluating the impact of improvements in life expectancy at various ages on fertility and saving choices. Key aspects of this research are the explicit links established between: (i) improvements in health, (ii) availability of public pensions and other forms of retirement savings, (iii) internal family structure, on the one hand, and the dynamics of fertility and capital accumulation, on the other. The second portion of this research project aims at providing tools and criteria useful for evaluating the welfare value of pay-as-you-go pension systems and their (often underestimated) connection with the provision of public education and health. This project shows that a good pay-as-you-go pension system should link pension payments to past investment in the human capital of young generations and not, as it is currently done, to previous social security contributions. Redesigning the intergenerational welfare state along these lines, not only makes the pension system immune from demographic shocks but also foster economic growth by increasing human capital accumulation and reducing labor supply distortions. A key goal of this project is to deliver a quantitative appraisal of such effects for the USA and other OECD countries. From a more general policy perspective, this investigation should provide new tools for designing the intergenerational features of the welfare state and for furthering the use of Generational Accounting methods in evaluating it. \r\n\r\n",
