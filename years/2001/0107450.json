 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work will continue to develop the algorithm of the LOQO \r\ninterior point code for general continuous mathematical \r\nprogramming problems, and expand the range of problems to \r\nwhich it can be applied. Areas of research include better\r\ndetection of infeasibility and unboundedness, better detection \r\nof linear dependence of the constraints, and better estimates \r\nof initial estimates to the optimum point. Work on higher \r\norder methods, which can greatly improve algorithmic efficiency, \r\nwill be continued, with particular interest in applying filter \r\nmethods. In an attempt to expand the scope of the types of \r\nproblems that the algorithm can solve, the research will be \r\nconcerned with solving discrete problems using interior point \r\nmethods. On type of problem considered will be mixed integer \r\nquadratic programming. Problems of this type commonly arise in \r\nfinance. Mixed integer linear programming problems will also \r\nbe studied, with an initial focus on quickly finding feasible \r\nsolutions. Further work will be concerned with general \r\ncomplementarity problems, especially those that arise in \r\neconomics and engineering. In all cases, appropriate collections \r\nof problems arising from real applications will be modeled \r\nin AMPL. These will be made available via the internet, as will \r\nextensions to the LOQO program.\r\n\r\nThe LOQO code for solving a variety of types of mathematical \r\nprogramming problems has been under development for the past \r\nfour years as a joint research effort of the principal investigator \r\nand Professor Robert Vanderbei of Princeton University. The code \r\nis made freely available via the internet, and to date has been \r\ndownloaded several thousand times. It is used to solve problems \r\nas diverse as engineering design, portfolio optimization, airline \r\nscheduling problems, and is currently being adapted for various \r\nprojects in medical research. The proposed research is \r\nconcentrated both on improving the efficiency of the code and \r\nincreasing the set of problems for which the code can be used. \r\nThe new types of problems for which it is hoped the code can \r\nbe adapted efficiently are problems with variables that must be \r\nan integer, generally 0 or 1. These problems are extremely common, \r\nand of great practical value. For example, when assigning aircraft \r\nto routes, a whole plane must be assigned to a specific route, \r\nnot some fraction of a plane. Including integer variables within \r\nthe context an algorithm of this type is very new, and will be \r\napproached initially through important specific applications.",
