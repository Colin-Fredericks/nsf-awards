 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to research and develop high-quality, scalable, and reconfigurable acquisition\r\nand display systems for digital library collections accessed via the Internet. We will acquire new digital\r\ncollections at the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico and provide access to them through end-user displays\r\nthat are scalable and reconfigurable. These displays will cooperate with a remote model server to\r\nprovide the highest possible display fidelity under the current network conditions. In order to allow\r\nthe widespread acquisition and dissemination of digital collections, revolutionary advances in 3D model\r\nacquistion, content delivery, and display are required. To thisend,we will focus on the following research\r\nchallenges:\r\n   Acquisition: we willprovide new acquisition strategies designed to produce high-quality layered,\r\nimage-based representations, 3-D shape descriptions, and multi-layerd data. These new strategies\r\nwill enable efficient access and high-resolution end-user display. hybrid representation of texture,\r\nshape, and metadata.\r\n   Representation: we will encode the acquired collection in a way that moves toward the features\r\nprovided in the MPEG-4 multimedia standard. This encoding will preserve the richness and\r\nfidelity of the data while achieving standardization for access, manipulation, and evolution of\r\ncollections over time.\r\n   Remote Access: we will develop new techniques supporting distributed access to digital col-\r\nlections in a heterogeneous networked environment. These techniques will be designed to satisfy\r\naccess requirements across a spectrum that varies from very high quality local display and low-\r\nlatency interactive manipulation, to remote access over wide-area, potentially low bitrate links.\r\n   Display: we will develop new techniques for deploying scalable tiled projection displays for\r\ninstitutions and users who do not have access to sophisticated and dedicated technical support and\r\nhigh-cost hardware. These scalable display systems can be assembled from commodity hardware\r\nand provide automatic, continuous calibration, and rapid reconfigurability.\r\nThe motivation for this work stems from the need for high-quality preservation, access, and display\r\ntechniques for digitized collections. Libraries, museums, and research scholars who want to acquire,\r\nmanipulate, and provide remote access to (and high-definition display of)digitized artifacts need cost\r\neffective, non-intrusive, easily configurable methods for creating and viewing high-quality collections.\r\nNew techniques will be evaluated on real-world library collections with particular focus on the preser-\r\nvation and dissemination of artifacts at our partner institution for this work, the Museo de Arte de\r\nPuerto Rico . With the aid of expert consultants who will contribute significant effort towards this\r\nproject at our partner institution (see attached letter), we willdevelop and deploy a prototype system\r\nfor acqusition and display using the techniques developed as part of this project. The resulting digital\r\narchive will be made accessible to patrons of the museum as well as a much larger audience around the\r\nworld via the Internet.\r\nWe believe that this research will have significant immediate, medium-term and long-term impact.\r\nThe immediate impact of the project will be the development of new acquisition, access, and display\r\nmethods that will be deployed and tested at the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico, making parts of their\r\ncollections available in forms not previously possible. In the medium term, our new technical approaches\r\nwill be valuable not only to the digital library community, but also to other research, instructional, and\r\ncommercial areas where configurable large-scale display systems are needed (e.g., classroom, research\r\nvisualization centers, conference venues, etc). In the long term, we believe this proposed work has\r\nthe potential to substantially impact the way people view and interact with data, whether the data is\r\na collection of historical artifacts, a visual representation of a complex simulation, data/illustrations\r\npresenting in the classroom, etc. Moreover, the cost effectiveness of our approach means that it will be\r\naffordable to a wide range of users.",
