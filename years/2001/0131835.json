The wise\r\nstewardship of these riches affects current and future generations and, therefore, must be\r\nrooted in decisions based on the best information available. Because of the rapid growth\r\nof all content on the Internet, there is a corresponding increase in online biological\r\ninformation of all types. However, the sheer volume of data, and its widely varying\r\nquality and physical distribution make it impossible for decision makers to make critical\r\ndecisions without the benefit of the existing body of information. This project aims to\r\ninvestigate and develop intelligent knowledge management tools and deploy them in this\r\nimportant domain. In particular, we will investigate the use of a taxonomy as a reference\r\nontology to provide a conceptual framework to allow intelligent agents to browse\r\nbiodiversity information in a variety of formats widely distributed on the World Wide\r\nWeb.\r\n\r\nOur goals are four fold: 1) to investigate the use of a taxonomy as a reference ontology\r\nfor browsing biodiverity information; 2) to evaluate techniques to automatically classify\r\nbiodiversity information (web sites and individual web pages; 3) to personalize the\r\ninformation presented to the users expertise and needs; and 4) lay the groundwork for\r\nlarger, multidisciplinary, efforts in intelligent search, visualization, and personalization of\r\nbiodiversity information.\r\n\r\nThis project proposes to build on existing work currently being done at the University of\r\nKansas related to information discovery, retrieval, and delivery, particularly the\r\nOBIWAN project for ontology based search, browsing and visualization of Web\r\nresources and the PEET project for preserving and extending biodiversity information. A\r\npartnership has already been established between the University of Kansas and the\r\nNational Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) to capitalize on the knowledge,\r\nexpertise, and tools that have grown out of the existing University of Kansas NSF\r\nresearch agreement. As a result of this partnership, the first intelligent search agent for\r\nbiodiversity information, BioBot, has been developed.\r\n",
