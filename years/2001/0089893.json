 "awd_abstract_narration": "A small grant is requested for exploratory research leading to the possible \r\ndemonstration of a critical element for a nanoscale  universal quantum gate.\r\nA novel gate structure will be electrochemically self assembled by sequential \r\nelectrodeposition of ferromagnetic and semiconducting layers inside the pores \r\nof a self-assembled porous film with ~ 10-nm sized pores. A qubit will be \r\nencoded by the spin polarization of a single electron injected into the \r\ndepleted semiconductor layer from the ferromagnetic contact and \r\ntrapped there by Coulomb blockade. Single qubit rotations will be effected\r\nby modulating the spin splitting energy in the semiconductor layer with an \r\nexternal electrostatic gate potential, utilizing the Rashba effect. \r\nThe uniqueness of this approach is that it utilizes a self-assembled structure \r\n(thereby obviating the need for complicated lithography; some lithography is \r\nneeded for input/output connections and gate contacts) and it relies on \r\nelectrical control of the qubit as opposed to magnetic field control envisaged \r\nin other comparable schemes. Since electrical switching is faster and more\r\nconvenient on a chip, this paradigm has distinct advantages.\r\n\r\nThe risk involved in the project is the uncertainty of coherent spin injection\r\nacross a ferromagnetic/semiconductor interface. The risk is however mitigated \r\nby the fact that spin injection is easier across small area interfaces \r\nand there exists experimental evidence of spin injection across the \r\ninterface of carbon nanotubes and ferromagnetic metals which is of\r\na quality comparable to or worse than what we expect in our fabrication scheme. \r\nIf successful, this project will lead to the only self-assembled, \r\nall-electric spintronic quantum gate.\r\n\r\nA self assembled spintronic quantum gate will ultimately allow the creation of a self-assembled  quantum circuit with quantum connectors linking different gates,\r\nas well as quantum memory elements. Since the self assembled \r\nstructures are extremely dense,  it is  expect a qubit density of\r\nmore than 10E11/cmE2 that translates to a storage density equivalent to\r\nthat of 2**{10E9} classical bits in a 1-cmE2 area which exceeds the \r\nstorage capacity of all the hard disks that could be made with all \r\nthe material in the universe over the life of the universe.",
