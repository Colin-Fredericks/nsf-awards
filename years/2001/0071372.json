The\r\nVirasoro conjecture in symplectic geometry asserts that the\r\ngenerating function of the Gromov-Witten invariants for a compact\r\nsymplectic manifold must be annihilated by a sequence of\r\ndifferential operators in the Virasoro algebra.  The principal\r\ninvestigator will study whether the genus-one Virasoro conjecture\r\nand perhaps more general constraints hold for all projective\r\nvarieties.  It is even possible that the generating function of\r\ngenus-one primary Gromov-Witten invariants can be computed\r\nexplicitly from the genus-zero invariants, although this is more\r\nthan the Virasoro conjecture implies.  The second area to be\r\naddressed is submanifold geometry, especially the properties of\r\nisoparametric submanifolds, including infinite dimensional\r\nsubmanifolds.  We know some good constructions of isoparametric\r\nsubmanifolds, but important aspects of the classification theory\r\nare in early stages of development.\r\n\r\nGeometric descriptions of classical or quantum mechanical systems\r\nare based in symplectic geometry, which takes as its basic\r\nmeasurement the area of two-dimensional surfaces.  The\r\nGromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic manifold can be\r\ndescribed as a family of number that count the number of surfaces\r\nof a nice sort that satisfy certain constraints, such as\r\nintersecting specified subsets of the manifold.  Enumerative\r\ninvariants of this kind are an ancient concern in algebraic\r\ngeometry, where we count the number of solutions to a system of\r\nequations, and the subject was recently found to be connected to\r\nhigh energy physical theory, where the partition functions of\r\ncertain quantum systems on a manifold have been found to be\r\nrelated to generating functions that collect families of\r\nGromov-Witten invariants into a manageable form.  The Virasoro\r\nconjecture proposed by a group of physicists and mathematicians\r\nasserts that these generating functions satisfy a family of\r\nconstraints that simplify computations and connect the\r\nGromov-Witten invariants to the mathematics of completely\r\ndifferent problems.  A different kind of geometry arises in the\r\nstudy of submanifolds as curved objects, where we use several\r\nmeasurements of bending to capture the intuitive sense that a\r\nsphere in three-space is more curved if its radius is small than\r\nif its radius is large.  An isoparametric submanifold is an\r\nimbedded object which has particularly simple curvature\r\nproperties with respect to the larger space, and the character of\r\nthis specialty is driven by the fact that this local condition\r\nfrequently imposes strong symmetry properties the whole\r\nsubmanifold.\r\n",
