 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tAll organisms must regulate metal homeostasis, which involves metal\r\nuptake, transport, storage, and distribution. The goal of this research is\r\nto gain insight into the basic mechanisms by which heavy metal homeostasis\r\nis regulated in plants, particularly in the chloroplast. The chloroplast is\r\nthe location of photosynthesis, the process that drives all life on earth.\r\nThis complex process involves a set of enzymes and pigments, many of which\r\nrequire specific heavy metal ions as cofactors, e.g. copper, iron,\r\nmagnesium, manganese, and zinc. Although these metals are necessary\r\ncomponents of the photosynthetic machinery - as well as of other enzymes in\r\nthe cell - they are toxic when present in excess. Therefore,\r\nchloroplast copper homeostasis is vital for plant heath and productivity.\r\nThis project focuses on two Arabidopsis thaliana  genes, PAA1 and AtCUTA,\r\nboth thought to be involved in metal homeostasis. Judged from the presence\r\nof putative chloroplast import sequences, both gene products are predicted\r\nto be functional in the chloroplast. Based on similarities with genes\r\ncloned from other sources, Paa1 protein is likely involved in copper\r\ntransport, and AtCutA protein in the regulation of copper tolerance. These\r\nhypotheses regarding the location and functions of these proteins are\r\nanalyzed in this project. The mRNA levels of both genes will be\r\nanalyzed with respect to tissue distribution, developmental stage, and\r\nenvironmental conditions such as metal toxicity or metal deficiency. The\r\nintracellular location of the proteins encoded by the genes will be\r\ndetermined. To investigate the functions of the genes in vivo, Dr.Pilon will analyze plant lines\r\nthat have T-DNA insertions and plant lines that overexpress the genes.  They will be studied  with respect to metal homeostasis and assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus. Finally, the metal binding properties and metal specificity of the encoded proteins will be determined.  \r\n\r\nThe results from this project will provide much-needed fundamental knowledge about\r\nheavy metal homeostasis mechanisms in chloroplasts, a largely unexplored field of research.  In addition,  this work may lead to the development of strategies to manipulate metal tolerance and accumulation in\r\nplants. This, in turn, may be used to increase crop yields and nutritional\r\nvalue of plants, or to help clean up metal-contaminated sites.",
