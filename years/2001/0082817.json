 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project introduces needed advances in multimedia data management and access for applications dealing with streams of multimedia data. In particular, medical patient information involves streams of sequences of multimedia data, including streams of images  (X-rays, MRIs, etc.), medical reports, treatment and medication information, and other alphanumeric data taken at various points in time, any part of which must be readily accessible for patient care. The goal of this effort is to enable doctors and the patient to store and easily retrieve and visualize the variety of such medical information, and various related data in the web. Data modeling constructs to support the needed substreams, aggregated streams, derived streams, and relationships among and within these constructs is expected to result from this research. A stream algebra for expressing queries is introduced to explore methods for effective query processing, as well as a corresponding visual language for users to easily express the queries. A Time Line end-user interface is extended to incorporate the new constructs introduced for a variety of representative medical user queries. A prototype system will be developed and tested at the UCLA Medical Center to determine the potential impact of these advances through the Time Line paradigm vs current practice in the actual medical domain. Demos will be developed for various computer science and medical domain forums, and will be accessible via Internet, to highlight the technical and medical application innovations. It is expected that the resulting multimedia stream data modeling and data accessing advances will have significant applicability in the medical domain and other areas.",
