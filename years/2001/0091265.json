 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn most animal cells, the centrosomes, or microtubule organizing centers (MTOC), play akey role in chromosome segregation during nuclear division. They consist of a pair of centrioles\r\nencompassed by a complex protein matrix. In most organisms, the centrioles are paternally\r\nderived from the sperm basal body and the surrounding components are primarily derived from\r\nthe maternal cytoplasm. Organisms that undergo parthenogenetic development provide an\r\nopportunity to study natural variants in centrosome formation and structure. The insect order\r\nHymenoptera (this includes ants, bees, and wasps) is characterized by haplodiploid\r\nparthenogenesis, whereby unfertilized eggs develop as males and fertilized eggs develop as\r\nfemales. Although the genetics, behavior, and ecology of species within this order have been\r\nintensively studied, surprisingly few studies have directly focused on issues pertaining to the\r\ncentrosome. Preliminary results for one species within this order, the jewel wasp Nasonia\r\nvitripennis, demonstrate that centrosomes form despite the lack of a sperm-derived basal body.\r\nNumerous cytoplasmic asters form in both fertilized and unfertilized eggs after the completion of\r\nmeiosis. In unfertilized eggs, two of these cytoplasmic asters are captured by the female\r\npronucleus and these function as the zygotic centrosomes while the unassociated asters\r\ndisappear. In fertilized embryos, the sperm derived centrosomes function as the zygotic\r\ncentrosomes and the cytoplasmic asters disappear. Because unfertilized eggs develop into males\r\nand fertilized eggs into females, this is the first system described in which centrosomes are\r\nreciprocally inherited. This project seeks to further characterize centrosome inheritance and\r\nstructure in Nasonia. These studies are likely to yield novel mechanisms of organizing\r\nMTOCs and also provide new insights concerning the evolution and developmental consequences\r\nof parthenogenesis. The three specific aims of this project are:\r\n1. To further characterize the behavior of the cytoplasmic asters in fertilized and unfertilized\r\nembryos through live fluorescent microscopy.\r\n2. To characterize the centrosome inheritance pattern in Nasonia strains in which development\r\nof unfertilized or fertilized eggs is specifically disrupted.\r\n3. To characterize the composition and structure of the asters and centrosomes in fertilized and\r\nunfertilized embryos through immunofluorescent analysis and thick section electron\r\nmicroscopy.\r\n\r\n",
