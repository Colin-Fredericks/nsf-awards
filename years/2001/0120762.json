 "awd_abstract_narration": "West Virginia University at Parkersburg will partner with Ritchie County High School and Williamstown High School to provide research experiences for female high school students in the Appalachian region known as the Mid-Ohio Valley. Mentoring and peer groups will be important components of the project.\r\n\r\nIn West Virginia, women are less likely to seek a college education let alone pursue a career in science or math. One of the most exciting experiences that a female high school student interested in the sciences can have is one that involves interaction with a teacher and peers in a group setting participating in a scientific project. This is particularly valuable for women students in Appalachia who have attended K-12 schools in isolated areas where there is little opportunity for advanced study of science, who have not had personal role models or do not picture themselves doing science. The research component is the key to the project's impact on high school students and their decisions regarding entering the sciences as a career. It will give students their first experience with original research, teach them how to deal with the open-ended nature of the research process, and give them the self-confidence to see themselves not just as students, but as actual researchers.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that lessons learned from the project will inform a full proposal for an expanded Women in Science program at additional public schools in partnership with WVU Parkersburg. The goal is to impact how young women perceive careers in science and mathematics and encourage their pursuit of a college education in these studies. \r\n",
