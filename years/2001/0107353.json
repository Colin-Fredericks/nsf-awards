The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide 11 months of support to Dr.Roland de Gouvenain to work with Professor Joelisoa Ratsirarson at the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar on the modeling of sustainable harvesting regimes for forest conservation.  Of the 11 month duration, five months will be spent back in the United States at the University of Connecticut, working with Dr. John Silander, analyzing the data and writing up his results. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to determine whether sustainable tree harvesting is compatible with forest biodiversity conservation.    The PI proposes to determine the sustainability of different tree harvesting \r\nregimes, and to analyze the possible causal relationship between harvesting and changes in forest structure, forest composition and site environmental variables from a \"no-harvest\" baseline forest condition.  He will use a regeneration probability model to simulate how different harvesting regimes may impact forest \r\nregeneration and how it affects long-term forest conservation.\r\n\r\nThe study forest of Tampolo is an ideal \"field laboratory\" with a range of harvesting \"treatments\" resulting from unequal protection at different sites.  \r\nThese harvesting regimes could be incorporated into future management and conservation plans for the study forest and other threatened forests.\r\n***\r\n",
