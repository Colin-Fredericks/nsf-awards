The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide twenty-four months of support to Dr. Catherine Lebiedzik of the University of Virginia to do research with Dr. John Cagnol at Pole Universitaire, Leonard de Vinci, in Paris, France, and with Dr. Jean-Paul Zolesio at Ecole des Mines de Paris in Sophia Antipolis, France.  Funding for this project is provided by NSF's Math and Physical Sciences Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\nThe PI will work on the problem of reducing noise in an acoustic cavity.  The project involves the complex mathematical solution of a simple physical system; describing the physics via the acoustic wave equation embedded in an appropriate boundary surface.  Noise reduction is a concern in the field of aerospace engineering as well as an application of modern control theory of partial differential equations (PDEs).  The structural acoustic interaction in the chamber is mathematically modeled by a coupled system of PDEs.\r\nThe international nature for this work is necessary because the intrinsic model itself was first developed in France.  The French group will be responsible for generalizing the model to include thermoelastic effects and for assisting in numerical analysis with the finite element method.\r\n",
