Pair-learning is a technique for educating computer science students in which students work on programs in pairs at one computer. We are conducting educational studies at diverse institutions to measure the impact of pair-learning on our students' aptitude for, and attitudes toward, computer science. Based on this experience, we are creating and disseminating educational materials for teachers, teaching assistants, and students to support the transition from solo-learning to pair-learning. These materials include: a textbook, lecture slides, laboratory exercises, a collaborative web site, a web-based data tracking tool, teaching assistant training materials, and journal and conference presentations and publications. We conducting longitudinal studies of the performance of students in classes in which pair-learning is used and in all subsequent computer science classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
