 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the study algorithmic problems that arise in\r\nthe design of next generation networking technology.\r\nRapid growth of the internet user base, coupled with rapid parallel\r\ngrowth in mobile subscriber numbers, is creating powerful pent-up demand\r\nfor wireless access to the internet/intranets and other data networks.\r\nCommunication in wireless networks differs in some fundamental \r\nways from communication in wired networks. In particular, the basic\r\nform of communication in wireless networks is broadcasting,\r\nas opposed to point-to-point communications in most wired\r\nnetworks. This research investigates the effect of switching to \r\nbroadcast communication on server strategies\r\nin the client-server computing model, one of the most common \r\ncomputing paradigms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA wide range of real-time applications, such as multimedia conferencing, \r\ncomputer supported cooperated workspaces, remote medical diagnosis etc., \r\nhas become very popular in recent years.  These applications have \r\ndynamically changing bandwidth requirements.  \r\nIt is clear that controlling and allocating\r\nbandwidth for individual users and web browsers is becoming very \r\nimportant for bursty traffic flows utilizing highly constrained\r\ncommunications channels.\r\nFrom the network management's perspective, it is advantageous to \r\nallow the network to dynamically \r\nchange the tariff parameters of the charging scheme in response to demand.  \r\nThis research investigates dynamic renegotiation and\r\npricing problems that arise in the design of networks\r\nthat give quality of service guarantees.",
