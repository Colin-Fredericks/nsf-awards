 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the influence of culture on individual adaptation\r\nthrough investigating cultural, social-psychological and dietary influences\r\non individual differences in physiological and psychological adaptation.\r\nIndividual differences in variables such as blood pressure, serum lipids,\r\nanxiety and depression have most often been attributed to individual-level\r\nfactors such as diet or stressful experiences.  This project will use\r\ncontemporary culture theory and methods to examine how cultural models\r\nconstruct shared meanings, which in turn affect the behavior of individuals\r\nand their health status.  The research hypothesizes that high cultural\r\nconsonance, the degree to which individuals approximate shared cultural\r\nmodels, will be associated with better physiological and psychological\r\nadaptation, as measured by lower blood pressure and other variables\r\nassociated with stress and distress.  The research will be done in Ribeirao\r\nPreto, Brazil, a community with a considerable amount of socio-cultural and\r\ndietary variability.  The research will take place in four diverse\r\nneighborhoods in three stages: unstructured interviewing will be used to\r\nelicit cultural domains; then cultural consensus analysis will be used to\r\ntest for shared knowledge; and finally data on individual psycho-biological\r\nadaptation will be collected from a survey sample.  The research will\r\ncontribute to our understanding of how individuals adapt in their cultural\r\nsetting as well as advance our knowledge of this important region of the\r\nworld.\r\n",
