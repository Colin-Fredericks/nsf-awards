 "awd_abstract_narration": "DEB- 0108208\tKalisz\r\nWhite-tailed deer population sizes have increased dramatically over the last 50 years in the eastern half of North America.  As a result of this increase, the non-woody understory vegetation in forests is being consumed to a greater degree.  This has resulted in a significant decline in flowering and fruiting of the native wild flower community in the presence of deer.  However, when deer were excluded via fences, some plant species that were previously consumed by deer were observed to grow to larger sizes and reproduce.  Other species in the deer exclosures are not reproducing. The goal of this research is to determine the likelihood of persistence or decline of understory wild flower species in the continued presence or absence of deer.  Using key species naturally occurring in deer exclosure plots (fenced) and paired control plots (no fence) we will monitor their growth, survival , flowering and fruiting. Comparative demographic analyses using data from exclosure and control plots will be conducted to determine the likelihood of persistence or extinction of these species.  This research will help inform wildlife and forest management decisions.\r\n\r\n",
