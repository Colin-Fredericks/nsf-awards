FPCC provides academic and vocational\r\nprograms and community service to the 10,000 members of the Assiniboine and Sioux\r\ntribes and area residents. In 1999-2000, FPCC had an average enrollment of 233 students.\r\nApproximately 85% of the students are Native American - nearly all are enrolled\r\nmembers of the Sioux and Assiniboine Tribes. In June 2000, there were 30 graduates\r\nwith Associate Degrees. Of these, only 4 (13%) were in science, mathematics,\r\nengineering and technology (SMET) disciplines.\r\nCurriculum Enhancement: Objectives and Anticipated Outcomes\r\n1-1. By Fall 2003, all entering students will be advised to enroll in appropriate levels\r\nof SMET courses based on assessment scores and previous achievement.\r\n1-2. By Fall 2004, instructors will have integrated technology into 6 introductory\r\nSMET courses.\r\n1-3. By Fall 2005, instructors will have integrated technology into 6 advanced SMET\r\ncourses.\r\nFaculty Development: Objectives and Anticipated Outcomes\r\n2-1. Each year, two SMET instructors will attend one regional or one national\r\nconference specifically focused on integrating technology into courses according\r\nto national standards.\r\n2-2. By Spring 2005, all eight SMET instructors will have completed one semester of\r\nfaculty exchange or sabbatical at another academic institution or national\r\nlaboratory.\r\n2-3. By Fall 2003, each SMET instructor will have designed and implemented a Web-\r\nbased course based on national standards.\r\nUndergraduate Training: Objectives and Anticipated Outcomes\r\n3-1. By Fall 2003, student enrollment in SMET courses will increase by 10%.\r\n3-2. By Fall 2004, ten students will be selected for internship placement in local sites.\r\n3-3. By Spring 2005, five students will graduate with SMET majors and/or transfers\r\nto four-year institutions.\r\n3-4. By Spring 2006, five students will enter SMET careers.\r\nExpected Impact. This project will impact the college and reservation in several\r\nways. Implementation of an appropriate system of assessment and student placement in\r\nbeginning SMET classes will increase the completion rate to 70%. The addition of the\r\ncomputer laboratories and wireless communication will increase the FPCC capacity to\r\noffer additional SMET classes and research and increase enrollment in advanced SMET\r\nclasses by 10%. As a result of the student internships, the percent of SMET majors\r\nentering math, science and technology careers is expected to increase by 10%. The\r\nstudents assigned to internships will become aware of career opportunities in math,\r\nscience and computer technology especially in the region. The addition of the Web-based\r\ncourses, especially advanced courses, will further increase enrollment and course\r\ncompletions. Involvement of the Advisory Committee will increase potential training and\r\nservice opportunities. FPCC will enter into partnerships with tribal businesses and private\r\ncompanies for training and education especially in computer applications.",
