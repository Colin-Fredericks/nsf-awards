 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Science Research Institute (SUMSRI) which is funded by the NSF, and the NSA, is designed to prepare participants for the rigor of graduate school.  We feel that this\r\npreparation will help participants to successfully compete for and complete the graduate school.  The Principal Investigators: Vasant Waikarand Patrick Dowling, are professors at Miami University in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.  SUMSRI will be housed at Miami U. in Oxford,Ohio.  We are especially interested in, but not limited to, African Americans and other underrepresented minorities and women in the mathematical sciences.  SUMSRI will provide approximately 15 nationally selected, and mathematically talented undergraduate students an intensive research experience.  The primary goal of the institute is to convince participating students to pursue advanced degrees like a Ph.D. in the\r\nmathematical sciences.  We will also encourage participants to attend national meetings (for example, the AMS-MAA Winter Meeting,the Conference of African American Researchers in the Mathematical\r\nSciences (CAARMS), SIAM meetings, NAM Mathfest, MAA Mathfest, American Statistical Association Meeting, Pi Mu Epsilon meetings) and give talks or poster presentations.\r\n\r\nThe institute will run for seven weeks in the summer of 2001.  During these seven weeks the students will participate in research seminars in mathematics, statistics, or computer science.  At least one colloquium talk will be given each week.  We will also have panel discussions on information about graduate  school, fellowship sources, and career opportunities in the mathematical sciences. The program will also include\r\na technical writing seminar, a GRE preparation workshop, and two short courses in abstract algebra and real analysis.  The institute seeks mature students who have completed at least two years of undergraduate\r\nmathematics with distinction.  SUMSRI will provide each participant with room, board, books, supplies, one round trip ticket, and a $2500 stipend.  Minorities and women are strongly encouraged to apply.",
