The interaction of geometric analysis, \r\npartial differential equations, and their  application to some interesting \r\napplied analysis problems is the thread connecting the two projects.  \r\nIn the education project, Han proposes to rejuvenate an undergraduate geometry course  \r\nmostly for  math education majors and an undergraduate differential geometry course \r\nto better serve the need of a wider audience that has grown out of \r\ntoday's rapidly changing technological environments\r\nand emergence of new interdisciplinary fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good understanding of the evolution of concentrated vortices, such\r\nas vortex sheet, has immensely important practical values. \r\nThe mathematical equations that govern the evolution of vortex sheets\r\nexhibit many features very similar to those that have been\r\nsuccessfully studied in geometric analysis in recent years. The PI hopes\r\nthat the interactions of ideas and tools from across the fields will\r\nbring some fruitful results in understanding better the geometric aspects\r\nof vortex sheet evolution. In his second project, the PI also hopes to\r\ncombine closer the geometric and the analytic approaches, the success of which\r\nmay provide further insight back to purely geometrical or analytical problems.\r\nThe successful implementation of the third proposed project will \r\nwill be a positive contribution to the K-12 math education through \r\nbetter training of math education majors.\r\n",
