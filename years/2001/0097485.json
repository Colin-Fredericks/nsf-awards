 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at North Carolina State University, where a previous REU site was funded for 1997-1999.  Thomas Gunnoe is the site's Program Director; Maria Oliver-Hoyo is the Co-Program Director. Twelve faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will participate in a ten-week program.  Strong emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from undergraduate institutions that lack research opportunities, using existing relations with many of the HBCUs and PMCUs within North Carolina.  In addition, plans are underway to develop relationships with selected universities in Puerto Rico.  These relationships will be utilized to bolster the program's minority recruiting efforts. The research projects offered are in the areas of analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. While the primary focus of the program will be on the students' direct participation in a research project, students will also participate in weekly seminars, industrial site visits, safety instruction, and other educational and networking activities.  At the conclusion of the program, each student will present his/her research at a mini-symposium that will include both poster and oral presentations.  Both long- and short-term evaluation methods will be implemented to determine the effectiveness of this REU program.\r\n\r\n",
