 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of the Applied Information Technology Education (AITE) project is (1) to equip and develop students who can function effectively in an information technology (IT) workplace, who can adapt to changes in emerging technologies, and who will become innovators in their respective disciplines, and (2) to prepare educators with the understanding of an IT economy and with the knowledge and skills to teach and develop the current and future workforce. This mission evolves from Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College's vision to develop a Gulf South workforce that can perform successfully in a knowledge- and idea-based economy, embedded with technology.\r\n\r\nThe project is accomplishing its mission by increasing the supply of IT workers--female IT workers, in particular--in the Gulf South region and developing programs in database administration and Web design and administration. Activities and methodologies to support the goals and objectives involve faculty training and certification; curriculum adaptation; developing a career awareness and exploration model, called \"The IT Pathway,\" focusing on females and other underrepresented groups; communicating \"The IT Pathway\" to high school and college faculty and students; and disseminating the project's findings and products. The curricula developed in the project are geared to nationally recognized certifications and industry standards.\r\n",
