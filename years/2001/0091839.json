 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brooks, III Charles L.\r\nMCB-0091839\r\n\r\nEnergy landscape theory was the springboard for development of the \"new view'\" of protein\r\nfolding. This framework is responsible for our growing quantitative understanding of\r\nprotein folding mechanism and detailed connections to experiments probing the folding\r\nprocess. Parallel development of landscape theory in the study of clusters and glasses has\r\nalso significantly shaped understanding in this field. The interchange of ideas and\r\nconcepts between these two distinct areas has added to the growth of each. However, more\r\ndetailed exchanges and forums for discussion and presentation of underlying ideas and\r\nquestions will aid continuing development of both areas. The goal of this symposium is to\r\nprovide this forum for a discussion of common themes between folding and glasses and\r\ncluster phenomena, to promote the exchange of ideas between these communities, to survey\r\nthe advances that have hallmarked each area, and to point to the challenges that remain in\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nThe exciting new advances that have taken place in these areas of investigation would have\r\nbeen impossible without the integration of the new theoretical and experimental advances\r\nin computational chemistry and physical chemistry that have been successfully applied to\r\nmolecular biology and biochemistry. In this symposium, we will integrate the different\r\ngroups that have taken part in shaping the successes this interdisciplinary persuit aimed\r\nat a quantitative understanding of the folding problem. The ACS Spring Meeting in 2001 at\r\nSan Diego will provide the appropriate forum for this event.",
