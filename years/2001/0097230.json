 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an REU Site in archaeological research methods in Veszto, Hungary.  This is part of a collaborative, multi-disciplinary, international research project co-organized by Ohio  State University and the Munkacsy Mihaly Museum, Bekescsaba, Hungary.  Ten students will have the opportunity to participate in research aimed at understanding the later prehistory of the Great Hungarian Plain.  They will help excavate the Early Copper Age settlement of Veszto-Bikeri.  They will (1) work side-by-side with Hungarian students as they receive instruction in survey and excavation techniques; (2) participate in seminars taught by experts on archaeological method and theory and on the culture and history of Eastern Europe; (3) visit museums and archaeological sites; (4) plan and complete an independent research project; and (5) live in the small town of Veszto and learn about life in Hungary from the villagers and Hungarian students and archaeologists.  The students will be responsible not only for helping excavate the site, but also for analyzing archaeological material that will provide a better understanding of prehistoric economic and social organization.  They will present papers and publish their results on the project website and in archaeological journals.  \r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
