The award supports the acquisition of a combination Auger (AES) scanning Auger microscopy (SAM) and high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA) surface analysis system. This state of the art system will enable high-resolution energy, depth and spatial characterization of a variety of novel thin-film/surface materials at levels that are currently unavailable at the institution. The instrument will be combined with exiting instrumentation and will constitute the nucleus of a centralized campus-wide Materials Characterization Facility. The facility will be accessible to scientists and students from Southern University, and will support several federally funded projects. It will enhance substantially the infrastructure in and impact the visibility and competitiveness of LSU and Southern University.   \r\n\r\nThis award to Louisiana State University and Agricultural & Mechanical College (LSU)is from the Major Research Instrumentation program and the NSF/EPSCoR program.
