 "awd_abstract_narration": "This creative project pairs grandparents or other senior citizens with children in grades K-7 for an intergenerational hands-on SMT program.  The OASIS institute, which has a large national membership of adults 55 and older with centers based in 25 cities across the US, is the source of adults.  Twenty intergenerational modules will be developed which address the learning styles of both children and older adults, half of which will be linked with the NSF-funded \"Find Out Why\" materials.  Master training sessions will be conducted for OASIS trainers, who would then train volunteers at their local centers.  Anticipated outcomes include increased knowledge of standards-based SMT concepts, enhanced problem-solving skills and a better understanding of how science, math and technology apply to everyday life.  In addition to the modules, the program would also result in the creation of a supplementary guide for volunteers, materials kits and a comprehensive training program.  It is anticipated that this exciting program will be piloted in the following nine states:  MO, IN, OR, MD, AZ, TX, CA, IL and OH. Over 100,000 individuals will be impacted during the three years of the project.\r\n\r\n",
