 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enhance student understanding of NMR spectroscopy through increased laboratory experiences in both the chemistry and biochemistry curriculums. A 300 MHz Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT NMR) spectrometer and additional copies of NMR processing software have been obtained to achieve this goal. Additional coverage of NMR, needed to keep pace with current trends, is being added to five courses or course sequences: (1) introductory (sophomore) organic chemistry; (2) inorganic/organic synthesis; (3) biochemistry; (4) advanced analytical chemistry; and (5) undergraduate research.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the stated goals of the proposal, NMR theory and practice is being incorporated at two levels. At the first level, all chemistry, biology, and biochemistry students are being introduced to 1-D and 2-D NMR experiments in the introductory organic chemistry sequence. New experiments from the literature (chemical education and research) are being adapted and implemented. At the second level, chemistry and biochemistry majors in subsequent courses are conducting additional NMR experiments relevant to their areas of interest. NMR experiments from the literature are being adapted and implemented into these five courses as well. Other suitable experiments, most notably in the biochemistry area, are being developed in the Department. Once complete, these experiments will be made available to others through adequate dissemination methods.",
