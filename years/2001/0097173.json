 "awd_abstract_narration": "The annual meeting of the Rocky Mountain Regional Neuroscience Group provides a unique opportunity for scientists in this geographically isolated region to interchange results and ideas in neuroscience.   Participants hear an internationally known keynote speaker, learn about ongoing research in regional laboratories, and meet neuroscientists from regional universities and colleges.  Faculty and students from departments of neuroscience, psychology, and biology, from smaller colleges as well as major universities come to provide interactions that foster undergraduate participation and exchange of graduate training information, as well as potential collaborations.  This award provides partial funding for the conference, primarily for small travel awards for participants from distant schools, to help defray student expenses, and for publication of an abstract volume.\r\n    This meeting will have an impact on career choices of many students who attend, and will foster collaborative opportunities between the many colleges represented.\r\n",
