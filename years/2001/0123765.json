 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new generation of sophisticated, multi-party distributed applications are being proposed and implemented over the Internet.  Many of these applications, such as distributed publish-subscribe services, ubiquitous files system and distributed auctions, require the location and coordination of a large number of resources dispersed throughout the network.  A fundamental building block for these applications, is a distributed directory.  The distributed directory enables applications to locate required resources in a timely and efficient manner, and helps the application to scale.\r\n\r\nThe proposal describes TerraDir; a set of protocols for implementing customizable, distributed, peer-to-peer directories over which a range of wide-area resource discovery applications can be implemented.  The architecture addresses scalability and flexibility.  The research will concentrate on:\r\n- dynamic view implementation (decoupling naming from location)\r\n- configurability (applications are not monolithic, must address wide needs)\r\n- caching (multiple locations of caches)\r\n- fault tolerance (required for success), and\r\n- network layer techniques for finding peers and distributing applications.\r\n\r\nEach TerraDir Directory is a private namespace, and multiple TerraDirs can be active at the same time to provide other virtual directors.  Since the TerraDir is designed to be implemented over the existing Internet, the protocols address end-to-end requirements and do not require any special network support.\r\n",
