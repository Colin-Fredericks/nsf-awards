 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reed\r\n0109872\r\n     Certain cells in the mammalian auditory brainstem (three\r\nneurons from the periphery) show exceptionally small standard\r\ndeviations in the microsecond range of the timing of the first\r\naction potential response under repeated trials of the same\r\nsound.  Moreover, the latency and its standard deviation are\r\nquite independent of frequency and decibel level over large\r\nranges.  This behavior is exceptional since the inputs to these\r\ncells come from octopus and other cells in the contralateral\r\ncochlear nucleus, a nucleus which is ennervated by auditory nerve\r\nfibers that have much larger standard deviations and high\r\ndependence on frequency and decibel level.  Thus, this system is\r\nan example of how the brain can use relatively sloppy and\r\nvariable devices (neurons) to perform surprisingly accurate\r\ncalculations.  Professor Michael Reed, with colleague physiologist\r\nJoseph Blum, investigates this system with three research\r\nprojects: (i) They create and investigate by machine computation\r\na large scale mathematical model of the whole system using known\r\nphysiological properties of auditory nerve fibers and recently\r\ndiscovered properties of octopus cells; (ii) They use\r\nmathematical analysis investigate of the improvement of the\r\nstandard deviation of latency in converging networks where the\r\ntarget cells require coincident inputs within time windows in\r\norder to fire;  (iii) They use partial differential equations to\r\nunderstand the special properties of dendritic information\r\nprocessing in octopus cells.\r\n     Using mathematics and machine computation, Professor Michael\r\nReed continues  to study how groups of cells (neurons) in the\r\nauditory brainstem perform calculations that individual cells can\r\nnot do by themselves.  Neurons are inherently sloppy and variable\r\ndevices that perform differently even under (apparently) the same\r\nconditions with the same inputs.  Nevertheless, large groups of\r\nthese neurons are able to perform together, reliably, highly\r\naccurate calculations.  This project tries to understand this\r\napparent paradox.  The project sheds light on how and why human\r\nbrains are organized the way they are and it suggests new\r\nmechanisms for the development of man-made thinking devices.\r\n",
