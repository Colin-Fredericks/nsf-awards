 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three-year research project is proposed with the following goals:\r\n1. To fully describe the science and mathematics curricular exposure of high school students and\r\ndifferences resulting from curricular variations, social context and opportunities to learn, and\r\nstudents background.\r\n2. To analyze how curricular exposure and social structure influence students persistence through\r\nthe science and mathematics pipeline.\r\n3. To analyze how curricular exposure and academic progress through the science pipeline affect\r\nstudents choice to major in science-related fields, including teaching.\r\n4. To analyze how science curricular exposure shapes students health behavior and health-related\r\nscience literacy.\r\nThree major areas that influence students progress through the science and mathematics\r\npipeline and their health choices and literacy even if they leave the pipeline are identified and\r\nanalyzed: (1) curriculum content, performance expectations and perspectives (2) formal,\r\nstructured opportunities to learn and (3) the informal social contexts of students learning\r\nenvironments.\r\nQuantitative methods are employed. This study takes advantage of a unique and timely\r\nopportunity to analyze nationally representative, longitudinal data from the 1990s, the National\r\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and its transcript supplement. A third\r\nwave of Add Health is currently being gathered, and students high school transcripts and\r\nsupporting school documents (course catalogues, syllabi, textbook lists) are being collected and\r\ncoded. For this study, course curriculum (content, performance expectations, and perspectives)\r\nwill also be coded and analyzed along with the transcript data and longitudinal survey data from\r\napproximately 19,000 respondents who were in grades 7 through 12 in the1994-1995 school year.\r\nThis data set contains extensive measures of many sources of influence from the contexts of\r\nstudents lives that can be linked to adolescents health behavior, academic performance, and\r\nscience and teaching aspirations.\r\nThis study is set within Quadrant III of the ROLE program: irResearch on SMET learning in\r\nformal and informal educational settings,ll and has major implications and links to Quadrants II\r\nand IV. The study directly targets the question of how recent mathematics and science\r\neducational reforms in approaches and curriculum materials affect students academic progress\r\nand learning. It explicitly distinguishes between formal and informal processes to assess the\r\neffects and interactions of each. The study addresses the concentration of Quadrant II since the\r\nresearch questions are framed to recognize how the complex, multilevel aspects of students\r\nbackgrounds and lives interact with the structure and social context of schools to affect learning.\r\nThe concentrations of Quadrant IV are also addressed by the multilevel approach to analysis of\r\nlongitudinal, nationally representative data. The data sets depth allows for analysis of how\r\nreforms in curricular content (including textbook adoptions) and structure are related to students\r\nprogress within the context of schools and curriculum-based subsets of students (such as tracks).\r\nConsistent with common themes across ROLE concentration areas, this study will model these\r\nprocesses and analyze large-scale effects of curricular and social structuring inherent in\r\nmathematics and science reform efforts. Finally, it assesses how science education is related to\r\nthe everyday lives of the U.S.s diverse population by examining how exposure to science in\r\nhigh school is related to health choices and behaviors.",
