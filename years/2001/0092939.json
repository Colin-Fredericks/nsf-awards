 "awd_abstract_narration": "0092939\r\nFields\r\nThe goals of this project are to test the consistency between predictions of the primordial\r\nabundances of cosmic baryons from the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) theory and the measurement of these abundances obtained from an analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations planned for the future satellite missions \"MAP\"(2002) and \"PLANK.\" (2008). The work is divided into three phases, before, during, and after the release of the \"MAP\" results. In Phase 1 Fields will develop and hone the tools needed for this comparison, refining the Monte Carlo methods in current use by improving their treatment of the nuclear reaction uncertainties involved in the calculations. He will also improve the nuclear database used in the calculations, introducing a set of thermonuclear reaction rates and temperature-dependent errors in a user- friendly, publicly available form. In Phase 2, Fields will use the MAP determinations of the baryon density, to accurately compare the BBN and CMB measures of cosmic baryons, having developed the statistical tools to compare the results prior to the MAP mission. Finally in Phase 3 the MAP measurement of the baryon density will be used to remove the last free parameter from the BBN theory and permit its use as a probe of the early universe and basic nuclear physics by setting a limit on such parameters as the number  of light neutrino species as well as such astrophysically interesting quantities as the rate of Galactic evolution,  AGB star nucleosynthesis, dwarf galaxy evolution, and globular cluster ages and stellar rotation and evolution.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Fields will develop a new course in Astronomy for Teachers, designed for K-12\r\nscience and mathematics teachers, that will include both a survey of astronomy, and activities to bring this information to the classroom.  Initially held as a summer course on campus, it will eventually be offered in a distance learning format, and will use the Web as a resource for curricular material and activities developed by the teachers who take the course.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
