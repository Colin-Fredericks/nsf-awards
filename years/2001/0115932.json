 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Allan, Bushar and Hearn at Arcadia University (formerly Beaver College) to conduct DNA sequence analyses of select organisms belonging to the Plant and Animal kingdoms.  Dr. Allan will analyze evolutionary relationships among plant species in the Pea Family to better understand their origin and diversification in specific mediterranean environments.  The study will entail analysis of DNA sequences generated by an automated DNA sequencer, and will result in the construction of a molecular phylogeny (DNA-based family tree) for approximately 150 species, some of which are agriculturally important.  Dr. Bushar will conduct DNA sequence and microsatellite (tandemly repeated DNA sequences) studies to understand factors that impact the structure, variation and long-term viability of North American rattlesnakes.  Dr. Hearn will use DNA sequence information to augment her work on the conservation management and evolutionary relationships of large forest mammals and nesting marine turtles on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, West Africa.\r\n\r\nMethods used in this research include: the isolation of genomic DNA from different study organisms (plants, snakes, mammals); identification of target gene regions in nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA; and the generation of DNA sequence information using a Genetic Analyzer (DNA sequencer).  In the plant study, DNA sequence information will be used to generate molecular-based phylogenies, in conjunction with computer-based algorithms.  These data will address questions relating to the origin and diversification of plants endemic to different mediterranean regions including western North America, Chile, the Mediterranean, western Australia and South Africa.  In rattlesnakes, both DNA sequence information and microsatellite loci will be applied to genetic comparisons of spatially isolated North American species.  These data will provide valuable information on the genetic structure both within and between snake populations.  Relationships among large forest mammals will be analyzed using DNA sequence data in conjunction with computer-based phylogenetic analyses.  These data will contribute to the conservation management of large forest mammals and nesting marine turtles on Bioko Island.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of these DNA sequence studies is to enhance undergraduate education in biology at Arcadia University.  DNA sequence technology is rapidly becoming the method of choice for a broad spectrum of biological-based questions.  The development of new pharmaceutical drugs, the identification of virulent flu viruses, research on the AIDS virus, the human genome project and conservation management of biodiversity are just a few examples of studies that use DNA sequence technology.  By incorporating DNA sequence methods into plant biology, advanced genetics and molecular biology courses, students will gain an understanding of the wide application DNA technology has to diverse biological questions.  Students will be trained both in theoretical and applied analyses of DNA sequence data.  An additional goal is to offer courses in advanced laboratory techniques to faculty from other small liberal arts colleges and to high school teachers.  Ultimately, this research program constitutes a powerful heuristic tool for educating and training the next generation of young scientists and teachers.  This program has a direct benefit to the public by training students who will teach and conduct research on problems that directly impact human society.\r\n\r\n",
