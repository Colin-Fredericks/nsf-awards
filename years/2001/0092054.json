 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is the synthesis and characterization of a new class of electro-photonic oxides. Enhanced electro-photonic materials behavior will be achieved through cooperative structural and electronic distortions. The primary emphasis will be on the  synthesis of new materials to include a new class of double perovskite compounds. The students involved in this research will be trained in solid-state techniques that will enable them to synthesize materials as both pure powders and single crystals.  In addition to the standard solid-state synthetic techniques, a radio-frequency induction furnace will be utilized to grow large (5mm) crystals of the new materials. The new materials will be structurally characterized by powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction. These diffraction measurements will provide the students with a solid foundation in crystallography and crystallographic techniques. Variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction measurements will be undertaken in order to investigate phase changes, as well as elucidate the structural changes that occur during a ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition.  Once the materials have been structurally characterized, electro-photonic experiments will be performed. Second-harmonic generation and ferroelectric experiments will aid in deriving structure-property relationships. The relationships will impart to the students an understanding of materials properties with respect to synthesis and crystal structure. \r\n%%%\r\nElectro-photonic compounds find uses in dynamic random access memories (DRAM), frequency doubling (SHG), and Pockels cells. This integrated research and education project will provide graduate students with a thorough education in solid state materials chemistry areas such as synthesis, diffraction, and physical property measurements. The students wil be highly competitive in the job market as these materials and materials characterization areas are of significant importance to the industrial community.  \r\n",
