Linhart\r\n\r\nMultiple Roles and Consequences of Intra-specific Chemical Variability\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will explore the role of plant secondary compounds such as monoterpenes as important mediators of biotic interactions such as herbivory and competition.  The research will ask 1) can there be multiple consequences associated with synthesis and storage of a specific compound?  2) to what extent do results obtained in experiments apply to natural settings?  The plant to be studied is Thymus vulgaris, which is a plant with odor and taste primarily defined by one monoterpene.  In southern France, where much of the work is to be done, individuals belonging to one of six chemical phenotypes (or chemotypes) each has its own specific monoterpene. Terpene synthesis is under genetic control.  They chemotypes show variable deterrence against herbivores and influence germination and growth of competitiors differently.  Individuals of all six chemotypes will be exposed to herbivory, or competition, or a combination of both in experimental field work.  The relative fitness of chemotypes will be studied.   Comparisons will be made of survival and reproduction in various environmental settings. \r\n",
