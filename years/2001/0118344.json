 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several behaviors are differentially expressed in male and female mammals as adults, typically regulated by the levels of steroid hormones that were present during early postnatal development.  A number of differences in the brain also have been correlated with sex differences in behavior, including differences in numbers and density of particular nuclei (clusters of nerve cells) in parts of the brain.  Changes in these neural parameters suggest that changes also are required in the afferent and efferent neural connections of these nuclei.  This project combines hormonal treatments with quantitative neuroanatomy to test the hypothesis that neonatal steroids regulate male sexual behavior by regulating the development of the number, density, and interconnections of neurons in the magnocellular part of the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN mag), which is involved in olfactory-driven male sexual behavior.\r\n   This study provides a unique opportunity to clarify functional roles of neuronal differences in sexually dimorphic structures in the brain, and will be important for future molecular studies underlying dimorphic neurogenesis, so the impact will extend to developmental biology.  In addition, the broader impact promotes research by a woman investigator from an underrepresented group, who is actively involved in increasing the representation of minority students in scientific research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
