 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University will expand its successful Master Science Educators program and create a national model for the delivery of natural science education to elementary and middle school youth.  Master Science Educators are volunteers who undergo a rigorous 30-hour training and commit to 50 hours of service to a community site, such as a community center, housing project or school.  Volunteers work in teams of two so that each site receives 100 hours of service devoted to the research and development of a natural science project.  Volunteers and on-site and off-site scientists who act as virtual volunteers,  guide youth ages K-8, in the design, development and evaluation of their project.  Wildlife habitat projects provide a means for participants to learn inquiry and are tailored to address local science standards.  A trainer's guide, a volunteer handbook, a guide for community sites and promotional and training videos will be produced, as well as a web-based science course.  It is anticipated that 240 volunteers will be trained to work with over 12,000 youth during the course of the project.  Dissemination will occur through the 4-H Extension service, impacting both urban and rural populations.\r\n\r\n",
