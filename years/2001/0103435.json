The second is to continue the principal investigator's\r\nstudy of the forcing order on braid types in the four times\r\npunctured disk.  This project has both an experimental and\r\ntheoretical part.  Computer programs are used to generate\r\nexamples and to aid in the formation of conjectures. Once\r\nconjectures are made that cannot be disproved by computer,\r\nrigorous proofs will be attempted.  The third project is a\r\ncollaboration with John Franks with the long term goal of proving\r\nthat generic area preserving diffeomorphisms of the two\r\ndimensional sphere have dense periodic orbits.  The more\r\nimmediate goal is to find analogs for generic area preserving\r\ndiffeomorphisms of the topological structure that is known to\r\nexist for twist maps.  The fourth is a collaboration with Lee\r\nMosher.  The first steps in the project will be to identify and\r\nstudy quasi-lines that can play the role in Culler Vogtmann space\r\nthat Teichmuller geodesics play in Teichmuller space.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is concerned with the interface between two areas\r\nof mathematics: two dimensional dynamical systems and geometric\r\ngroup theory.  The former studies the long term behavior of\r\nsystems that evolve over time, while the latter treats algebraic\r\nobjects by geometric means.  The fields have been intertwined for\r\nmore than fifty years and have been the focus of a great deal of\r\nresearch in the past twenty.  Part of the proposal focuses on two\r\nlong standing fundamental questions in two dimensional dynamical\r\nsystems.  The first examines how simple systems change into\r\nchaotic ones.  The second concerns transformations of the sphere\r\nthat preserve area, and asks whether every piece of the sphere\r\ncontains at least one point that eventually (as the system\r\nevolves) returns to its original position.  There are two groups\r\n(in the technical algebraic sense) that are most closely related\r\nto two dimensional dynamical systems.  They are the mapping class\r\ngroup and the outer automorphism group.  To understand the\r\ngeometry of a group one must understand its geodesics; i.e. what\r\nthe shortest paths are between any two points.  The geodesics of\r\nthe mapping class group have been well understood for some time.\r\nThe principal investigator will generalize from what is known\r\nabout the geodesics of the mapping class group to identify and\r\nstudy geodesics for the outer automorphism group.\r\n",
