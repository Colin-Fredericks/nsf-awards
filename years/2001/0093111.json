 "awd_abstract_narration": "Storage systems have evolved from simple disks under the control of file servers to large, indepen-\r\ndent disk-array systems connected to the network using Network-Attached Storage (NAS) and Storage\r\nArea Network (SAN) technology. A unique feature of these storage systems is that they are directly\r\naccessible by applications running on independent computers without the intervention of file servers.\r\nA downside, however, is that these systems are very difficult to manage because of the increased de-\r\nmands placed on them by data intensive applications and the number of storage devices connected to\r\nthe network. We propose to improve the management of such storage systems by automating the\r\nstorage management tasks and incorporating performance techniques to provide the system with the\r\n\\intelligence\" to adapt to varying storage and workload conditions. In essence, this storage manage-\r\nment software system will control and manage all access to storage devices on the network, much as\r\nan operating system manages and controls all access to a computer system. The storage manager will\r\nallow applications to express their response time, availability, and bandwidth requirements, and then\r\nuse this information along with its knowledge of device behaviors and application access patterns to\r\ndecide how best to map data to devices such that application constraints and storage system goals\r\nare met. Based on this work, we anticipate the development of user-friendly, self-managed storage\r\nsystems that are more cost-effective, efficient, and available than current systems that are configured\r\nand managed manually.\r\nOur education goal is to integrate performance evaluation tools and techniques into the Computer\r\nScience curriculum at the University of New Hampshire. Students who will work on the storage\r\nmanagement system will require performance evaluation skills and our education plan addresses this\r\nissue. Our long-term goal is to coordinate with industry and other institutions to implement a\r\nself-managing storage system and make itavailable for research and educational purposes.",
