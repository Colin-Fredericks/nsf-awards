The goal of the workshop is to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions and information exchange within a multidisciplinary group of researchers and top post doctoral scholars and graduate students studying, fuel cells, and electronic devices.  The NSF funds will be used to help invited speakers, graduate students, post doctoral scholars, and junior faculty participate in the symposium.\r\n%%%\r\nImportant areas impacted by oxide surfaces include catalysis and electrocatalysis; photochemistry, photcatalysis and environmental remediation; biomaterials; ceramics; and sensors.  Students trained in these multidisciplinary areas compete very well in the job market in areas such as energy, transportation, chemicals, and electronics, and often go on to contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.\r\n",
