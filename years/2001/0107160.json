 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smith\r\n0107160\r\n     The investigator develops mathematical methods that exploit\r\nthe special properties inherent in dynamical systems arising in\r\nthe biological sciences and applies them to specific problems.\r\nThe main focus is on the long-term behavior of the dynamics after\r\ntransient effects have disappeared.  The work on biofilms focuses\r\non systems of advection-diffusion equations coupled to ordinary\r\ndifferential equations with coupled nonlinear boundary conditions\r\nin piecewise-smooth domains.  Aside from well-posedness and the\r\nexistence of multiple steady states, which are nontrivial\r\nquestions, the important biological information comes from key\r\neigenvalues for associated nonstandard eigenvalue problems and\r\ntheir dependence on parameters.  Both mathematical analysis and\r\nnumerical simulations are required for an understanding.  The work\r\non the paradox of the plankton focuses on the classical model of\r\nn-species exploitative competition for k essential\r\n(non-substitutable) nutrients.  If n is larger than k there can be\r\nno equilibrium coexistence of all n species so one must seek\r\noscillatory coexistence.  The investigator exploits certain\r\nheteroclinic structures (cycles of equilibria) that arise\r\nnaturally in such systems in order to seek periodic coexistence\r\nsolutions.  The theory of competitive and cooperative systems can\r\nplay a significant role.  Abstract dynamical systems theory comes\r\ninto play in the work on robust persistence.  Specifically,\r\nunderstanding chain recurrent sets and Morse decompositions of\r\nthe boundary dynamics (where one or more species are absent) are\r\nkey to showing that persistence for a dynamical system is robust\r\nto perturbation of that system or of its parameters.\r\n     Dynamical systems that arise naturally in many areas in the\r\nbiological sciences often have special features not shared by\r\nsystems arising in the physical sciences.  Broadly speaking, the\r\ninvestigator develops mathematical methods that exploit these\r\nspecial properties and applies them to specific problems.  The\r\nmain focus is on the long-term behavior of the dynamics after\r\ntransient effects have disappeared.  Progress in this area can\r\nhelp to answer important biological questions that are subject to\r\nmathematical modeling, such as whether an infectious disease\r\nbecomes endemic in a population or becomes extinct, or which\r\nspecies in an ecosystem can survive and which will become\r\nextinct.  A substantial effort is devoted to understanding the\r\ndynamics of mathematical models in three areas of the\r\nbiosciences.  The first is microbial growth and competition in\r\nenvironmental settings where biofilms may form on surfaces.\r\nBiofilms are of great importance in the health sciences and food\r\nindustry where their formation typically results in negative\r\noutcomes.  They are responsible for food and water contamination,\r\ndental caries and periodontal disease, and the contamination of\r\nmedical implants.  The investigator studies under what conditions\r\nbiofilms may form and what bacterial densities can be expected.\r\nThe second is a fundamental issue in population biology, the\r\nso-called \"paradox of the plankton\": why can so many plankton\r\nspecies (and, more generally, species of other taxa) be supported\r\nby so few limiting resources?  The investigator provides\r\nmathematically rigorous results for the existence of oscillatory\r\ncoexistence states of the relevant mathematical models when the\r\nnumber of species exceeds the number of resources, as is typical\r\nin natural environments.  The third is a more robust theory of\r\npersistence (also called permanence) for dynamical systems\r\narising in population dynamics.  In its simplest form, this theory\r\nseeks not to determine the global behavior of solutions of a\r\ndynamical system representing interacting populations but rather\r\nto answer the more basic question: What species are present at\r\nthe end of the day?  While past research in this area has\r\nprimarily ignored the fact that population models are only\r\napproximately correct, the investigator seeks to provide answers\r\nto the basic question that hold true for all small perturbations\r\nof the model equations.\r\n\r\n",
