 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wilkinson will continue to extend her previous work toward an understanding\r\nof the dynamics of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.\r\nIn particular, with her collaborators, Wilkinson proposes to address\r\nthe issue of density of stable ergodicity in the space of partially \r\nhyperbolic diffeomorphisms, and the existence of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures \r\nfor these diffeomorphisms.  Wilkinson  will also study the dependence \r\non smooth parameter of invariant structures for partially hyperbolic systems.\r\n\r\nA diffeomorphism is a way of smoothly rearranging the points\r\nin a space.  A diffeomorphism is a natural object, arising, for\r\nexample, in the study of planetary motion. By applying a \r\ndiffeomorphism repeatedly, one obtains a dynamical system; each iteration\r\ncorresponds to a unit of time in the evolution of the system. For any \r\ngiven space, there are infinitely many diffeomorphisms, with widely\r\nvarying dynamical behaviors; a goal of dynamics is to arrange \r\ndiffeomorphisms into classes whose dynamical behavior can be understood.\r\nOne class of diffeomorphisms whose dynamics are now well-understood\r\nare Smale's Axiom A, or hyperbolic, diffeomorphisms, which \r\nare chaotic: among other things, they display sensitive\r\ndependence on initial conditions. This project aims to better\r\nunderstand the behavior of another important class of diffeomorphisms,\r\ncalled partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.  Partially hyperbolic \r\ndiffeomorphisms have many of the features of Axiom A systems,\r\nbut their dynamical behavior is yet to be completely understood.\r\n",
