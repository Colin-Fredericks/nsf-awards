The instrument will also support research and training of faculty and students at other colleges that are part a consortium of users affiliated with single crystal X-ray facility at Youngstown State University. The X-ray Diffractometer will provide data of sufficiently high quality to enable structure determinations of powder samples, which is not possible with multi-wire detector currently used for powder analysis.
