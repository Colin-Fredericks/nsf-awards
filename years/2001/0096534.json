 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study magnetic impulse events (MIE) in the dayside magnetosphere.  MIE events are signatures of plasma entry into the magnetosphere.  The study will make use of ground- and space-based data, which will be combined with theoretical models to isolate the most important mechanisms responsible for these processes.  In the first year, the investigators will identify the factors controlling the motion of MIE seen in high latitude ground magnetograms and discriminate between proposed interpretations in terms of bursty merging, pressure pulses, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.  During the second year, they will investigate the nature of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling by comparing geosynchronous and ground signatures with the predictions of several recent proposed coupling models.  In the third year, they will undertake a survey of dayside auroral brightenings seen by satellite imagers, determine their occurrence patterns as a function of solar wind conditions, and establish their relationship to previously reported categories of transient events seen in high latitude ground observations.  Understanding MIE is important for identify the factors that control solar wind entry in the magnetosphere and its subsequent effects on Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere and space weather.",
