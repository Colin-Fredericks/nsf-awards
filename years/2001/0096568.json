 "awd_abstract_narration": "Livebearing fishes of the Family Poeciliidae exhibit a variety of developmental strategies. In the\r\nguppy, young develop in the ovary from the energy stored in large, yolky eggs (lecithotrophy), whereas in\r\nthe least killifish, the eggs are very small, with little yolk, and most energy for development and growth is\r\ntransferred from the mother to the embryo through a placenta-like structure (obligate matrotrophy). Other\r\nspecies exhibit a mixed strategy in which energy stored in relatively large eggs is supplemented by\r\nmaternal transfer of nutrients during embryonic development (supplemental matrotrophy). The type of\r\nstrategy exhibited by a given species has been suggested to reflect the productivity of the environment\r\nthat it inhabits. Obligate matrotrophs are predicted to occur only in highly productive environments where\r\nfood for the mother is abundant and predictable. In less productive or less predictable environments,\r\nlecithotrophy is the expected strategy. Species that exhibit supplemental matrotrophy may inhabit\r\nunpredictable environments but be capable of exploiting excess food if it occurs and passing extra energy\r\non to developing offspring (facultative supplemental matrotrophy).\r\n\r\nThe largespring gambusia has traditionally been considered to be strictly lecithotrophic, but\r\nrecent studies have demonstrated mother-to-embryo transfer of nutrients in this species despite the\r\nabsence of an obvious placental structure. This study proposes to use radiolabeled nutrients to quantify\r\nmatrotrophic contribution in largespring gambusia in order to address the following questions: What is\r\nthe nature of the mother-embryo transfer surface and how does it limit the amount or types of nutrients\r\ntransferred? To what extent does the largespring gambusia exhibit matrotrophy under natural conditions?\r\nHow does matrotrophic contribution vary with environmental conditions within a given population and\r\namong different populations? Understanding the occurrence of facultative matrotrophy, both across\r\nhabitats and temporally within habitats, may help explain the variety of developmental strategies within\r\nthe Family Poeciliidae and the relationship of those strategies to environmental productivity. Furthermore,\r\nthe strategy of facultative matrotrophy itself may reflect an adaptation to unpredictable environments that\r\nallows species exhibiting this strategy to occupy habitats that undergo natural environmental variation.\r\nThis strategy, then, may provide an important buffer against human-induced environmental changes.",
