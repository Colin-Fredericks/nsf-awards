 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a low-cost composite proton exchange membrane (PEM) capable of high temperature operation (>150 degrees C) with excellent chemical resistance and good thermal and dimensional stability suitable for advanced fuel cells in next generation vehicles (NGV).  The key to this new composite membrane is a high temperature, high strength, chemically resistant membrane support structure fabricated from Foster-Miller's patented porous single crystal alumina material.  Tailored porosity structures have been fabricated with interconnected passages suitable\r\nfor infusion with a suitable ion conducting polymer (ICP) for high strength PEM's.  This new PEM will address the serious cost/performance problems associated with current perfluorinated membranes.  Fuel cells based on this new technology will achieve power density greater than 0.2 W/cm2.  Membrane cost should eventually approach the $80/m2 level necessary to promote development of the NGV. Commercial scale up of the porous single crystal alumina manufacturing is already underway with a commercial processor of ceramics.  During Phase I small composite Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEA's) will be\r\nfabricated, characterized and electrically tested for high temperature conditions (150 degrees C) and peroxide stability. Phase II will optimize the composite PEM with fabrication and testing of MEA fuel cell stacks.\r\n\r\nCommercial applications for the proposed advanced composite PEM include cost efficient fuel cells for automotive, utility and space/military applications. As a potentially key enabling technology for the automotive (NGV) application, the market potential is very large. Utility uses include communications, computers (laptop) and remote power generation. Space and military include manned space missions (space station), shipboard power, battery replacements and portable/mobile field generating units.\r\n",
