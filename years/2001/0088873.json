 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Engineering Technology (58) \r\r\n\r\nProgrammable logic controllers (PLCs) are an essential part of manufacturing\r\nautomation. Thousands of these devices have been used in manufacturing plants for such\r\napplications as monitoring security, managing energy consumption, and controlling\r\nmachines and automatic production lines. However, because of limitations in equipment\r\navailability, it is often difficult for students to gain the experience needed to become\r\nproficient with PLCs.\r\nThis is a proof-of-concept project to develop an integrated virtual learning system for\r\nprogrammable logic controllers. The system is initially being utilized as an\r\ninstructional/laboratory aid within the Manufacturing Engineering Technology program\r\nat Texas A&M University. This system is integrating the strong educational emphasis of an intelligent tutoring system with the technological innovation of a PLC emulator and the attraction and motivation of a game. Each component is being developed and evaluated both internally and externally. Evaluation criteria includes instructional effectiveness and lesson content appropriateness. Results are being disseminated within the academic and industrial communities via the Internet. If the concept is proven, the methodology will be replicable and applicable to several other types of equipment and technical laboratory courses. \r\n\r\n",
