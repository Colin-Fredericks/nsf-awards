 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lindquist\r\n0107893\r\n     The investigator creates quantitative computational tools\r\nfor the automated analysis of neural images, including software\r\nalgorithms to provide automated morphology measurements both of\r\nneuron dendrites and of dendritic spines (the primary synaptic\r\nreceivers).  These tools are developed in close collaboration\r\nwith the neural imaging research programs of two groups, led by\r\nProf. K. Svoboda at Cold Spring Harbor Lab. and by Profs. P. Hof\r\nand S. Wearne at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine.  In preliminary\r\nwork, automated algorithms have been developed and verified\r\n(against manual measurements) to identify and extract\r\nmorphological measurements of dendritic spine length and density\r\nfrom 3D images.  This project develops algorithms to\r\n  i) provide spine volume measurements, which are currently\r\navailable only through manually intensive, scanning electron\r\nmicroscopy measurements;\r\n  ii) analyze (two-channel) images containing two dyes that\r\nfluoresce at different frequencies.  One dye is a marker for\r\nspine morphology, the second is a marker for specific\r\nfunctionality.  This allows for direct correlation studies of\r\nform and function.  The primary application of these algorithms\r\nis in structural genetics work.\r\n  iii) determine higher moment (shape) measures both of spines\r\nand dendrite cross sections.  The primary application of these\r\nalgorithms is in developing models of neural integration behavior\r\nand age-related deficits in short-term memory.\r\n     Biological science technologies are now capable of producing\r\ndata at a rate so fast that only with computers and sophisticated\r\nnumerical and statistical algorithms can biologists analyze these\r\ndata.  In the past decade, laser scanning fluorescence\r\nmicroscopy, enabling non-invasive, three dimensional imaging of\r\nliving neurons, has produced a revolution in neural research.\r\nThe wealth of information available from a time sequence of three\r\ndimensional neuron images is outstripping our current information\r\nprocessing capacity, which has been based upon manual\r\nidentification and tracing of structures of interest.  Although\r\nit uses the superb recognition capability of human sight, manual\r\nmeasurement is tedious, susceptible to systematic and hard to\r\ncharacterize human biases, restricted to measurements involving\r\nonly length and counting, and effective only for small data sets.\r\nThe purpose of this project is to develop computer based tools\r\nfor the automated analysis of neuron images, eliminating manual\r\nanalysis.  The resultant computer tools will make practical such\r\nstudies as\r\n  i) the relationship between neuron structure and age-related\r\ndeficits in memory as well as some forms of mental retardation;\r\n  ii) where in neurons certain proteins concentrate and how\r\ntheir presence and concentration correlates to the signal\r\nprocessing role of neurons;\r\n  iii) large scale screening of drug treatments designed to\r\ncorrect genetic- or trauma-induced deficiencies in neuron\r\nstructure.\r\nThe project is supported by the DMS/Computational Mathematics,\r\nDMS/Applied Mathematics, and IBN/Computational Neuroscience\r\nprograms and by the MPS/Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n",
