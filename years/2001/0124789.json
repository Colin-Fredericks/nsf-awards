 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF/EPA Technology for a Sustainable Environment project seeks to address fundamental issues associated with replacing existing petroleum-based glass fiber - polypropylene composites with eco-friendly, sustainable, bio-composites from renewable resource-based natural/bio-fibers and bio-plastics for automotive applications. The research will focus on:  (1) innovative bio-fiber surface treatments and the design of engineered natural fibers; (2) synthesis of cellosic bio-plastics with acceptable mechanical properties; and (3) research into the processing methods to produce void free bio-composites sheets for stamping processes. The use of an electrical field during the processing enhances control of fiber alignment.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that this will result in a break-through process for the new generation of bio-composites that is cost effective as well as environmentally friendly. University - industry collaboration is expected to add knowledge of the material and process engineering as well as to create a consciousness in designing value-added composite materials from bio-resources for the automotive and transporation industries. Knowledge gained from this research will enhance the education of students and practitioners in engineering design as well as manufacturing and production engineers concerned with environmentally benign manufacturing. \r\n",
