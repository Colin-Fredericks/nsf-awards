 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nNONLINEAR OPERATOR THEORY. The goal is to find canonical \"nonlinear generalizations\" \r\nof analytic function theory and the related parts of linear operator theory.  Many \r\nclassical and many new analytic function theorems have a statement purely in terms of \r\nlinear operators.  The surprising thing is that these theorems about linear operators \r\ndo not actually require linearity, and it has become clear that there will be  extensive \r\nnonlinear generalizations of them.  This wide open area is close to control theory.\r\nCOMPUTER OPERATOR ALGEBRA.  Linear engineering systems theory and operator theory are rife with calculations in a noncommutative algebra. Helton's group with M. Stankus \r\nare major providers of software (called NCAlgebra) for performing general noncommutative \r\ncalculations in Mathematica.  One phase of the software is at the level of a very \r\npowerful `yellow pad', and contains numerous algorithms they developed. For example, \r\nthe  \"noncommutative convexity\" algorithm discussed  below will go in.  In another phase \r\nthere is  extensive software implementing noncommutative Groebner basis algorithms \r\ndue to Mora and algorithms for sorting and \"shrinking\" the output in various ways ( this \r\nis crucial in the noncommutative case). Since the techniques are new, experimentation on \r\ntraditional problems is important. \r\nNONCOMMUTATIVE INEQUALITIES.  Recently, Helton and collaborators made progress on a \r\ntheory and resulting algorithm which takes a rational function F of noncommutative \r\nvariables Z and outputs a family of inequalities which determine a domain G of Z on \r\nwhich F is \"matrix convex\".  Decidedly non-trivial is showing that the domain G \r\ndetermined by the algorithm is  \"the  largest possible\" domain of matrix convexity \r\nfor F. This is a first attempt at an automatic method for what engineers now do with \r\nSchur complement tricks  to convert a design problem to Linear Matrix Inequalities.  \r\nOPTIMIZATION  OVER SPACES OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS. Qualitative theory, computer algorithms based on this theory, analysis of such algorithms.  These are the key optimization \r\nproblems which arise in designs of linear systems where there are competing constraints, \r\nor uncertainty in the math model of the physical system one is trying to control.\r\n\r\nThe research is directed at several projects in parts of operator theory and functional \r\nanalysis related to engineering system theory. Linear operator theory has had a strong \r\ninterplay with analytic function theory and engineering for many decades.  Indeed most \r\ncommercial software (at least in the control engineering community) for solving analytic \r\nfunction problems is based on this type of interplay between functions and matrices.  \r\nOne branch of analysis closely related to applications is classical Nevanlinna-Pick-\r\nNehari theory, or equivalently commutant lifting theory, a part of the area called \r\noperator model theory.  The early development of this  was done for the purest of \r\nmathematical reasons, but in the mid 1970's  and early 1980's this was shown to be \r\ncritical to the design of engineering systems where stability of the system is the key \r\nconstraint. This motivated much more mathematical development and now it is one of the \r\nareas of functional analysis most closely associated with control engineering. For many \r\nyears (since Norbert Wiener) design tools optimized mean square performance. The theory \r\nabove ultimately lead to (commercially commonplace) tools for optimizing worst case \r\nfrequency domain performance. The goal of much of the proposed research is to extend \r\nthis theory in several radically new directions and we list the main ones.\r\nHIGHLY NONLINEAR GENERALIZATIONS; the goal is to find canonical \"nonlinear \r\ngeneralizations\" of analytic function theory and the related parts of linear \r\noperator theory.  This wide open area is closely related to control theory.  Many \r\nsystems which people wish to control are nonlinear (e.g., jet engines).\r\nNONCOMMUTATIVE COMPUTER ALGEBRA; if a signal goes into a system A, comes out and then goes into B what we get is BA, while if a signal goes into B and then A what we \r\nget is AB.  Seldom does AB  equal BA, thus the design of engineering systems\r\nrequires (heavy) noncommutative calculations.  Helton's group has a broad based \r\neffort to develop methods and theory for computer assistance of such calculations.  \r\nInequalities with noncommuting elements is now a major topic in engineering and \r\nHelton's group is working out systematic methods for treating them.\r\n\r\n",
