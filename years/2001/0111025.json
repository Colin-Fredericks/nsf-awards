 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe lifecycle of many spherical (icosahedral) viruses involves co-assembly of the protein\r\ncapsid around the viral genome. However, the details of this process are largely\r\nunknown. Important questions remain about how capsid protein associates with the\r\nnucleic acid to initiate assembly and complete virion, and how the viral genome becomes\r\norganized within the capsid. We will examine assembly of Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle\r\nvirus (CCMV), a plus strand RNA plant virus. This is an ideal model for studying in vitro\r\nassembly because CCMV capsid protein (CP) can assemble into empty capsids, virus-like\r\nparticles with non-specific RNA, and infectious virions with viral RNA. We hypothesize\r\nthat virion assembly proceeds stepwise by (i) non - specific binding of CP to RNA, (ii)\r\nspecific binding to viral RNA, (iii) refolding of the RNA - protein complex, and (iv)\r\nfinally, cooperative association of CP to the complex, leading to completion of the\r\ncapsid. This hypothesis implies that the protein - protein interactions will affect the\r\norganization of the packaged RNA and that RNA structure will have a profound effect on\r\ncapsid assembly.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the assembly of empty capsids is a preliminary to studying assembly of\r\nRNA-filled virions. Study of the protein-protein interaction is complicated because the\r\nCCMV capsid is an oligomer of 180 copies of CP. We have developed analyses of\r\nassembly that allow us to deduce elements of the mechanism and thermodynamic and\r\nkinetic parameters. Experimentally, assembly will be observed using light scattering,\r\nliquid chromatography, and electron microscopy.\r\nAssembly of RNA-filled capsids adds an additional layer of complexity. In vivo, only\r\nviral RNA is encapsidated; in vitro, encapsidation is promiscuous. The role of RNA in\r\ndirecting assembly remains to be determined. RNA binding will concentrate CP, but is\r\nalso likely to affect CP - RNA quaternary structure. We have observed distinct CP - RNA\r\ncomplexes that are likely to play critical roles in assembly and specificity. We will\r\nphysically and structurally characterize these complexes and their formation on viral and\r\nrandom RNA. Subsequent capsid assembly will be observed with electrophoresis, and\r\nsolution assays using RNA with bound complex, bare viral RNA, and random RNA as\r\nsubstrates. We expect that protein - protein interaction energy, observed for formation of\r\nempty capsids, will probably contribute to the cooperativity of assembly. We anticipate\r\nthat these studies will yield a detailed picture of a basic biological process, the assembly\r\nof an infectious virus. These studies will be a paradigm for understanding assembly of\r\nother viruses, identifying new targets for anti-viral intervention, and for manipulating\r\nvirus assembly to yield novel nano-structures.\r\n",
