C\r\nCollaborate more effectively with its Harvard University colleagues on the  development of data assimilation modeling system.\r\nBecome more actively engaged in the real-time exchange of large observational and model data that accompanies our joint development of an Advanced Fisheries Management Information System (AFMIS).\r\nCollaborate more effectively with colleagues in (1) large eddy simulation modeling of coastal winter-mixed layer evolution and (2) direct numerical simulation of ocean physical-biological systems on a remote supercomputer.\r\nCollaborate more effectively in its GLOBEC/Georges Bank studies on the relation of satellite-derived temperature fields and biology.\r\nThe establishment of an ACCESS GRID node would establish reliable support for distributed (remote) research and education collaborations.\r\nProvide IGS/SMAST researchers and students with high-speed access to the virtual libraries that are being built to augment traditional libraries.\r\nBegin employing advanced visualization technology to analyze and synthesize results",
