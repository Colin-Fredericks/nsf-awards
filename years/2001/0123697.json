 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Women in Science (AWIS) is a recognized national leader and\r\ninnovator in developing mentoring and leadership programs. AWIS proposes to build on\r\na previous project on academic climate funded by the Sloan Foundation.\r\nThis project developed surveys for assessing the institutional climate for undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty. \r\n\r\nIn addition to surveys, site visit protocols were developed for campus visits. Nine central\r\nissues for faculty emerged from this work: (1) Recruitment, hiring, and retention; (2)\r\nTenure and promotion; (3) Dual careers; (4) Family and work; (5) communication; (6)\r\nMentoring faculty; (7) Mentoring students; (8) Informal networking and socializing; and\r\n(9) Career development.\r\n\r\nRecommendations were developed to address these issues and sample model policies\r\nwere collected. AWIS has been involved in the dissemination of these materials for the\r\npast three years. Recently, with the MIT Report, the demand has outpaced the ability of\r\nAWIS to supply materials on an individual basis. AWIS proposes to develop an on-line\r\nInstitutional Climate Assessment Kit that institutions can use to implement their own\r\nprograms. In addition to the kit, AWIS will have a section on Model Academic Policies\r\nthat address many of the nine topics listed above and a bi-weekly on-line column that\r\ntackles these issues. As a result of the proposed project, AWIS anticipates three clear and realistic outcomes, including (1) An institutional Climate Assessment Kit that will provide an evaluated and tested model for replication by the institutions; (2) Model Academic Policies that can be used by science societies and institutions; and (3) explicit professional science society\r\nlinkages that will facilitate replication and sustainability of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the National Institutes of Health through the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers\r\n",
