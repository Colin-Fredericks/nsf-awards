 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop and optimize a novel bioassay tool for routine low-cost biomonitoring of water quality.  Submitochondrial particle (SMP) toxicity bioassays, based on the in vitro responses to toxicants of the integrated enzyme functions in oxidative phosphorylation, are good predictors of conventional whole organism tests, yet can be completed in minutes. Phase I research proved the concept that SMP technology could be streamlined and semi-automated, enhancing their convenience and commercial potential.  In Phase II, prototypes of two dedicated instruments will be developed to accommodate both the cuvette and 96-well microplate-based formats. Accessory liquid and cuvette handling tools will be developed to increase sample throughput.  Features will be added to computer software developed in Phase I for running the tests, including support for other protocols; better error detection; statistical treatments and graphical presentation of data.  SMP production methods and quality control procedures will be improved and standardized.  The software and instrument prototypes will be tested at four independent laboratories to establish assay variability and to gain additional information on appropriate applications of the tests. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will provide affordable tools that will allow for screening of water quality and wastewater discharges by industry and municipalities.\r\n",
