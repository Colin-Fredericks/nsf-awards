Keck Foundation and NSF to continue the highly successful Keck Geology Consortium undergraduate research program.  A primary goal is to maintain the synergy created by the existing collaborative program while including more students and faculty from other institutions.  Twenty-seven students and nine faculty drawn from institutions nationwide will participate in three collaborative research projects.  The projects will begin in the spring when students will investigate the literature and become familiar with their research area.  Each research group will work together for approximately four weeks in the summer.  During this time each student will define an individual project that contributes to the research group's broader goals and will begin collecting data.  The research will continue through the academic year under the guidance of an on-compus sponsor.  Funds will be available for six sponsors to visit their students during the summer to increase the quality of advising.  The student work will culminate in the preparation of a paper evaluated for credit at their home institution, a presentation at an annual consortium research symposium, and a four-page contribution to the symposium proceedings.  Students are also encouraged to present their results at professional society meetings and to work with faculty on joint publications.",
