 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Steven Kuhn and a\r\ngroup of international researchers will continue archaeological excavations\r\nat UUagizli (\"three mouths\") cave in south-central Turkey.  The team includes\r\nprofessional archaeologists, physical anthropologists, geologists, and specialists\r\nin the analysis of ancient plant remains, as well as graduate students from\r\nthe U.S., Turkey, and western Europe.  The central goal of the project is\r\nto examine evidence for marked changes in human behavior within the earliest\r\nUpper Paleolithic period, and to place these developments in their environmental\r\ncontext. Archaeological deposits at the site span the period between about\r\n30,000 and 43,000 years before present. Although humans with essentially\r\nmodern skeletal anatomy had appeared much earlier, many researchers believe\r\nthat it was only after 45,000 years ago that there is evidence in Eurasia\r\nfor complex technologies, symbolic communication and art, and other features\r\nof material, social and intellectual life that distinguish fully modern\r\nhumans from their ancestors.  Results from excavations at UUagizli cave\r\nto date have helped expand our understanding of changes in economies and\r\ntechnology for this crucial interval in human history.  The site has also\r\nyielded remains of what are among the earliest ornament-making traditions\r\nin Eurasia. These findings are especially important because they document\r\nthe use of material culture as a medium of symbolic communication, long\r\nconsidered an important rubicon in human cognitive evolution.  One issue\r\nguiding the research is whether developments in human behavior after 45,000\r\nyears ago represent local responses to changing ecological and demographic\r\nconditions, or whether they reflect the appearance of new human populations\r\nwith enhanced cognitive abilities. Continuing excavations will allow us\r\nto examine in detail the timing of major shifts in behavior, and whether\r\nthey occurred independently or in concert. Studies of animal bones, remains\r\nof shellfish, as well as ancient pollen and phytoliths (durable crystalline\r\ncomponents of plant tissues) will allow us to place these developments in\r\ntheir environmental context, helping to distinguish broad evolutionary trends\r\nwithin the human species as a whole from local adaptations to changing conditions.\r\n At the same time, the project is helping to establish new links between\r\nacademic institutions in Turkey and the United States.  Through their participation\r\nin the research, students from Ankara University obtain training in field\r\nand lab methods. In exchange, American graduate students get valuable\r\noverseas research experience as well as material for theses and dissertations.\r\n\r\n",
