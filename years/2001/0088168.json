 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) \r\nThis project is incorporating new analytical instrumentation in undergraduate instructional laboratories -- an ICP-AES and an ion chromatograph (IC). With these instruments, we are restructuring the Earth Science curriculum, putting more emphasis on learning geochemical principles and processes, following the recommendations in Ireton, Manduca, and Mogk, \"Shaping the Future of Undergraduate Earth Science Education\" (AGU, 1996). Five key changes are taking place. (1) Upper-level courses in geochemistry are being redesigned to focus on low-temperature and environmental geochemistry. The laboratory component to these courses includes a skills enhancement component and a project component. (2) The project component is teaching students to develop a research proposal with an experimental design, to implement the research, and to analyze the research findings with an emphasis on technical writing skills. This part of our project is adapting the work of Catherine Carlson in designing a hydro-geochemistry course at Eastern Connecticut State University, \"Field Research as a Pedagogical Tool for Learning Hydrogeochemistry and Scientific Writing Skills,\" Journal of Geoscience Education (1999) Vol. 47, pp. 150-157. (3) We are adding a project-based component to the introductory geology course, giving students experience in the use of analytical instruments, data collection, and analysis. This feature is adapting the approach developed by Dunnivant et al., \"A Comprehensive Stream Study Designed for an Undergraduate Non-Majors Course in Earth Science,\" Journal of Geoscience Education (1999) Vol. 47, pp. 158-165. Students are required to undertake an environmental investigation using locally available groundwater and surface water resources. (4) We are providing enhanced opportunities for undergraduates in the honors program and in independent study to use advanced analytical techniques in their projects. (5) In addition we are providing enhanced opportunities for undergraduates in the senior seminar. We have redesigned this seminar to be a capstone course. The objective is to increase students' ability acquire and interpret geochemical data in support of broader earth science concepts and theories. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
