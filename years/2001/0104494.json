 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of the exploding Internet and the terra-bytes of\r\nheterogeneous data in it have made more acute the topic of searching\r\nsuch large digital databases. The challenges involved go beyond\r\nquestions in information retrieval. One may envision seeking images in\r\nfilms, seeking words in voice data, and seeking phrases in compressed\r\nfiles and in files of various types.\r\nThese challenges have boosted the appearance of myriad start-up\r\ncompanies and ad-hoc methods for the various tasks.\r\nThe PI's approach has been a basic bottom-up long-term study of the\r\ntheory of searching. They have a large center of pattern matching\r\nresearch that has pursued and continues to pursue understanding of the\r\ntheoretical underpinnings of generalized searching, coupled with\r\napplications of their various ideas.\r\n\r\nthe current research will continue the investigation of issues in\r\ngeneralized searching. In particular:\r\n        1. Approximate indexing with a small number of errors.\r\n        2. In-place compressed search.\r\n        3. ``Reusable'' dynamic programming code.\r\n        4. Parameterized matching with ``don't care''s.\r\nResearch on the theory of image processing will also be\r\ncontinued. The particular areas of concentration are: \r\n\t1. The effect of digitization.\r\n\t2. Real multi-dimensional scaling.\r\n\t3. Efficient search of rotated images.\r\nThe investigators' research group has started a program of selective\r\nimplementation of advanced pattern matching ideas, some in conjunction\r\nwith research groups from other application areas. There are plans to\r\nimplement text fingerprinting ideas and test their applicability in\r\nIR. In addition a project is planned that incorporates many of the\r\nideas on searching compressed and heterogeneous files by constructing\r\nan automatic scientific home-page generator and maintainer (guaranteed\r\nto be an instant hit with all professors of Computer Science!).\r\n",
