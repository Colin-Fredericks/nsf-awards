 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hoppensteadt\r\n0109001\r\n     The investigator and his colleague study the relation\r\nbetween bifurcations in neural dynamics and electrophysiological\r\nfeatures of neurons.  There is growing understanding of the role\r\nof bifurcations in neuron dynamics.  Indeed, knowledge of all\r\nbifurcations in a neuron model can explain some features of\r\nneuron activity, such as the existence of oscillatory potentials,\r\nsynchronization, bursting, excitability, etc., without knowing\r\nelectrophysiological details.  However, there is little\r\nunderstanding of the relationship between electrophysiology and\r\nbifurcations in neural dynamics.  For example, why do certain\r\nionic currents or combinations of them result in an Andronov-Hopf\r\nbifurcation but not a saddle-node on limit cycle bifurcation?\r\n(These two types of bifurcations describe Hodgkin's\r\nclassification of excitable neurons.)  Over 100 different kinds\r\nof recognizable bifurcations result in bursting patterns of\r\nactivity.  A key question is whether or not one can determine for\r\na given type of bursting activity what combinations of ionic\r\ncurrents must (or must not) be involved.  The investigator and his\r\ncolleague introduce here a notion of minimal electrophysiological\r\nmodels classified by voltage gated, second messenger gated, and\r\nvariable Nernst potentials.  They map this classification onto the\r\nexisting classification of bifurcation mechanisms in neuron\r\ndynamics.  This yields a deeper understanding of nonlinear\r\ndynamics of electrophysiological systems.\r\n     How does a brain encode and process information?\r\nMathematics has played an important role in studies of this\r\nproblem to date by creating methods for analyzing results\r\nobtained by life science and medical researchers.  There is a\r\nwell-developed electrophysiological theory of how neural tissue\r\ncan sustain and propagate electrical activity using ionic\r\ncurrents.  At the same time there is an emerging mathematical\r\ntheory based on canonical models of bifurcations, which are\r\nobservable changes in a biological preparation in response to\r\nstimulation.  This project brings these two lines of inquiry\r\ntogether by classifying dynamical systems (mathematical\r\nstructures) in terms that are consistent with electrophysiology.\r\nThe result is a deeper understanding of nonlinear phenomena in\r\nelectrophysiological systems.\r\n\r\n",
