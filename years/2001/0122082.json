 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Scalable Enterprise Systems Phase II grant funds an investigation of scalable techniques for real-time order promising by discrete build-to-order environments facing dynamic order arrivals.  The algorithms to be developed in this project for calculating due dates accurately consider current time-phased availability of resources and materials, prior order commitments, and the current system state.  The presence of various alternates (resource paths or material sources) creates combinatorial complexity.  To increase performance, the promising algorithms will integrate (1) theoretically sound heuristic techniques developed through research, (2) scalable optimal algorithms such as shortest path, and (3) computational technology.  One of the heuristics to be examined is based on a novel, even controversial, idea-- for the purposes of promising, the time when a resource will be available to process an operation can be estimated with sufficient accuracy by considering only a partially ordered task plan.  Current support for this principle is based on practical experience but little scientific evidence.  A key tenet of this project is that the results be highly scalable.  Consequently, joint research occurring at the intersection of Industrial Engineering and Computer Science is both necessary and synergistic in this project since the algorithmic aspects of promising and advanced computational approaches for technological realization are intertwined when research is performed in a large-scale systems context.  Algorithms will be implemented in an object-oriented, event-driven, memory-resident, multi-threaded architecture for detailed study and empirical evaluation.  \r\n\r\nOne of the most important short-term customer service decisions is making accurate promises in response to requests from customers or business partners.  Surprisingly, very little research has been done in this area.  While a vast body of literature exists on scheduling to meet prescribed due dates, very little work addresses how due dates that are tight yet achievable may be assigned.  Results of this research will increase the accuracy and speed with which these due date promises can be made, which in turn will have a very significant impact on revenues, operating expenses, and customer satisfaction.  This research is directly applicable to manufacturers that increasingly are selling built-to-order products direct to customers via the Internet and to a future where collaborative commerce freely occurs among dynamically recombinant business partners.\r\n",
