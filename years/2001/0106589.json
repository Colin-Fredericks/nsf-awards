 "awd_abstract_narration": "1. The proposed project covers several topics in Probabilistic\r\nCombinatorics.  The first group of questions is about graph colorings.\r\nIt mainly deals with the study of chromatic and choice numbers of\r\ngraphs satisfying certain local conditions. One of the open problem\r\nwhich investigators will study is bounding the chromatic number of a\r\ngraph G with maximum degree d, which contains no copy of a fixed graph\r\nH. A variant of this problem was posed already twenty years ago by\r\nKomlos and Szemeredi and so far it was solved only for some special\r\ncases. Investigator also plans to work on a few related questions\r\nabout vertex list coloring and acyclic edge coloring of graphs.\r\nAnother set of questions is about asymptotic properties of random graphs\r\nand random regular graphs. Here investigators goal is to understand\r\nthe distribution of independent sets of nearly optimal size in sparse\r\nrandom graphs, and use this to determine the asymptotic behavior of\r\nits choice number. It is sometimes the case that an existence proof,\r\nsupplied by the probabilistic method, is not sufficient and it is\r\nbetter to have an explicit construction. One of the major open\r\nproblems in this field is to construct exponentially large graphs,\r\nwithout a clique or an independent set of size k. In this project\r\ninvestigator intends to consider this problem together with its\r\nbipartite version. He also plans to study the properties of\r\npseudo-random graphs and their applications.\r\n\r\n2. Leave nothing to chance. This cliche embodies the common belief\r\nthat randomness has no place in carefully planned methodologies.\r\nIn modern Combinatorics at least, nothing can be further from the\r\ntruth. Here the Probabilistic Method has been developed intensively\r\nand become one of the most powerful and widely used tools.\r\nUse of probability proved to be helpful in tackling many long\r\nstanding open problems. Another major reason for the development of\r\nthis method is the important role of randomness in Theoretical\r\nComputer Science. Here algorithm which make random choices during its\r\nexecution proved to be simplest and fastest for many applications.\r\n",
