This instrument is significantly enhancing student laboratory experiences, incorporating modern technology into the classroom, and expanding course offerings. Experiments adapted from the research and educational literature and implemented into our curriculum are focusing on the multinuclear capabilities of the instrument, the ability to record 2-dimensional spectra, and the ability to do quantitative analysis through line-broadening experiments. Curricular changes are evolving as the NMR is incorporated into a new spectroscopy course, merged from a portion of three (currently ) separate courses, and it is becomes essential for the development of modular, Special Topics courses and new integrated laboratories. Students at all levels are readily obtaining their own spectra and thus are gaining valuable, hands-on experience with an instrument that has wide applicability in a modern research and/or quality control laboratory.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
