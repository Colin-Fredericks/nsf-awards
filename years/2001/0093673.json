 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the forces that shape international migration in the shadow of American immigration law, documenting how and why mail order bride migration has emerged as an issue for governments and nongovernmental organizations. Three questions will be addressed: Is the international marriage market an indicator of 'global feminism'? How have governments of the U.S. and the sending countries responded to this migration? What businesses or organizations encourage or discourage bride migration?  In examining these questions, this project builds on previous migration research in economics, politics, foreign relations, law, and feminism. Data will be collected in the U.S., Russia, and the Philippines. Interviews with marriage agents, immigration officials, and men and women seeking foreign mates will provide information about the business, government policies, and perceptions of the process by those involved. The findings will have implications for U.S. immigration policy, foreign relations between countries involved in this industry, and feminist international migration theory.",
