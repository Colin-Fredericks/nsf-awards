 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bio-Link's mission is to strengthen and expand biotechnology technician education at community and technical colleges throughout the nation in order to 1) increase the number and diversity of well-trained technicians in the workforce; 2) meet the needs of industry for appropriately trained technicians; and 3) institutionalize community college educational practices that make modern, high-quality education in the concepts, skills, and ethics of biotechnology available to all students.\r\nBio-Link's National Center at City College of San Francisco provides leadership to seven Regional Centers using a coordinated national strategy that is implemented through the Regional Centers. The Regional Centers are located at community colleges throughout the United States: Northeast-New Hampshire Community and Technical College; Southeast-Alamance Community College; North Central-Madison Area Technical College; South Central-Austin Community College; Northwest-Seattle Central Community College; Northern California Biotechnology Center-City College of San Francisco; and Southwest-San Diego City College. Regional Centers pursue a number of specific substantive activities that help Bio-Link achieve its objectives. Each region also develops relations with local industry and educational institutions in order to understand and meet regional needs and to distribute information locally.\r\nThe goals Bio-Link established are key to fulfilling its mission: 1) Provide support for students and technicians, 2) improve instruction & learning, 3) share information and resources, and 4) foster collaborations and partnerships. Some of the key accomplishments under these goals that continue to be supported include a survey of all biotechnology technician programs at community and technical colleges across the United States; an annual Summer Fellows Forum for community college and high school instructors from around the country to share best practices and learn new techniques; and the Bio-Link Website that contains information on a myriad of topics from job and workshop announcements to a virtual laboratory, equipment lists, and instructional materials.\r\nIn addition, Bio-Link solicits, tests, and reviews instructional materials; assists in program development; devises means for attracting students, especially underrepresented minorities, into biotechnology; and works with high schools and baccalaureate institutions to improve articulation.\r\nIn general Bio-Link helps educators keep up with an industry that is not only increasing in size, but expanding from research and development to manufacturing and computer analysis. In doing so, Bio-Link best prepares students to meet the evolving needs of the biotechnology industry.\r\n",
