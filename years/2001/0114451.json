The conference is organized by The IEEE History Committee and the IEEE History Center at Rutgers University. The grantees will be chosen by the Program Committee on the basis of merit from among those eligible participants registering for the workshop. As telecommunications become ever more important economically, politically, and socially, it is important to understand better their historical development. The conference will bring together both engineers and historians for two and a half days of paper presentations and discussions, shared breakfasts and lunches, and optional evening activities and excursions.",
