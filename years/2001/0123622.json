 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of under-representation of women in engineering and sciences is critical.\r\nThis is particularly true of senior women in engineering. To address this urgent problem\r\nof under-representation and to meet the marketplace demand for the technological\r\nworkforce in the 21 st century, a program is proposed that provides for mentoring and\r\nleadership development.\r\n \r\nThe aim of the Mentoring and Leadership Program is to sustain and broaden the existing\r\ninitiatives at Syracuse University to promote the advancement of women faculty in\r\nengineering and sciences. Some of the existing initiatives are the brainchild of WISE,\r\nwhich the PI co-directs with the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and others\r\nare the direct results of the PI's Meredith Professorship initiatives. The proposed\r\nMentoring and Leadership Program will capitalize on the existing initiatives and will \r\nintroduce new features that reflect current knowledge of leadership development. \r\n\r\nThe ADVANCE Leadership Award will also enable the PI to maintain an active\r\nresearch program while she develops and implements initiatives aimed at the\r\nadvancement of women students and faculty at Syracuse University.\r\nThis project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. \r\n",
