The conference will focus on four overlapping \r\nthemes: i) Mathematical Methods for Multiscale Problems, ii) Industrial \r\nMathematics, iii) Mathematical and Computational Biology, and iv) \r\nMaterial Science. Multiscaled models are found in a wide range of \r\napplications and pose difficulties for both mathematical and numerical \r\nanalysis. What is, for instance, the effect of the fine scale behavior on the \r\nsolutions? How well should the fine scales be resolved to obtain accurate \r\ninformation? etc.  The problems to be discussed in Industrial Mathematics \r\ncome from areas such as microelectronic, chemical manufacturing and \r\nmaterial processing, and will focus on the process of technology transfer. \r\nThe extreme complexity of the problems studied in Mathematical Biology \r\nprecludes a traditional \"pencil and paper\" approach and calls rather for an \r\nintegrated approach between mathematical modeling and computer \r\nanalyses. This trend has been accelerated by the development of \r\nproductive partnerships between experimentalists, theoreticians and \r\nmathematicians with similar interests but very different areas of expertise. \r\nSuccessful examples will be discussed. The study of emerging \r\napplications in the Material Sciences such as granular flows, thin films or \r\nsmart materials has led to the discovery of new kind of instabilities and \r\ninterface propagation problems. This session will aim at facilitating the \r\nmigration of the most successful analysis and computational techniques \r\nfrom specific areas of Material Science to other problems.\r\n\r\nThe conference aims at accomplishing three main goals: Interaction, \r\nShowcase, and New Activities. Interaction: The conference will provide a \r\nforum and gathering place for applied mathematicians in the Southeast. It \r\nwill reach out to several groups that are underrepresented in traditional \r\nmeetings. First, many successful collaborations have been established \r\nbetween applied mathematicians and scientists from local companies and \r\ngovernmental laboratories in technological parks such as Research \r\nTriangle Park, NC. Several industrial partners have been invited to give \r\npresentations. Second, there are emerging centers of excellence within the \r\nmany local colleges and historically black institutions. Speakers and \r\nstudents from such institution have been invited to contribute to the \r\nsuccess of the conference. Showcase: The high level of activity in Applied \r\nand Industrial Mathematics is not always accurately represented through \r\nthe usual channels of communication. Indeed, by its very nature, a sizable \r\npart of the work done in Industrial Mathematics gets to be published in \r\nspecialized engineering type journals, reaching only a small portion of the \r\nApplied Mathematics community. Conferences such as this one can play a \r\nfundamental role in unifying and improving approaches that may be \r\nsimilar in many aspects but are used in very distinct applications. Special \r\ncare has been taken to provide younger scientists and graduate students \r\nwith the opportunity to present their work and take an active part in the \r\nconference. New activities: The audience is expected to span a whole \r\nspectrum of expertise, experience and background, from recognized \r\nresearchers in academia to engineers from the private sector and national \r\nresearch laboratories to students and people with limited research \r\nexperience in Applied Mathematics. It is expected that not only will the \r\nconference give an accurate idea of significant ongoing and future trends \r\nin Applied Mathematics, but also will lead to new collaborations and \r\napplications.\r\n",
