 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for Lay Audience -Routtenberg\r\n\r\n       Perhaps the most  unnerving experiences in our intellectual lives is \r\nthe frustration of forgetting.  It is the over-arching view of the proposed \r\nresearch that 'why we forget' has to do with the faulty  chemistry of the \r\nbrain connections that form the memory network.   Indeed we have recently \r\ndiscovered using a model system of brain memory that we can prevent memory \r\nstorage and its retrieval.  Then, by giving a drug that activates a \r\nsignalling pathway that our laboratory described, we can reactivate the \r\nmemory.  Put another way, the key that turns on memory and its retrieval \r\nmay be like that used in the car's ignition.  What we have done is moved to \r\nthe next stage and 'hot-wired' memory processes, by-passing the initial \r\nswitch.  This pathway is thus critical to memory formation and retrieval.\r\n      Our studies employ gene targeting methods in transgenic mice to \r\nmodify the switches and signalling mechanisms (gene products or proteins, \r\none and all) that regulate both the chemistry of the brain connections and \r\nas a consequence the memory storage process.  We study the most widely used \r\nphysiological model of memory, long-term potentiation, which monitors the \r\nevents that occur at the synapse at the time when model memories are being \r\nstored.  We complement the gene targeting with pharmacological tools that \r\nallow us to confirm with converging lines of evidence the identified \r\nsequence of events involved in the storage of information.  Since gene \r\nmanipulation is not feasible in humans, this complimentary approach \r\nprovides the basis for drug discovery in the context of current molecular \r\nbiological technologies and suggest novel strategies in the war against \r\ncognitive and memory disorders.\r\n",
