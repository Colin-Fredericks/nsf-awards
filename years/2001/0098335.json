 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constrained Power and Performance Optimization for Embedded Systems\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to explore techniques for power management of\r\nembedded systems with provable bounds on power efficiency as well as adverse\r\neffects on latency due to power management.  The current state of the art in\r\nsystem-level power management is limited to shutting parts of a system after\r\na certain period of idle time, thus ignoring the application timing\r\nconstraints, runtime traffic and application usage information.  This work\r\nwill develop power-performance control \"knobs\" that will allow us to make\r\neffective online decisions. Specific applications will include power-aware\r\nresource scheduling in RTOS, timing-aware power optimizations and tradeoffs\r\nbetween power savings and application quality of service (e.g., missed\r\ndeadlines).\r\n\r\nOur technical focus is on solving two key problems:  (a) latency-constrained\r\npower optimization, i.e., minimization of system-level power consumption\r\nwith constrains on the effect of system latency due to power management; and\r\n(b) power-constrained performance optimization, e.g., system-level task\r\nimplementation and scheduling within a given power budget. As a first step,\r\nwe focus on analytic bounds on the effectiveness of online power management\r\nalgorithms and their efficiency by developing bounds on latency increases\r\ndue to power management.  We introduce the notion of a competitive ratio as\r\na quantitative measure of how well a given power management algorithm\r\nperforms against an optimum power consumption profile. Next, we incorporate\r\nthese analytic bounds in a broader system-level timing and power simulation\r\nengine which enables an accurate performance simulation while minimizing the\r\ndetails related to actual system functionality. Our experimental evaluation\r\nis through RTOS implementation of  new power management services through\r\ncoordinated scheduling and resource shutdown.\r\n\r\n",
