 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a new optically transparent intrinsically conducting polymer (ICP) that can be processed from organic solutions.   Despite much information on ICPs in the technical literature, the number of commercial applications of ICPs is still very small because of their intrinsically poor stability and the lack of reasonable processing methods.   Phase II will address the problem of processability.  Phase I successfully prepared ICPs that are soluble up to 15% weight in alcohols.  Cast films are optically transparent, have conductivity of 1-100 Siemens per centimeter, and maintain constant conductivity when elongated up to 30%.  ICPs were made from commercially available monomers.  Phase II will bring the polymers developed in Phase I from a feasibility stage to commercial products by optimizing their composition and synthesis and scaling up production and purification. \r\n\r\nThese materials could be used to replace indium tin oxide in flat panel displays and other electronic applications.  ICPs are expected to find application in the manufacture of electronic components, inks, biomedical materials, electronic devices, and specialty coatings.\r\n\r\n",
