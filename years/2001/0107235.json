 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Twenty First Fungal Genetics Conference is being held at the Asilomar Conference Center at Asilomar, California on March 13-18, 2001. Approximately 650 scientists and students from around the world are expected to  attend. The conference focuses on the molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology of filamentous fungi. This meeting consists of four plenary sessions, four sessions devoted to concurrent workshops in specialized areas, three poster sessions and time set aside for informal discussions. Topics covered in the plenary sessions are: Comparative and Functional Genomics, Fungal-Host Interactions, Cell Biology, and Genome Structure and Maintenance.  Specialized sessions cover  Signal Transduction in Growth, Adaptation and Development; Comparative and Evolutionary Genomics; Mating and Heterokaryosis; Fungal Photobiology and Clocks; Mutation, DNA Repair/Genome Stability; Plant Pathogenesis: Mycotoxins, Secondary Metabolism and Gene Clusters;  Accessory Genetic Elements: Introns, Plasmids Prions and Transposons; Horizontal Gene Transfer; New Tools: Microarrays, Transcriptome, Knockouts and Transposon Tagging; and Fungi in Teaching. In this meeting, strong emphasis is placed on the participation of young scientists and students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. The meeting actively promotes the interaction of these junior scientists with more senior scientists in the field to allow them opportunities to develop collaborations. Funds are to help defray the travel and participation costs of students, postdoctorals and others who would otherwise be financially unable to attend.",
