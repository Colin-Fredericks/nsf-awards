 "awd_abstract_narration": "0099868\r\nTsukruk\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop robust nanocomposite molecular coatings of advanced polymers with controlled mechanical and tribological properties.  These coatings would serve to enhance the performance of microdevices such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) by improving their resistance to contact deformation and friction and by providing controllable surface nanomechanical properties.  The approach is to combine two-step self-assembly and grafting routines to fabricate multifunctional coatings from advanced polymeric materials with appropriate nanomechanical properties.  The chemical grafting of the polymer layers onto the functionalized silion surface will then be explored in order to produce wear resistant and superelastic coatings.  A grafted rubber matrix will be reinforced by interconnected glassy nanodomains to enhance its wear resistance.  The grafting technique will also be used to grow nanocomposite brush layers with two dissimilar polymers, soft-hard alternating, and with reversible adaptive intralayer reorganization.  Mapping of mechanical properties will be done with a nanoprobing/nanoindentation technique adapted for compliant coatings.\r\n\r\nRobust, uniform, nanometer thick polymer coatings which are uniformly and firmly anchored to solid surfaces and which have low adhesion energy and variable elastic modulus and wettability are expected to be highly beneficial for the operation of nano- and microdevices in real world applications, where they are exposed to humid air and bio and chemo fluids.  This will expand the application range of these devices significantly.\r\n***",
