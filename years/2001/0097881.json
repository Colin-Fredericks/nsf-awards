 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator's research integrates a number of diverse areas in\r\nmathematics: logic, set theory, algebra, topology, and analysis,\r\nas well as some automated reasoning techniques from computer science.\r\nIn topology, the investigator focuses on properties of\r\nStone spaces, compact homogeneous spaces, and Bohr topologies.\r\nTopology and analysis are integrated in this research; measure theory is\r\nused to construct topological spaces with interesting properties,\r\nwhile the topological properties of a space are used to prove theorems\r\nabout the possible measures which can exist on the space.\r\nThe investigator studies Bohr topologies, which involve giving a topology\r\nto arbitrary abstract groups or other structures; this subject has its\r\nroots in the harmonic analysis of the 1930s; modern questions in this\r\narea relate to general topology, Fourier series, and functional analysis.\r\nLogic and set theory are relevant because results in topology and measure\r\ntheory are frequently independent of the usual axioms of set theory; when a\r\nresult is proved independent, the methods used are those of formal logic. \r\nIn algebra, the investigator works on algebraic systems such as\r\nquasigroups and loops.  Automated reasoning tools are very useful\r\nhere, primarily in the study of non-associative systems.  These\r\nsystems are described by fairly simple axioms, and a computer search\r\ncan often reveal interesting new consequences of these axioms. \r\nHowever, the investigator combines the computer use with\r\nclassical arguments involving combinatorics and group theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n    There are two distinct, but related, threads to this research.\r\nThe first thread involves the expansion of our knowledge of traditional\r\npure mathematics.  There is no specific practical application in mind\r\nhere, although topology arises naturally in an attempt to generalize\r\nproperties of the geometry of physical space, and measure\r\ntheory is a natural extension of the notion of probability.\r\nThe second thread involves automated reasoning (AR) tools.  AR allows the\r\ncomputer to derive logical conclusions from given knowledge.  This subject\r\nhas been in existence since the 1960s, but it is only in recent years that\r\nthe hardware and software have become powerful enough to discover conclusions\r\nwhich could not have been discovered without computer assistance.\r\nThis second thread is a continuation of the investigator's work in\r\nimproving the AR tools and using these tools to create new results\r\nin mathematics.  This is of interest not only for the\r\nmathematics itself, but because it demonstrates the power of the tools,\r\nwhich can then be applied to reasoning tasks in other areas of science\r\nand engineering, as well as to autonomous decision making by robotic agents.\r\n",
