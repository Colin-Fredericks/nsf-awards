 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a lightweight infrastructure for deploying workflow services into digital libraries that can be tailored to meet users' unique needs. Such workflow requirements typically involve multiple stakeholders distributed across different organizations who must coordinate their actions. Recent advances in event messaging systems, hypermedia, and Web-based technologies (such as XML), are being used to create a lightweight workflow technology to help the stakeholders of a digital library coordinate their shared activities. The technology is being designed to support a low entry barrier to use, multiple computing platforms, and a certain level of autonomy to the individual organizations that adopt it. Evaluation of the project's techniques and technology is being undertaken using the workflow processes of three \"real-world\" digital libraries: the Web Portal to the Scientific Computing Division of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the JESSE electronic journal, associated with the Digital Library for Earth System Education, and the JIME electronic journal.\r\n",
