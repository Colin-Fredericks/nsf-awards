 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to increase opportunities for students to successfully complete degree programs in engineering, telecommunications engineering, electronics technology, mathematics, and computer science. Objectives of the CSEMS project are to increase the matriculation, retention, and graduation rates of students enrolled in five degree programs, establish new and enhance existing support programs for students, increase the awareness of high school students about the opportunities in the CSEMS fields, increase partnerships with industry and government agencies for internships and permanent hires of the CSEMS scholarship graduates, and create assessment tools that will be used to monitor the impact of the CSEMS project on the community. Internships are an important component to the CSEMS project. Special effort is being given to strengthening existing relationships with industry and identifying new sources of internships for CSEMS students in the private and government sectors. Forging new partnerships with the private sector enhance CSEMS students' opportunities for terminal employment.",
