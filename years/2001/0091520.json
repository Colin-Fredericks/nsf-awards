 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance full-field, three-dimensional image correlation measurement technology to a level far beyond the current state-of-the-art.  The research will produce a prototype commercial measurement system that will present a cost effective solution to a wide range of deformation measurement problems.  The four areas of research for this project are: system calibration, algorithm development, distributed computing and system validation. The completion of this project will result in an easy-to-use, real-time measurement system applicable to a wide range of size scales with high accuracy and a known level of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe unique ability to simultaneously measure surface shape, displacement and strain with high accuracy meets industrial measurement demands in many areas. The method is ideally suited for structural evaluation, computer model verification, non-destructive testing, material property measurement and shape measurement. Among others, the technology has applications in the following industries:  automotive industry, commercial aviation manufacturers, space vehicle manufacturers, academic research institutions, government laboratories, and the biomedical and electronic packaging industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
