SCC is adamant in our belief that in order to attract more students into these disciplines, our instructional methodologies, as well as advanced teaching devices, are the key to induce student curiosity and eventual enrollment into SMET fields. By developing a five-year plan based on research, we believe we can successfully pursue other resources for the implementation of our SMET plan. Therefore, SCC has developed the following major objective which will guide us during this initial 12-month planning process: \r\nMajor Project Objective \r\nDuring the project period of January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002, SCC will develop a researched-based five-year institutional plan to enhance our SMET program as measured by internal and external evaluation results and the plan being formally adopted by the SCC Board of Regents prior to the end of the project period. \r\nCOLLABORATIVE PARTNERS \r\nStone Child College will coordinate this project with our Packard Foundation project, DoD project, MSEIP projects, as well as other proposed projects SCC has currently written and are awaiting approval/disapproval. \r\nTOTAL FUNDS REQUESTED $50,000.
