 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a tremendous market for tetherless and ubiquitous network\r\naccess, and a great demand for nomadic computation and\r\ncommunication. A major component of such a system is a high speed\r\nrobust wireless local area network (WLAN) that provides services for a\r\nlimited geographical area. This limited geographical area enables a\r\nlarge density of access points as well as high power tranmissions and\r\nopens up the possibility of high rate robust multimedia communications\r\ncomparable to wired systems. Even though the bandwidth is still\r\nscarce, the spatial dimension can now be exploited: The size of\r\ntypical WLAN devices, such as laptops and hand-held computers, enable\r\nproper spacing of multiple antennas to provide diversity and coding\r\ngains.\r\n\r\nThis research is aimed at a complete system design for multiple\r\nantenna methods in the WLAN environment including coding, modulation,\r\nchannel estimation and power control strategies specifically tailored\r\nfor the slow fading environment of a WLAN channel. In particular,\r\nhigh-rate multiple antenna coded modulation techniques and multiple\r\ntransmit antenna joint source and channel coding strategies are\r\ndeveloped. The issue of channel estimation along with feedback is\r\ninvestigated and power control based on limited feedback is adressed.\r\nA general approach to multiple transmit antenna methods is explored by\r\nproviding a theoretical foundation for spatially separated antennas in\r\nWLAN environments. \r\n\r\nThe education plan is closely aligned with the research work and\r\nemphasises the use of internet and computers in education by making\r\nuse of Polytechnic University's newly installed WLAN system on\r\ncampus. Curriculum development addresses specific needs of\r\nPolytechnic's professional masters program and is based on an\r\nintegrated, end-to-end approach to communication systems.",
