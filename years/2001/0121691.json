 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is promoting wide-spread access to quality information, resources, and activities in support of learning, teaching, and research in the areas of geotechnical engineering, rock engineering, and water and its use. The effort is envisioned as a component of a larger national civil engineering digital library providing \"one-stop\" access to resources to meet the learning, teaching and research needs of a wide audience including higher education, professionals, and the community at large. The project expects significant benefits to accrue as citizens gain awareness of the importance of these areas of civil engineering activities in their daily lives. In formal educational settings a direct impact is expected on undergraduate, graduate and continuing education as users gain rapid access to educational resources dealing with cutting edge civil engineering advances. A host portal provides access to collections of reviewed and ranked resources in the three target areas, and growth of the collection is planned in other areas of civil engineering. An advisory panel is assisting the project in areas of user needs assessment, testing of learning objects, and dissemination of information about the project.",
