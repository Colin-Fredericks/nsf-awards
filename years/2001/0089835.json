Balents and his group at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Pierre Le Doussal and his group at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, France.  The investigators propose to extend and apply elastic models of materials that describe: vortex lattices in type II superconductors; pinned charge density waves and Wigner crystals; domain walls in ferromagnets; and quantum Hall bilayers.  Functional normalization group methods, quantum transport methods and inclusion of topological defects will be utilized.  The objective is to develop more realistic descriptions of coarsening and aging of experimentally relevant systems and use the models to explore transport, dissipation, non-linear and glassy dynamics in the quantum region.  The US group brings to this collaboration expertise in disordered systems. They will focus on quantum transport and applications of low-dimensional conductors and other effects.   This is complemented by expertise of the French group in disordered systems and their new techniques to describe topological defects. \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF's Division of International Programs and Division of Materials Research will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator, postdoctoral researcher and/or graduate student.  The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of interactions and disorder in modern materials and the coarsening and aging process of materials. \r\n",
