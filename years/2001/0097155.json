 "awd_abstract_narration": "To advance the state-of-the-art in conjugated polymeric transistors by examining ordered conjugated polymer systems and developing ways to engineer it for enhanced mobilities and improved current drive capability. This project will investigate polymeric thin film transistors (TFT) using oriented conjugated polymers to elevate mobility and polymers doped with low molecular weight compounds to enhance charge injection. Recipes and materials developed in Germany will be used to orient and dope the polyflourenes and apply them to polymeric field effect transistors (FET). Processing schemes will be developed to fabricate prototypes which reduce the source/drain resistance to the channel while maintaining compatibility with polymer processing.\r\n\r\nThis project team will design, fabricate and test polymeric field effect transistors to advance active matrix polymeric flat panel displays. Large area displays, which could be manufactured using cheap reel-to-reel batch technology, and which are ultra-thin and flexible could become a reality soon. Flexible displays and low production costs make light emitting polymers (LEP) a competitive option for the manufacture of flat panel display technology. Development of polymer electronics will fuel this revolution by their integration with LEPs into smart pixels for active matrix displays. This proposal addresses some of the key impediments to this realization.",
