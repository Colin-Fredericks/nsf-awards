 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies  various K-theories  of algebraic varieties\r\nand their relation to arithmetic cohomologies. In the case of classical\r\nalgebraic K-theory this relation has found numerous applications in\r\nnumber theory, for example, to special values of L-functions of motives.\r\nIn the last couple of year the investigator has introduced log-K-theory\r\ngroups of log-schemes (log-scheme is a generalization of a toric variety)\r\nand studied their basic properties.  She proposes to continue studying\r\nthese groups as well as regulator maps into log-crystalline and log-etale\r\ncohomologies.  She believes  that this will have important arithmetic\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThis proposal deals with number theory and algebraic geometry. \r\nNumber theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers\r\nand is the oldest branch of mathematics. Algebraic geometry studies\r\ngeometric figures that can be defined by the simplest of equations,\r\nnamely polynomials. The questions and phenomena which arise from\r\ncombining these two subjects serve as driving forces in much of\r\ncontemporary mathematics research. Moreover, the combination of\r\nthese subjects has contributed many applications in such diverse\r\nareas as codes and data transmission, robotics, and theoretical\r\ncomputer science.",
