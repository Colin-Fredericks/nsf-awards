Approximation of Riemannian \r\nmanifolds by polyhedral metrics and generalization of Alexandrov embedding\r\ntheorem. The PI has proved that approximability by polyhedral metrics\r\nimplies a new kind of curvature bound which appears naturally but has never been\r\nconsidered in geometry before. The proof is interesting in its own right,\r\nas it uses a Lemma closely resembling the Alexandrov embedding theorem\r\n(which states that any positively curved metric on a 2-sphere is isometric\r\nto a convex surface in a Euclidean space). This brings us back to a more\r\ngeometrical point of view on Riemannian Geometry, according to which\r\n``interesting'' curvature bounds should arise from properties of\r\nembeddings of manifolds into Euclidean space. This circle of ideas also\r\ngives a new approach to the old conjecture that every simply connected\r\nRiemannian manifold with positive curvature operator is diffeomorphic to a\r\nsphere; \r\n2. Collapsing with lower curvature bound. The general goal of this topic\r\nis to understand how collapsing with lower curvature and diameter bounds\r\nhappens and, in the very best case, to construct a structure analogous to\r\nthe one obtained by Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov for the case of bounded\r\ncurvature.\r\n3. Gate spaces.  Gate spaces are related to a circle of problems arising\r\nfrom the question of K.Grove of whether there is an Alexandrov space that\r\nhas two different smoothings into Riemannian manifolds of the same\r\ndimension and lower curvature bound;\r\n4. Applications of megafolds to collapsing with bounded curvature and to \r\nRicci flow.  Megafolds are a generalization of Riemannian manifolds and\r\norbifolds that has already proved it usefulness for collapsing with\r\nbounded curvature; in particular, they were used by the PI to prove, in\r\ncoloboration with W.Tuschmann, the main part of the Klingenberg-Sakai\r\nConjecture. Such a collapsing also arises naturally from the rescaling of\r\nthe Ricci flow; it can be used to construct singularity models for the\r\nRicci flow with no injectivity radius estimates; \r\n5. Theory of Alexandrov spaces.  Alexandrov spaces appear naturally as\r\nlimits of Riemannian manifolds with lower curvature bound. Most geometric\r\nresults which are true for Riemaninan manifolds with lower curvature bound\r\nare also true for Alexandrov spaces; however, there are several such\r\nresults that cannot be generalized. For example, it is not known whether a\r\nconvex hypersurface in an Alexandrov space is also an Alexandrov\r\nspace. Such problems are mostly due to the lack of local analysis, and\r\nthat is what the PI proposes to study.\r\n\r\n\r\nRiemannian manifold, which could be considered as a simplified version of\r\nspace-time, is a way too complicated object. The first topic in this\r\nproposal is aimed at studing Riemanian manifolds by means of approximation\r\nby simpler objects. These objects are polyhedral spaces, i.e. spaces glued\r\nof Euclidean polyhedra. The other topics considers a different approach to\r\nstuding Riemannian manifolds. It is based on considering extremal metrics,\r\nin an appropriate sense, for example how Riemannian manifolds collapse to\r\nlower dimenssional objects. This method makes possible to get new results\r\nin the main stream direction of Riemannian geometry: how to make\r\nconclusions about global structure of space basing on local properties.\r\n\r\n",
