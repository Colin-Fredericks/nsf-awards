 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past thirty years Spelman College has made great strides in its efforts to increase the\r\nnumber of women and the number of African American students who complete bachelor's degrees\r\nin mathematics and who enter into and persist in graduate programs in the sciences, mathematics and\r\nengineering. Those efforts have resulted in a greater understanding of the academic training and early\r\nprofessional development needs, and the support mechanisms required to attract these students into\r\nthe higher levels of academic excellence and academic leadership. It has also resulted in a cadre of\r\nwomen faculty who hold leadership positions throughout the SEM areas in their own disciplines.\r\nThe current ADVANCE project intends to capitalize on past success by pursuing the following\r\ngoals:\r\n\r\na. Use scholarly writings to disseminate information regarding support structures\r\naimed at increasing retention among women in graduate mathematics programs; and\r\ninformation on support mechanisms to advance the careers of women in the scientific\r\ncommunity.\r\nb. Facilitate the transition of the PI back to a full-time research and teaching position\r\nfollowing a period of long-term leadership in efforts to expand the pipeline of\r\nacademic leaders in SEM areas.\r\nc. Increase the capacity of women to assume academic positions in higher education\r\nas mathematicians and to advance to leadership roles in the science, engineering and\r\nmathematics academic community, with a particular emphasis on minority women.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.\r\n",
