 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of Dr. George Gatewood's long term astrometric program at Allegheny Observatory is to provide high precision astrometric data for groups of astrophysically interesting stars that either can not or will not be studied by other techniques.  These include stars that are too bright for CCD observing systems and for the FAME spacecraft, as well as stars for which the motion is too slow for detection by short term (5years) astrometric programs.  \r\n\r\nTheoretical understanding of the formation and evolution of stellar systems sometimes requires a data base extending over decades.  Because they are the best studied, the bright stars are often the most informative examples that can be studied.  The study of triple and quadruple star systems yield indications of the formation and evolution processes of stars and brown dwarfs, as opposed to that of planetary systems.  Detections of the long term motions of apparently single stars are giving us the first indications of planetary systems that are similar to the Solar System.   \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
