Professor Roger Bilham, University of Colorado Boulder will convene a three-day international meeting for scientists and engineers to discuss the scientific findings and implications of this earthquake.  With fatalities exceeding 20,000, this was the most disastrous event in India's recorded history.  The first day of the workshop will be devoted to seismological, geologic and geodetic investigations, the second to acceleration and engineering effects, and to the characterization of seismic risk in India, the third to general discussions on the seismotectonic implications of recent earthquakes in India and to their association with plate boundary processes and underlying plate dynamics.   \r\n\r\nScope:  The Bhuj event had a number of features that resemble the mid-continent 19th century earthquakes of North America.  The expectation is that discussions will provide insights into the causes of the Bhuj earthquake and of mid-cratonic events in general.  This will be a forum for Indian and foreign scientists that have undertaken relevant post-seismic and theoretical investigations to compare their findings.  The Indian Department of Science and Technology is cofunding this workshop; it is jointly funded by NSF's  Division of International Programs and Division of Earth Sciences.   \r\n\r\n",
