 "awd_abstract_narration": "Impact of the World Trace Center Disaster on Critical Infrastructure Interdependence\r\nThis exploratory research focuses on time sensitive data and field research related to the devastating impacts of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City, NY on September 11, 2001. The objective of this research is to increase our knowledge base of and model the interdependencies of critical infrastructure systems with the aim of understanding their vulnerabilities to disasters of this type and scale. A systems approach will be used to represent 1) designed or intended infrastructure interdependencies; 2) the impacts of the attack overall and during emergency response; and the effects and needs related to interdependencies during recovery operations. Much of the information will only be available in the early phases of response. \r\nInfrastructure interdependencies have been identified by Presidential Decision Directive 63 as a part of the Critical Infrastructure Protection initiative. Understanding interdependencies is key to efficient funds allocation for design, construction, operations, maintenance, operations and security of our nation's infrastructure. Interdependencies imply the potential for cost-efficiencies through redundancy reductions as well as disastrous vulnerabilities through cascading losses of lifelines and lives. This results of this research will be used to identify opportunities for reducing vulnerabilities, developing countermeasures to mitigate the impacts of disruptions, and guide actions for response and recovery. \r\n",
