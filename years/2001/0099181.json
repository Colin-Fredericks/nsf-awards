 "awd_abstract_narration": "BSCS is developing a 10th-grade curriculum unit on evolution and on science as a way of knowing.  Included is a 100-page, six-chapter book to be used by students and a teacher's guide that contains background information, implementation strategies and student assessments.  The first chapter of the student book deals with the nature of science and the issue of diversity and unity within and between species, the second with historical materials regarding evolutionary theory, the third with basic questions about diversity and adaptation, the fourth with genetics and molecular biology, the fifth with how evolution can be demonstrated experimentally with viruses and by reference to the AIDS epidemic and antibiotic resistance, and the sixth with the effects of humans on the environment and on natural selection.  Two CD-ROMs complement the program.  One includes samples of the writings of Darwin, maps of his voyages, and other historical materials as well as 2-3 student investigations for each chapter of the book.  The second CD-ROM is an interactive simulated inquiry based on contemporary research on finches in the Galapagos Islands.  Also included on the CD-ROMs are professional development materials for teachers.\r\n\r\n",
