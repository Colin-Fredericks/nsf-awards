 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Kay C  Dee at Tulane University to acquire a dual-photon/laser scanning confocal microscope.  This microscope will support the activities of a diverse consortium of biological researchers and educators in or near New Orleans, Louisiana (from Tulane University, the University of New Orleans, Xavier University, the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species, and the USDA Southern Regional Research Center).  A broad range of biologically-oriented research and education efforts will be significantly and positively impacted by the new instrumentation, ranging from fundamental studies of embryonic development, to examinations of cellular and molecular functions, to studies of bacterial biofilms and cotton fiber organization.  These distinct projects are connected through geographic location (greater New Orleans area) and through the need to obtain high-resolution, three-dimensional images of subcellular structures, in real-time or time-lapse, without associated phototoxicity or bleaching.  Confocal microscopy offers image resolutions far superior to those obtainable via conventional fluorescence microscopy, and allows the collection and assembly of sequential two-dimensional images to construct three-dimensional representations of a sample.  Dual-photon microscopy utilizes short pulses of a lower energy laser to control fluorescence from a sample in three dimensions, increasing sensitivity and drastically reducing the problems of photobleaching and phototoxicity. The dual-photon microscope is a state-of-the-art imaging tool, ideal for use in the research-intensive learning environments of the consortium.\r\nThe microscope will be housed in the Coordinated Instrumentation Facility (CIF) at Tulane University.  The mission of the CIF is to maintain, manage, and operate high-priced instrumentation for academic, non-profit, and private sector researchers; the CIF is a well-established provider of maintenance, operation, and technical support for instrumentation.  The CIF microscopy laboratory at Tulane is a convenient, central location for the new microscope, easily accessible by all members of the consortium of contributing researchers.  A summary list of the types of consortium research/educational projects for which the microscope will be used includes: embryo development and preservation; bacterial biofilms; tissue engineering, cellular signal transduction, and biomechanics; neurophysiology, endocrinology, and renal hemodynamics; cotton genetics and fiber quality; pharmaceutical and biotechnology applications; and oocyte maturation and fertilization.\r\nBy housing this state-of-the-art microscope in the CIF, whose goal is to supply instrumentation to researchers at Tulane as well as any and all neighboring institutions, the cutting-edge technology of dual-photon microscopy will certainly benefit researchers in the greater New Orleans area.  Moreover, this award has potential impact far beyond New Orleans, since no instrument with similar capabilities is currently available in the entire state of Louisiana.  The new microscope system will not only be accessible to researchers, but will also be used in mentored training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  Furthermore, programs (such as the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation, a \"3+2\" program between the Tulane School of Engineering and Xavier University, etc.) are in place to make these educational opportunities available to minority students.  In summary, the installation and shared use of the microscope will significantly strengthen scientific expertise and collaborations in Louisiana, and will therefore have a major impact on an area of the country geographically underrepresented in nationally-recognized scientific and engineering efforts.\r\n",
