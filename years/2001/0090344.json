Mourou, and the Laboratory for Applied Optics, French National Center for Scientific Research at the Ecole Polytechnique, directed by Daniele Hulin.  The groups will continue to collaborate on the development of next generation ultraintense lasers, in particular, aspects of high peak power, spatial and temporal beam quality, and new amplifying media. In this next phase, the groups will: (1) extend and characterize harmonic generation to the water window with good efficiency; (2) combine their efforts on electron acceleration and injection using Laser Wakefield Acceleration techniques. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration will be pursued through an exchange of US and French postdoctoral researchers.  Both sides will benefit from complementary expertise and facilities and will advance applications of ultrahigh laser intensities to new fields of physics research.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-supported by the Division of International Programs in the Directorate for Social, Behaviorial, and Economics Sciences and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n",
