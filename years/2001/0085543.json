They will develop a collection of follow-up activities (surveys & interviews, newsletter, and web-based resources) that will motivate, inform, and sustain a network of workshop alumni in K-14 geoscience education.  Over the course of this three-year project at least 150 scientists and educators will participate in this network.  The goals of the proposed project are: to build and maintain a national cadre of well informed geoscientists who can act as advocates and leaders for effective science education, and also as role models for scientific colleagues who become involved in improving K-14 geoscience education; to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of the education activities presently (and soon-to-be) underway in the geoscience community; and to provide geoscientists who are active in K-14 education with an opportunity to showcase their work and network with educators and other scientists involved in education.\r\n",
