The problem of nonuniform sampling and reconstruction\r\nis treated in the context of shift-invariant subspaces, Besov\r\nspaces, and in arbitrary dimensions.  The theory is developed for\r\nthe case when the samples are obtained from weighted averages.\r\nDensity conditions for exact reconstruction are established.  When\r\nthe data are noisy, incomplete, or when the assumptions needed\r\nfor exact reconstruction are not satisfied, bounds on the error\r\nbetween the reconstructed and original signal are derived in\r\nterms of the sampling densities, the averaging functionals, and\r\nthe noise statistics.  The development of the mathematical\r\nframework and the computational schemes requires a new set of\r\ntechniques and ideas, and involves several areas of mathematics\r\nincluding wavelet theory, frame theory, functional analysis, and\r\nharmonic analysis.\r\n     The project is motivated by problems arising in data\r\ntransmission, geophysical exploration, astronomy, spectroscopy,\r\nand biomedical imaging.  The problem of reconstructing a signal or\r\nan image from a set of nonuniform samples is encountered in many\r\napplications of signal or image processing.  For example, the loss\r\nof data packets during transmission through internet or from\r\nsatellites can be viewed as a nonuniform sampling and\r\nreconstruction problem.  In geophysical exploration, the earth's\r\nmagnetic field is measured by a combination of airborn, fast\r\nmoving acquisition devices, as well as scattered stationary\r\ndevices resulting in highly nonuniform sampling patterns, and a\r\nhuge data set.  The goal is to reconstruct the magnetic field and\r\nuse it to reveal geological features.  In fact, modern digital\r\ndata processing of signals or images always uses a sampled\r\nversion of the original analog signals or images.  However, the\r\nsampling devices are never ideal, and the collected data consist\r\nof average samples.  Moreover these data are often very large,\r\nincomplete, and corrupted by noise.  The question then arises\r\nwhether and how the original signal can be recovered from the\r\ndata.  Therefore the investigator aims to 1) quantify the\r\nconditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a signal\r\nexactly from different sets of nonuniform average-samples; 2) use\r\nthese analytical results to develop explicit, and computationally\r\nefficient reconstruction schemes; and 3) analyze the performance\r\nof the algorithms under adverse conditions, or when the data are\r\nincomplete or corrupted by noise.  The development of a theory and\r\nalgorithms that perform well under stringent and realistic\r\nsituations will help the analysis, processing and management of\r\nvery large data sets obtained digitally by new acquisition\r\nmodalities, and transmitted or received by communication networks\r\nsuch as the internet, cellular phones, and other distributed\r\ncommunication systems.\r\n\r\n",
