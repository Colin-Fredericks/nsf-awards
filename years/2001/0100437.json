A generalization of Nudelman's\r\nproblem in interpolation theory will be studied.  In the classical\r\ncase, existence criteria were given by M. Rosenblum and the PI using\r\nthe commutant lifting theorem.  The criteria imply a series of\r\nclassical interpolation results with both interior and boundary data.\r\nThe Ball and Helton generalization of the commutant lifting theorem\r\nyields an extension of Nudelman's problem to the generalized Schur\r\nclass which has similar applications.  New problems for boundary\r\ninterpolation and Hilbert transforms arise in the indefinite case and\r\nwill be studied in joint work with T. Constantinescu and A. Dijksma.\r\nD. Z. Arov and the PI will study Darlington synthesis for\r\nJ-contractive matrix-valued functions in the unit disk.  State spaces\r\nnow are Pontryagin spaces.  The approach follows previous work by Arov\r\nand also uses the factorization theory for pseudo-continuable\r\nfunctions by Rosenblum and the PI.  L. A. Sakhnovich and the PI will\r\nstudy indefinite cases of direct and inverse problems for canonical\r\ndifferential and difference equations by the method of operator\r\nidentities.  A recent Ph.D. dissertation by C. Hellings obtains a\r\ngeneralization of Richter's theorem on analytic two-isometries on\r\nPontryagin spaces.  This area is new and includes a number of open\r\nquestions and possibilities for further developments.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is concerned with problems in areas of mathematics which\r\nhave traditional connections with engineering and control theory and\r\nespecially the design of stabilizing feedback controllers and passive\r\nnetworks.  The main problem of interpolation theory is to reconstruct\r\na function from partial information such as given values of the\r\nfunction at specified points.  Usually the data of a problem satisfy a\r\npositivity condition depending on the class of functions under\r\nconsideration.  The proposal will study a unified method to deal with\r\none class of such problems in which the positivity conditions are\r\nreplaced by weaker assumptions.  The inverse problem of spectral\r\ntheory, which asks to reconstruct an operator from observed spectral\r\nproperties, is related to interpolation theory, and the effect of\r\nweakening positivity will again be considered.  Other problems are\r\nrelated to the embedding of a passive system into a conservative\r\nsystem: extensions will be considered in which systems contain active\r\nas well as passive elements.  Conservative systems correspond in some\r\nsense to isometric operators, and another group of problems explores\r\ngeneralizations of isometric operators in the absence of positivity.\r\nThe projects are in collaboration with colleagues in the U.S. and\r\nEurope.  Funding of the project will also provide support for an\r\nundergraduate research program in the Mathematics Department of the\r\nUniversity of Virginia that matches students one-on-one with\r\nmathematics professors for projects of approximately eight weeks in\r\n\r\n",
