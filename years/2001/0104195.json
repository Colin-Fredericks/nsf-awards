 "awd_abstract_narration": "A problem common to many disparate fields of scientific and industrial enquiry is\r\nthat of comparing a set of experimental conditions, or `treatments', when faced with\r\nheterogeneity in the units of material on which the experiment is to be performed. The\r\ntechnique of blocking specifically addresses this problem. Typically using values of some\r\nidentifiable nuisance factor, the experimental units are partitioned into homogeneous\r\nsubsets called blocks. Inferences can then be based on the more precise comparisons of\r\nmeasurements from the same block. The design problem is to determine which treat-\r\nments are assigned to which units in which blocks, said assignment being driven by\r\nthe desire to maximize the quality of information that will ultimately be produced.\r\nThe problem becomes more complicated as more nuisance factors, with various inter-\r\nrelationships, are introduced or identified. This project addresses the design problem\r\nfor a variety of commonly encountered experimental settings, with two broad goals:\r\n(i) to extend the known theory for determining optimal designs for a wider range of\r\nsettings than is now known or available; and (ii) to produce a comprehensive catalog\r\nof designs to be incorporated into a larger, web-based resource that will include a vari-\r\nety of downloadable combinatorial designs useful for statisticians, mathematicians, and\r\nother scientists in academia and industry. By collecting optimal designs in a single,\r\neasily accessible resource, the use of good designs can be increased and the practice of\r\nexperimental science consequently sharpened.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing v treatments, the most commonly encountered situation across a\r\nrange of scientific endeavors is that of a single blocking variable partitioning bk experi-\r\nmental units into b blocks of k units each. This project will examine optimality problems\r\nfor these simple block designs, and the attendant combinatorial issues, augmenting the-\r\nory by computation where needed, to produce designs for a practical range of parameter\r\ncombinations (v; b; k), including settings where equireplication is not possible. The most\r\nfrequently used designs with two blocking factors are row-column designs, in which two\r\nblocking factors can be visualized as row and columns in a rectangular array, and re-\r\nsolvable designs, in which a second blocking factor partitions a simple block design into\r\nsubsets of blocks each consisting of a single replicate. This project will also address\r\nproblems in optimality and construction of designs in both these classes, with special\r\nemphasis on plans most demanded in practice: those with few replicates.",
