 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to support faculty members and departments in efforts to assess student learning in at least one of the following:\r\n(1) Coherent blocks of courses of undergraduate mathematical sciences, including entire degree programs; and (2) Individual courses, especially reform courses, using various assessment tools across varieties of institutions. The targeted blocks of courses are: (a) the major in mathematics, (b) courses for future teachers; (c) school mathematics as a preparation for college mathematics, usually called college placement programs; and (d) general education courses, including those aimed at quantitative literacy. This latter block includes study of assessments of the mathematical and quantitative literacy achieved in entire degree programs, recognizing that much mathematics is learned outside mathematics courses. Assessment cycles that use assessment for program improvements are of special interest, including those that use research on learning.\r\n\r\nSupport from this work includes: (1) Nationwide distribution and discussion of a 1999 volume of case studies on assessment practices in undergraduate mathematics; (2) Compilation and nationwide distribution of a second volume of case studies and syntheses of coherent sets of case studies; (3) Construction and maintenance of a website to contain an annotated bibliography, literature synopses, interviews, and assessment designs; and (4) Development and operation of a series of workshops for faculty working\r\non campus-based assessment programs, including both face-to-face and electronic venues.\r\n\r\nAssessment cycles for program improvement have not been integrated into core operations of departments. This project greatly facilitates assessment program development through wide dissemination of knowledge gained through experiences with assessment. \r\n",
