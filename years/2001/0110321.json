On the Kaehler\r\nRicci flow problem,  I am working  with G. Tian. Our main results\r\nare:  in any Kaehler-Einstein manifolds, if the initial metric has positive\r\nbisectional curvature, then the flow converges exponentially to a\r\nunique Kaehler-Einstein metric.  I plan to work with him to eliminate\r\nwith the assumption of positive bisectional curvature or the assumption\r\nof Kaehler Einstein metrics. On the problem of geodesic, the main results\r\nof my research  are: a) there exists a  geodesic with second derivatives\r\nuniformly bounded, between any two Kaehler metrics in\r\na Kaehler class. A direct consequence of this result is that the constant\r\nscalar curvature metric is unique in each Kaehler class if the first\r\nChern class of the manifold is negative. b) the space of Kaehler\r\nmetrics is a metric space and it is non-positively curved in the\r\nsense of Alexandrov. On the problem of geodesic, I want to improve the\r\nregularity of geodesic to  three derivatives uniformly bounded\r\n(or to understand when this regularity might fail). That will be a very\r\nimportant consequence in Kaehler geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nKaehler Einstein metric arose naturally from Physics, algebraic geometry and\r\nsome other diverse areas of mathematics. Extremal Kaehler metric is a\r\nnatural generalization of these concepts by E. Calabi.  The method of finding these\r\nmetrics is by solving a totally nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation on\r\nmanifolds. Most of the time,  one can not find solution explicitly. Then one has to\r\nrely on various kind a priori estimates to determined when there exists a solution\r\nand if the solution metric should be unique.  In this project, we will develop some\r\nnew techniques to handle these difficult estimates. And these techniques will\r\nhave impact in other related problems of mathematics.\r\n",
