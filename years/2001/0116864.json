 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Zafra Lerman and Dr. Ken Ilio at the Science Institute of Columbia College, Chicago to establish a state-of-the-art cell and tissue culture laboratory. The proposed laboratory will support the research of Dr. Kenneth Ilio\r\n(co-PI) on prostate development that he will be conducting with students taking Science Institute courses.  In particular, he is devising a method to isolate stem cells, the most primitive cells in the adult prostate membranous tissue.  A major component of this research is cell culture, particularly defining culture conditions that will shift\r\ndifferentiation of candidate primitive stem cells to a more differentiated adult cell.  The long-term goal of this research is to establish both normal and transformed cell lines of specific lineages that are derived from the stem cells of the prostate.  The differentiated cells that arise from stem cells could be valuable tools as cell culture models for the study of prostate normal and abnormal development, particularly cancer development.\r\n\tThe cell culture lab complements existing laboratories in the Science\r\nInstitute, namely (1) the Science Visualization and Communications Laboratory where students can produce 2-D and 3-D models of scientific concepts and processes, and (2) an analytical laboratory where students can perform and replicate sophisticated experiments similar to those used in forensic and environmental investigations.  The proposed laboratory will service the cell culture needs of all the biology courses taught at the Science Institute.  Students will gain hands-on exposure in and basic understanding of cell biology in both microscopic and molecular levels.  In addition, acquisition of the cell culture laboratory will allow Chicago public school teachers in the Science Institute's network to conduct projects during the summer as well as during the academic year.  These research projects will enhance the teachers' instructional methods and materials in their classrooms.\r\n\tThe benefits of this curriculum to the general public are substantial by providing a strong science background to Columbia College's television, radio, journalism, education and other students, and to teachers in the Chicago public schools, the Science Institute is\r\npositively influencing the education of millions of people through these professionals.  Providing these communication and education students with first-hand research experience  will guarantee that an accurate and positive image of science will be communicated to the public, and will dramatically improve the public understanding of science.  It is anticipated that the exposure of teachers to this proposed facility and\r\nto the creative methods of teaching developed by the Science Institute will increase the number of students seeking careers in the sciences. Project results will be reported in professional conferences and in scientific journals, in addition to the print and electronic media that regularly report on programs of the Science Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
