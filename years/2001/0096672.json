 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates leadership curriculum materials designed to develop the skills, sensibilities and long-term capacity of teacher leaders, enabling them to design and implement quality mathematics professional development.  Curriculum materials are video-based (CD-ROM) cases illuminating various aspects of mathematics professional development practice.  Rooted in mathematics, a series of five modules (containing six three-hour cases) include video of professional sessions, mathematics activities, interviews, commentaries, research papers, articles, references to the literature, assignments designed to help apply learnings to practice and facilitator guides.  Materials are designed for flexible use as individual cases, as complete modules or as a comprehensive curriculum.  Rather than providing exemplars to model, these materials will utilize a case method, lesson-study approach where leaders inquire into professional development practice in mathematics K-12.  Modules are designed for use in facilitated sessions; text and video facilitation materials are integral to the final product.  The CD-ROM format provides for at home and distance learning capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe materials are designed for use by leaders of teacher leaders to help these teacher leaders:\r\n1. Deepen their knowledge of mathematics content;\r\n2. Develop the habits of mind that view professional development as a complex practice, foster a stance of inquiry about that practice and look at all professional development through the lens of equity;\r\n3. Build analytic skills and a language of practice that will enable the development of clearer communication and reasoning about mathematics professional development;\r\n4. Build a repertoire of strategies and facilitation moves that can be used to design and implement a thoughtful program of mathematics professional development. \r\n",
