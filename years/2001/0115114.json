 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Portland Public Schools (PPS) District is the largest district in the state of Oregon. It has an enrollment of almost 55,000 students in 64 elementary schools, 20 middle schools, 12 high schools and an increasing number of special focus and alternative programs. Of these schools 55 qualify for Title I assistance while approximately 49% of elementary students, 37% of middle school students and 28% of high school students participate in free/reduced lunch programs. Currently an estimated 38% of the students stem from minority backgrounds. PPS employs over 3,100 certified teachers and the district serves over 90% of Portland's eligible population. The district has used the PASS college entrance requirements as the academic target of all students for a number of years. The goals of the Portland USP are:\r\n1. To enable the district's entire diverse student enrollment to meet rigorous K-12 standards in science and mathematics and prepare for post-secondary education and future careers. To significantly reduce disparities in participation and academic performance between various student populations.\r\n2. To increase the district's capacity to develop, support, and sustain teacher and principal leadership in implementing standards-based curricular reform and continuous improvement of K-12 science, mathematics and technology education for all students.\r\n3. To engage families and the community in supporting improved student performance in science and mathematics and improved access to high-quality, inquiry-based educational opportunities in science, mathematics and technology.\r\n4. To establish ongoing, collaborative partnerships with higher education, business/industry, policy makers, and other key stakeholders in support of exemplary, research-based teaching and learning in science, mathematics, and technology within the context of a large and diverse urban school district.\r\n\r\nTo reach these goals, some of the implementation strategies that will be used by the Portland USP during the first year are:\r\na. After-school academic assistance/tutoring in both mathematics and science.\r\nb.  Parent education on standards-based curricula and support for students at home.\r\nc.  After-school workshops for teachers and principals on content knowledge and pedagogy.\r\nd.  Science and math courses, workshops and lecture series.\r\ne. Annual summer institutes (5 days in math and 5 days in science).\r\nf. Preparation of science and mathematics leaders.\r\n",
