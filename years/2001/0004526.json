 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Hungary ecological research project involves Debra Peters of New Mexico State University, James Gosz of the University of New Mexico, and partner Edit Kovacs-Lang from the Institute of Ecology and Botany of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  Their goal is to study the influence of disturbance and climate on the biodiversity of arid and semiarid grasslands. Multiple grassland sites in both countries will be examined that have varying species, composition, climate gradients, land use history, and soils.  Experimental manipulations, field studies, and simulation models will be used to evaluate effects of small-scale disturbances and climate on plant biodiversity, species composition, and dominance through time.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the US-Hungary team intends to test their hypothesis that small-scale disturbances and climate interact to generate and maintain biodiversity at multiple spatial scales with disproportionate effects compared to the total amount of area disturbed. Their research plan features three components: 1) evaluation of the effects of small, animal-created disturbances on patterns in species dominance and biodiversity at patch and landscape scale; 2) identification of the key recruitment processes limiting recovery of vegetation following disturbance; and 3) prediction of long-term responses of vegetation to small disturbances in the presence of climatic fluctuations and directional changes in climate.  Results should improve our basic ability to predict changes in grassland structure using model simulations.  If successful, the generalizations developed may be applicable to dry grasslands located in other parts of the world.  Understanding such grassland structures and functions may help us manage these large and potentially fragile systems in the face of global climate change. \r\n\r\nThis ecological research project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
