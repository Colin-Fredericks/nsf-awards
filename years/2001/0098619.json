 "awd_abstract_narration": "\" Problems in Stellar Abundances and Chemical Evolution: Solutions from Infrared Spectroscopy \"\r\nAST- 0098619\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central region of our galaxy is heavily obscured and, until the development of infrared instrumentation, was inaccessible to spectroscopic observation. But it is here that we expect to see the long-term effects of vigorous star formation on the chemical abundances of our galaxy. Thus the availability of infrared spectrographs has opened a new window of opportunity for observing stars to investigate abundance trends where they are likely to be the most conspicuous. The work during this two year award will be directed towards the changing abundances of oxygen and carbon in the atmospheres of cool stars in the halo and in the galactic center region. A further advantage of working in the infrared comes from the relative cleanness of the spectrum and an atmospheric opacity which is better understood. The project will use high resolution echelle spectrographs at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and at the Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii. Plans are also being made to observe with the two Gemini telescopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
