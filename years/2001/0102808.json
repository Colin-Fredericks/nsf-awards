 "awd_abstract_narration": "Piezoelectric thin films are attractive elements in several MEMS applications due to \r\nthe large generated force, high electromechanical coupling coefficients, and \r\nsubstantial charge output that can be generated.  This proposal focuses on two \r\napproaches to increasing the performance in piezoelectric MEMS devices: (i) enhancing \r\nthe effective piezoelectric response in thin ferroelectric films utilizing in-plane \r\npoled structures and (ii) developing miniaturized flextensional transducers to amplify \r\nthe piezoelectric effect.  From the scientific standpoint, the program will determine \r\nhow the piezoelectric properties of in-plane polarized lead zirconate titanate films \r\ncompare to through-the-thickness polarized transducers, as well as any differences in \r\nthe way piezoelectric and dielectric properties age and fatigue relative to \r\nconventionally poled films.  A processing scheme to enable production of flextionsional \r\nMEMS transducers will also be developed. In addition, a MEMS switch for RF applications \r\nwith large displacement (~2 microns) and high-speed (<1microsecond) will be \r\ndemonstrated using the d33 coefficient and a flextensional actuation mechanism.  The \r\neducational aspects of this program will concentrate on training graduate as well as \r\nundergraduate researchers.  \r\n%%%\r\nMicroelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are miniaturized devices produced with the same \r\ntechniques developed for integrated circuits, and typically range from several microns \r\nto several millimeters in size.  Such devices are now widely used in ink jet printers \r\nand automobile air bag deployment accelerometers.  Many fields, including miniaturized \r\nbiomedical instrumentation for bedside diagnosis, commercial electronics such as cell \r\nphones, and small sensors to detect phenomena as diverse as toxic gases or the imminent \r\nfailure of a piece of industrial equipment would benefit from MEMS devices with higher \r\nsensitivities or with the capability of doing more work.  This program is designed to \r\nincrease the functionality of MEMS systems by exploring the integration of high \r\nperformance ferroelectric thin films with motion amplification. This program will also \r\ntrain and educate scientists in an interdisciplinary research environment in a \r\ntechnologically-significant area of national importance. \r\n\r\n",
