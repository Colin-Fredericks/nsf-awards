McRoy, Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Yong Se Kim, Department of Mechanical Engineering, SungKyunKwan University, Korea.  The objective of the joint project is to develop an intelligent instructional software system for visual reasoning which can adaptively support different student learning needs, track students' progress, and give an active critique.  The intent is to provide a learning system with which a student can develop visualizing and spatial reasoning capabilities in a self-paced series of exercises related to solid modeling. \r\n\r\nThe ability of an engineer to visualize and reason about geometric aspects of physical objects and processes is crucial to the success of the activities of the engineer.  The visual reasoning capability forms the essential foundation for engineering education in all disciplines.  This project will combine the complementary skills and expertise of the American and Korean researchers/educators/students to advance these educational tools.\r\n\r\n",
