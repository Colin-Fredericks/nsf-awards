 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Weeks of the University of Maryland is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to investigate the properties of nonuniform fluids.  This work concentrates on ionic systems, and addresses the following topics: 1) research in the theory of ionic liquids focusing on regimes where molecular and intermediate length scales play an important role along with long-range Coulomb interactions, 2) further development of the theory of hydrophobic interactions and application to new experiments describing the density distribution of water near hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, 3) detailed examination of the relationship between this new theoretical approach and density functional theory, and  4) development of new technical extensions and improvements in the theory by incorporating known data for bulk systems and exact sum rules. This may be required for quantitative results in some of the applications, ionic liquids in particular, and is expected to facilitate the development of simple semi-empirical approaches that make use of experimental data to help uncover new qualitative effects.\r\n\r\nProblems in the area of nonuniform fluids are of great current interest due to their practical importance in biophysical and industrial applications.  Experiments have shown that the static and dynamic properties of nonuniform simple fluids, particularly when confined to small pores or slits, differ dramatically from those of uniform systems.  Nonuniform solutions containing ions such as salts and proteins play a key role in biological processes.  The nonuniform charge distribution associated with double layer formation is believed to stabilize aqueous solutions of macromolecules and colloids.",
