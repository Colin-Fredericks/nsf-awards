 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systemic Research, Inc. proposes to conduct a 24-month evaluative study (from October 2001 to\r\nSeptember 2003). During the initial phase,  comprehensive secondary data collection will be conducted from various sources, including past Core Data Elements (CDE) reports, Annual Reports submitted to\r\nNSF, other key indicators obtainable from the RSIs' own web sites and relevant rural project reports.\r\nSystemic Research will develop a Rural Key Indicator Database (RKID) to organize both quantitative and\r\nqualitative longitudinal achievement databases over the project period of individual RSI sites. The study\r\nteam will conduct two site visits each year to confirm reform implementation and to write relevant case\r\nstories based on observation. Based on completed RKID, both quantitative and qualitative data analysis will be performed to explore an inferential causal model. Study results will be disseminated in three\r\npublications: a two volume Rural Key Indicators of Science and Mathematics Education (Volume I for\r\nindividual RSI progress report and Volume II for overall RSI progress reports); a rural education report in\r\nbooklet format; and a RSI Evaluative Study Report including case stories of the four sites that were\r\nvisited. All publications will be available in three different formats-- printed copy, CD-ROM, and web-based\r\npublication.",
