The principal investigator, Marcin Szumowski, is from the University of Nevada Desert Research Institute.  His Polish collaborators, Szymon Malinowski and Krzysztof Haman, are from the Institute of Geophysics at Warsaw University.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will use a suite of high-frequency instruments developed in the last decade to simultaneously measure the temperature, cloud liquid water content, and microphysical structure within the cloud.  This suite of instruments has never been used simultaneously before and has the potential to create an unprecedented robust data set characterizing the entrainment process and its effects on cloud microphysical evolution with very fine spatial resolution.   \r\n\r\nThis project in atmospheric sciences research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
