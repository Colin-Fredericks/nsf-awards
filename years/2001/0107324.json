The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide twelve months of support to Dr. Paige C. Geiger to work with Dr. Giovanni Cecchi at the University of Florence in Firenze, Italy on the role of titin-actin interactions in the development of static stiffness in skeletal muscle fibers.\r\n\r\nMuscle fiber stiffness has been attributed to cross bridge formation.  However, a component of muscle stiffness, static stiffness, precedes tension development and is independent of myosin and actin interaction.  The physiological significance of this non-cross bridge based stiffness is unknown.  The goal of this project is to characterize static stiffness in skinned frog muscle fibers and identify structural elements of the sarcomere that contribute to static stiffness.  This research experience will afford Dr. Geiger with the opportunity to learn all aspects of single fiber mechanical measurements using a variety of physiological techniques.\r\n\r\nThe current research focus of Dr. Cecchi's lab concerns ultrastructural changes accompanying force generation, analysis of cross bridge state during isometric force development and isotonic shortening.\r\n",
