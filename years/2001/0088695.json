 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) Physics education research has shown that many students are leaving their introductory college- and university-level physics courses with little understanding of the fundamental concepts of physics. Whereas much of the research has studied in-class methods of alleviating the problem, this project focuses on students' out-of-class activities as a complementary means of improving learning. The goal of this project is to develop and test a prototype of freely available, Internet-accessible instructional software for algebra- and calculus-based introductory physics - software focusing on students' out-of-class learning that can be used by instructors (through homework assignments) or by students (through self-study) to supplement in-class or textbook discussion of basic physics concepts.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator has created a limited set of explanatory/exploratory/assessment Java applets for introductory kinematics and dynamics. Preliminary surveys and experiments indicate that even in its present form the software is well received by and helpful to students in learning physics. This project is developing a more complete prototype including: \r\n\r\nAdditional applets to provide more complete coverage for the kinematics and dynamics prototype;\r\nSystem CGI software to simplify the administrative details of student logins and recording of scores, and to allow students to check their scores on-line;\r\nAn instructor's guide describing the prototype and providing assignment suggestions;\r\nIndependent, formal assessment of the software by faculty other than the author.\r\n\r\nThis project should provide a clear picture of the effectiveness of this means of complementing in-class instruction with out-of-class learning activities. This information can then be used to determine the desirability of developing a full version of the software.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
