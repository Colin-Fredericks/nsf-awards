 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a significant theoretical literature in economics that identifies various ways through\r\nwhich providing more information to consumers may lead to improvements in market effciency\r\nand consumer welfare in particular. The theoretical insights provide a basis for government\r\npolicies that seek to increase the amount of information available to consumers. Examples of\r\nsuch policies include food labeling laws, accounting disclosure rules and energy effciency labels\r\non home applicances. Meanwhile existing empirical studies into the effects of information to\r\nconsumers on firm behavior find small or negligible effects, casting doubt on the importance of\r\nsuch policies. In this project, we analyze a regulatory change that provides an appealing context\r\nfor evaluating the effects of increased product information on firms' product quality choices and\r\ndisclosure decisions.\r\nIn 1998, Los Angeles County introduced hygiene quality grade cards to be displayed in restaurant\r\nwindows. The regulatory change provides an experiment in whether firms are subject to volun-\r\ntary disclosure (of hygiene quality) without verifiability, voluntary disclosure with verifiability\r\nor mandatory disclosure. Our research indicates substantial effects of the increased information\r\non restaurant hygiene quality. We also find that the effects from mandatory disclosure are very\r\nsimilar to the effects from voluntary verifiable disclosure. A possible implication of this finding\r\nis that mandatory disclosure laws (which could be hard to introduce due to lobbying by indus-\r\ntry groups) are less important than having the government provide mechanisms/procedures for\r\nfirms to voluntarily disclose verifiable product information.\r\nThe richness of our dataset allows us to also analyze how the effects of the grade cards differ\r\nacross restaurants. This is interesting because we can address questions that have received\r\nlittle or no attention in the existing empirical literature, such as: (i) does reputation help firms\r\nto overcome adverse selection problems, (ii) do franchised chain-restaurants free-ride on chain\r\nreputation, and (iii) what is the effect of the increased product information on firms' profitability\r\nand market structure?",
