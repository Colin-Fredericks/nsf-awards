 "awd_abstract_narration": "A big theme in number theory in the last 50 years has been the relationship\r\nbetween automorphic forms, Galois representations and objects from algebraic\r\ngeometry. There is an extensive web of extraordinary conjectures (for instance\r\nthe Artin conjecture, the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Langlands' conjectures,\r\nSerre's conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture) linking these three\r\nseemingly very different subjects (which relate to analysis, algebra and\r\ngeometry respectively). Progress on these conjectures is currently very\r\nexciting. Under his previous NSF grant the PI proved (with Michael Harris) the\r\nlocal Langlands conjecture for GL(n) of a p-adic field; completed (with\r\nChristophe Breuil, Brian Conrad and Fred Diamond) the proof of the \r\nShimura-Taniyama conjecture; found (with Kevin Buzzard, Mark Dickinson and\r\nNick Shepherd-Barron) the first infinite families of non-soluble irreducible\r\nArtin representations for which one could prove the Artin conjecture; and\r\nestablished the meromorphic continuation and functional equation of the\r\nL-functions of all abelian varieties ``of GL(2)-type''. The PI will\r\ncontinue to work on related problems. In particular he will work with Michael\r\nHarris to generalise the work of Wiles and of Wiles and the PI from GL(2) to\r\nGL(n). There seems to be just one significant problem remaining in the way of\r\na really useful result. If this problem can be overcome the PI will work with\r\nMichael Harris and Nick Shepherd-Barron on applications to the arithmetic of\r\nelliptic curves. The PI will also look for generalisations of his work with\r\nMichael Harris on the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n) to other\r\nreductive groups.\r\n\r\nThis circle of ideas is the one that led to Andrew Wiles' celebrated proof of\r\nFermat's last theorem after over 300 years. They fall into the general area of\r\narithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of\r\nmathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved\r\nextraordinarily fruitful. Among its many consequences are new error correcting\r\ncodes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and\r\ncompact disks. \r\n",
