 "awd_abstract_narration": "0091754\r\nMeinke\r\n\r\nThe titan (ttn) mutants of Arabidopsis exhibit dramatic alterations in\r\nmitosis and cell cycle control during seed development.  The common\r\nfeature among these mutants is that endosperm nuclei become enlarged and\r\nhighly polyploid.  Mutant embryos differ in cell size, morphology, and\r\nviability, depending on the locus involved.  Three titan mutants with\r\ndistinct phenotypes were first identified in the Meinke laboratory 4 years\r\nago.  During the previous grant period, 10 additional titan mutants were\r\nrecovered and 5 TITAN genes cloned in collaboration with Novartis\r\n(Syngenta).  Several of these genes encode condensin (SMC) proteins\r\nrequired for chromosome condensation and dosage compensation.  Another\r\ngene product is related to the ARF class of GTP binding proteins\r\nassociated with vesicle trafficking.  The remaining genes are involved\r\nwith other cellular processes.  What remains to be determined is how these\r\ndiverse proteins interact to influence nuclear division and cell viability\r\nduring seed development.    \r\n\r\nThis project will make it possible to continue the analysis of titan\r\nmutants and determine the relationship between gene function, nuclear\r\ndynamics, and cell growth during seed development.  Emphasis will be\r\nplaced on the SMC class of titans because these proteins appear to be most\r\ndirectly linked to the mutant phenotype.  Project objectives are to\r\nidentify the remaining SMC gene knockouts through reverse genetics,\r\ncharacterize nuclear and cytoskeletal defects in more detail through\r\nfluorescence and electron microscopy, analyze phenotypes of multiple SMC\r\nknockouts, and determine how SMC functions in plants compare with those\r\nestablished in other organisms.  The ARF class of titans will be examined\r\nfirst by attempting to complement ttn1 with an ARF-GAP that maps to the\r\nTTN1 region.  This should complete a map-based cloning effort initiated\r\nduring the last grant period.  The other class of titans will be examined\r\nin part by analyzing more tagged endosperm mutants from the Novartis\r\ncollection, including those that have intermediate titan phenotypes.\r\nThese additional mutants will be compared with existing titans to\r\nestablish the complex network of genes that influence endosperm\r\ndevelopment.  \r\n\r\nThe titan phenotype demonstrates that Arabidopsis endosperm tissue\r\nprovides an ideal environment for proliferation of aberrant nuclei\r\ndefective in mitosis and cell cycle control.  Detailed analysis of these\r\nmutants should provide valuable insights into novel features of nuclear\r\ndynamics during endosperm development and evolution.  The long-term goal\r\nis to understand the complex mechanisms that regulate endosperm formation\r\nin angiosperms. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
