Security and Quality of Service (QoS) are of utmost importance.  Providing security and QoS is a difficult problem in mobile systems because the availability of network and other resources may change as the mobile host fails, moves, or comes under intentional or unintentional attack.  Research on a technique to achieve fault-tolerant mobile node authentication in an efficient way is proposed for a postdoctoral research associate.  Such a technique would eliminate single points of failure, distribute loading, and enhance scalability and survivability, and make failures transparent to users.  A series of experiments are planned that will evaluate this technique under a variety of variables and lead to the development of new authentication and key management  techniques.  The associate will 1) identify guidelines for authentication between an upstream domain and an ingress router in a QoS enabled network, 2) evaluate various secure group communication and access control techniques for suitability in wireless communications, and 3) explore adaptability requirements when considering security as a QoS parameter.\r\n\r\n",
