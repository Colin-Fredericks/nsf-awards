Even for simple learning problems, the error function possesses a large number of local minima (isolated valleys). Despite the enormous amount of attention devoted to neural networks, there is currently no efficient method that can identify with certainty time global minimum of the error function. Current approaches, such as back-propagation and stochastic search methods, may get trapped at local minima corresponding to large learning errors and suboptimal neural networks. This may lead to incorrect inferences and devastate decision makers.\r\n\r\nGlobally optimal neural computing holds the promise of an enabling technology that could significantly improve learning in many diverse application domains.  The results of the proposed research will be implemented in the their widely distributed global optimization software package and will be made available to the research community.\r\n",
