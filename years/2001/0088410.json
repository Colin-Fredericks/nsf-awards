Specifically, the PI plans to accomplish 1.  Map the structure of Io's escaping atmosphere, 2.  Identify the finest spatial structures in the Io plasma tours, and relate them to the torus supply and transport processes and 3.  Make the first simultaneous observations of atmospheric escape and volcanic activity on the satellite surface.  Observations will be made at the following wavelengths:  766 nm, 953 nm, 673 nm, 630 nm, 589 nm.\r\n\r\nJupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.  Many of the observations of planets outside our solar system are of objects similar to Jupiter.  It is important that astronomers understand our solar system's planet Jupiter and its satellites as part of understanding the formation of planetary systems and thus the origins of the solar system.  Io is a satellite of Jupiter and of significant interest.  It is close enough to the giant planet Jupiter to suffer significant tidal forces that sustain a liquid core and cause significant volcanic activity on the surface.  Ionized particles are observed to stream from the satellite into Jupiter.  This work will aid our understanding of the interaction of gravity fields between two bodies, the chemistry of planet and satellite formation and the interactions between charged particles and magnetic fields.\r\n***\r\n",
