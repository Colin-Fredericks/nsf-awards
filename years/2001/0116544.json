 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: Didier\r\nA grant has been awarded to Drs. Dominique A. Didier and Jon K. Gelhaus at The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia to obtain a digital imaging system for the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a 3-D imaging system for light microscopy.  This new equipment will become part the Academy's Albert M. Greenfield Digital Imaging Center, a multi-user facility that is shared by all units of the Academy's Biodiversity Research Group, including the Library and the Molecular Systematics and Evolution Group.  These new acquisitions will enhance ongoing collections-based research and facilitate the collection and distribution of data from our natural history collections.\r\nTogether the digital imaging system and the 3-D imaging system will enable the study of samples and specimens ranging in size from several microns in diameter to at least 30 cm in diameter.  This technology is especially important for ongoing collaborative research in four of our most important collections: rotifers, insects, mollusks, and diatoms. Many of these invertebrate taxa have never been studied and may be globally rare or endangered, and may also be bio-indicators of environmental health, thus important to both taxonomists and environmental biologists.  Using the combined imaging capabilities of the new systems both internal and external morphology of microscopic specimens can be visualized in perfect focus in a single image and will facilitate taxonomic research on the revision and identification of these important biological specimens. Digital images will be used in the production of publications, field guides, taxonomic keys, and Internet products.  Additionally, digital images are easily shared among colleagues worldwide and will greatly facilitate international collaborations, and will be especially useful in enhancing ongoing research with colleagues in developing countries such as Mongolia.\r\nThe enhanced digital imaging facilities at the Academy of Natural Sciences will significantly improve current educational opportunities at the Academy.  In particular, undergraduate interns funded through an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Grant will be intimately involved in independent research that utilizes this new digital imaging technology.  The Academy also offers several Fellowships including the Gallagher Postdoctoral Fellowship for research on the Academy's world-ranked collection of rotifers as well as Jessup and Mchenry Fellowships for graduate students to conduct research in our collections.  These prestigious Fellowships support use of all Academy facilities, including the Digital Imaging Center.  In addition, through collaborations with local colleges and Universities researchers at the Academy have colleagues as well as undergraduate, masters' and doctoral students working in their laboratories, most of whom utilize digital imaging technology in their research.  Most importantly, this new digital imaging technology will make it possible to bring specimen images and data to a global audience of scientists, students, hobbyists and the general public. \r\n",
