He feels that there are many opportunities\r\nfor strengthening the myriad connections between combinatorics and\r\nother branches of mathematics. He will investigate how recent\r\nbreakthroughs in the theory of total positivity can be applied to open\r\nproblems concerning such topics as counting faces in cubical polytopes\r\nand counting stable sets in clawfree graphs. The investigator will\r\nalso continue his research on the combinatorial properties of convex\r\npolytopes that have arisen in such areas as statistical inference and\r\nthe representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras. In particular,\r\nhe will investigate further some convex polytopes related to Kostant's\r\npartition function.  He will in addition pursue a number of\r\nmiscellaneous problems arising in the work of Kac, Kontsevich,\r\nVarchenko, and others.\r\n\r\nThe field of combinatorics was first systematically investigated in\r\nthe 1960's and only recently has reached a high level of maturity. It\r\nis an area of mathematics that has close connections with many other\r\nsubjects, ranging from algebra, geometry, and statistics within\r\nmathematics, andcomputer science, high-energy physics, chemistry, and\r\nmost recently biology without. The investigator's primary interest is\r\nthe development of connections between combinatorics and other areas\r\nof mathematics. He will investigate a number of problems that would\r\ncontinue the development of the connections between combinatorics and\r\nother branches of mathematics and that would lead to the development\r\nof tools that could be used by scientists outside of mathematics.\r\n",
