Understanding the evolutionary forces that can affect this transition requires a model system in which both parasites and mutualists are found. A large body of literature exists documenting the parasitic effects of Wolbachia in the fly Drosophila simulans. However, our preliminary experiments with the model organism Drosophila melanogaster indicate that a beneficial Wolbachia strain inhabits this species. This mutualistic form of Wolbachia can extend the lifespan of D. melanogaster flies up to 35%.  This research investigates whether this increased lifespan leads to enhanced evolutionary fitness.  To do this, the investigators will compare the age-specific survival and reproduction of infected flies with flies that have been experimentally treated with antibiotics to remove Wolbachia infection.\r\n\r\nThe experiments will improve understanding of parasite-arthropod coevolution by characterizing a novel phenotype, extended lifespan, associated with Wolbachia infection. This will allow quantification of Wolbachia's effect on Drosophila fitness and determine if normally parasitic Wolbachia are becoming mutualists in Drosophila hosts. The Wolbachia-Drosophila symbiosis may prove useful to researchers investigating the virulence of parasites, and may provide an ideal system for testing evolutionary theories about the transition from parasitism to mutualism.\r\n\r\n",
