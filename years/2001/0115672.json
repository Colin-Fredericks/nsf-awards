 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the goals of optical fiber communication system design and development is the realization of the full 25 THz bandwidth capability of this transmission medium. One approach currently being pursued is to transmit a large number of spectral channels at high modulation rates within the gain profile of doped optical fiber amplifiers. Therefore in order for new device technologies to be acceptable they must be characterized with high spectral resolution probes (0.10-0.20 nm; 10-25 GHz at 1550 nm) over relatively large spectral bandwidths (C-Band: 1528-1561 nm; L-Band: 1561-1620 nm). One approach to accomplishing this task is to use a tunable laser source to probe the device to measure its spectral properties over a range of wavelengths. The polarization of the incident beam can also be changed to examine the sensitivity to polarization variations that may occur in a length of fiber. The source output can also serve as a continuous wave optical source that can then be modulated with an external modulator to examine the performance of a modulator at different wavelengths. In this regard a tunable laser source is an extremely versatile tool for investigating many different aspects of high performance fiber optic devices and systems.\r\nIn addition to using a tunable laser source for research purposes it also is a very useful instrument for education purposes. It can be used in laboratory experiments that evaluate devices found in modern fiber optic communications systems such as fiber Bragg gratings, spectral gain variation of optical amplifiers, and amplifier gain equalization techniques. In addition it can be used to train both undergraduate and graduate students in DWDM device characterization techniques.\r\nThe purpose of this proposal is a request for a tunable laser diode with a spectral resolution of 0.02 rim and a tuning range from 1510-1580 nm. This source will provide our lab with the capability to investigate the performance of devices and materials for wavelength selective operations in fiber optic communications systems. it will also allow us to significantly improve the quality and relevance of laboratory experiments that we can offer in our classes on fiber optics and undergraduate and graduate research projects. A source of this type is currently not available for our research and educational facilities and is a significant obstacle to our efforts. The importance of acquiring an instrument of this type is underscored by the commitment from the University of Arizona to cost share one-third of the cost of the laser.\r\n",
