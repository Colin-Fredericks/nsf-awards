The affirmative solution to this work will\r\nopen a new avenue of research about these connections, for which all the \r\nknown examples by far have been analytic. He also proposes to investigate\r\nthe classification problem of isoparametric hypersurfaces with four\r\nprincipal curvatures in spheres by investigating the normal holonomy Lie \r\nalgebra of a focal submanifold of the hypersurface, which contains the\r\ninformation about the 2nd fundamental form of the focal submanifold, which\r\nis, by his study, crucial for the classification.  \r\n \r\n\r\nIf one sets off from the North Pole and travels with a compass along a \r\nloop, one will discover that at the end of the trip back at the North Pole\r\nthe compass needle has turned a degree. This says mathematically that parallel\r\ntranslation (induced by a linear connection) of vectors along loops can\r\ndetect whether the space is flat, which is fundamental to Einstein's \r\nTheory of Relativity. In Hermann Weyl's terms, the existence of inertia \r\nsystems in the universe warrants that its linear connection is\r\ntorsion-free. The project on torsion-free G_3 connections is a study of the \r\nrather anomalous nature of these connections among all exotic holonomies \r\nwhose development has been participated by the PI. The notion of\r\nisoparametric hypersurfaces was first proposed in connection with wave \r\nfronts in Euclidean space and recently the more general Dupin hypersurfaces \r\nwere tied with integrable hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type. Shortly \r\nafter their introduction the isoparametric hypersurfaces were all classified \r\nin Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces of all dimensions. The complete \r\nclassification of such hypersurfaces in spheres of arbitrary dimensions has \r\ndefied people's efforts for nearly six decades, despite many outstanding\r\nresults achieved in the past three decades. The PI's second project is to \r\nutilize the normal holonomy and the new approach of him, T. Cecil and G. \r\nJensen toward the classification in the case of four principal \r\ncurvatures. \r\n",
