 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe primary problem addressed is the deleterious effect of dynamic\r\nmultipath propagation on high-speed wireless digital communications \r\nsupporting real-time video and multimedia applications.  Digital TV (DTV) \r\nis a target application along with Fourth Generation Cellular Communication \r\nSystems.  Reflections off buildings and other structures cause ghosts \r\nand other artifacts in the reconstructed video stream.  These multipath \r\neffects can wreak havoc on all functions of the receiver causing\r\nloss of synchronization and loss of carrier/timing recovery as well\r\nas inter-symbol interference. Discrete ghosts are often associated with \r\nmultipath conditions of large, flat surfaces, such as tall steel buildings. \r\nHowever, multipath conditions can occur in areas with hills and dense foliage\r\nwhere a signal can travel through many paths to the receiver. When the signal\r\nis bounced back from a moving object, complex ghosts can arise with a \r\ntime-varying nature that is very challenging for the equalizer to overcome.\r\nTo accommodate delay spreads of up to 40 microseconds, current generation \r\nDigital TV receiver chips employ a Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE) with \r\nmore than 100 Feed-Forward taps and more than 400 Feed-Back taps.  This \r\nconstitutes a large number of taps to adapt implying slow convergence and \r\nhigh computational complexity.  Future high-speed wireless multimedia \r\napplications will place even more stressful demands on equalizer performance. \r\n\r\nThe investigator will develop fundamental advances in the area of\r\nreduced-dimension Decision Feedback Equalizers (DFE's).\r\nThese include methods for dimensionality reduction based on a\r\npowerful reduced-rank adaptive filtering algorithm referred to \r\nas the Multi-Stage Nested Wiener Filter (MSNWF).  The MSNWF provides\r\nconvergence speeds better than the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm,\r\nbut at a much reduced computational complexity due to the fact that \r\nthat the MSNWF constrains the overall weight vector to lie \r\nin a data-adaptive, low-dimensional subspace.\r\nThe MSNWF has been successfully employed to effect a reduced-rank, \r\nlinear equalizer for applications in Third Generation Cellular Communications\r\nbased on both CDMA Technology and the European GSM EDGE System.  The\r\ninvestigator will also develop other means for dimensionality\r\nreduction including the use of the channel shortening concept employed in \r\nOFDM systems to reduce the length of the cyclic prefix, and symbol waveform \r\ncompression achieved through simple linear filtering at the receiver.\r\nIn addition, the investigator will study the use of reduced-dimension DFE's\r\nfor equalization when block space-time coding is employed under frequency \r\nselective multipath conditions.",
