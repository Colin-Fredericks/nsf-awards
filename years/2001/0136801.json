The program director is Clemen Gehlhar, of the USDA/Foreign Agriculture Service.  These projects include: 1) holding a workshop on developing an insecticidal nematode industry in Egypt, managed by Dr. Randy Gaugler of Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey and Dr. Sally Allam of Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt; 2) development of improved low-fat soft cheese, managed by Dr. Joseph Frank, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia and Dr. Morsi El-Soda, University of Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt; and 3) examination of poliovirus isolates from Egypt by nucleic acid probe hybridization signals to determine the pattern of virus spread, managed by Dr. Olen Kew, Center for Diseas Control & Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia and Dr. Naglaa A. Hamed, Egyptian Organization for Biological Products & Vaccines, Agouza, Cairo, Egypt.\r\n\r\nScope: The award allows USDA to support three collaborative projects involving US and Egyptian scientists, in areas of interest to the two countries.  This award is made under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
