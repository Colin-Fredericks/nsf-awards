This assessment has led to the articulation of two goals: (1) to maintain and expand opportunities for students to gain experience with the scientific method through student-designed laboratory projects, (2) to expand coverage of central themes in cell and tissue biology by the addition of new upper-level courses. To meet these objectives, this project is adapting the successful project developed by Dr. Diana Darnell at Lake Forest College (DUE-9952472) in which students gain experience designing a semester-long project. Using Dr. Darnell's project as a model, this adaptation is incorporating multiple-week, student-designed projects into laboratory sessions of four courses with cell and tissue biology themes. Students are responsible for designing experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and communicating their results to others. These student-designed projects are being incorporated into a current course (Cell Biology) and into three courses that are being implemented as a result of this curriculum reform (Immunology, Plant Physiology and Advanced Topics in Cell and Molecular Biology). An added benefit of this reform will be the better preparation of students for their year-long senior research requirement. Equipment such as compound fluorescence microscopes, a sterile hood, incubators with lighting and CO2 control, and a high-speed centrifuge allow the development of projects involving subcellular localization, cell and tissue culture and cellular fractionation. This equipment is also being used by students with interests in cell and tissue biology to conduct their senior research requirement.",
