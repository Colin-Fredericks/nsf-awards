 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary aim of this proposal is the development of diffractive photonic\r\ncomponents for the terahertz spectral range, and the exploration of terahertz\r\npulse propagation in strongly diffractive media.  One primary aim of this\r\nproposal is to develop a range of new and useful optical components specifically\r\ndesigned for the far infrared, or terahertz, spectral range, based on the\r\nconcepts of photonic crystals.  Researchers have made tremendous strides in the\r\nuse of periodically diffractive materials for optical components, with examples\r\nranging from fiber Bragg gratings to colloidal crystal notch filters.  Such\r\nsystems could also be useful as waveguides, filters, tunable dispersive optics,\r\nand as components for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM).  However, these\r\nideas have rarely been implemented at terahertz frequencies, a portion of the\r\nspectrum with increasing technological importance.  Another important aspect of\r\nthe proposed research involves the propagation of THz radiation in strongly\r\nscattering media.  This area of research has been of substantial interest in\r\nrecent years, motivated by the prospect of achieving localization of\r\nelectromagnetic waves.  Interestingly, although a clear demonstration of light\r\nlocalization is quite difficult in the optical regime, this research has led to\r\nthe development of techniques for imaging in turbid media.  Since many of the\r\nexpected applications of THz imaging involve turbid or scattering media, it will\r\nbe valuable to extend these imaging studies to the THz regime\r\n",
