The workshop is an extension of one of the break-out sessions at the NSF-sponsored US/Africa workshop that was held in Pretoria in August, 2000.  The workshop will bring together researchers from Africa, South America, Europe and the United States to interact within a basic research framework that will stimulate materials and infrastructure development within the U.S., Africa and a global framework.  The workshop will also provide opportunities between African and U.S. researchers that could result ultimately in synergisms that are not possible within national or continental boundaries.  In an effort to ensure subsequent interactions, participants from outside the U.S. will be given the opportunity to visit potential collaborators within the U.S. before returning to their home countries.  The highlights of the symposium will be published on a web-site that will be developed to disseminate the information from the workshop to a worldwide audience.  The technical papers from the workshop will be published in the International Journal of Concrete and Cement Composites after a rigorous review process.  Travel assistance will be provided to 12 invited speakers, two graduate students and one post-doctoral research associate.  An undergraduate student will also be supported to assist with the development of the workshop web-site.\r\n***",
