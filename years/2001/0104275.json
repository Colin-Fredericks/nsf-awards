The\r\nsuccess of algebraic topology in knot theory, for example, has,\r\nuntil recently centered around abelian invariants, that is to\r\nsay, invariants associated to the universal abelian covering\r\nspace of the knot or link exterior. These invariants are the\r\nAlexander module, which is the first homology of this cover as a\r\nmodule over a commutative Laurent polynomial ring, and the\r\nBlanchfield pairing. These determine the S-equivalence class of\r\nthe knot as well as various other invariants. From the\r\nperspective of the knot group G, the Alexander module is simply\r\nG'/G\".  Hence any behavior associated to G\" will be invisible to\r\nthese abelian invariants. We remedy this deficiency by studying\r\nthe quotients of successive terms of the higher derived series,\r\nor, put another way, study modules associated to more general\r\nsolvable covering spaces. These are modules over noncommutative\r\nrings and thus are difficult to work with. We use techniques from\r\nnoncommutative algebra and C* algebras to define invariants. We\r\nfind , for each integer n, an entire theory which parallels the\r\nAlexander module and Blanchfield form and signatures. There are\r\napplications to estimating genus, detecting fibered knots and\r\n3-manifolds, new invariants of concordance and representations of\r\nmapping class groups.\r\n\r\nThe advent of quantum mechanics led scientists to many\r\nparadoxical, but now accepted, facts about our universe. In\r\nparticular, there came the realization that \"commutative\r\nmathematics\" was inadequate to describe our physical\r\nworld. Recall that 2 times 3 equals 3 times 2 is the commutative\r\nlaw of multiplication of numbers. Quantum mechanics showed that\r\nphysical quantities are not mere numbers but more like arrays or\r\nmatrices of numbers. Since multiplication of matrices is not\r\ncommutative, this explains and models noncommutative phenomena at\r\nthe most fundamental levels of the physical world. This project\r\nstudies the shape of 3 and 4-dimensional spaces by using new\r\nnoncommutative mathematics arising from algebra.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
