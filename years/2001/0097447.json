 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal deals with a large set of key problems in stochastic control and applications.\r\nConcerning Numerical  Methods in Stochastic Control,  the aim is to have a large set of effective  algorithms  which can  be conveniently programmed,  have good numerical properties,  are robust, and  for which there are convergence theorems under realistic conditions, so that numerical methods can fulfill   their  role  as a practical and efficient approach to  both investigation and design.\r\nThe  foundations are the Markov chain approximation methods. Algorithms with faster rate of convergence for the ergodic cost problem will be developed. The methods will be extended to stochastic differential games.  This will allow  treatment of robust and risk sensitive problems as well In many problems, the intensity of the noise  is affected by the control.  We will  design  practical and well performing  algorithms. Numerical algorithms generally suppose that the drift  terms are bounded.\r\nProblems with unbounded and controlled drift  occur in communications theory and appropriate convergent algorithms will be developed. The treatment  of ergodic costs with singular controls is  one of the key  remaining numerical problem areas, and is crucial in applications to communications theory and for heavy traffic limit models.  Well performing algorithms will be developed.  More generally, the theory of heavy traffic limits for the ergodic criteria  and singular controls will be completed.  We will also develop a complete theory of approximation methods for the modeling and control of  Mobile communications systems when the channels are rapidly time varying in an arbitrary way. The heavy traffic models and associated limit theorems provide good guides for the analysis  and control of a large variety of such systems.\r\n",
