This system will be used initially for environmental and other research projects conducted by faculty and undergraduate students in Chemistry and Environmental Studies. The system comprises an automated HPLC with an autosampler, diode array detector, and a gas chromatography system with a GC autosampler system, computer and associated software, which will operate as a common interface between the two systems.  In addition, maintenance supplies and a service contract are included in the grant. The initial projects supported by this equipment grant include trace detection and measurement of air pollutants, particularly those related to ozone formation, an issue of prime importance in the Houston area. Related research includes analysis for similar types of oxygenates in ozonated drinking water. The second project has to do with analysis of components in wine samples from the sophomore organic laboratory. Winemaking has been included as part of the organic curriculum for over 20 years and this addition will allow integration of analysis for various components, including multifunctional components, to be integrated as special projects in the laboratory. The automated nature of the instrumentation will allow efficient processing of the 50+ wine samples in a short time period. The third project involves the investigation of HPLC methods for the detection and quantitation of carbamates and related species in drinking water.  Once the method development stage is complete, samples of local drinking water will be analyzed for the presence of these analytes and the contamination level determined. The fourth project is the use of chemical analysis in conjunction with the development of a Foraminiferal Laboratory. The environmental studies program at the University is actively engaged in research concerning the use of both benthic foraminifera and ostracodes in the determination of water quality in the environments of the bays of the Texas coast.  This equipment acquisition will complement and supplement work on GC/MS equipment for both electron ionization and positive and negative chemical ionization already present in the department. In addition to research projects, the automated nature of the equipment will allow integration into normal laboratory course work. Recent collaboration on projects with a member of the Biology department has led to future possibilities for use of this equipment.\r\n***\r\n",
