 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing scholarships to low- income, academically talented students who show interest and promise in majoring in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. The college is providing a student- support infrastructure through its Center for Science Excellence (CSE), thus facilitating the successful graduation of students with an associate- level degree and transfer to a four- year college or university. The college's student- support infrastructure coordinates formal study, work experience in science and technology, and various science- and technology- based activities through a social support system. It provides academic support in the form of mentoring, academic workshops, tutoring, internship opportunities, leadership development, scientific seminars, and field trips. Through active recruitment efforts in CSE and a competitive application process, the college is selecting 40 financially disadvantaged, academically talented students interested in computer science, engineering or mathematics who meet all the eligibility requirements. The scholarship awards are being distributed during the recipients' second year of enrollment at the College and during their first year of transfer. Scholarship recipients will enroll as full- time students, be expected to maintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average, and follow an educational plan prescribing a sequence of courses that is enabling them to graduate and transfer to a baccalaureate- granting institution. Experience shows that gaining access to a coordinated support system of mentoring, internships, and enrichment activities along with high academic expectations is an important contribution to students' success.",
