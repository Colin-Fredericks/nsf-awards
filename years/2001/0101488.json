He will be undertaking his research with Professor Isao Tanihata at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Saitama, Japan.  Dr. Famiano will be researching the measurement of beta-decay rates of r-process and other exotic neutron-rich nuclei.  The proposed work involves both experimental and theoretical efforts surrounding the rapid-neutron capture process, which is believed to be the source of heavy elements in stars and planets.  He will be carrying out sophisticated r-process calculations in which he will insert his predictions for excited state beta-decays into a state-of-the-art r-process code to observe the impact of the excited state decay half-lives on the r-process abundance predictions. \r\n\r\nThe research will result in solving a longstanding problem in the formulation of r-process nucleosynthesis calculations.  The findings will then allow the incorporation of the calculated rates into more elaborate r-process models, and the experimental verification of these calculations.  Useful contributions to the field are likely, and the exposure of the awardee to a new research setting will be intellectually stimulating.  The proposed work will benefit through collaboration with the Japanese host laboratory, where Dr. Famiano will have access to the necessary experimental systems, equipment and expertise.   \r\n",
