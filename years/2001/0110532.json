It is\r\nknown that the micromeres, which form the early signaling center that\r\nspecifies mesendoderm, require nuclear beta-catenin to become competent to\r\ncarry out their inductive functions. Beta-catenin signaling is also\r\nrequired in the veg2 lineage for these cells to respond to micromere\r\nsignals and to become specified as mesendoderm. Identifying\r\ntranscriptional targets of beta-catenin and elucidating their functions\r\nwould be a critical step in defining the molecular basis of mesendoderm\r\nspecification. This proposal will focus on SUWnt8, a nuclear\r\nbeta-catenin-sensitive Wnt gene that is activated in the micromeres\r\ncoincident with the entry of beta-catenin into the nuclei of these cells\r\nand in the veg2 tier shortly after transit of beta-catenin into the nuclei\r\nof this cell tier. Four proposed specific aims will define the function of\r\nSUWnt8 in these cell lineages and will further the understanding of\r\nmesendoderm specification in the sea urchin embryo. These aims are: (1) To\r\ndetermine the role of cell interactions in regulating early SUWnt8\r\nexpression in the mesendoderm domain. This will provide insight into the\r\nrelative roles of cell autonomous and non cell-autonomous mechanisms in\r\nearly mesendoderm specification. (2) To determine how SUWnt8 participates\r\nin early mesendoderm specification by elucidating its role in the\r\nmicromeres and the veg2 tier by blocking its activity using morpholino\r\nantisense oligonucleotide-mediated translational inhibition. Additionally,\r\na possible role for SUWnt8 in maintaining nuclear beta-catenin levels in\r\nvegetal cells and in suppressing the activity of animalizing transcription\r\nfactors in vegetal cells will be determined. (3) While nuclear\r\nbeta-catenin is required for normal mesendoderm specification, there is\r\nevidence that micromeres can induce mesendoderm in animal half blastomeres\r\nin the absence of detectable nuclear beta-catenin. It will be determined\r\nif SUWnt8 can signal through the planar cell polarity pathway via the\r\nDisheveled protein to participate in mesendoderm specification in parallel\r\nwith the beta-catenin pathway. (4) The unique expression pattern of SUWnt8\r\nmakes it a powerful reagent for studying the transcriptional basis of\r\nmesendoderm specification. The trans-acting factors that mediate SUWnt8\r\nexpression in the micromeres and the veg2 tier will be identified.\r\nTogether, these studies will further our understanding of how the sea\r\nurchin A/V axis is specified and patterned and may provide insight into\r\nthe evolution of the A/V axis in bilaterians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
