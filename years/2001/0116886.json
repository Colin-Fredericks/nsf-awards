 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Amaldi Conferences were initiated in 1994 by an international group of scientists involved in the search for gravitational waves in honor of Edoardo Amaldi, the Italian physicist who was one of the founders of the University of Rome Gravitational Wave group.  The conferences are now a continuing series sponsored and organized by the Gravitational Wave International Committee (GWIC).   GWIC has members from all of the major gravitational wave detector projects around the world.  This proposal requests support for travel to the 4th Amaldi Conference to be held in Perth, Western Australia, July 8-13, 2001, for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC).  The Amaldi Conferences are the principal international meetings for the Gravitational Wave community.  The latest developments and accomplishments in this rapidly growing scientific field will be reported at this meeting.  In addition to this important exchange of ideas and advances in gravitational wave science,  US members of the LSC will have an opportunity to discuss research on techniques to improve the sensitivity of LIGO interferometers with their Australian collaborators who are also members of the LSC.",
