Hofer\r\n\r\nThe main tool for most of the proposed projects is a \r\nparticularly adapted theory of holomorphic curves, \r\nwhich has been developed by Dr. Hofer and his co-workers \r\nin recent years. The fact, that there is such a close, \r\nbut completely  unexpected, relationship between some \r\nimportant class of dynamical systems and a  suitable \r\ntheory of holomorphic curves has deep implications. \r\nImmediately it makes it, in principle, feasible to \r\nrelate questions about large classes of dynamical \r\nsystems to recent mathematical theories like quantum \r\ncohomology,  Gromov-Witten invariants, and in low \r\ndimensions even to Seiberg-Witten invariants. One of the \r\nmain goals of this project will be the development of a \r\nmathematical machinery for constructing global surfaces \r\nof section for three-dimensional Reeb flows and \r\ngeneralizations thereof.  In practice this means that \r\nthe study of certain three-dimensional dynamical system \r\ncan effectively be reduced to two dimensions.   The other \r\ngoal is the development of a symplectic field theory. \r\nParticular cases of such a theory are Gromov-Witten \r\ninvariants and Floer Homology.  \r\n\r\nMany physical systems like the flow of an incompressible\r\nideal fluid, the movement of a satellite under the \r\ngravitational forces of celestial bodies, or the \r\nmovement of charged particles in a magnetic field, \r\nto name a few, are examples of so called dynamical systems. \r\nThe mathematical theory of dynamical systems provides \r\ntools to understand their complex behavior and allows\r\nto make predictions. The particular examples mentioned \r\nabove are of so-called Hamiltonian nature. For such systems, \r\nbeginning with the work of Lagrange and Hamilton, \r\ngeometric tools have been developed leading to the \r\nmodern theory of contact and symplectic geometry. These \r\ngeometries play a central role in connecting mathematical \r\nareas like dynamical systems, algebraic geometry and \r\nsmooth topology. This makes it possible to employ powerful \r\ntools from different mathematical areas in the study of \r\nimportant classes of dynamical systems and also to use \r\nideas from dynamical systems to study important intrinsic \r\nquestions in other fields by new methods.\r\n",
