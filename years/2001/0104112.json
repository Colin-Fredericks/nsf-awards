The common thread that runs through the \r\nproposed research is the use of techniques from approximation theory, \r\nharmonic and functional analysis (Littlewood-Paley theory, wavelet \r\ndecompositions, maximal functions, interpolation and K-functionals) to \r\nprove analytic results in other areas of applied mathematics and to use \r\nthese techniques to develop numerical methods. Particular emphases will \r\nbe placed on several issues: development of a satisfactory theory for linear \r\ntransport equations in several space dimensions which arise when \r\nlinearizing the nonlinear problem, development of Godunov type central \r\nschemes for solving multidimensional systems of conservation laws, and \r\napplication of these schemes to various problems and models. Extensions \r\nof averaging lemmas to go from microscopic to macroscopic formulations \r\nwill also be of primary concern.  A portion of this project will address \r\nfundamental questions in nonlinear approximation and multivariate \r\ncubature.\r\n\r\nThe areas under discussion (nonlinear approximation, analytical properties \r\nof solutions to transport equations and development of effective numerical \r\nmethods for their computation) are of significant practical interest. The \r\napplications include image processing, statistical estimation, fluid \r\nmechanics, geophysics, meteorology, astrophysics, multi-component \r\nflows, ground water flow, semiconductors, and reactive flows.\r\n",
