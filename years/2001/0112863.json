Dr. Riazuddin, Director of the National Center for Physics at Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan is the organizer of a one-week session on condensed matter physics (CMP) at the College.  Scientists from Europe, Pakistan and the United States will make presentations.  Attendees include scientists, mostly recent Ph.D.'s, from a number of developing countries in the region, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Tajikistan, Turkey, as well as Pakistan.   They also include graduate students from Pakistan. There are four areas covered during the three week College.  The US team will participate mainly in the CMP session.  The topics are selected with the aim of providing a synoptic view of latest advances and trends in these fields of research.  These include the statistical mechanics of systems far from equilibrium; studies of nanostructuring and etching of metal surfaces; theory, synthesis and characterization of nanostructured materials for photocatalysis; macroscopic studies of thin film growth on semiconductor surfaces; atomistic studies of thin film growth on metal surfaces, carbon nanotubes; studies of permanent magnetic materials and magnetic multilayers; and studies of permanent magnets, magnetic nanostructures and magnet recording applications.  The organizers are planning to have a publication of the proceedings of the entire College presentations. \r\n\r\nScope: This project enables eight US scientists to attend an important meeting and to allow scientists from countries in south Asia to stay in touch with recent developments in physics, especially condensed matter physics, resulting from observations at facilities in advanced countries. This is an excellent opportunity for scientists from the advanced countries to take their knowledge and ideas for exchange, development, and application in other communities.  Lecturers and speakers from Europe, China and Japan are increasingly participating in these summer colleges.  This project allows the US to maintain a presence in programs like this and to remain competitive in scientific collaborations, recruiting graduate students and visitors, and to have the opportunity to disseminate results of research.  Past colleges have resulted in recruitment of several new graduate students who have added significantly to US research programs. The project meets INT objectives in supporting seminars where mutual benefits and dissemination of information is likely to result.",
