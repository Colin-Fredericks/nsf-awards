 "awd_abstract_narration": "0102686\r\nCasazza\r\n\r\nThis project will concentrate on several new applications of frame theory \r\nconcerning the transmission of information.  First, for communication \r\nnetworks such as the Internet, packets of data are often lost in transmission \r\nand are retransmitted according to a protocol invisible to the user.  In \r\nmany applications, the subsequent delay is unacceptable and best possible \r\nreconstruction from what is initially received is necessary.  Second, it has \r\nbeen shown that wireless communication systems which employ multiple \r\nantennas can have very high channel capacities.  Until now, constructive \r\napproaches to achieving this capacity have relied on the assumption that \r\nthe receiver knows the complex-valued Rayleigh fading coefficients.  This \r\nassumption is often unrealistic in practice and recently new classes of \r\nunitary space-time signals have been proposed where neither the sender \r\nnor the receiver knows the fading coefficients.  The investigators will \r\nfacilitate the implementation of both of these programs along with a host \r\nof related problems in signal/image processing.  This will require:  (1) The \r\nconstruction of totally new families of uniform tight frames with specific \r\noptimization properties;  (2) The development of algorithms for their \r\nimplementation;  (3) The development of new (and computationally \r\nefficient) methods for inverting the Gabor frame operator to allow a much \r\nbroader class of functions to be used for signal/image processing.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to develop a cell phone which will not fade under almost any \r\ncircumstance?  Is it possible to have your computer receive an almost \r\nperfect message immediately after it is sent?  Is it possible to develop a \r\nhearing aid which not only allows the wearer to hear what he/she wants, \r\nbut also allows a person to filter out sounds they do not want to hear? Is it \r\npossible to have a breast x-ray which is so clear that cancer diagnoses are \r\n99% accurate?  The answer is that all of these (and a host of other \r\nimportant questions) are ``theoretically possible''.  What is needed for the \r\nimplementation of these important applications is the development of a \r\nbranch of mathematics called ``uniform tight frames''. Working with a \r\ndozen research groups around the country, the investigators are developing \r\nthe mathematics needed for these applications as well as developing the \r\nmeans to implement these results in the specific cases listed above and a \r\nlarge number of other areas of application.\r\n",
