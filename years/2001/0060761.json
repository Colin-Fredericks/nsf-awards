 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the use of a new and unique hypervelocity acceleration technique to deposit powder particles for the creation of superior wear and corrosion resistant coatings. The research objective is to determine if metallic powders, at temperatures below their melting point, can be accelerated to high velocities, impact a substrate and adhere, to produce a high quality coating. The coating device that will be used is an experimental Pulsed High Acceleration Spray Technique (PHAST) Gun. The PHAST coating technique can be described as a high velocity cold spray type process that utilizes a pulsed capillary discharge. Screening experiments will be performed in Phase I to determine if various alloys can be deposited by the PHAST Gun. The PHAST process is expected to result in plastic deformation of the feed particles upon impact with the substrate, thus forming coatings characterized by good adhesion, high density, and low oxide content. Measured properties will be compared with existing thermal spray coating properties to determine the improvement attributed to the PHAST Gun.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous commercial applications for dense corrosion and wear resistant coatings in the chemical process industry, industrial machinery, and aircraft industries. Some of these applications are for the replacement of hard chrome plate and others will be new applications for previously unprotected parts. PHAST coatings are expected to protect and extend the life of components such as, pump shafts, die gates, linings for process vessels, housings, nozzles, ball and roller bearing surfaces, and hydraulic cylinder\r\nshafts.",
