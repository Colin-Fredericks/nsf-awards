 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Kirk, Houde, Darnell, and DebBurman in the\r\nBiology Department at Lake Forest College to acquire a state-of-the-art\r\nmulti-imaging system to further biological research and enhance the\r\nundergraduate biology curriculum.  Faculty in the biology department\r\ncurrently utilize molecular techniques to research basic aspects of biology\r\nsuch as chromosome replication, neural development and degeneration, and the\r\nevolution of sexual behavior.  The multi-imaging system will allow the\r\ndepartment to transition from conventional analyses of protein and DNA to a\r\nhighly sensitive and quantitative approach utilizing fluorescent and\r\nradioactive signal detection.\r\n\r\nFaculty-student collaborative research and teaching at Lake Forest College\r\nrelies heavily on the use of modern molecular techniques in order to\r\nvisualize a particular class of DNA or protein, separated from all other\r\nmolecules of its kind.  For example, Dr. Karen Kirk studies the interaction\r\nof specific proteins that bind to telomeres, the ends of chromosomes, in the\r\ncell cycle of the protozoan, Tetrahymena.  Dr. Diana Darnell studies the\r\nexpression of certain genes affecting neural development in chick, and Dr.\r\nShubhik DebBurman studies the effects of protein-remodeling factors on human\r\ndisease-associated proteins in yeast.  Dr. Anne Houde will initiate a new\r\nmolecular fingerprinting project in her ongoing studies of the evolution of\r\nsexual behavior and color polymorphism in guppies.  The multi-imaging system\r\nis so versatile that it can be used in all these research contexts.  Data\r\nwill be collected much more efficiently and quantitatively from a variety of\r\ntechniques, including agarose and acrylamide gel electrophoresis of nucleic\r\nacids and proteins, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), colony library\r\nscreening, and Southern, Northern, and Western blotting.  Acquisition of the\r\nmulti-imaging system will allow more rapid processing of the data and hence\r\ngreater throughput in laboratory procedures and will extend quantification\r\ncapabilities to allow faculty and students to employ new experimental\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\nLake Forest College and its Biology Department are committed to an\r\neducational mission that stresses integration of research and teaching and\r\nprovides an environment in which students can engage in original, publishable\r\nresearch. Students majoring in biology at Lake Forest College receive\r\ntraining in modern research methods through these research programs and\r\nthrough their course work.  The undergraduate biology curriculum emphasizes\r\nstudent-designed investigation using current technology. This kind of\r\nenvironment in small colleges has been shown to contribute disproportionately\r\nto the pool of future research scientists.  Lake Forest College has a strong\r\ntrack record in collaborative faculty-student research and will benefit\r\nsubstantially from the availability of a state-of-the-art multi-imaging\r\nsystem. Ultimately, the enhancement of the research and training capabilities\r\nof the biology department will help attract larger numbers of talented\r\nstudents interested in research and research careers.  Currently, the\r\nmajority of biology majors at Lake Forest College are women and  a\r\nsignificant number are minority students. The college is strongly committed\r\nto recruitment of underrepresented groups and improved research facilities\r\nwill help to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\n",
