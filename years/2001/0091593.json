 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a computational Problem Solving Environment (PSE) for the creation, optimization, testing, and application of reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms.  Inclusion of detailed chemistry into 3D simulations with turbulence-chemistry interaction will be computationally intractable for the foreseeable future.  Practical simulation of reacting flows requires reduced mechanisms tailored to the application and conditions of interest.  The PSE created in Phase I allows the user to rapidly create reduced mechanisms, set up multi-parameter test problems for comparison to detailed chemistry, and interrogate and visualize the results more thoroughly than was previously possible. Human effort for reduced mechanism validation is reduced from days to hours. Rigorous testing is necessary to make reduced mechanisms a reliable commercial product. In Phase II the PSE will be extended to automatically optimize reduced mechanisms to the users' specification, and produce reduced mechanism modules for a variety of applications that seamlessly integrate into a variety of Computational Fluid Dynamics codes.\r\n\r\nThese technologies will have commercial value due to the ever-increasing need to include more detailed chemistry into the design and analysis software used by scientists and engineers.  The problem solving environment provides the engineer with the ability to rapidly create reduced mechanisms, set up multiple test problems covering a multidimensional parameter space for comparison to detailed chemistry, and efficiently interrogate and visualize the results.\r\n",
