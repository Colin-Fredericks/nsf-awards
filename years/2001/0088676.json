 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) Biological Sciences (61) \r\nThe primary objectives for this project are to enhance the laboratory experience of students in ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy with the introduction of a new protein chemistry course, and to expand the laboratory experiences involving UV/visible spectroscopy in chemistry, biology, and molecular science courses. In addition, we are providing access of UV/visible spectroscopy to the wider educational community in Cedar Rapids through existing outreach programs. We are basing these changes on the addition of eight, single wavelength UV/visible spectrophotometers and three scanning UV/visible instruments. Students have the opportunity to use more sophisticated techniques with the inclusion of more research based laboratory experiences that begin in introductory laboratories and continue through advanced courses. The new protein chemistry course in being adapted from one developed by John Markwell at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, while changes in the other courses include the adaptation of a wide range of experiments from the research or educational literature. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
