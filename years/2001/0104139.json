 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0104139\r\nMikhail G. Khovanov\r\n\r\nThe project aims to construct quantum invariants of \r\n4-dimensional objects.  It is based on the author's recent \r\ndiscovery of a doubly-graded cohomology theory of links in \r\nthe 3-sphere. The Euler characteristic of the cohomology \r\ngroups is equal to the Jones polynomial.  We would like to \r\nextend this theory to link cobordisms. The invariant of a \r\ncobordism will be a homomorphism between cohomology groups \r\nassigned to the boundaries of the cobordism. Furthermore, \r\nthe theory should extend to tangles and tangle cobordisms. \r\nTo a tangle we'll associate a functor between triangulated \r\ncategories associated to the boundaries of the tangle, and \r\nto a tangle cobordism a natural transformation between functors. \r\nThese triangulated categories will be related to highest weight\r\ncategories of modules over simple Lie algebras, as well as \r\ncategories of modules over certain Frobenius algebras, such \r\nas cyclotomic Hecke algebras. In addition, we will look for \r\ncohomology theories lifts of other quantum invariants of links \r\nand 3-manifolds, including the Alexander and HOMFLY polynomials \r\nand Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.   \r\n\r\nAn n-dimensional manifold is an object that locally looks \r\nlike an n-dimensional space. A circle can be approximated by \r\na tangent line in the neighbourhood of a point, and is a \r\none-dimensional manifold (n-manifold, for short). The global \r\nstructure distinguishes the circle from the line, though. \r\nSurfaces provide examples of two-manifolds.  It turns out that \r\none and two-manifolds are easy to classify, while in higher \r\ndimensions classification is hard. It is a theorem that \r\nin dimensions greater than three there can be no satisfactory classification, and topologists seem to be fairly close to \r\nfinding one for three-manifolds. Given a pair of manifolds, \r\nit is a tough question to decide whether or not they are \r\nisomorphic. One approach is to extract some tangible invariant \r\nout of a manifold, such as a number, or a polynomial, and then \r\ncompare these numbers. Most of the times the numbers are different \r\nand tell us that the manifolds are different, too. Dimension \r\nthree is special in that there is a wealth of such invariants. \r\nThese invariants, moreover, link three-manifold topology with \r\ndeep algebraic structures. There are indications that the \r\ninvariants can be lifted to the next dimension, to invariants \r\nof four-manifolds, and my goal is to find them and compare to \r\nanalytical invariants of 4-manifolds that arise from solutions of \r\ncertain partial differential equations. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
