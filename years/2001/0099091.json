 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: Issues in the Applied Analysis of Markets.\r\n\r\nThis proposal has several parts. The first is to extend prior models of demand\r\nsystems in characteristic space. These models were primarily developed to\r\nprovide a tool that enables the user to analyze (own and cross) price and\r\ncharacteristic elasticities of demand. The same models can (and have) been\r\nused to evaluate the demand for and the utility derived from new goods, but\r\ntheir implications in those contexts are questionable (these include applica-\r\ntions like evaluating the returns to innovations, or constructing price indices).\r\nThis is because some of the model's properties vis a vis the evaluation of new\r\ngoods are \"counterintuitve\".\r\n\r\nWe consider a change in the demand model that gets rid of these coun-\r\nterintuitive implications, and then compare alternative ways of evaluating\r\nnew goods. One of the alternatives is \\hedonic\" analysis; a technique which\r\nis currently used to correct the CPI for new goods bias. In doing this com-\r\nparison I will provide a detailed analysis of alternative ways of computing\r\nhedonic corrections. Hopefully this will be of use to the statistical agencies.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the proposal seeks to extend methods for computing\r\nand analyzing dynamic games to allow for asymmetric information. We focus\r\non models which can detect and analyze collusive outcomes, and show how\r\nthe learning and artificial intelligence literatures can help provide a simple\r\ntool for such an analysis.\r\n\r\nThe third section of the proposal outlines a new and relatively simple\r\nprocedure for estimation and subsequent empirical analysis of oligopolistic\r\nmarkets when either asymmetric information, or dynamic considerations, are\r\nimportant. I hope to explore the range of application and performance of\r\nthis technique. The technique was developed while I was trying to sort out\r\nresearch strategies for two new empirical projects, one on the demand for\r\npharmaceuticals and one on deregulated electric utility markets. The two\r\nfinal sections of the proposal outline these projects.\r\n\r\nBoth empirical projects are joint with colleagues who have worked exten-\r\nsively on the industries studied. Our goal in the project on the demand for\r\npharmaceuticals is to understand how past experience, marketing, and infor-\r\nmation on product performance, interact with other market characteristics\r\nto shape demand. We are particularly interested in the impact of advertis-\r\ning on demand and on welfare, and on how recent institutional changes, like\r\nthe development of the Over the Counter market for some durgs, impact on\r\ndemand and welfare.\r\n\r\nThe project on deregulated British electric utility markets will initially\r\nfocus on getting estimates of start up and capital costs. This should enable\r\nus to provide measures of profitability that take account of these costs. This,\r\nin turn, will enable us to quantify the incentives to invest in more generating\r\ncapacity that are provided by the institutions which determine the newly\r\nderregulated market outcomes. Later we hope to engage in a more in depth\r\nanalysis of the relationship between different aspects of these institutions\r\nand the price and quantity allocations that are likely to be generated by the\r\nmarket.\r\n",
