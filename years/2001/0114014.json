 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose development of a network layer protocol necessary to increase the utility of acoustic\r\ncommunications in the shallow water environment. Increasing attention has been given to collecting data\r\nfrom difficult to access coastal waters for diverse activities, to include scientific research, industrial and\r\ncommercial concerns, and military applications. The preponderance of activity has focused on\r\ndeveloping reliable methods for transmitting the information collected through the difficult time-varying\r\nshallow water medium. However, current network layer protocols, which are responsible for determining\r\ntraffic routing, do not provide for guaranteed quality of services. Current protocols also may cause\r\nunnecessary message delays.\r\nThe delivery of traffic in an acoustic network is complicated by the excessive propagation delays\r\nresulting from the speed of sound in water. The effect of this propagation speed is to cause an acoustic\r\nnetwork connected by short hops to perform similar to a wire-based network with links between\r\nneighboring nodes of over 100,000 kilometers. However, the potential benefits and increased potential\r\nfor application developments that stem from the implementation of wireless underwater networks make it\r\nworthwhile to explore means of mitigating the effects of the propagation delays.\r\nCentral to the problem of route determination for network traffic is the discovery of the networks\r\ntopology from which network nodes extract next-hop information upon which to base traffic forwarding\r\ndecisions. Two principal methods are used for discovering the route information. Proactive routing\r\nmethods pre-compute route data before network traffic is generated, thus when traffic is submitted by\r\nnetwork applications the appropriate routes are already known. Reactive routing determines the route\r\ninformation in response to traffic submissions. This method, referred to as on-demand routing, seeks to\r\nminimize route discovery traffic by only determining routes necessary to support actual traffic patterns.\r\nThis routing information is cached to increase responsiveness to submitted traffic and adaptability to\r\ntopology changes. Both methods have their merits; however, neither adequately supports resource\r\nallocations necessary to assure guaranteed levels of service quality.\r\nWe proposed a novel network protocol that provides many of the benefits of proactive routing yet\r\nretains the adaptability of reactive protocols. Our protocol is based upon a central master node which\r\nperiodically probes the network for active participant nodes. In responding to the probes, the nodes\r\nprovide the master node with sufficient information for the master node to determine all possible data\r\npaths through the network. From this information the master node makes all routing decisions for the\r\nnetwork and provides irnext-hoply information to each non-master node, thus reducing the workload on\r\nnon-master nodes. This information also enables the master node to optimize the allocation of traffic to\r\nnetwork paths providing for active management of delays insuring delay variance and data capacity are\r\nwithin the established quality of service commitments.\r\nFundamental to this approach is the separation of control traffic from data delivery. This separation\r\nallows data to be transmitted without first having to wait for traditional handshake mechanisms to provide\r\naccess to the channel. This separation significantly reduces the expected delay to which traffic is\r\nsubjected resulting in potentially higher data throughput.\r\nProgress in network layer protocols will expand the usefulness of underwater acoustic networks\r\nbeyond applications that are limited to very low data rate traffic and non-time sensitive data types.\r\nSpecific beneficiaries of this research activity include the Deployable Autonomous Distributed System,\r\nthe SeaWeb Technology Demonstrations, the Autonomous Oceanographic Sampling Network, and the\r\nNational Oceanographic partnership Programs Front Resolving Observational Network with Telemetry\r\n(FRONT) project.",
