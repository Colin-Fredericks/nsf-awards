 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the interfacial adsorption, diffusion, and reaction of hydrogen halides with hydroxy-functionalized organic surfaces.  Professor John R.  Morris and his coworkers of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univeristy  will examine reactions of interest in a number of environmentally important processes.  Molecular beam scattering from functionalized self-assembled monolayers will be used to examine these interactions.  The translational energy of the scattered product species will be monitored by TOF analysis, and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy will be used to identify the surface adsorbed reaction products.  Gas-surface energy transfer, interfacial reaction probability, and the role of coadsorbed solvent molecules on the surface reaction process will be examined.  This research effort will be integrated with the development of an introductory analytical chemistry course at VPI incorporating inquiry based cooperative learning methods.  Examples will be drawn from real world environmental problems, and will be tied to the basic research underway in the P.I.'s laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER project focusses on the basic understanding of the interfacial chemistry of hydrogen halides, using detailed dynamic experimental methods.  This surface chemistry is of considerable interest in a number of environmental applications, and the educational component of this project will focus on these environmental connections in the integration of this research with the education of graduate and undergraduate students.  Inquiry based learning methods will be incorporated into the introductory analytical course offerings as part of this project.\r\n",
