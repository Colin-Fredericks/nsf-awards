 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to establish methods for theoretical \r\nstudy in an important area of theoretical computer science, which is\r\nthe analysis of randomized algorithms. The main focus is on problems\r\nthat either can be modeled by Markov chains or can be analyzed using\r\nthe Markov chain approach.\r\n\r\nThis project concentrates on three main topics: (1) general analysis\r\nof discrete-time Markov chains and the Monte Carlo Markov Chain\r\nmethod, (2) analysis of Markov chains for generating random\r\npermutations, and (3) resource allocation problems in distributed\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nIn the area of general analysis of Markov chains the goal of the\r\nresearch is to develop new tools for the analysis of mixing times of\r\nMarkov chains. An important part of this study is to investigate\r\nrelationships between various known methods of the analysis of mixing\r\ntimes of Markov chains.\r\n\r\nIn the investigations of Markov chains for generating random\r\npermutations the main focus is on so called random switching\r\nnetworks. These networks model behavior of many Markov chains that\r\nare sought in applications in cryptography.\r\n\r\nIn the area of resource allocation problems in distributed systems,\r\nthe research focuses mostly on resource allocation problems in\r\nnetworks, in which the cost of the allocation depend on the routing\r\nproperties of the input network as well as on the contention\r\nresolution protocols applied to the system.\r\n\r\n",
