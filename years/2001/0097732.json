 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the University of Southern Mississippi.  Jeffrey Evans is the site's Program Director and he will be assisted by at least 12 faculty in the department offering a wide variety of research opportunities for undergraduates.  Over the award period (2001-2003), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. The objective of this project is to provide research experience for minority undergraduates in Chemistry and Biochemistry.  Recruitment efforts will be both within the State of Mississippi and adjoining states with special emphasis on attracting minority students.  During the summer there will be weekly research presentations and discussions of ethics in science, graduate school and GRE preparation.  The final week in the summer will include a symposium.",
