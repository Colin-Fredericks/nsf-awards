 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nolan\r\n0104573\r\n     The investigator seeks to improve ultrasound imaging in\r\norder for it to be a more effective tool in breast cancer\r\ndiagnosis and treatment.  He uses modern methods of partial\r\ndifferential equations and microlocal analysis to provide images\r\nof the breast that are artifact-free and of a higher resolution\r\nthan currently available.  He models propagation and scattering of\r\nultrasonic waves using microlocal analysis and geometrical\r\noptics.  In particular, the approach uses the complete waveform of\r\nthe ultrasound instead of just its phase.  Microlocal analysis\r\nprovides a clear explanation of artifacts that appear in acoustic\r\nimages.  More importantly, it provides a means of avoiding and\r\nremoving such artifacts.  To help in obtaining clear images, the\r\ninvestigator looks for an arrangement of transducers providing\r\nthe strongest measurable scattered signal at the surface of the\r\nbreast.  The optimal configuration is based on a power method that\r\nstarts with a non-zero arbitrary source and measures the\r\nresulting scattered field (caused by a tumor for example) at the\r\nsurface.  He models the scattering process with a linear\r\nscattering operator based on the wave equation.  The scattering\r\noperator maps sources to scattered wave fields, whereas the\r\nadjoint scattering operator maps scattered wave fields to\r\nsources.  By composing the scattering operator with its adjoint,\r\nhe uses the power method to find the eigenfunction corresponding\r\nto the largest scattered signal.  Novel in the approach is the\r\nability to couple the power method with geometrical optics.  This\r\nprovides an analytical tool for computing the optimal sources\r\nthat can then be implemented computationally in a very efficient\r\nway for both modeling and imaging the inversion.\r\n     This work aims to provide a new method of imaging the female\r\nbreast for use in diagnosing and treating of breast cancer.  The\r\ntechnique is based on ultrasound waves, howver it uses much more\r\ninformation from these waves than is currently used.  In\r\nparticular, the shape of the waves that bounce off of a lesion or\r\ntumor in the breast is analyzed.  The method is tailored to avoid\r\nartifacts that can appear in current imaging techniques.  In\r\naddition, the method will be fast and feasible to implement.\r\nBecause of the reliability and clarity of the images, this new\r\nimaging technique should significantly cut down on the number of\r\nunnecessary biopsies that are currently carried out in the United\r\nStates each year.  Because of the speed of the method, it can help\r\nto provide a quick diagnosis.  The method also takes advantage of\r\nrecently developed three dimensional imaging technology.\r\nUltrasound is a tried and safe method of imaging; it involves no\r\nharmful radiation.  The method is general enought that it could\r\nconcievably have spin-offs into other modes of imaging (X-Ray,\r\nMRI, etc.).  Finally, this new method of imaging should create\r\nopportunities for new and established companies to manufacture\r\ndevices that take advantage of it.\r\n",
