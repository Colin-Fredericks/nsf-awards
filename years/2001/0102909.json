The PI  proposes to continue her research program \r\nto develop methods to study  valuation problems in incomplete \r\nmarkets, concetrated in the following class of applications: \r\ni) optimal asset allocation under market frictions the goal being  \r\nto derive and analyze the optimal risky demand and to represent the \r\nvalue function in terms of  distorted measures, ii) valuation of \r\nderivatives written on nontraded assets with the goal to use \r\nutility-based pricing methodology to specify the hedging strategies \r\nand to expole their role in risk aggregation, iii) dynamic hedging \r\nof volatility risks  the goal being to specify the arbitrage-free \r\ncomponents of the implied volatility process and to study their \r\nimplications to the dynamic management of volatility risks, and\r\niv) asset valuation under irreversible decisions with the goals \r\nbeing to evaluate early exercise instruments under constraints \r\nrelated to irreversible decisions and to analyze the impact of \r\nirreversibilities to prices and optimal demand. The technical \r\ntools come from stochastic analysis, stochastic control and \r\nnonlinear partial differential equations.\r\n\r\nIn most market settings, the classical assumption of market \r\ncompleteness is not satisfied and, therefore, the traditional \r\napproach of perfect replication cannot be applied. It becomes \r\nhence necessary to review the pricing and risk management concepts.  \r\nThe first  step is the development of a unified framework to \r\nanalyze the inherent market risks, and identify the components that \r\ncan be hedged away and the ones that cannot. The second step is the \r\nestablishment of a coherent method to price the unhedgeable risks \r\nin order to achieve effective risk management. The PI proposes to \r\ncontinue her work in market models with frictions along the \r\naforementioned two general directions. The proposed methodologies rely\r\nheavily on the classical economic principles of utility theory which\r\nreflect the investors' preferences towards the risks that cannot be\r\neliminated. Among others, the PI proposes to study models of asset\r\nallocation, derivative pricing and risk management under various market\r\nfrictions including stochastic volatility, nontraded assets and\r\nirreversible management policies.\r\n\r\n",
