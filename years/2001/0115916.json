The experiment continued until Viki's untimely death in 1954 of viral encephalitis. During that time, Catherine Hayes kept a detailed daily diary of Viki's behavior, collected numerous photographs of the project, along with unpublished book chapters and manuscript materials. This is the most important cross-rearing project of its kind, given the length of the effort, the quality of the investigators, and the thorough documentation of the project.\r\n\r\nCatherine Hayes (now Catherine Nissen), preserved these extensive records of the project. She is now suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and is reluctant to make any permanent arrangements for the disposition of these invaluable scientific records. Her daughter, Diana Hovey, believes it is possible to negotiate such an arrangement.  This project supports a visit by the PI to meet with Catherine Nissen in Middleton, WI, in the near future.  The goal is to arrange for a donation of these invaluable scientific records. Photocopies of all material are to be made, along with copy photographs of images. The project supports an undergraduate student to conduct  the preliminary sorting of the copied materials.  The PI also intends to negotiate with an institution, according to Ms. Nissen's wishes, for a permanent home for the extensive records of this singularly important research project.\r\n",
