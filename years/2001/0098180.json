 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximation of NP-hard problems: Algorithms and Complexity\r\nSanjeev Arora\r\nPrinceton University\r\n\r\nThe broad goal of  the project is a study of the approximation properties of\r\nNP-hard problems. NP-hard problems are those that do not have any efficient\r\nalgorithms if the classes P and NP are different, as is widely-believed. They arise in a variety\r\nof application areas in science and technology, including scheduling, VLSI\r\ndesign, artificial intelligence, design of optimum networks, etc. \r\nSince we do not expect to solve these problems optimally, there is a need to \r\ndesign efficient approximation algorithms for them: algorithms that compute a \r\nsolution whose cost is within a small factor of the optimum. The PI has been\r\ninvolved in designing approximation algorithms during the past decade. He has\r\nalso been part of an ongoing research program that shows that for many of these problems,\r\ncomputing approximate solutions is no easier than computing optimum\r\nsolutions. (In other words, approximation is also NP-hard.) These\r\ninapproximability results shed important light on the problems as well.\r\n\r\nThe project takes a two-pronged approach, combining a search for good\r\napproximation algorithms with a search ---using the theory of probabilistically \r\ncheckable proofs (PCPs)--- for inapproximability results. The project focusses\r\non a collection of important algorithmic problems, including: learning mixtures\r\nof distributions (a problem important in AI and data  mining/analysis),\r\nlearning bayes nets and markov random fields  (useful in speech recognition,\r\nmachine vision, medical diagnoses systems etc.), lattice problems (useful in\r\ncryptography and cryptanalysis), and graph coloring (a central problem in complexity theory).\r\nProgress, especially algorithmic progress, on any of these problems has\r\nimportant consequences.",
