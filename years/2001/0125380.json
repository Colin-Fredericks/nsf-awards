The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0179).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners for this award include Michigan Technological University, North Carolina State University, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, NASA, Michigan Economic Development Corporation, Upstate Alliance for Innovation (NY), and North Carolina Technological Development Authority.\r\n\r\nProposed Activities\r\nThe award will support the following activities: (1) coupling technology transfer and sponsored research programs in the academic institutions, (2) create an inventory of knowledge assets at the academic institutions via an on-line data base, (3) managing and sharing knowledge assets among the partners via internal collaborative relationships among the partners, and any new partners.\r\n\r\nProposed Innovation\r\nWhen completed the integrated knowledge management infrastructure will support university to university as well as university to industry knowledge sharing.  The new system will facilitate the recognition and management of the full range of academia's knowledge assets with a sharp focus on identifying, implementing and managing partnership opportunities.  The knowledge management infrastructure will be easily replicated by other academic institutions and their partners.  The innovation is the research to identify which knowledge an academic institution has that has potential for commercialization plus development of the information technology needed to inventory and manage it.  Included in this research is the development of methodology to identify the knowledge of interest to the various private sector partners, both current and future.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe methodologies should be invaluable to academia to recognize the value of its intellectual property and to target potential private sector and government partners needed for commercialization more effectively.\r\n\r\nPotential Societal Impact\r\nGeneral economic wellbeing that results from new sustainable businesses will be of benefit to the citizens of the affected regions.  The results will be easily replicated by other academic institutions and their regions.\r\n",
