 "awd_abstract_narration": "Practical Persistent Data Structures\r\n\r\nThe legal phrase \"status quo ante\" refers to reverting to a previous\r\nstate of affairs.  The same concept frequently arises in computer\r\nscience.  For example, most word processors include an \"undo\" feature that\r\nnullifies the most recent changes and returns the document to its previous\r\nstate.  Unfortunately, most current methods of organizing data do not\r\nsupport the ability to revert to previous states, or at least do not do\r\nso efficiently.  This research involves designing and evaluating practical\r\ntechniques for supporting such an ability.\r\n\r\nTechnically, a data structure is called \"persistent\" if updating the data\r\nstructure creates a new version without destroying the old version.  After\r\nthe update the two versions co-exist, and future operations can refer to\r\neither or both.  Persistent data structures are sometimes called immutable.\r\nPersistent data structures have applications in computational geometry,\r\ntransaction processing, editing, functional programming, compilers, and\r\nmany other areas.  In addition, persistent data structures have several\r\nimportant non-algorithmic benefits, including elimination of certain\r\nfamilies of bugs, increased security, and decreased need for synchronization\r\namong multiple processors.  The objectives of this project include - inventing\r\nnew persistent data structures, with an emphasis on practicality  rather than\r\nmerely theoretical efficiency,  - extracting from these new data structures new\r\ndesign and analysis techniques suitable for a persistent environment, and -\r\nexperimentally evaluating the practical efficiency of competing persistent\r\ndata structures.\r\n",
