 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a prototype instrument for measuring harmful bi-products of chlorination in drinking water. These disinfection bi-products are subject to EPA regulations. The Phase I project demonstrated that the concept of differential UV absorption measurement, i.e. absorption before and after chlorination, is suitable for the needed measurement. A pre-production prototype instrument will be constructed during the Phase II project. This device shall employ a multi-pass cell design using our novel dual-ratio technique that eliminates concerns about long term drifts. The overall instrument architecture design and systems design will be carried out prior to assembly of the full microprocessor-controlled  recording device. Extensive laboratory and field tests will be used to review design changes before production.\r\n\r\nThe potential commercial applications of the instrument proposed may be used in the\r\nlaboratory or in-line at utilities. The market for the proposed product is quite substantial as EPA regulations will result in the installation of such devices at all utilities and drinking water facilities.\r\n",
