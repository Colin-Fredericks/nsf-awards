Key observations lie in the fact that \r\nthere are symmetric and compactly supported biorthogonal wavelets, but \r\nnot within an MRA (of compactly supported wavelets). It shows the \"lack \r\nof room\" within the MRA subspace structure. PFFS is a tool to explore the \r\ninsight story of such a phenomenon.  Theme 2 focuses on a new \r\nconstruction approach of interpolatory multiresolution analysis (I-MRA).  \r\nThe key observation is that an interpolatory sequence can be defined by \r\nsampled reproducing kernel function of a subspace V of an MRA.   It is \r\nexpected that such an interpolatory sequence can easily form a basis or \r\nframe of V, giving rise to an interpolatory \"interface\" to the MRA, and a \r\nconstruction methodology of I-MRA.  Theme 3 studies applications of \r\nPFFSs in the Sinc-type methods for interpolations and quadratures.  The \r\nmotivation is to explore the advantage of fast decaying properties of \r\nPFFSs in the Sinc-type applications.  In theme 4, the P.I. expects to apply \r\nsimilar interpolation techniques as described in theme 2 to study multi-\r\nband samplings using frames and/or PFFSs as fundamental tools. The \r\ntechnique of PFFSs with their flexibility is expected to play a role.\r\n\r\nEach research topic is highly motivated by its applications in data/image \r\ncompression, sampling and interpolation for efficient numerical \r\nimplementations.  PFFS is a tool to study a subspace V while \"standing\" \r\noutside of it.  In doing so, one is given the freedom and additional \"room\" \r\nto perform tasks in V by using advanced tools not available in V.  In \r\nsignal/image processing, such advanced properties of PFFS are extremely \r\nuseful because it is known that biorthogonal wavelets of finite length with \r\nsymmetry are desirable for reducing ``blocking'' and ``ringing'' effects, and \r\nyet such biorthogonal wavelets do not reside in its dual wavelet subspace. \r\nWe believe that PFFS shall not only provide a class of biorthogonal \r\nwavelet examples, the additional information (known from the \r\nconstruction) contributed by PFFS will provide practical insight about \r\n\"blocking\" and \"ringing\" artifacts, and thereby delivers new solutions and \r\nenhanced signal/image compression rate and communication speed.   \r\nOther applications of PFFSs in irregular sampling (for multi-band \r\nfunctions) as well as in the Sinc-type methods (for interpolation and \r\nquadratures) are all based on applying flexible properties of PFFSs.  The \r\nexpectations include enhanced practical efficiency and improved rate of \r\nconvergence.   The project on interpolatory multiresolution analysis has \r\npractical applications in data acquisition/sampling while simultaneously \r\nperforming the wavelet transform.  One of the key ingredients of the study \r\nis to build an interpolatory \"interface\" to a given MRA and still keep the \r\nunderlying desirable wavelet properties.\r\n",
