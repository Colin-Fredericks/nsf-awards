 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discrete spectrum of the Laplacian on the \r\nmodular surface and the associated eigenfunctions \r\n(called Maass wave forms) are an interesting and basic \r\nclass of functions which nevertheless remain mysteriously \r\nelusive fifty years after their discovery. While numerical \r\napproximations exist, concrete analytic information is \r\nsomewhat scarce; in particular, at present no explicit \r\nconstructions exist for any of these eigenfunctions. These \r\nmathematical objects are of interest in such seemingly \r\ndiverse fields as number theory in mathematics and dynamical \r\nsystems, statistical mechanics, and quantum chaos in \r\ntheoretical physics. The starting point for this project is\r\na new class of functions equivalent to the Maass forms, called \r\nperiod functions in analogy with the period polynomials \r\nassociated to the classical modular forms of integral weight. \r\nThese functions, discovered by the investigator and developed \r\nindividually and more recently in collaboration with D. Zagier, \r\nare holomorphic and satisfy a simple functional equation, and \r\nso appear to be simpler class of mathematical objects than the \r\nMaass forms themselves. For this reason, and because the \r\ndevelopment of their algebraic structure leads in a number of \r\ndifferent interrelated and intriguing directions, they show \r\npromise to continue to shed new light on this basic problem. \r\nTheir further development and the extension of these results \r\nto general subgroups, using representation theory and cohomology \r\nof groups, are the main goals of this project. In addition, \r\nconnections between period functions and certain equations which \r\narise both in the study of transfer operators for dynamical \r\nsystems and in the study of spin-chain partition functions in \r\nstatistical mechanics are already under study by several \r\nresearchers, including one working group in Germany which \r\nis specifically investigating these questions. The applications \r\nof Maass period functions to these related areas of theoretical \r\nphysics is thus also a focus of this work, to be pursued including \r\ndiscussions with researchers working on these problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Research in mathematics and related theoretical physics will \r\nuse methods developed by the investigator and his colleagues to \r\ngain more concrete and explicit information about Maass wave forms. \r\nThese functions are one type in a class called \"modular forms\" \r\nwhich has many applications in such diverse fields as number theory, \r\nphysics, and cryptography (or code making and breaking). Maass wave \r\nforms in particular are the non-Euclidean version of the sine waves \r\n(or pure tones - the wave form produced by striking a tuning fork) \r\nin ordinary space, which are the basic components out of which all \r\nshapes are built. The study of geometry and physics in this non-\r\nEuclidean \"parallel universe\" has provided science with a rich source \r\nof new ideas, as well as a contrasting proving ground on which to \r\nsharpen ideas in the geometry and physics of the space we live in. \r\nFor example, the study of the behavior of Maass forms provides very \r\nuseful insights in the quest to gain a deeper understanding of the \r\nconditions under which a physical system will exhibit regular or \r\nchaotic behavior, an important and pervasive question in physics. \r\nMaass forms have proven mysteriously hard to construct explicitly, \r\nand continue to be under active investigation fifty years after \r\ntheir discovery.  \r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n",
