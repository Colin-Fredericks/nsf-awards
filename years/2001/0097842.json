 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research experiences for undergraduates (REU) program at the Medical University of South Carolina is designed to provide both didactic and laboratory research experience in cutting-edge neuroscience research.  The successful applicants will receive overview training in the neurosciences, exposure to one or more laboratories where they will have hands on experience in a specific research project, as well as an appreciation for the ethical responsibilities faced by researchers responsible for bringing new knowledge into society and training new neuroscientists.  Students will have the opportunity to use a variety of biological, chemical and biophysical approaches to understanding cell biology as it pertains to the functioning of neurons.  Research will be focussed on the cellular neuroplastic responses of in vitro and in vivo models of central nervous system functions, including studies of receptors, signal transduction pathways, signaling in development and cell differentiation, as well as in memory formation.  The research period will be for a period of ten weeks with an immediate goal of, 1) giving the students hands on experience in the excitement of scientific discovery in the neurosciences, and 2) an appreciation for what a career in research in the neurosciences would be like.  The overarching goal and significance of this proposal is that through exposure to the REU program we can attract an important human resource into the field of neuroscience research.  However, even if a career in science is not chosen, the REU program will give future decision makers in our society a strong appreciation for the discovery process.",
