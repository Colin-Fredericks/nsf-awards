 "awd_abstract_narration": "The author proposes to study a variety of problems in harmonic analysis\r\nrelated to linear and  multilinear  singular integral operators.\r\nMore specifically, the principal investigator proposes to embark on a\r\nstudy of multipliers for translation-invariant multilinear operators, both broad\r\nenough to cover known examples, but also deep enough to include very singular\r\noperators such as the bilinear Hilbert transform. A key point of the author's\r\nresearch will be the characteristic function of the unit\r\ndisc thought of as a bilinear multiplier and its relation to other\r\nimportant operators in Fourier analysis such as the ball multiplier and\r\nCarleson's operator.  A related study of maximal multilinear multipliers\r\nwill also be pursued. Deep relations between Carleson's operator in two dimensions and the maximal disc multiplier will be sought. In particular it will\r\nbe  investigated whether the analysis developed in the study of the maximal bilinear disc multiplier will shed  light on the problem of almost everywhere\r\nconvergence of Fourier series in two dimensions. Problems in linear harmonic analysis that will be investigated include estimates for rough singular integrals and sharp inequalities for  operators such as the discrete Hilbert transform and the Balayage operator associated with Carleson measures.\r\n\r\nIn music,  harmonics are simple tones whose oscillations are integral\r\nmultiples of a simple basic frequency and these can be used to\r\ndisassemble arrangements of complicated sounds.\r\nIn mathematics, harmonic analysis has a similar objective i.e.\r\nthe study of complicated objects via their decomposition into simpler\r\nwell-understood basic blocks.  Irregularities of signals and images\r\nare better located once these are decomposed into small pieces and\r\nstudied via Fourier analysis. For instance, noise and blurring are easily located\r\nwith the application of the Fourier transform, but nowadays even\r\nmore challenging feats can be achieved. This proposal is\r\nconcerned with the study of certain linear and multilinear\r\nmultiplier operators   using decomposition techniques.\r\nMultiplier operators are defined by altering the frequency of signals via  multiplication with a fixed and often nonsmooth function.\r\nIn practice, the abrupt interruption of radio communication or\r\ntelevision transmission by a meteorological phenomenon\r\nare examples of such nonsmooth multiplier operators.\r\nThe protection against the loss of information can be\r\nmathematically modeled  in a quantitative  way (integrability to a\r\npower) which is  proposed to be studied here.  This constitutes the first\r\ngoal of the proposed research. A secondary issue considered in this proposal is obtaining sharp estimates for some important and useful inequalities. Sharp estimates enrich our understanding of these inequalities as they\r\noften reflect useful esoteric  combinatorial or geometric information.\r\nFurthermore, they provide improved error estimates often needed in\r\nnumerical implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
