 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nSupport of student participation in the North American Paleontological Convention (NAPC-2001) June 26-July 1, 2001\r\n\r\nThe North American Paleontological Convention is a quadrennial meeting of paleontologists from a variety of disciplines.  It is supported by paleontological societies headquartered in North America, and is open to all who are interested in paleontology.  The meeting planned for June 26 through July 1, 2001 in Berkeley, CA will be the seventh NAPC.  Each previous convention has been judged an excellent opportunity for the presentation of the results of new research and for discussions of current areas of paleontological research.  One aim of NAPC is to allow specialists who would not otherwise normally be in contact to meet and exchange ideas.  Based on past experience, the Organizing Committee for NAPC-2001 expects that over 500 professionals will attend and interact during four days of meetings and on several field trips.\r\n\r\nThe Organizing Committee believes that the continued interest of students and young professionals is critical to the health of the field.  Not only will they maintain the study of past life, they are the ones who will provide fresh approaches and examine old fossils with new eyes.  NAPC provides an outstanding educational opportunity to obtain focused presentations of paleontological information from talks and poster presentations without the other distractions presented at a general geological meeting.  It also allows students the ready opportunity to meet with leaders in the field and to discuss their research in progress, both formally and informally, in a venue not provided by a national or regional geologic meeting.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests $25,000 to support the attendance at NAPC-2001 of students and young professionals from the U.S., Mexico and other countries where students and professionals work on North American paleontology.\r\n",
