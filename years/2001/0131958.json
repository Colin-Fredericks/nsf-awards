The normal response\r\nto this double heterogeneity has been the development and enforcement of metadata (data about data)\r\nstandards; in this response one tries to abstract data away from its organizational context in order to\r\nrender it universally accessible. This project takes the opposite track, and seeks new ways of grounding\r\nenvironmental data in its organizational context in such a way that it can both be used more flexibly today\r\nand so it can retain its value longer. The hypothesis, based on the last 25 years of work in the field of\r\nScience Studies, is that formal data descriptions must be wrapped in informal descriptions in order to\r\nbe useful. The informal description for short-lived data is provided by face-to-face contact, by\r\nexchanging graduate students, through conference papers and so forth. It is precisely this layer which is\r\nlost in highly distributed data collection efforts characteristic of biodiversity and ecosystem informatics; it\r\nis also this layer which is lost when data is wrapped in formal metadata and saved to disk. The goal of\r\nthis project is to open up a major new field of database inquiry tied precisely to the specific problems of\r\nthe biodiversity and ecosystems communities generated by their need for very long lasting and highly\r\ndistributed data. The project will develop into a larger study of the articulation between metadata and\r\nnarrative modes of wrapping data.\r\n",
