Specifically I propose to make n type field effect transistors (FET),\r\nnanotube p-n junctions, and an integrated single-molecule CMOS inverter. This research\r\nis exploratory in nature; however, if successful, will advance our understanding of the\r\nfundamental properties of nanotubes and produce practical nanoscale devices for the real\r\nworld.\r\nThere has been a great deal of research into carbon nanotubes in the past few years. P\r\ntype field effect transistors have been demonstrated consisting of semiconductive\r\nnanotubes with a silicon substrate backgate separated from the tube by a layer of SiO2.\r\nDespite the utmost interest in developing n type FETs to enable nanoscale CMOS\r\ncircuits, the research effort has been hampered by lack of an effective doping method for\r\nnanotubes. I propose to demonstrate a simple, effective and reliable method to\r\nelectrostatically dope nanotubes into n type, thus paving the way for n type FETs, p-n\r\njunctions and integrated systems. This new method will employ TiO2 instead of SiO2 as\r\nthe gate dielectric. With a dielectric constant of 30 for TiO2, as compared to 3.8 for SiO2,\r\nthe gate utilizing TiO2 will be seven times more effective than previously reported, and\r\nour preliminary analysis confirms that with a reasonable gate bias (~ 10 V), a nanotube\r\ncan be electrostatically doped into n type, thereby producing an n type FETs.\r\nFurthermore, carbon nanotube p-n junctions will be demonstrated with a split-gate\r\ntechnique, by depositing TiO2 onto a semiconductive nanotube contacted with source and\r\ndrain electrodes, and patterning two gate electrodes atop the TiO2, each covering half of\r\nthe tube. By controlling these two gate biases independently, one can tune the left half\r\ntube into p type and the right half into n type, thus creating a p-n junction in between,\r\nwhich provides an ideal system for studying the depletion and screening in one\r\ndimension.\r\nFinally, a simple integrated system will be demonstrated by attaching an electrode to the\r\ncenter of a semiconductive nanotube in addition to the source and drain electrodes. This\r\ncenter electrode divides the nanotube into two segments and serves as the output of the\r\ncircuit. The silicon substrate backgate with TiO2 dielectric layer will serve as the circuit\r\ninput and be used to tune one tube segment to function as an n type FET and the other\r\nsegment as a p type FET, thereby forming the worlds first single molecule inverter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
