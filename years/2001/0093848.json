 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arsenic is a toxic and carcinogenic metalloid that presents a major human health threat. The potentially very high cost of meeting the new U. S. Environmental Protection Agency standard necessitates the development of more cost-effective methods for arsenic removal.\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this CAREER proposal is to develop an innovative arsenic removal process using membrane-enhanced sorption with iron-based materials (IBM) as sorbents. The hypothesis is that membrane-induced concentration polarization effects will concentrate arsenic species in the concentration polarization layer and the higher arsenic concentration will result in more sorption onto an iron-based material. The proposed system could result in significant cost savings for arsenic treatment due to less chemical use, prolonged operation between backwashes, and less wastes for handling and disposal.  Experimental and modeling work will be completed in order to select the most suitable membrane and a particulate iron-based material, and a bench-scale pilot system will be optimized for effective arsenic removal and cost analysis.\r\n\r\nThe integrated CAREER educational activities focus on K-12 science teacher training for the State of New Mexico through an integrated teaching-research-curriculum development program. Science teacher training for those from historically underrepresented groups in science and engineering or those who teach students from those groups is critically needed in New Mexico. Since science and engineering are best taught to the K-12 science teachers and their students through hands-on, inquiry-based experiences, laboratory and field projects on arsenic measurement and treatment will be implemented as part of the program. In addition, New Mexico Tech has a high percentage of minority undergraduate and graduate students. While all students would benefit form research participation, the CAREER support will provide historically underrepresented minority students with critically-needed research opportunities in science and engineering.\r\n",
