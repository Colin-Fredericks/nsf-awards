 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) \r\nThis project establishes a model for adapting and implementing ecological research methodologies traditionally restricted for use in the research laboratory to an integrated, field-based ecology curriculum. This new curriculum involves undergraduate students (freshman to seniors) in state-of-the-art research in population, community and ecosystem ecology. The core of this project is a new field-based quantitative laboratory course for General Ecology, a required course in which students conduct research along a 3000m elevational gradient spanning desert to tundra ecosystems as a natural experiment. Additionally, this project enhances other introductory biology courses by adding field exercises along the gradient which introduce students to the experimental system they revisit more comprehensively in General Ecology. The project also adds advanced exercises involving the gradient to existing laboratories of a number of upper division courses in ecology including Entomology, Plant Physiology, Mammology, Microbial Ecology, Ecosystem Ecology, Stable Isotope Techniques, and Field Ecology. Thus, this project substantially revises and provides a unifying theme to the ecology curriculum in that students visit the same sites in different courses and in different years. Students learn how the same systems and gradients can be approached from different perspectives and used to address some of the major ecological, environmental and conservation challenges of our time. Through this project, equipment has been purchased and curriculum has been developed to promote active student involvement in integrated research in ecology. \r\n",
