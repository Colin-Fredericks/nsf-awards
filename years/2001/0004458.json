The principal organizer is Professor Cesar Valladares of Boston College.  The two-day workshop, which immediately follows the International Beacon Satellite Symposium of the International Union of Radio Scientists (URSI), will promote discussion among researchers from the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, China, Taiwan, India, and Africa.  The prime topic for discussion is the ionospheric effects on space-based communication and navigation systems.  Following the plenary presentations, workshop and poster sessions will provide the opportunity to exchange information on worldwide and regional ionospheric problems and on current research activities aimed to assess and understand ionospheric effects on space-based systems.\r\n\r\nScope:  The Global Positioning System (GPS), which originally was developed by the Department of Defense as a military system, has become a global utility.  Conversion of the GPS has resulted in dramatic improvement in its accuracy for civilian users worldwide.  Applications include air, road, marine, and rail navigation, telecommunications, emergency response, oil exploration, mining, and many more.  The workshop will provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge developed in the United States and Europe on utilizing the GPS for space-based navigation and communication systems.  Likewise, colleagues from various equatorial countries will be able to share their knowledge of local ionospheric conditions and current research activities.  The workshop offers a unique opportunity for international colleagues to develop a research agenda for understanding ionospheric effects on space-based systems.  This award is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences\r\n",
