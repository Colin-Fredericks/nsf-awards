 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. David Jenkins and Michael Lemke at the University of\r\nIllinois at Springfield (UIS) to purchase an image analysis suite to be used in aquatic ecology\r\nresearch and st udent (B.S., M.S.) research training. The image analysis suite will also be available\r\nto o ther scientists and students at t he UIS campus. The suite will be composed of three different\r\nresearch-grade Olympus microscopes: a compound light microscope with epifluorescence and\r\nphase-contrast capabilities; a stereo dissecting microscope; and an inverted light microscope. All\r\nthree microscopes can be connected to a computer Image Analysis System with a digital camera,\r\nplus that camera can be used to photograph electrophoresis results. Finally, a Polaroid HR 6000\r\nDigital Palette Color Film Recorder will allow digital images to be converted to film suitable for\r\npublication or presentation at scientific meetings or in the classroom, and a printer will provide\r\nhardcopy capability.\r\nResearch with the image analysis suite will focus on two related disciplines of aquatic ecology:\r\ninvertebrate and microbial ecology. Aquatic invertebrate ecology research at UIS investigates:\r\nthe potential of invertebrates as wetland indicators in central Illinois; mechanisms of organismal\r\nspatial patterns in temporary freshwat er ponds; empirically-based models of metapopulation\r\nnetworks and gene flow; and endosymbionts in microcrustaceans. The microscopes will be used\r\nfrequently for all of that research (e.g., taxonomic identification, fluorescence microscopy to\r\nindicate symbiont presence), and images of electrophoresis gels will facilitate research on\r\npopulation genetics. Aquatic microbial ecology research at UIS heavily relies on microscopic\r\nanalysis (e.g., fluorescent staining for enumeration and biomass) to investigate: bacterial\r\npopulation dynamics in anthropogenically-impacted st reams, t he identification of culturable and\r\nnon-culturable river microbial communities by advanced molecular biology techniques,\r\ndegradation of natural and t oxic subst ances by microbial assemblage (i.e. domains Bacteria and\r\nArchaea), and rain-pulse effects on bacterial and viral abundance. Students will be trained in use\r\nof the suite, and will then conduct research for independent and honor's projects, Masters theses,\r\nand advanced courses (e.g., Aquatic Ecology, Microbial Ecology). Ot her science faculty and\r\nstudents will also share in use of the microscopes.\r\nThe requested instruments will permit an expansion of current research and research training,\r\nand will facilitate the collaboration of UIS faculty with investigators at other institutions. UIS\r\nstudents will have greatly improved training and access to important scientific equipment for\r\naquatic ecology, which will in turn advance UIS r esearch capabilities and st rengthen the curricula\r\nin the UIS Biology and Chemistry departments.",
