As increasing effort is directed toward proteomics and high throughput protein\r\nstructure determination, the data derived from the determination of 3-D protein structures\r\nwill have enormous impact in such areas as protein engineering, recombinant DNA technology and gene therapy. This project proffers a simple design for an inexpensive device, a Microfluidic Protein Crystallization Chip (MPCC), that possesses a high-density array of vessels, each with fluid inlets and vents, and a design for simple on-chip two-way valves. Methods are proposed to rapidly prototype new designs with design modifications made on the order of a day. The MPCC will be able to dose solutions appropriate to run commercial screening matrices. Since the device will be on the order of 1 mm thick,  x-ray data will be collected by simply placing the crystal-containing MPCC device directly into the x-ray beam, thereby abrogating the expensive labor and equipment intensive exercise of isolating several micron sized crystals from 20-100 nL of mother liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project will be in the Structural Genomics market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
