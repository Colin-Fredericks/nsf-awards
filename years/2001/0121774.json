The course involves hands-on training with meteorological instrumentation and analysis of climate variables using real-time and archived data, and web-based models.  The curriculum introduces undergraduate students to practical applications of field instrumentation, measurements and observations while introducing them to the synthesis of heterogeneous instrumentation output with human observations.  The project promotes and emphasizes student - community interactions for understanding the microvariability in climatological observations, and its feedback on regional perceptions.  It focuses on educating students on climate analysis both as a monitoring and outlook problem, and employs a variety of field-tested instrumentation (radiation, micrometeorological and air pollution related) and calibration facilities.   \r\n\r\n.\r\n",
