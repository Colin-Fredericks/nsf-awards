 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alaska Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)\r\nproject will feature infrastructure enhancements in three research focus areas as\r\nwell as strengthen research competitiveness through S&T planning, outreach\r\nand education, technology transfer, targeted hires and faculty development. The\r\nresearch focus areas are: Infrastructure and Systems for Cold Regions, which\r\nwill consider structures that must function at low temperatures and develop new\r\nconstruction and engineering strategies; High Latitude Environments\r\nContaminants Consortium, which will involve engineers, biologists and chemists\r\ndeveloping analytical facilities and expertise to address water, ground and\r\natmospheric contaminants that accumulate at high altitudes; and Integrative\r\nApproaches to Environmental Physiology which will use physiological\r\nadaptations of Alaskan animals to extreme, highly seasonal environments as\r\nplatforms for addressing general physiological questions.\r\nInfrastructure enhancements in these areas build on strengths of the three\r\nparticipating campuses of the University of Alaska (Fairbanks, Anchorage and\r\nJuneau) and are consistent with on-going program development and strategic\r\nplans. Education and human resource programs will support undergraduate,\r\ngraduate and postdoctoral students. Partnerships with colleges and rural high\r\nschools having predominantly native student populations will be expanded.\r\nOutreach to the Alaska business community and state agencies will provide\r\nopportunities for planning and development of the state's science and\r\nengineering capacity. The infrastructure improvements will greatly enhance the\r\nrange and depth of research projects and improve the state's research\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n",
