 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarship Project provides 55 scholarship awards of $895 per semester to full-time, academically talented, Pell-eligible students who are enrolled in programs leading to the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) or Associate in Science degree in computer information systems, electronics computer technology, electronics manufacturing technology, networking technology, computer science, engineering, or mathematics. The CSEMS project is being implemented at the partner colleges of Glendale Community College (GCC) and South Mountain Community College (SMCC), two schools who have led systemic reform initiatives in mathematics and science curriculum through the ACE (Achieving a College Education) Program. First implemented in the 1980's, these ACE 2+2+2 programs target low income, first generation, and minority students beginning in their sophomore year of high school and have been nationally- recognized for success in retaining \"at risk\", predominately Hispanic, students in the pipeline which leads to associate and baccalaureate degrees. The CSEMS project adapts from the ACE program these primary student support strategies: 1) Individual Education Plans (IEP); 2) academic support services (i.e., tutoring, study strategies); 3) faculty/industry representative mentors for students; 4) ongoing monitoring/tracking with early intervention services as required; 5) monthly special events/activities that provide student interaction with faculty/industry representatives and applicant ion-oriented experiences (i.e., field trip s to high tech workplaces);and 6) job placement services as appropriate. Project evaluation includes ongoing monitoring of performance outcomes, annual student/mentor surveys, and post-graduate placement of students in either jobs or continuing higher education programs. \r\n",
