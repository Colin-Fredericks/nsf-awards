Kuhn\r\n\r\nProfessor Kuhn has a long record of developing \r\nmethods to solve interesting problems in homotopy \r\ntheory, K-theory, and representation theory.  \r\nThe goal of the largest part of this project is \r\nto connect new 'polynomial' resolutions of classic \r\nfunction spaces to other things: model categories of \r\nstructured spectra, equivariant stable homotopy, \r\nclassial loop space theory, and periodic homotopy.  \r\nThese connections will be used to calculate previously \r\ninaccessible cohomological invariants of both such \r\nfunction spaces and infinite loop spaces.  A second \r\npart of the work is a continuation of the study of the \r\ngeneric representation theory of finite fields.  \r\nIn particular, from his homotopical/K-theoretic point \r\nof view, he is studying his newly discovered lattices \r\nof generalized Schur algebras, with an eye towards \r\ngaining insight about the modular representations of \r\nthe finite permutation groups, and the finite general \r\nlinear matrix groups.\r\n\r\nHomotopy theory, K-theory, and representation theory \r\nare mathematical subjects in which one is trying to \r\ndiscover, and ultimately classify, fundamental building \r\nblocks of various sorts of mathematical structure. \r\n(This is quite analogous to a chemist studying simple \r\nmolecular configurations, and how these can be assembled \r\nin more complex ways.)  Homotopy is concerned with \r\ndeformations of geometric objects such as higher \r\ndimensional surfaces. A sample hard problem is to \r\nunderstand the `shape' of all continuous functions \r\nfrom a sphere (surface of a ball) to itself.  \r\nRepresentation theory is concerned with the algebraic \r\nsymmetries of more rigid and discrete objects such \r\nas configurations of lines and planes. A sample hard \r\nproblem is to understand all the basic ways in which \r\nthe set of n by n matrices of 0's and 1's can act on \r\nstrings of 0's and 1's.  Finally K-theory is a \r\nsophisticated hybrid of the two.  Professor Kuhn is \r\nstudying new connections relating these subjects, by \r\ndeveloping and using a variety of state-of-the-art \r\nalgebraic and homotopy theoretic tools.\r\n",
