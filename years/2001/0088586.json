Acquisition of 16 computers, each interfaced to a set of Vernier data acquisition probes, will up-grade the General Chemistry laboratories with modern instrumentation which will enable all General Chemistry students to focus on the discovery of critical concepts and the interpretation of data rather than on mathematical algorithms and data collection.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are:\r\n1. to increase student interest in chemistry;\r\n2. to expose students to modern equipment and techniques at the General Chemistry level; and\r\n3. to improve student understanding of concepts and develop critical thinking skills. \r\n\r\nFour courses are currently taught at the General Chemistry level:\r\n Chemistry 1040 -Environmental Chemistry, for non-science majors;\r\n Chemistry 1140 - Introduction to General and Organic Chemistry, for allied health majors; and\r\n Chemistry 1145/1146 - Introduction to General Chemistry, for science majors.\r\n\r\nThis diverse group of students, representing nearly every academic department on campus and totaling more than 1000 students for the last academic year, will benefit from early exposure to instrumentation and the new focus in the laboratory portion of the General Chemistry courses.",
