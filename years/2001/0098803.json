 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the implementation of an Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation Between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America, the National Science Foundation has entered into an implementing arrangement with a European Union \"key action\" that supports materials research. Details about this agreement may be found at http://www.cordis.lu/fp5 and in the NSF Dear Colleague Letter, NSF-0018 (revised), Proposals for Cooperative Activities in Materials Sciences between the National Science Foundation and the European Commission, http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2000/nsf0018/nsf0018.htm. The present project, \"NSF-EC Activity: Current Induced Magnetic Switching in Sub-micron Sized Multilayers\", is a joint undertaking between the PI's group at Michigan State University and Prof. A. Fert's group at ORSAY in France.  The research concerns the current induced magnetic switching in sub-micron sized multilayers. This topic is of great importance both on account of its intrinsic interest on the physics of giant magneto resistance, as well as for its technological relevance.  The principal goal of this grant award is to permit the PIs and/or their students to travel to France to plan and carry out joint experiments.  This scientific interchange serves to enhance the synergistic link between two major groups and the development of a globally oriented workforce, which helps maintain America's leadership position in the science and technology of magnetic materials.   \r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of an Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation Between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America, the National Science Foundation has entered into an implementing arrangement with a European Union \"key action\" that supports materials research.
