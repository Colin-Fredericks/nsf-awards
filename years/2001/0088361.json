 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nIn this project, a novel Remote Wiring and Measurement Laboratory (RwmLab) allows students to wire up physical electrical and electronics circuits and perform real measurements through internet access. In this way, students gain hands-on experience in a real-world laboratory environment. This work builds from several recent remote-access laboratory projects in Chemistry that received NSF support.\r\n\r\nThe RwmLab acts as a local multi- circuit board on a common distributed panel. A 16- bit data acquisition, data processing and analysis, and graphical unit interface enabled device characterizes the RwmLab. The multi circuit board contains various electronic components such as Power Supplies (AC & DC), Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Transformers, Diodes (including Zener), Transistors (including BJT, MOSFET, & JFET), and Op- amps. The 16- bit enabled device allows the connectivity and control of these embedded electronics devices. A data acquisition interface allows measurements to be made at important nodes. The data collected at the nodes are then processed at the host computer.\r\n \r\nThe laboratory is set up in such a way that the student can see what he/ she is wiring on the host PC. All activities are PC- based and therefore the student has total control over the process of performing his/her experiment without relying on any structured steps already pre-designed.",
