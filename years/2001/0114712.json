 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase III Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) LSAMP\r\nproposes to (1) institutionalize its highly successful LSAMP Phase II activities,\r\n(2) double once again the degree rate from our current baseline to achieve 2,260 \r\nunderrepresented minority science, mathematics, engineering, andtechnology (SMET)\r\nBS degrees in the year 2006, and (3) expand and link LSAMP graduates and Phase III\r\nLSAMP participating underrepresented minority SMET undergraduate students to our \r\nMGE@MSA AGEP and other AGEPs with high technology products that will help our \r\nstudents and graduates both in our service region and nationally. The Phase III WAESO\r\nLSAMP is the undergraduate component of a comprehensive, concerted, sequenced \r\neffort that helps students beginning in secondary school throughundergraduate, graduate\r\nschool, and beyond, including the transition of college sophomores, juniors, and seniors \r\ntoward graduate school and the development of high technology products with \r\napplication or dissemination both regionally and nationally. Although, our LSAMP \r\nNSF funds will focus solely on undergraduate students, we will use non-NSF funds \r\nto support thousands of pre-college students and use both NSF AGEP and non-NSF \r\nfunds to help hundreds of graduate students and graduates of Ph.D. or Master level \r\nprograms beginning in the 7th grade and going through the doctorate and even beyond \r\nto faculty status or careers in the corporate or government sectors.\r\n\r\nSome of the unique and highly effective features of our Phase II LSAMP that will \r\nbe institutionalized in Phase III WAESO lie within the sequence and integration of \r\nthe various levels of the project. For example, (1) Integrating pre-college and\r\ngraduate study with our core undergraduate project in a coherent and\r\neffective way; (2) Giving scientists, specifically faculty members who are \r\ncurrently working with students in classrooms and laboratories and who review and \r\nrank projects which in turn also come from the field and need to compete for funds, \r\nprimary control over project activities and the allocation of funds, including\r\nthe flexibility to make mid-course corrections in the funding of deserving\r\n(or undeserving) projects, through their participation in the operational committees;\r\n(3) Using high-technology to produce and distribute underrepresented minority-focused\r\nSMET materials as well as to coordinate project components over great distances \r\nthrough the use of DVDs, CD-ROMs, the Internet, and the World Wide Web; and (4)\r\nDeveloping and maintain special programmatic initiatives directed toward each of\r\nour participating student populations, including American Indians. Thanks to strong\r\nlong-term institutional support, we have the ability to not only meet the basic \r\nLSAMP cost-sharing requirements but, even more importantly, to meet the\r\ninstitutionalization costs of the new, third phase of the LSAMP program.\r\n\r\nBased on the successes of Phase I in doubling the number of graduates per year of our\r\ntarget population and being above a similar doubling goal in Phase II, we propose to take \r\non the formidable task of achieving B.S. degree rates reflective of the substantial \r\nunderrepresented minority population of our region which is 25.8% American Indian,\r\nAfrican American, and Hispanic. Thus, our long-term numerical goal in the year\r\n2011 of 2,858 SMET B.S. degrees awarded to American Indian, African American, and\r\nHispanics as accomplishing parity with our regional population of these Americans.\r\nFor the purposes of Phase III, we are establishing a goal of doubling the degree rate \r\nonce again from our current baseline to achieve 2,260 degrees in the year 2006,\r\nwhich is well on the way to achieving parity.\r\n",
