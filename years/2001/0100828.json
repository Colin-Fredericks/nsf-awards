 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nSingle molecule studies can provide unique information on the structure and dynamics of\r\nbiological molecules and cellular complexes that is impossible to obtain using traditional\r\nstructural techniques. These studies, to be performed at conditions close to physiological\r\nenvironments, open the way for looking directly at the function of individual biological\r\nmolecules and their complexes. Scanning probe microscopy and atomic force microscope\r\n(AFM) in particular has proven to be a very useful technique permitting static and dynamic\r\nstudies of molecules at nanometer range resolution. However, the requirement for the sample to\r\nbe bound to the surface restricts considerably the dynamical studies. A breakthrough has\r\nrecently been made in the real-time observation of dynamics of molecular complexes at the\r\nsingle-molecule level using single-photon sensitive fluorescence microscopes. However, the\r\nresolution of this technique is limited by the wavelength of the light and does not reveal\r\nstructural details of molecules. The combination of AFM and a single molecule fluorescence\r\n(SMF) microscope into one instrument would enable us to identify structural details of\r\nbiological systems at the molecular level by AFM and to use the SMF microscope to observe\r\ndirectly the dynamics of an experimental system at a the single molecule level. Importantly, the\r\ndynamics can be performed on molecular systems structurally characterized by AFM and\r\nlocalized on a comparatively large surface area. Therefore, the major objective of this proposal\r\nis to build AFM/SMF system based on the currently available Bioscope AFM/fluorescence\r\nmicroscope instrument. The sensitivity of the fluorescent system will be tested using specially\r\ndesigned samples. In addition, potential pitfalls of integrated AFM will be identified and\r\nanalyzed for solutions.",
