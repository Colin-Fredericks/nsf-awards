The K-theory of such  \r\noperator algebras are receptacles of higher indices of elliptic  \r\ndifferential operators and have  important applications to problems \r\nin differential geometry and topology of manifolds such as \r\nthe existence problem for Riemannian metrics with positive\r\nscalar curvature, the Novikov conjecture on homotopy invariance of\r\nhigher signatures. The methods to be employed include \r\ncontrolled operator K-theory, infinite dimensional almost flat bundles, \r\nand geometric group theory. \r\n\r\nManifolds are spaces glued together by Euclidean spaces. Examples \r\nof manifolds include spheres and tori. In differential geometry  \r\none studies how  manifolds are  curved. For example a flat piece of \r\npaper has zero curvature while the sphere has positive curvature. \r\nThis is why we can not bend a piece of paper into a sphere.  A basic\r\nproblem in differential geometry is to determine when a manifold \r\ncan have positive scalar curvature. Another  important problem in \r\nmathematics is the classification of  manifolds. By surgery theory \r\nthe classification problem for higher dimensional manifolds  \r\ncan be essentially  reduced to  the Novikov conjecture. The K-theoretic \r\nhigher indices of certain elliptic differential operators can be used\r\nto attack the positive scalar curvature problem and the Novikov \r\nconjecture. A key step in this analytic approach is the computation \r\nof the K-theoretic higher indices, which can be essentially\r\nreduced to the problem of computing the K-theory of operator algebras \r\nassociated to metric spaces and groups.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
