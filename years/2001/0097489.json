 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fort Valley State University, an 1890 Land-Grant institution serving a 90-95% African-American student population, proposes to initiate a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in biotechnology.  The program will focus primarily on encouraging and facilitating research careers and, secondarily, assisting students with interests in other science-based careers to appreciate the nature of research.  Ten students (women/minorities) selected from small colleges will work on research projects with pre-selected mentors in cell biology, genetic engineering, tissue culture, molecular genetics, environmental sciences, entomology and biochemistry.  The students will also participate in seminars, attend workshops, and engage in experiential learning through field trips to major research sites.   During the 10-week program, they will complete research projects, give oral presentations and submit written abstracts of their work.  To promote continued interest in research, two students will be nominated for additional research funds to extend their experiences into the following school year, and will be eligible for travel funds to present their research at scientific meetings.  Program effectiveness will be assessed from student exit surveys and a long-term tracking system.  At the formative level, the  project will be evaluated by an advisory committee consisting of prominent scientists from private industry and research institutions.  Establishing this program will have a significant impact on students' decisions to pursue careers in biotechnology or biological sciences, and will enhance the university's opportunities to support student-centered research.  Toward that end, the university has committed partial support and resources to ensure successful execution of the REU program.",
