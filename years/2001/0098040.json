The demand for high-performance optimization algorithms and software is increasing rapidly as the power of the current technology to solve difficult real-world problems is becoming more widely recognized.\r\nMuch of the success of modern optimization techiques stems from the recent development of so-called interior-point methods.  These methods were first developed for linear optimization problems but are now actively being extended to nonlinear optimization problems.\r\n\r\nThis research involves the development of new interior-point algorithms and software for large-scale nonlinear constrained optimization.  Specific goals include: (1) fundamental enhancements to the current state-of-the-art, such as the replacement of the merit-function for step-length control with a\r\nfilter-based method and the development of better techniques to detect unbounded and infeasible problems; (2) extension of the basic algorithm to new problem classes, such as second-order cone programming and semidefinite programming, that don't quite fit the basic paradigm of nonlinear constrained optimization; (3) further extension beyond the realm of optimization to nonlinear complementarity problems, which arise in many engineering problems; and finally (4) development of a large repository of optimization models, which serves both to illustrate the power of modern optimization technology and also to provide a test bed for future algorithm development.\r\n\r\n",
