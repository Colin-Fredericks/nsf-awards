Fieldwork includes sampling vegetation in a variety of permanent plots and transects along a tidal gradient as well as in natural light gaps.  Soil physicochemical characteristics and the light environment will be monitored to evaluate if changes in vegetation are associated with changes in abiotic characteristics.   This study includes a number of field experiments that test hypotheses that have been proposed to explain mangrove zonation, including the Physiological Specialization, Included Niche Competition, Tidal Sorting and Dominance-Predation hypotheses.  In addition, an herbivore exclusion experiment will assess the impact of insect folivores and stem-borers on the growth, survival, and distribution of species along the tidal gradient, as well as the mediating effect of herbivory on interspecific competition.  In general, these studies will advance our understanding of the interactions of disturbance with competition and herbivory in structuring natural ecosystems, and thereby contribute to our ability to predict the ecological consequences of various human-caused alterations of these endangered wetlands.\r\n",
