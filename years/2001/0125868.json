 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will provide a three-year, in depth, longitudinal analysis of students' development as mathematical learners in reform-oriented mathematics classrooms during the middle school years.  For the purposes of this study, reform is defined as a teacher's use of instructional practices and curricular materials that aligned with the NCTM's Curriculum and Teaching Standards and the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics.   \r\n\r\nThe overall purpose of this research is to examine the ways in which mathematics reform affects students' development as mathematics knowers and learners.  The study will document changes in students' learning and self-conceptions, as well as the processes by which this change occurs.\r\n\r\nThe primary research questions guiding the work are:\r\n\r\n1. What are the direct and indirect effects of teacher practice, classroom and student level processes on students' conceptual understanding, achievement and identify development in mathematics?\r\n\r\n2. How are the effects of teacher practice, and classroom and student level processes on students' conceptual understanding and identify development moderated by gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status?\r\n\r\n",
