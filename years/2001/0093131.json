 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information theory is the science of quantifying, encoding, and\r\nextracting information.  The research proposed in this career\r\ndevelopment plan consists of work designed to strengthen the\r\ntheoretical foundations and empirical applicability of computational\r\nlearning through the development of a rigorous, information-theoretic\r\nframework for investigating this discipline.  Specifically, an\r\ninformation-theoretic framework, based on communication theory, is\r\nproposed for investigating the probably approximately correct (PAC)\r\nmodel of machine learning.  This framework is shown to be robust and\r\nextensible; new learning algorithms, general measures of performance,\r\nand analysis techniques are all proposed and demonstrated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing a means for strengthening the theoretical\r\nfoundations of computational learning, this framework also provides a\r\nmechanism for developing and rigorously analyzing new learning\r\nalgorithms.  New algorithms for hypothesis boosting, document\r\nclassification, document filtering, and meta-search are all proposed.\r\nThe proposed applications work has both theoretical and experimental\r\ncomponents: all new algorithms are to be analyzed, implemented and\r\ntested using benchmark data.\r\n\r\nTeaching and education are an integral part of this career development\r\nplan.  Both graduate and undergraduate students are introduced to\r\ntopical research, both theoretical and applied, through the projects\r\nproposed. New courses on learning and information retrieval,\r\naccessible to both graduate and undergraduate students, are also\r\nproposed.",
