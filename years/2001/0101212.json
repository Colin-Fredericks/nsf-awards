 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nLanzani\r\n\r\nThis project concerns several questions about integral  representations for holomorphic functions of one and several complex  variables, related (singular) integral boundary operators, and elliptic  boundary value problems. The main underlying theme consists of estimates of  Cauchy singular integral operators with focus on the case of domains with rough boundaries. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe crux of this project is the basic observation that it is often possible   to determine the values a certain function, say, f, takes inside, say, a ball, by only  measuring the values f takes on the surface of the ball, via the  computation of a (surface) integral involving the datum f and an auxiliary\r\nfunction K ( the \"kernel\").  It may help to think of the value f at a point\r\nP as the temperature at this point: by (easily) measuring temperature on the  \r\nsurface of a ball (think of the ball as been made of a solid material, such as \r\nmetal), one can then find out the value of the temperature  inside the ball without having to reach the inside, simply by plotting  the surface temperature data in an integral formula, and then computing the  integral. Because of the microscopic nature of matter, it is much more natural  to make these measurements and calculations on a \"rough\" body, say a cube  (which has corners and edges), than a \"smooth\" ball. In the mathematical  model, this new situation translates into additional constraints on the  kernel K which make it much harder to effectively use K in the computation  of the integrals.  In this project we study certain (\"complex\")analogues of these mathematical models in the context of \"rough\" domains.       \r\n",
