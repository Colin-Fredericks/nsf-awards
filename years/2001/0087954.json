 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) \r\n \r\nThe objective of the proposal is to enhance the learning process for students in Calculus I and II by adapting and implementing the WeBWork program developed at the University of Rochester. The implementation will take two tracks. First, students are assigned daily 'prep' problems to complete before coming to class. Hence, the students are better prepared to discuss the day's mathematical topic. Second, remedial problem sets are set up for those students who need more practice on certain topics, such as algebra and trigonometry. In both cases, students get immediate feedback after finishing the web assignments and the instructor of the course is sent a report on students web work. \r\n\r\nOutcomes for this project include increased student performance and better faculty assessment of student performance. Instructors are able to access and review student performance on web assignments and use this information to plan focus areas for each day's class. An additional outcome is to have students effectively using information technology immediately upon enrolling in their first college math course. Finally, the faculty learns how to integrate information technology into their teaching. \r\n\r\n",
