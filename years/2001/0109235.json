 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001. The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Genetically defining the non-dividing state of the cell.\"  It has been debated, for cells that have stopped growing, whether they have simply paused in their growth cycle or whether they have entered a physiologically different state, referred to as G0.  To distinguish between cycle arrested and G0 cells, this research is using microarray analysis on growth arrested cells of the year, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. \r\n",
