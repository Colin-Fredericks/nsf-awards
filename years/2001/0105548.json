Yet these problem\r\nabstractions capture models from a variety of application areas such as\r\ncommunication network routing, multicasting messages in large\r\nnetworks, VLSI layout, and transportation networks with economies of scale.\r\nThe research in this proposal aims to advance our fundamental knowledge of\r\nthe structure of good solutions to such inherently intractable computational\r\nproblems involving networks.  The investigators will develop approximation\r\nalgorithms for these problems -- these are heuristic methods that trade off\r\nsome accuracy in the solution in return for lowered computational resources,\r\nin a quantifiable way. The research will involve the application of and new\r\ndiscovery of results in the theory of graphs to guide the design of these\r\nheuristic solutions.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the investigators will design polynomial-time approximation\r\nalgorithms with improved performance ratios for many basic graph-theoretic\r\nproblems including the problem of augmenting a tree to make it\r\ntwo-connected, buy-at-bulk network design problems and the minimum $k$-cut\r\nproblem. The investigators will continue their ongoing study of bicriteria\r\nnetwork design problems (problems that involve two objective functions to be\r\noptimized simultaneously) to design improved bicriteria approximation\r\nalgorithms for many spanning tree problems arising in practice; These\r\nproblems involve a combination of commonly studied objectives such as the\r\nmaximum node degree, diameter and total cost of the tree. The research\r\neffort will focus on the theme of studying natural mathematical programming\r\nformulations for these NP-hard problems and attempt to derive improved\r\napproximation guarantees via rounding algorithms that will also establish\r\nthe integrality gap of these basic formulations.\r\n\r\n",
