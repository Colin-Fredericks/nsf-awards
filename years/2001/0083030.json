 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, using combinatorial search methods to discover and fabricate new phosphors for flat panel displays, aims at developing new methodologies to\r\nDiscover new phosphor materials and \r\nActually identify new materials that have attractive properties for flat displays.\r\nThe general approach consists of using electrodeposition as a means of preparing new inorganic phosphor materials (e.g. oxides, silicates, aluminates, phosphates, etc.) that vary in composition over wide range of values. Because of the multicomponent nature of these phosphates (typically containing three or four different metals), the number of compositions that must be examined to effectively map compositional space for a given class of materials may be many thousands. The effort comprises activities in several distinct areas:\r\nSynthesis of new metal-containing precursors that can be used in electrodeposition,\r\nDevelopment of electrodeposition methods that can be used as the substrate for electrodeposition,\r\nDevelopment of a microelectrode array that can be used with the new precursor metal complexes, as the substrate electrodepositions,\r\nActual phosphor deposition using the methods and precursors just described,\r\nParallel testing of the emission characteristics of the arrays of phosphors, and\r\nBulk synthesis and characterization of the most promising materials.\r\nThe expected outcomes of the effort include:\r\nDevelopment of new approaches for rapidly discovering phosphors,\r\nIdentification of new materials that have attractive properties for flat panel displays, and\r\nDevelopment of a long-term materials discovery and characterization effort at University of Wyoming (UW), that will dovetail with the institution and state's efforts at fostering the establishment and maintenance of a viable science and high technology based in the State.\r\nThe effort involves 3 researchers at UW and one at Blue Sky Applied Technologies, Inc. (BSAT).\r\n\r\n",
