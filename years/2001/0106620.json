 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooper \r\n0106620 \r\n\r\nThe experimental measurement of the low-frequency attenuation behavior of polycrystalline olivine, of olivine-orthopyroxene and of olivine-based partial melts is the practical emphasis of this research.   Of theoretical focus is a new hypothesis concerning the physical mechanism(s) and significance of the \"high-temperature background\" mechanical absorption, specifically, that this absorption relates to the diffusion-effected relaxations of grain and solid-state phase boundaries and particularly of (deformation-induced) subgrain boundaries.  The physical implication, then, is that a small-amplitude, oscillatory variation in stress, one that is added to a nominally constant differential stress that is effecting dislocation creep in a material, is \"sampling\" the deformation-induced microstructure, specifically the network of subgrains.  If this hypothesis is correct--and discerning this correctness is the long-range goal of the experimental work--one can envision an effective way to do attenuation-based \"geophysical prospecting\" of active tectonic regions, e.g., for levels of differential stress and, perhaps, strain, with a calibration based on laboratory experiments.  Experiments in this (one-year) funding period will emphasize dynamic (\"sub-resonant\" oscillatory loading) and quasi-static (constant loading, i.e., creep), high-resolution torsional mechanical responses of carefully engineered aggregates of (ferromagnesian) olivine and of two-phase solid olivine-orthopyroxene. These will be studied as functions of (i) temperature (1150-1350 degC), (ii) frequency (10^[-4]-1 Hz) and (iii) grain size (5-20 micrometers; fine enough that [a] thermal-expansion-anisotropy effected grain/phase boundary cracking cannot occur and [b] [for the levels of differential stress employed] lattice dislocations are not nucleated in the course of mechanical testing).  In addition, benchmarking deformation experiments, comparing the high-resolution ambient-pressure measurements with the mechanical response of the same material under a confining pressure of  ~300 MPa will be performed.   \r\n",
