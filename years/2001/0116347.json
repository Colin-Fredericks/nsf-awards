 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Sudman at Tarleton State University to\r\npurchase an automated DNA analysis system. This instrument package will be\r\nused to enhance the teaching and research activities within the Department\r\nof Biological Sciences, specifically those related to molecular biology and\r\ngenetics.  The use of this DNA analysis system, combined with the\r\nintroduction of DNA and protein analysis components into the laboratory\r\nportions of many of their classes, will greatly enhance the educational\r\nexperiences of all of the students associated with the Biology Department.\r\nThis modern, technological approach to biology will give Tarleton students\r\nadvantages on three different levels. Exposure to modern research techniques\r\nand instrumentation will 1) better prepare the students to enter post-baccalaureate educational settings - either traditional academic settings or medical related fields; 2) prepare future K-12 teachers with a basis for explaining and perhaps demonstrating the uses of modern molecular\r\ntechniques; and 3) prepare students for entrance into the rapidly changing,\r\nhigh-tech workplace.\r\n\r\nFrom an educational standpoint, individuals that will benefit from the\r\nacquisition of a DNA analysis system will include undergraduate students,\r\nMasters level graduate students, area high school teachers, and researchers\r\nboth at Tarleton State University and the Stephenville branch of the Texas\r\nA&M Agricultural Research and Extension Center.  Undergraduate students\r\nenrolled in courses in the Department of Biological Sciences such as\r\nHeredity, Molecular Biology, and Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry will\r\nutilize the automated DNA analysis system in a variety of laboratory\r\nsituations.  Students in the graduate course Laboratory Practicum in\r\nMolecular Biology will also benefit from the apparatus.  From a research\r\nstandpoint, undergraduate and graduate students involved with several\r\nongoing projects will directly utilize the automated DNA analysis system.\r\nThese research projects include generating data for investigating the past\r\nhistory  of various mammal species, DNA variation in an endangered bird\r\n(Attwater's prairie chickens), determination of the origin of introduced\r\ncrabs in freshwater Texas lakes, introducing foreign genes into\r\nbaculoviruses to enhance insect resistance in plants, examining the origin\r\nof specific \"hybrid\" plant species (such as peanuts), searching for genes\r\nrelated to drought tolerance in plants, and investigations into the genetic\r\ndiversity of immune response genes in various species of mammals.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this DNA analysis system will have a tremendous impact on\r\nthe academic and research community associated with the Department of\r\nBiological Sciences at Tarleton State University.  From students seeking\r\nteacher certification to those conducting Masters level research, an onsite\r\ninstrument for determining DNA sequences or other genetic differences\r\nbetween or within organisms will provide a vital boost to the biological\r\nteaching and research fields. The automated DNA analysis system will allow\r\nmore than 100 students per year the opportunity to obtain essential training\r\nwith a state-of-the-art biochemical analysis instrument.  Finally, the\r\nsystem will provide local access for the research community at the\r\nStephenville branch of the Texas A&M Agricultural Research and Extension\r\nCenter, fostering additional collaborative research activities between the\r\ntwo institutions.\r\n\r\n",
