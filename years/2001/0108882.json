 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of the conference is to encourage intellectual discourse on emerging statistical topics\r\nthat honor Wayne Fuller's forty plus years of contributions to statistics and fields of application. To do\r\nso, we have several goals for the conference:\r\n1. To advance statistical knowledge in the areas of time series analysis, measurement error models,\r\nand survey sampling. To achieve this goal, we have invited a distinguished slate of statisticians who\r\nwill present their work in three sessions.\r\n2. To highlight the importance of applications and the impact that statistical developments have in other\r\nfields of inquiry. For this purpose, we have invited a set of researchers who will discuss the\r\ninfluence of Fuller's work in various areas, including dietary assessment, small area estimation, econometrics and economics.\r\n3. To provide a friendly and open environment in which young statisticians can present their work and\r\ninteract with senior statisticians. We plan to achieve this goal by inviting researchers in the early\r\nstages of their careers to present a talk in one of the invited sessions or in the special poster area\r\nthat will be dedicated to young investigators.\r\n4. To gather statisticians from all over the world for a two-day celebration of statistics in general and of\r\nFuller in particular. A lively exchange of ideas and knowledge, a definition of future directions for\r\nresearch in these important areas, and a fostering of communication and collaboration among\r\nresearchers at different stages of their careers and from different geographic locations are lasting\r\nresults from the conference that we hope to produce.",
