 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program Towson University will be able to acquire equipment for a pulsed laser deposition system. The pulsed laser deposition system will be primarily used to fabricate thin films of several technologically useful and novel multi-component perovskite metal oxides and related materials. These materials include superconductors, colossal magnetoresistive manganites and other magnetic oxides, as well as other perovskite oxides suitable for sensor applications.  The thin film research program will address materials physics issues that are pertinent to sensor applications as well as those of fundamental interest.  The initial stage of the program will focus on the development colossal magnetoresistive manganite thin films for uncooled infrared imaging and magnetic sensor applications.  The proposed research will provide a strong and versatile synthetic materials base for the development of a Regional Materials Research Laboratory at Towson University. The pulsed laser deposition system, in conjunction with the existing surface characterization facility will play a vital role in this effort. The facility will have positive impact on the education and training of undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups at Towson University.\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program Towson University will be able to acquire equipment for a pulsed laser deposition system. Towson University has initiated the development of a Materials Research Laboratory, which will act as a regional facility for research and education. A Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) system will be the cornerstone of this multidisciplinary facility and will service researchers at Towson University, local colleges and universities, government laboratories, and industry.  The materials research facility will support investigations by the faculty and their students that seek to characterize the physical and chemical properties of both natural and synthetic materials.  Initial PLD projects will focus on thin films of colossal magnetoresistive materials, High Temperature Superconductors, Ferroelectrics and other perovskite oxides of interest for various sensor applications or as metallic electrodes. The analytical methods and techniques developed during these investigations will be shared and integrated into other projects and will serve to foster the collaborative atmosphere that already exists between the geoscience, physics, and astronomy programs. The facility will have positive impact on the education and training of undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups at Towson University.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
