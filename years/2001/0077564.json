 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nThis award provides partial support for the Gordon Conference on Glycobiology\r\nscheduled for March 4-9, 2001 at the Sheraton Harbortown Resort, Ventura, CA. The\r\nprevious conference was held at the same venue on February 21-26, 1999. This was a highly\r\nsuccessful conference and, in keeping with earlier conferences, demand for places\r\noutstripped supply and the 150 delegate places were quickly filled. The Gordon Conference\r\non Glycobiology is the main venue for presentation and discussion of current and future\r\ndirections in the field of glycobiology. By bringing together scientists whose skills span\r\na wide range of disciplines including chemistry, cell biology, genetics, developmental\r\nbiology and bioinformatics, these conferences consistently lead to new insights, new\r\ninteractions, new collaborations, and new research directions.\r\nThe 2001 Glycobiology Gordon Conference will build on the successful\r\ntraditions of previous conferences whilst taking account of the many exciting new avenues\r\nof glycobiological research which are being opened up by the information emanating from\r\nGenome Projects. For example, once the amino acid sequences of the several hundred\r\nthousand proteins that make up a human being are known, scientists will be faced with the\r\nawesome challenge of understanding their functions and learning how post-translational\r\nevents such as glycosylation contribute to human health and disease. Glycobiologists will\r\nplay key roles in the post-genomics era and the 2001 Gordon Conference is well timed to\r\nfacilitate inter-disciplinary collaborations essential to the successful exploitation of\r\ngenomic information of relevance to glycobiology.\r\nThe main themes of the conference will be: (i) structural glycobiology with special\r\nemphasis on technological developments and new information pertaining to\r\nlectin-carbohydrate recognition; (ii) the impact of genomics on glycobiology; (iii)\r\ndiscoveries from knockout mouse experiments; (iii) glyco-immunology; (iv) reproductive and\r\ndevelopmental glycobiology; (v) neuro-glycobiology; (vi) glycoconjugates as therapeutic\r\nagents. Since glycopolymers are important in a wide range of biological and pathological\r\nsystems, this multi-disciplinary approach should appeal to a broad spectrum of\r\ninvestigators.\r\n",
