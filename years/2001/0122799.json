 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of the PI (Miller) focuses on the analytic theory of\r\nautomorphic forms.  The proposed research concentrates on two analytic\r\ntools in the subject.  The first is the trace formula.  The PI hopes to\r\nsharpen Arthur's trace formula for GL(n) so that it can be applied to\r\nanalytic questions in the same fashion that Selberg's original trace\r\nformula for GL(2) has been.  One of the expected applications is to\r\ncounting various types of automorphic forms, for example a general Weyl\r\nlaw for arithmetic quotients of reductive Lie groups.  The second tool is\r\nthat of automorphic L-functions.  The PI and his coworker Wilfried Schmid\r\n(Harvard University) are engaged in a research program to study\r\nautomorphic forms using the boundary distributions of eigenfunctions on\r\nsymmetric spaces.  These boundary techniques allow new constructions of\r\nL-functions, and offer a new way to investigate many problems in\r\nautomorphic forms.  The proposed research involves developing this\r\ntechnique and its applications.\r\n\r\nThe study of automorphic forms slices across many important areas of\r\nmodern mathematical research, including number theory, representation\r\ntheory, geometry, analysis, and mathematical physics.  Through\r\nL-functions, Langlands has conjectured many deep and interesting\r\nstructural relationships between automorphic forms which have implications\r\nin the above areas.  As an example, the work of Wiles et al demonstrates\r\nthe link between certain automorphic forms and the ancient problem of\r\nsolving equations between squares and cubes.  The proposed research aims\r\nto apply and develop new tools for automorphic forms and L-functions from\r\nanalysis, which is the branch of mathematics expanding calculus, and\r\nrepresentation theory, the concrete study of symmetry.  Current\r\napplications of automorphic forms and L-functions are manifest in\r\nconstructing the sophisticated codes which enable high-speed and secure\r\ntransactions over the internet.  \r\n",
