The research is part of a broader program involving experiments, computation and mathematics.  The following projects will be undertaken: development of computer codes aimed at understanding the similarity solutions occurring near singularities; further application of the methods of statistical physics to the development of dynamical theories for the motion of interfaces, particularly the interfaces between two fluids;  the development  of models for chaotic and turbulent behavior, particularly the continuation of studies of turbulence in extended systems while addressing the problems related to the chaotic behavior of dynamical systems models with many degrees of freedom; and, the study of granular materials, with particular reference to their chaotic dynamical behavior.\r\n%%\r\nThis grant is funded jointly by the Materials Theory Program in Division of Materials Research and the Mathematical Physics Program in the Physics Division.  The research is part of a broader program involving experiments, computation and mathematics.  Theoretical research will take place on a variety of topics including singularities, interfaces, turbulence and chaos in fluids, and the chaotic behavior of granular materials.\r\n***\r\n",
