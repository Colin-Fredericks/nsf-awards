 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Mountain Lake\r\nBiological Station (MLBS, University of Virginia) offers ten students a\r\nsummer opportunity to conduct independent, self-motivated,\r\ninterdisciplinary, and original biological research in experimental,\r\nfield-based ecology, evolution, and behavior.  Under the close supervision\r\nand guidance of a research mentor, and the program coordinator, students\r\ndesign, execute, analyze, interpret, and present a self-contained research\r\nproject within the ten weeks of the program.  Many student projects are\r\npublished in leading peer-reviewed journals.  Students participate in weekly\r\nseminars on the design and conduct of research, scientific ethics, writing\r\nand presentation techniques, and other matters of scientific and academic\r\nlife.  Students prepare written and oral proposals and final reports.\r\nParticipants also take advantage of the rich, varied, and stimulating\r\nintellectual and social life at Mountain Lake.  MLBS hosts two formal\r\nresearch seminars per week, which include both in-house and invited\r\nspeakers.  All Station residents eat meals together in the common dining\r\nhall, and most daily activity revolves around the central lab building where\r\nall research programs are housed.  And since field sites are often within\r\nwalking distance, interactions among all Station users occur constantly,\r\nresulting in a remarkably supportive and collaborative environment.\r\nResearchers from large universities and small colleges return to the Station\r\nyear after year - some for 10, 20, even 30 years. Sixty to eighty principal\r\ninvestigators, course faculty, post-docs, graduate and undergraduate\r\nstudents, and high school students are in residence at the Station\r\nthroughout the summer.  MLBS has hosted an NSF REU-Sites program\r\ncontinuously since 1993 and has graduated well over 100 students - over half\r\nhave gone on to pursue graduate training in biology.  The program is very\r\nsuccessful at attracting women and students from small colleges where\r\nresearch may not be a focus.  Minority students and those in\r\nunderrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply.  \r\n",
