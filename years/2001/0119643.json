 "awd_abstract_narration": "0119643\r\nJeffrey A. Walker\r\n\r\nWhen an object, such as a cube, is reduced to smaller and smaller sizes, its surface area to volume ratio increases proportionally. This scaling relationship has large consequences on how animals move through air and water because inertia (mass) and friction are functions of volume and area, respectively. Animals slightly larger or faster than a fruitfly (about 2 mm long) live in a world dominated by inertia. In this world, oscillating wings or fins create swirling vortexes that result from the fluid \"separating\" from the propulsive structure as it flows by. These separations create unusually large forces that wreak havoc for airplanes with rigid wings (they are the source of stall) but recent work has shown that the separations and sometimes the vortices can be exploited by animals with oscillating appendages. Animals that are slightly smaller or slower than a fruitfly live in a world where friction results in a significant component of the net force generated by a propulsive structure. Friction weakens vortices and delays or entirely stops separation. A large friction component, then, must have profound effects on the design of small swimming and flying animals and, indeed, the propulsive appendages of small animals show remarkable convergence among diverse taxa (the phyla Arthropoda, Chordata, and Mollusca), anatomy (antennae, wings, fins, legs, feet), behaviors (swimming and flying) and fluid media (air and water). The objective of the current proposal is to investigate how small, oscillating appendages generate forces in air or water, how the propulsive mechanisms change with scale (size and speed), and how the optimal design of an appendage changes with scale. Appendage shape and motion will be measured in various groups of small animals that span the relevant size range including the sea butterflies (swimming snails with reduced or lost shells), small wasps, and water beetles. Forces on oscillating plates that replicate the conditions found in oscillating appendages of small animals will be measured across a range of sizes. Despite the fact that animals swimming or flying with oscillating appendages at small scales comprise a large portion of described animal species, little is known about how oscillating appendages work at the low end of this range and how the force generating mechanisms scale with size and speed. The proposed research will be the first to systematically study the scaling of appendage shape, motion, and function in this important size range.\r\n",
