Oxide films will be deposited onto single crystal substrates.  With these model systems, surface science techniques can be used to define and characterize surface species more precisely than can be done with conventional catalysts.  The nature of the active catalyst will be probed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to monitor metal oxidation state, electron energy loss spectroscopy to estimate cluster sizes, reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy to follow vibrational changes, and temperature-programmed desorption to measure decarbonylation kinetics.  The two systems to be studied are alumina-supported molybdenum and alumina-supported rhenium catalysts for olefin metathesis. The metathesis reaction has wide industrial applications, and obtaining a better understanding of the catalysis through model studies may help in the development of improved catalysts.  The synthesis of realistic planar model supported catalysts, and the corresponding ability to fully analyze the surface, provides a powerful strategy for fundamentally understanding catalytic reactions on realistic supported systems.\r\n\r\n",
