 "awd_abstract_narration": "The paleopalynological (pollen, spores, and aquatic microfauna) and paleobotanical (leaf, seeds, wood) collections at the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History constitute an important and irreplaceable scientific resource for the study of plant and animal systematics, paleoecology, evolution, and biogeography.  The collection was built through the efforts of one curator, Leonard R. Wilson, and his students between the 1930s and 1970s.  It currently comprises approximately 3800 bulk palynological samples plus ca. 50,000 corresponding prepared microscope slides, and over 8000 macrofossil specimens from Oklahoma, the US mid-continent, and around the world.  In addition, there are over 2000 palynological slides, herbarium sheets, and wood samples of modern taxa from around the world that constitute comparative materials included in the overall collection.  Altough formal expansion and curation has been minimal since the mid- 1970's, the University of Oklahoma has renewed its commitment to the palynological and paleobotanical collections with the addition of staff.  The collections have  been assigned a larger area in a new building.  The current project will involve the acquisition of new cases for the collections and hiring temporary staff to move the collections.  Later activities wil include computerization of the specimen data.  The project\r\nwill significantly enhance the quality, and accessibility of these important collections for research, teaching, and public programs in the Museum.",
