 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH is producing twenty, new, half-hour programs for the fourth season of \"ZOOM.\"  Uniquely for, by and about kids, \"ZOOM\" gives its viewers a chance to explore, experiment and share their creativity with the world.  Targeted at children 8-11 years-old, \"ZOOM\" features a diverse cast of seven children who build bridges, solve puzzles, play games, respond to challenges and act out stories, as they bring to life contributions sent in by viewers from across the country.  \r\n\r\n\"ZOOM\" currently is carried by 281 public broadcasting stations and is viewed by an average of 5.22 million children per week.  The \"ZOOM\" website receives 18,000 - 20,000 visits per day with kids averaging 30 minutes per visit.  The specific goals for Season IV are to:  (1) connect science to kids' every day world and every day lives; (2) promote Habits of Mind and an understanding of the basic science and math within three content areas; (3) expand ZOOM's outreach activities, and (4) increase parental involvement in children's \"ZOOM\"-related activities.  The themes for the new seasons will include \"Your Biome,\" \"Kitchen Chemistry,\" and \"Structures.\"  Outreach for the project will include printed materials for kids, families and educators; \"ZOOM\"-related activities at community-based organizations, shopping malls and science museums; and a 3000-page web site.\r\n\r\n",
