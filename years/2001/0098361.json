 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet and wireless communication explosion increase the demand for privacy, authentication and security in general. Encryption is not only added to PC's and Internet routers. There is a whole new class of embedded applications that requires high levels of security at low power. Examples are smart cards, cell phones, PDA's, sensor networks, etc. The current approach is to build an ASIC library of so-called IP (Intellectual Property) modules, each implementing one algorithm: DES, triple DES, RSA, SHA-1, and so on. Due to the increased demand for security, there is also a proliferation of encryption algorithms. Examples are the new AES standard, the Camellia initiative of the Japanese NTT, Kasumi for 3th generation cellular standards, IPSEC, etc. So this IP approach can no longer be sustained. \r\nTherefore, the focus of this research is the design of new fast, low power encryption platforms that at the same time can easily be reprogrammed and reconfigured. On top of this, cryptographic implementations need to withstand power and timing attacks. To withstand these attacks, the execution time and the power consumption has to be independent of the data or the key. This is in contradiction with low power or high speed implementation techniques. The VLSI design methodology to build these processors covers different levels of abstraction. At the circuit level, new circuit styles are developed that withstand power and timing attacks. At the interconnect level a novel RF on-chip wireless LAN technique is integrated. At the architecture level, reconfigurable data path modules are designed which execute the unusual arithmetic of encryption algorithms.\r\n\r\n",
