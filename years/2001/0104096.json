 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences: Nonlinear Geometric Optics\r\n\r\n0104096\r\nRauch\r\n\r\nThe project concerns the development and analysis of new \r\nasymptotic methods to study short wavelength solutions of \r\nnonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations.  \r\nShort wavelength asymptotics, also known as geometric \r\noptics, is one of the most penetrating and widely \r\napplicable methods for analyzing partial differential \r\nequations.  Traditionally applied to linear problems, the \r\nmethod has recently been employed to furnish rigorous \r\nresults in the nonlinear context.  This project continues \r\nthe development of the method for treatment of nonlinear \r\nproblems. Special emphasis is placed on analysis of \r\nsolutions that model ultrashort laser pulses and on the \r\nbehavior of both wave trains and pulses upon crossing \r\nfocal points.\r\n\r\nThis project develops new mathematical tools to describe \r\nthe propagation of waves whose form is that of short \r\npulses.  The technique, called asymptotic analysis, \r\nstudies such pulses in the limit as the wavelength of the \r\npulse becomes shorter and shorter.  In such limiting \r\nsituations, much can be learned about solutions of the \r\nunderlying equations, which express physical laws such as \r\nNewton's second law for fluids or the laws of \r\nelectromagnetism. This project develops the technique to \r\nanalyze important nonlinear equations that arise in a \r\nvariety of applications.  Special attention is given to \r\ndiffractive effects that occur when rays of geometric \r\noptics stay close together for long times, and to the \r\neffects that occur when pulses focus in a nonlinear \r\nregime.  Promising preliminary results show that standard \r\nnumerical techniques can be improved in both accuracy and \r\nsimplicity.  The results of this project will yield \r\nreliable procedures for numerical simulations of \r\nimportant physical systems, including lasers that produce \r\nultrashort pulses.\r\n",
