 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electrical activity of many organs is shaped by potassium selective ion\r\nchannel proteins. Defects in potassium channels produce several types of\r\nelectrophysiological disturbances including cardiac arrhythmias and\r\nepilepsy.  These channels are the targets of many therapeutic drugs\r\nincluding the Class III anti-arrhythmic compounds.  While many types of\r\npotassium channels have been cloned, many of their most basic properties,\r\nincluding ion discrimination and permeation, remain poorly understood.  This\r\nproject is designed to probe the mechanism of the interaction between\r\ntetraethylammonium ions (related to some Class III drugs) in the pore in\r\nthese channels.  This will be accomplished through a combination of\r\nmolecular biological techniques with electrophysiological recordings and\r\nmeasurements of radio-labeled unidirectional ion fluxes. An additional\r\ncomponent of this work will be the development of new forms of ion\r\npermeation models.  These models will be developed as quantitative\r\ndescriptions of the ion permeation mechanism but, more importantly, will be\r\nused to design new experiments and test competing mechanisms.  A Web site\r\nwill be established in order to facilitate wide distribution of these models\r\nfor teaching and scientific uses.\r\n\r\nThe results from this work will aid the understanding of selectivity and\r\npermeation in ion channel proteins.  Since many therapeutic drugs interact\r\nwith the pore in these channels and with ions in the pore, understanding the\r\nmechanisms of permeation and block may lead to the development of better\r\ndrug therapies.  The modeling tools that will be developed and broadly\r\ndisseminated will help educate students and other scientists about these\r\nfundamental properties of ion channel proteins.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
