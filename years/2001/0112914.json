 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tRecent advances in computer and network technologies and storage, the explosion of publishing, and the vast increase in data availability from sources such as the Internet  and satellites, that have enabled the emergence of an unprecedented number of new computer applications, present a new challenge to the ways data and information are used and managed. This challenge will shape both the research agenda as well as the technology to be developed for the 21st century. The objective of this workshop is to bring together the PIs and Co-PIs currently funded by the Information and Data Management Program (IDM) of the National Science Foundation to:  (1) cooperatively analyze and focus on the research and development issues of  problems that are fundamental in making progress towards this new challenge; (2) share, provide demonstrations and interact with each other on the objectives, contributions and challenges of major research activities funded by the IDM and explore fruitful collaboration and synergism; and  (3) provide an opportunity to NSF program officers, other foundations and funding agencies, and industry representatives to learn more about the current research efforts and successes of projects funded by IDM, and for such officers to share their program highlights and concerns. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will generate a proceedings  on all projects currently funded by IDM in both hard copy and electronic form. The workshop will also generate a report detailing future directions of research and will suggest promising modalities of research with an aim to foster innovation and technology transfer. The proceedings will provide project information searchable by different criteria and provide connections between discoveries and their use to society. The workshop website (http://itlab.uta.edu/idm01) will also include links to other relevant material.\r\n",
