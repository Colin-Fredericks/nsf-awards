 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for DMS - 0103884 (Bryant, Duke)\r\n\r\nRobert Bryant plans to apply the theory of differential systems,\r\nthe method of equivalence, and methods from the calculus of variations\r\nto study a collection of problems in differential geometry and\r\nmathematical physics. In the first problem, motivated by mathematical\r\nphysics, Bryant intends to study the geometry of connections compatible\r\nwith either a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metric that admit\r\nparallel spinor fields and that differ from the Levi-Civita connection\r\nby a closed 3-form. In the second problem, Bryant wants to continue\r\nhis investigations into the nature of singular special Lagrangian subvarieties\r\nand special Lagrangian foliations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the third\r\nproblem, which concerns the study of the space of almost complex structures on\r\n6-manifolds, Bryant proposes to investigate several natural functionals on the space\r\nof such almost complex structures and the geometry of the extrema\r\nof these functionals. Fourth, Bryant plans to continue his study\r\nof the space of homologically volume minimizing cycles in compact Lie groups,\r\nwith the goal of finding a complete classification of the volume minimizing\r\ncycles in each homology class in a compact, simple, simply connected Lie group.\r\nFinally, Bryant plans to continue his investigations into Finsler geometry,\r\nparticularly the problem of classifying the spaces of constant\r\nflag curvature (the natural generalization to Finsler geometry\r\nof constant sectional curvature in the Riemannian case).\r\n\r\n\r\nOptimization is a central problem in mathematics, in which one tries\r\nto select the 'best' configuration in a space of possible configurations\r\nof a model for a physical system.  An example is the problem of navigating\r\non a body of water in which one must take water currents into account\r\nin planning the 'best' path from origin to destination, where 'best' is\r\ntaken to mean 'shortest time of traverse'.  A path that is optimal for\r\na short period (a 'geodesic') might not remain optimal if pursued far enough.\r\nThis is known as instability. (For example, in a river where the current is\r\nfaster in midstream it turns out that downstream geodesics are stable, but\r\nthat upstream geodesics are not.) The geometric quantity that measures this\r\nnotion of stability is known as 'curvature', since it was first identified\r\nin studies of the curvature of the Earth.  Bryant's work studies curvature\r\nand 'over-determined' systems of differential equations, and is relevant\r\nto optimization problems in motion planning, control theory, robotics,\r\nand string theory models in high energy physics.  Some of the specific\r\nproblems he works on are aimed at applications to mathematical physics\r\n(e.g., connections with parallel spinor fields) or control theory (e.g.,\r\nFinsler geometry, which is the subject that studies problems such as\r\nthe navigation problem mentioned above), while others are aimed at more\r\nfoundational questions about the nature of minimizers (e.g., volume\r\nminimizing cycles in Lie groups) or the limits and/or possibilities inherent\r\nin the current methods and techniques for minimization problems\r\n(e.g., special Lagrangian geometry and almost complex 6-manifolds).\r\n\r\n",
