 "awd_abstract_narration": "0110856\r\nJaynes\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to investigate two aspects of transcriptional\r\nregulation in developing Drosophila embryos.  The first is a novel\r\nlong-range activity that occurs at the even-skipped (eve) locus at the\r\nblastoderm stage of development, earlier than similar long-range activities\r\nare thought to be active at other genes.  The second is the mechanism of\r\nrepression by the eve protein product, Eve.\r\n        \r\nLong-range regulation is thought to underlie such phenomena as\r\nepigenetic control of gene expression.  Epigenetic mechanisms are known to\r\nbe important for maintaining the correct spatial domains of expression of\r\nHOX and other genes, mediated by genes of the Polycomb and trithorax\r\ngroups.  This and other epigenetic phenomena, such as position effect\r\nvariegation and repression at the mating type locus in yeast, are mediated\r\nin part by the regulation of chromatin structure.  In contrast to the\r\nwell-studied examples of these phenomena in Drosophila, long-range\r\nregulation at eve occurs at very early stages of development, so that its\r\nanalysis may provide a novel perspective on the mechanisms involved.  This\r\nproposal uses an integrated biochemical and genetic approach to investigate\r\nthese mechanisms, to identify specific DNA sequences that mediate the\r\neffects, to identify and study the functions of proteins that bind to those\r\nsequences, and to identify genes that contribute to long-range regulation\r\nof eve.\r\n\r\nTranscriptional repression is a crucial activity in the function of\r\nmany DNA binding proteins.  Through work on this project, Eve has been\r\nshown to interact functionally with the corepressor Groucho.  Eve has also\r\nbeen shown to contain a Groucho-independent repression activity.  This\r\nproposal will investigate the mechanisms of each of these activities using\r\na genetic approach.  Fusion proteins between Eve repression domains and the Gal4 DNA binding protein repress reporter transgenes both early and late in embryonic development, providing an efficient means of screening for\r\ngenetic modifiers of this repression activity.  This proposal will screen\r\nsimultaneously for modifiers of Groucho-dependent and -independent\r\nrepression activity.  This work should provide novel insights into the\r\nmechanisms of repression.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
