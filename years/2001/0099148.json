 "awd_abstract_narration": "The explosive growth of computer networks, combined with rapid and unpredictable developments in ap-plications and workloads, has rendered network service inference and performance prediction increasingly de-manding and intractable tasks. Nonetheless, end-systems must have knowledge of internal network traffic con-ditions and servicing in order to validate, predict, or enhance performance capabilities required by demanding applications. Network service providers also have a great need for gauging the performance of their own sub-systems without recourse to global strategies. Without special-purpose network support, the only alternative is to indirectly infer dynamic network characteristics using edge-based network traffic processing.\r\n     The INCITE (InterNet Control and Inference Tools at the Edge) Project focuses experts from the fields of\r\nnetworking, digital signal processing, and applied mathematics towards the goal of characterizing network ser-vice based solely on edge-based measurement at hosts and/or edge routers. This project blends recent work in multifractal traffic modeling, quality of service (QoS) measurement, and network tomography to develop a unique and innovative framework for network service inference. The INCITE Project will develop new al-gorithms and implementations using the latest in DSP-driven network processor technology, providing a vital step towards better managing and understanding of Internet performance. Our effort consists of three closely inter-related research thrusts:\r\n1. Multifractal Traffic and Path Modeling: We will develop new, highly accurate tools for analyzing,\r\nmodeling, and measuring the dynamics of network connections and end-to-end paths from the edge. Our\r\napproach to inferring the competing cross-traffic load on a path utilizes an innovative exponentially spaced\r\nprobing sequence that is inspired by the theory of multifractal random processes. These probing packet\r\nchirps balance the trade-off between overwhelming the network with probes and obtaining statistics rich\r\nenough for accurate estimates.\r\n2. Multiclass Service Inference: We will develop a framework for clients to assess a network's core QoS\r\nfunctionalities based on external and passive observations. Using the theory of traffic envelopes, maximum\r\nlikelihood estimation, and hypothesis testing, clients will be able to assess a broad set of the network's\r\nmulti-class control mechanisms such as the service disciplines, link sharing rules and parameters, and\r\npolicing parameters.\r\n3. Unicast Network Tomography: We will develop a novel methodology for network tomography that pro-vides\r\nlink-level performance characterization of networks of arbitrary topologies based on unicast traffic\r\nmeasurements at a the network edge. A new network modeling framework based on factor graphs will\r\nenable the statistical inference of link-level service parameters (e.g., losses, delays, and service strate-gies).  A key strength of our envisioned methodology is that it will enable scalable, real-time tomography algorithms deployable on hosts and/or edge routers.\r\n     The INCITE Project will develop the theoretical underpinnings of network multifractal traffic processing,\r\nservice inference, and link-level characterization for complex, large-scale networks, and lead to computation-ally efficient and scalable service inference algorithms based only on traffic measurement at the network edge.  Moreover, in collaboration with a leading provider of broadband Internet bandwidth (Enron) and an innovator in networked signal processing hardware (Texas Instruments), we will build a complete prototype implementation of the proposed algorithms, including modules for multifractal traffic and path modeling, service inference, and network tomography. This reference implementation will provide a first-of-its-kind platform for obtaining a deep understanding of large networks and enable principled designs of future network architectures, algorithms, and models.",
