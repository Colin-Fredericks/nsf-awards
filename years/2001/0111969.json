 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study focuses on the processes involved in the editing (memory) of past \r\ndecisions.   Our goal is to contribute to decision theory while expanding our \r\ncollective understanding of how complex auditing decisions are made. The \r\nstudy builds on a well-known body of preceding work, notably Festinger's \r\ncognitive dissonance reduction theory, Fischhoff's hindsight bias, and \r\nSvenson's differentiation and consolidation theory.  Festinger, for example, \r\nhas shown that decision makers actively reevaluate the\" worth\" of the \r\nrejected alternative after a decision has been made--frequently to reduce the \r\nrisk of post-decision regret.  We focus on both pre- and post-decision \r\nattribute isolation and editing: on how expert and novice auditors make sense \r\nof complex and risky judgment/decision tasks, and on how feedback (or lack \r\nthereof) influences their memory of earlier supportive and counter-indicative \r\nsignal ratings.  Both pre- and post-decision sense-making (editing) processes \r\nare closely linked to both effective and biased learning.  We hypothesize \r\nthat there are significant differences in the type of data--qualitative vs. \r\nquantitative and positive vs. negative-- that the professionals and novices \r\nattend to.  We also hypothesize that novices are more likely to behave in \r\naccordance with established decision theory than their professional \r\ncounterparts; that domain knowledge gives rise to an interesting and largely \r\nunexplored set of mitigating factors. \r\n",
