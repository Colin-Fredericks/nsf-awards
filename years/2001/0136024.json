 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using a five-month planning grant, the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) will develop a comprehensive 10-year, educational initiative to address the needs of the optical science and engineering communities.  A series of workshops will be held at professional meetings of SPIE and the Optical Society of America (OSA) to assess regional needs and resources. Workshop recommendations will be used to create a plan to enhance the scientific and technological literacy of the public and raise the level of awareness about career options in this exciting and expanding field.  The meetings will incorporate a diverse array of stakeholders including optical engineering and science professionals, formal and informal educators, as well as representatives from industry and underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  Strategic emphasis will be placed on informal science education and efforts to recruit and retain minorities and women in optical engineering and related sciences.  The resulting education blueprint will be disseminated to the field in electronic and print media, and subsequently implemented by SPIE and OSA.",
