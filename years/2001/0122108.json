 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bio-composites from Engineered Natural Fibers \r\nfor Housing Panel Applications\r\n\r\nL. T. Drzal and A. K. Mohanty\r\nComposite Materials and Structures Center \r\nMichigan State University, MI 48824\r\n\r\nThis proposal will have as its objective, the development of natural fiber (bio-based) composites for housing panel applications as an environmentally friendly alternative to contemporary synthetic glass fiber - polyester composite materials.  Research under this project will investigate the utility of combining surface treated bast fibers (e.g., kenaf, hemp) with leaf fibers (e.g. pineapple leaf) in order to synergistically obtain the desired mechanical properties of strength, stiffness and toughness.  The bast fiber bio-composites alone show high flexural/tensile properties while the leaf fiber based bio-composites alone show the best impact properties.  The agricultural origin of the biofibers will create a new value-added use for pineapple leaf, at present a waste/underutilized product.  This project will be executed through effective collaboration of University (MSU), a housing panel manufacturing company (Kemlite), and a natural fiber company (Flaxcraft) in order to understand the changing demand and requirements of paneling systems by industry so that the use of bio-composites is maximized.  The fundamental knowledge of the relevant structure-processing-property relationships gained will be the basis for the commercialization of biocomposites into the housing market.  \r\n\r\n",
