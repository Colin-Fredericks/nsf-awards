Morgan\r\n\r\nThe work proposed to be carried out under this grant concerns mathematical formulation and proof of some of the mathematical dualities arising from high energy physics. The first duality \r\nto be studied concerns the F-theory/heterotic string duality. \r\nThe mathematical formulation of the duality is that for a \r\ncertain range of parameters the moduli spaces of classical \r\nvacua for various compactifications of F-theory and of \r\nheterotic string theory should be isomorphic.  We conjecture \r\nthat the appropriate mathematical statement is that the \r\nmoduli spaces of heterotic vacua are non-normal infinite-sheeted coverings of the F-theory moduli space associated with  \r\nmaximal parabolic subgroups of the fundamental group of \r\nthe F-theory moduli space. These maximal parabolic subgroups \r\nare the fundamental groups of neighborhoods of certain \r\ndivisors at infinity. This study involves a detailed analysis \r\nof the moduli space of semi-stable principal bundles over \r\nelliptic curves as well as the notions of differential \r\ncohomology. The second duality is the famous quantum field \r\ntheory duality between SU(2) Yang-Mills theory and the \r\nabelian Seiberg-Witten theory. These dual descriptions \r\nare simply the high and low energy limits of a twisted \r\nversion of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. One part of \r\na mathematical understanding of this duality involves \r\ngiving precise mathematical formulations of the high and \r\nlow energy limits of the twisted supersymmetric theory \r\nand showing how certain correlation functions in this \r\ntwisted theory  converge in the sense of perturbation \r\ntheory to the usual Donaldson polynomial invariants in the \r\nhigh energy limit and to the Seiberg-Witten invariants in \r\nthe low energy limit. This part of the story is surely \r\namenable to rigorous mathematical formulation. The \r\nmore ambitious goal is to find some mathematical \r\nformalism which allows for a mathematically rigorous \r\ninterpelation between these two limits -- a mathematical \r\nsubstitute for the mathematically undefined quantum \r\nfield theory -- which would allow one to compare the \r\nhigh and low energy limits.      \r\n\r\nThe connection between mathematics and high energy \r\ntheoretical physics has always been a close one. In the \r\nlast few years it has taken on new aspects. With the \r\nstudy of global issues in quantum field theory and string \r\ntheory has come a new level of interaction between geometry \r\nand topology and these areas of theoretical physics. Belief \r\nin the existence of these (to date non-rigorous) physics \r\ntheories leads physicists to make predictions, i.e., \r\nconjectures in mathematics.  In a strange way these \r\nconjectures play the role that physical predictions used \r\nto play. Now the physicists take confirmation that they are \r\non the right track when these mathematical predictions can \r\nbe verified by rigorous mathematics, which, since it is \r\nrigorous, can not make use of the quantum field theory \r\nparadigms that we used to make the prediction in the \r\nfirst place. The interest in mathematics of this interplay \r\nis that the sorts of mathematical statements that are \r\npredicted in this way have turned out to be quite novel \r\nproducing conjectures unlike anything that had been seen \r\nbefore. Much of the progress the last ten or fifteen years \r\nin large areas of geometry and topology traces back to this \r\nsource. One of the most fruitful sources of mathematical \r\nconjectures has been various dualities in physics. These \r\noccur when there is more than one classical mathematical \r\nlimit of a quantum field theory or string theory. The \r\nmathematical objects that arise in the description of \r\nthe classical limits then are related because they are \r\nlimits of a single quantum field theory or string theory. \r\nThe mathematical problem is always the same -- define \r\nrigorously what the relationship is and then establish it mathematically. The work proposed here is exactly along \r\nthese lines for two such dualities. \r\n",
