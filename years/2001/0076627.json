 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a major effort to apply global technologies to the analyses of specific acclimation processes in cyanobacteria.  It would make it possible to identify genes that are controlled under a number of different  environmental conditions and elucidate networks of control that link the responses of the cell to diverse environmental signals.   Specifically microarray analyses is being used to identify genes that become active during acclimation of Synechocystis PCC6803 to high light and nitrogen limitation. A whole genome chip is available. These analyses will provide clues concerning light and possibly redox control of metabolic processes. It may also be possible to identify the regulatory elements associated with high light and nutrient limitation responses since the transcription of regulatory genes in prokaryotes is often controlled by the environmental condition to which the regulator is sensitive. Microarray technology will be used to analyze one regulatory mutant, dspA, that has been shown to be altered in control of many high light regulated genes in Synechocystis PCC6803; the DspA protein appears to be involved in acclimation of the cells to high light. The information generated in this initial study will be used to exploit microarrays to dissect global regulation in cyanobacteria.",
