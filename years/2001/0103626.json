The PI has shown that a result of Dennis Sullivan's\r\nconcerning  the geometry of convex\r\nbodies in hyperbolic three space implies a factorization\r\ntheorem for conformal mappings in the plane and this, in turn,\r\nimplies  uniform bounds on the amount of\r\ncontraction a conformal map in the plane can have.  Finding the best constants\r\nin the factorization  theorem has consequences for well\r\nknown problems such as dimension distortion, integral means and Brennan's\r\nconjecture.  The PI will continue his work on\r\nlimit sets of Kleinian groups, a natural and important class of fractal sets.\r\nThe questions here are mainly to estimate the fractal dimension of these sets\r\nand study the behavior of the dimension as the group is deformed. \r\nThe PI will also  work on the metric properties\r\nof harmonic measures, particularly results which quantify the \r\nidea that harmonicmeasure cannot be concentrated on a small set.  Problems include the\r\nlower density conjecture, stability of harmonic measure and the growth rate\r\nof diffusion limited aggregation.  A few other questions\r\ninvolving  quasiconformal and biLipschitz maps are also considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nConformal mappings are a class of functions which are important\r\nin many area of mathematics and which are closely related\r\nto mnay physical problems (fluid flow, heat conduction, \r\nelectric fields, random growth models, ...) and have been \r\nintensively studied for many years.  One of the fundamental \r\nproperties of such maps is expansion; they tend to push \r\npoints farther apart on average.   Making this precise has \r\nmotivated much research in mathematical analysis.\r\nThe  PI has discovered a new way of quantifying\r\nthis expansion by approximating conformal maps by (the more\r\ngeneral class of) quasiconformal maps and showing these\r\napproximations may be taken with a very  strong \r\nexpansion property.  This has given a clearer understanding of some\r\nknown results and has led to progress on new problems.\r\nIn particular, it implies new results about Kleinian groups\r\n(these are important examples of conformal dynamical systems, \r\nand hence a contribution to the more general area of \r\ndynamical systems, fractals and chaos).  The PI's approach \r\nalso ties the behavior of conformal maps to the geometry \r\nthree dimensional hyperbolic space; this connection seems \r\nto be new and should lead to many interesting problems \r\nand  more interaction between the areas of complex \r\nanalysis and three dimensional topology (already connected \r\nin other ways).  He will also investigate the computational\r\naspects of this connection which may lead to new methods \r\nof computing conformal maps and Greens functions (important\r\nfor a variety of applications).  The PI will also continue \r\nhis investigation of other problems including the geometry  of random\r\npaths such as Brownian motion, the stability under\r\nperturbation of certain dynamical systems and fundamental\r\ngeometric properties of conformal and quasiconformal mappings.\r\n",
