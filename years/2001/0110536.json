 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the E2F transcription factors are key regulators of cell\r\ndivision and differentiation in animals. Related proteins have been identified in plants, but little is\r\nknown about their functions. In animals, much of our knowledge of pRb and E2F is from studies\r\nof DNA tumor viruses and their tumor antigen proteins. These viral proteins interact with\r\nunder-phosphorylated pRb (the form associated with cell cycle arrest and differentiation) and\r\ndisrupt pRb/E2F complexes, leading to altered host gene expression and cell cycle reentry.\r\nRecent experiments suggested that geminiviruses use a similar mechanism to alter cell cycle\r\ncontrols in plants. The overall goals of this research are to analyze host gene expression\r\nduring geminivirus infection and to use these important plant viruses as tools to study how pRb\r\nand E2F regulate plant gene expression. The first aim is to develop an Arabidopsis system for\r\nstudying geminivirus-mediated host induction and pRb interactions. This system will combine\r\ngeminiviruses with Arabidopsis genetic and database tools to study pRb and E2F function in\r\nplants. The second aim is characterize the global changes in Arabidopsis gene expression\r\nassociated with geminivirus infection using gene profiling technology. The third aim is to\r\ngenerate transgenic plants that express wild type and mutant viral proteins that differ only in their\r\npRb binding capacities. Comparison of the expression profiles of these lines will provide insight\r\ninto the identities of plant genes controlled by pRb and E2F. Together, these experiments are\r\nlikely to identify genes whose products are associated with the cell division cycle,\r\nendoreduplication, differentiation, and disease in plants. \r\n\r\nThe studies represent a unique opportunity to study the dedifferentiation process and the return to the cell division cycle in intact mature tissues of a higher eukaryote.  They have the potential to uncover plant-specific components of these two important processes and  may have a profound impact on agriculture by providing insight into strategies for altering plant growth.",
