 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gap between processor speed and main memory access speed\r\ncan cause processors to spend much of their time waiting on memory accesses.\r\nAs the gap has grown, this memory latency has become an\r\nincreasingly significant bottleneck in processor performance.\r\nExisting cache designs have worked well to fill the gap,\r\nbut new cache designs are needed as the gap continues to grow.\r\nA promising new class, restricted caches, includes\r\nskew caches, assist caches, victim caches, and other multi-lateral caches.\r\nExperiments have indicated that some restricted caches\r\noffer significant potential for improvement over traditional\r\nset-associative caches.  They also have revealed some interesting\r\nphenomenon that are not possible in traditional caches.  For example,\r\nskew caches seem to exhibit self-reorganization.\r\nHowever, no theoretical explanation exists for this behavior or for\r\nwhy these restricted caches perform well.\r\n\r\nThe investigators study the performance of distinct restricted cache\r\nstructures and algorithms for managing them.\r\nThe investigators first identify an underlying structural difference\r\nbetween restricted caches and traditional fully-associative\r\ncaches: all cache lines are not identical.  Specifically, in a\r\nrestricted cache, unlike in a traditional set-associative cache,\r\nthere exist pairs of memory blocks whose sets of legal cache lines\r\nare not identical and have a non-empty intersection.\r\nUsing this insight, the investigators evaluate and\r\ncompare different cache structures using new techniques.\r\nMost other analytical studies of caches focus only on the performance\r\nof algorithms for a given cache structure and do not explicitly\r\ncompare the effectiveness of distinct cache structures.  The\r\ninvestigators also study the performance of various algorithms\r\nfor these cache structures using a variety of techniques such\r\nas resource augmentation, standard competitive analysis,\r\nand trace-based simulation.  Their results indicate that traditional\r\ncache management algorithms behave very differently on restricted\r\ncaches than they do on traditional set-associative caches.\r\nFor example, the least recently used (LRU) algorithm that is strongly\r\ncompetitive for traditional caches is not competitive at all for\r\nrestricted caches unless explicit rearrangement of items in the\r\ncache is allowed.  Finally, the investigators construct a\r\ntrace warehouse to facilitate the comparison of distinct trace-based\r\nsimulation studies as well as to help new researchers learn this\r\nthis evaluation technique.",
