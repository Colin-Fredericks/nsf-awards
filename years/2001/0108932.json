 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of  repeated games  is a vital tool for understanding how groups overcome collective action problems. In such problems, decisions that are optimal for the individual may fail to be optimal for the group. So-called \"free rider problems\" manifest themselves, for example,  in attempts to collude in oligopolistic industries, in attempts to achieve multilateral tariff reductions in trade negotiations,  and  in attempts to cooperate when group effort is required in voluntary participation problems.   In repeated games, the use of intertemporal sanctions can be used to re-align individual incentives with collective incentives. It is well known that collectively optimal outcomes can be sustained in these cases if the participants are sufficiently patient.  Unfortunately, in many cases the players are not patient. In these cases \"full cooperation\" often cannot be sustained.  However, situations do exist in which the pattern of interaction in the game can be chosen to maximize the likelihood of collectively desirable outcomes.\r\n\r\nOne example of this is found in the design of team projects in firms. A manager must choose the size and makeup of the team, given the characteristics of the pool of lower level managers at the firm. Once chosen, individual effort can be mutually enforced by repeated contact. Another example is in residential planning. Local spillovers between neighbors are common. Mowing the lawn, leaving one's porch light on, or volunteering to maintain communal gardens are examples of positive spillovers.  A city planner who knows something about the aggregate population characteristics must choose among developers' plans, each of which proposes a number and spatial arrangement of houses. Some plans may be more conducive to facilitating \"neighborly cooperation\" than others.   \r\n\r\nThis project examines the tradeoffs involved in determining which interaction pattern is optimal, and how the answer depends on the particulars of the environment.  In the simplest type of such a problem, in  each period every individual has a binary choice between a \"cooperative\" and an \"uncooperative\" or \"free-riding\" action.  The project investigates how the size of the group and the  degree of social connectivity within the group matters for achieving socially desirable outcomes. The project describes and examines  two models of optimal interaction for repeated play. The first limits a planner's choice to group size. Randomly determined discount factors introduce unobserved  differences  in the population. A planner, knowing only the aggregate distribution of discount factors, chooses group size m to maximize expected average  payoff to the group, given the anticipated  strategic interaction  within the group. The second model generalizes the first to allow the planner to determine, not only group size, but also the pattern of social linkage within the group. The planner's choice determines  both the pattern of spillovers and the pattern of information flows.\r\n\r\nThe present project also extends the investigation to analyze: (a) the effect of correlation in the types (discount factors) of individuals, particularly when congestion and crowding play a role; (b) the role of communication as a way of increasing social interaction in the optimal solution; and (c) the effect of complexity of equilibrium sanctions on the optimal pattern of interaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
