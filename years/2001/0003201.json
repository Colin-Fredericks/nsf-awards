The PIs, John M. Hughes, John Rakovan, and Hailiang Dong, are all from the Department of Geology.  The group includes a mid-career researcher with extensive single-crystal x-ray experience, and two early-career researchers with expertise in emerging areas of the Earth Sciences (mineral surface structure and biomineralization).  Miami University students will be extensively involved in the studies to be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the CCD-detector diffractometer at Miami University will allow the investigation of samples that were previously too small for characterization through x-ray structure analysis.  The instrument will be used to investigate material properties of natural materials such as apatite, tourmaline, clay minerals, and biominerals.  The studies are of importance in the studies of environmental mineralogy, medical mineralogy, earth science, and the formation of minerals by organisms.  The facility will also by used by other researchers on a time-available basis.  The instrument will be housed in a newly renovated room in Hughes Hall on the Miami campus, and will complement the existing powder x-ray diffraction equipment, atomic force microscope, and single-crystal x-ray cameras.  In addition to support from the Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program (EAR/IF), matching funds are provided by the State of Ohio and Miami University.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
