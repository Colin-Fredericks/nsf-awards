 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an REU Site in psychology at Kent State University.  Ten junior-level REU students, recruited from 17 regional colleges and two other institutions that offer more promise for recruiting students from underrepresented groups, will participate.  Faculty members participating have research interests in cognitive psychology, health psychology, psychobiology, or social psychology.  Student activities include a Spring interview day, a 10-week summer research experience involving one-on-one faculty-student collaborations, and follow-through activities in the Fall after the summer research experience.  The goal of the program is to allow student participants who may have limited past research background to have a research experience that will more them from novice to relative independence in the laboratory.  The program will include student preparation prior to arrival at the Site, social gatherings, seminars on research methods and design,  weekly brown bag seminars, and presentations at regional or national meetings.  \r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
