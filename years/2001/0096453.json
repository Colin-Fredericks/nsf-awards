 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0096453\r\n\r\nIn this study, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will conduct a careful study of the marine chemistry of  molybdenum (Mo) in the open ocean.  Mo is currently believed to behave as a  conservative element in the open ocean and therefore to have a relatively  uninteresting chemistry in this environment.  However, it is well established that Mo is an  important micro-nutrient that is required in nitrate reductase and in the most common  form of nitrogenase, enzymes which are required for organisms to utilize nitrate and to  fix nitrogen (N), respectively.  The PIs expect that sufficiently precise analyses of Mo in  suspended particulate matter (SPM), and in filtered seawater will reveal variations that  are potentially related to biological utilization of Mo. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of this proposal are:  (1) to establish whether or not non-conservative distributions of Mo in the eastern Pacific result from biological utilization of  Mo; and (2) to determine whether or not enrichments of Mo in SPM result from biological  utilization of Mo in association with denitrification and/or N-fixation.  Accomplishing  these objectives is necessary in order to evaluate the potential of Mo enrichments as  tracers of these important components of the marine nitrogen cycle.  In addition, this work  could contribute to a better understanding the biological demand for iron (Fe) in the ocean because biological  utilization of Mo and Fe are coupled.  \r\n\r\nTo accomplish the objectives stated above the investigators will: (1) determine the vertical  distribution of Mo in filtered and unfiltered seawater samples from several sites in the  eastern Pacific that represent contrasting regimes of denitrification and Mn oxide redox  cycling, (2) complete a suite laboratory culture experiments designed to test our  hypothesis that cellular Mo concentration covary with levels of Mo-containing enzyme  activity and (3) collect and analyze SPM from regions that support active denitrification and  N-fixation in order to establish the relative proportions of Mo associated with lithogenic  debris, Mn oxides and biogenic material.  \r\n\r\nUpon completing the proposed work the investigators expect to be able to make a first order  assessment of the potential of analyses of dissolved and/or particulate Mo in seawater as  tracers of denitrification, N-fixation or Fe-utilization.  In addition, they hope to gain insight into the patterns of biological utilization of a non-limiting micronutrient.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
