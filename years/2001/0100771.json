Kronheimer\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to apply gauge-theory techniques to\r\nthe study of three-dimensional manifolds.  The principal\r\ninvestigator proposes to investigate Floer homology and closely\r\nrelated areas of geometry, and hopes to shed light on the\r\napplicability of gauge theory to problems in three-dimensional\r\ntopology.  In particular, it is hoped that a relation can be\r\nestablished between the Floer homologies of three-manifolds\r\ndefined on the one hand by the monopole equations on the other\r\nhand by the instanton equations.  (These are the equations which,\r\nin four-dimensions, lead respectively to the Seiberg-Witten\r\ninvariants and Donaldson invariants of four-manifolds, and which\r\nhave led to an flood of results in four-dimensional differential\r\ntopology in the past twenty years.)  A first goal is to prove\r\nthat if the instanton Floer homology of manifold with first betti\r\nnumber one is trivial in the strong sense that all the\r\nrepresentations of the fundamental group can be made to disappear\r\nby a holonomy perturbation, then the monopole Floer homology\r\ngroups are trivial also.  (For the instanton groups, the relevant\r\nrepresentations are the representations in SO(3) with non-trivial\r\nStiefel-Whitney class.)  By an application of a non-vanishing\r\ntheorem for the monopole Floer homology and use of Floer's exact\r\ntriangle, this would lead to a proof of the \"Property P\r\nconjecture\".  A related goal in this project is the development\r\nof new constructions for Floer homology, based on the technique\r\nof finite-dimensional approximation (which has already seen\r\nconvincing application in the study of the four-dimensional\r\ninvariants).\r\n\r\nTopology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness.\r\nIts importance was recognized at the turn of the last century by\r\nthe French mathematician Poincaro, during his investigation of\r\nthe laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body\r\nsystem such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to\r\nNewton's laws.  In the past twenty years, topology has seen\r\napplications in questions such as the knotting of proteins and\r\nDNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics.  The topology\r\nof three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of higher\r\ndimension, is of particular subtlety.  Through this project, it\r\nis hoped to bring new techniques to bear on outstanding questions\r\nin three-dimensional topology.  These techniques -- gauge theory\r\nand the Seiberg-Witten equations -- originated in physics, where\r\nthey had potential application to fundamental questions such as\r\nquark confinement.  They have been an effective tool in the study\r\nof four-dimensional spaces (such as our space-time).  The aim now\r\nis to apply the same techniques to questions in dimension three.\r\n",
