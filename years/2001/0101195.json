This medically-relevant research project offers potential for broad impact on the field of biomaterials engineering, by demonstrating the usefulness of non-natural, sequence-specific polymers for biomimicry. \r\n\r\nThe aims are:\r\n(1) To design, synthesize, chromatographically purify, and spectroscopically characteize the secondary strutures of peptoid mimics of helical, amphipathic LS proteins SP-B and SP-C;\r\n\r\n(2) To perform in vitro biophysical characterization of peptoid SP mimics as spreading agents for biomimetic lipid admixtures, carrying out studies on a pulsating bubble surfactometer and a Langmuir-Wilhelmy surface balance, and making comparisons to LS containing natural petpides;\r\n\r\n(3) To formulate a therapeutic, biomimetic LS replacement containing both phospholipids and SP mimics, that is effective, bioavailable, biocompatible, and more cost-effective than animal LS;\r\n\r\n(4) To carry out in vivo testing of optimized biomimetic LS replacements in a murine model of RDS, in collaboration with Brigham and Women's Hospital; and,\r\n\r\n(5) To deepen the present fundamental understanding of the relationship between LS protein structural features and biophysical functioning in phospholipid surface films.\r\n\r\n",
