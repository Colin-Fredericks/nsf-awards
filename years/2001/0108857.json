 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rubin\r\n0108857\r\n     This investigator develops and applies mathematical\r\ntechniques for the study of activity patterns in\r\nconductance-based neuronal network models incorporating features,\r\nsuch as continuous coupling, diffusive interactions, and\r\nheterogeneity in parameter values, that have largely been\r\nneglected in previous mathematical work on these systems.  Many\r\nof the mathematical results relate to the derivation and\r\nsubsequent analysis of subsystems of equations capturing dynamics\r\non disparate time scales.  One challenge in this endeavor is that\r\nthe additional features considered prevent the application of\r\nknown methods that could otherwise be used to reduce the\r\nsubsystem sizes and thereby facilitate analysis.  The particular\r\nactivity patterns that are investigated are sustained, localized\r\nactivity of cell populations in the thalamus involved in sleep\r\nrhythms and in tracking head direction; wave propagation, block,\r\nand reflection in inhomogeneous neuronal media such as branching,\r\nthickening, or damaged neurons; and periodic and chaotic\r\noscillations in a heterogeneous population of respiratory\r\npacemaker cells in the brain stem.  While this work is motivated\r\nby particular neuronal systems, it provides new steps in\r\ndirections with broad relevance.  Thus, the results of this\r\nproject yield insight into pattern formation and selection\r\nmechanisms that apply in specific neuronal contexts but that also\r\nconstitute more generally occurring phenomena.\r\n     Neuronal networks of the central nervous system can\r\ntypically display multiple types of rhythmic activity, ranging\r\nfrom periodic bursts of synchronized oscillations to traveling\r\nwaves of activity to more disorganized patterns.  Many of these\r\nforms of activity appear to be relevant to fundamental neuronal\r\nprocesses.  The overall goal of the investigator is to study\r\nmathematically the oscillatory population rhythms and wave\r\npropagation arising in certain models of neuronal networks, based\r\non systems involved in such disparate tasks as navigation,\r\nrespiration, and the generation of sleep rhythms.  This work\r\nelucidates the mechanisms that allow these networks to support,\r\nand to modulate between, distinct activity patterns.  These\r\nresults lead to conclusions about the roles of various\r\nbiophysical parameters in shaping network dynamics, with\r\nindividual contributions teased apart in a way that may be quite\r\ndifficult to achieve with a purely experimental approach.  Such\r\nfindings can then serve as guideposts for future biological and\r\ncomputational experiments.\r\n\r\n",
