 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is induced after a local infection by necrotizing pathogens and renders uninfected parts of the plant resistant to a variety of normally virulent viruses, bacterial and fungi. SAR is associated with the inducible expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. In dicots, the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of SAR. \r\nThe NPR1 protein is a key regulator of SA-mediated SAR in Arabidopsis. npr1 mutants fail to express SAR related PR genes and display enhanced susceptibility to pathogen infection even after treatment with SA. Furthermore, over-expression of NPR1 in Arabidopsis leads to enhanced disease resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens in a dose-dependent manner. We have now shown that over-expression of NPR1 in rice leads to enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), a serious disease of rice throughout the world.  In addition, we have isolated three resistance signaling components from rice: a rice NPR1 homolog, NH1, and two genes that encode products that interact with NH1 and NPR1; a bZIP transcription factor, rTGA2.1, and a previously unidentified signaling component, NRR (Negative Regulator of disease Resistance).\r\nThe long-term goal of this proposal is to further elucidate the signal cascade governing plant disease resistance and to create novel strategies for disease control in rice and other cereal crops. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
