Heat bath algorithms, which allow possibly \r\nnonlocal updates, appear to circumvent potentially bad situations \r\narising from simpler chains, but tend to be prohibitively complex \r\nfor analysis. Decomposition theorems provide a new tool which \r\nallow a Markov chain to be broken into pieces whereby a hybrid \r\napproach can be used to analyze each piece. The investigator \r\nstudies how these methods can be used together to approach some \r\nnew sampling problems.  2) Computational biologists have developed \r\na Turing-universal model of computation based on Wang tiles using \r\ndouble-stranded DNA.  New efficient sampling algorithms for some\r\nof these simple models are explored with the goal of providing ways\r\nto test the model predict outcomes of experiments.\r\n3) The research additionally explores the connection between \r\nrapid mixing of locally defined Markov chains and the uniqueness \r\nof the Gibbs state of the underlying physical system, also \r\ncharacterized by the lack of a phase transition.  Knowledge of \r\nthis phase structure is used to develop algorithms which will allow \r\nsampling below the critical point, where local Markov chains \r\nare inefficient.\r\n",
