 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Joseph Pesek of San Jose State University is sponsored by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program via a RUI grant for research on fabrication, characterization and applications of new separation media.  The research will lead to the development of new substrates for HPLC, capillary electrophoresis (CE), capillary electrochromatography (CEC), and solid phase microextraction (SPME) for the purpose of improved separations.  The first part of the work focuses on chemical modification of silica and other oxide surfaces with organic moieties, especially alkynes.  Chemical modification will also be achieved with liquid crystal compounds.   The second part focuses on etching processes for the purpose of increased surface area, and subsequent application of these materials to open tube CEC separations (OTCEC) and SPME configurations.  OTCEC will be developed for improved separation of proteins, peptides and pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nThe ability to separate biological compounds is of great importance in medical research and genomics, as well as in chemical and pharmaceutical industry.  Exposure to this work will enable San Jose students (many of whom are from under-represented groups) to enter technical positions in these areas of national need.\r\n\r\n",
