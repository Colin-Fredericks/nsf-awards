 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project will investigate the dynamics of partially hyperbolic systems.\r\nIt is hoped to improve the recent theorem of Pugh and Shub by weakening the\r\ncenter bunching hypothesis and adapting the proof so that it applies to the\r\npointwise (or Brazilian) version of partial hyperbolicity rather than more\r\nstringent uniform assumptions made by Pugh and Shub. I also hope to extend\r\nthe classes of partially hyperbolic maps within which the hypotheses of the\r\nPugh-Shub theorem are known to hold generically by studying compact group\r\nextensions of the compact group extensions already studied by myself and\r\nWilkinson. In addition I plan to continue my work with Paternain on\r\nmagnetic flows and to collaborate with Hasselblatt and Wilkinson on a\r\nstudy of Lyapunov exponents for geodesic flows.\r\n\r\nThis project will study the dynamics of partially hyperbolic systems.\r\nA differentiable dynamical system consists of a differentiable manifold which\r\nrepresents the possible states of the system and a differentiable map of the\r\nmanifold to itself which represents the evolution of the system from its\r\ncurrent state to its next state. A basic mechanism which tends to produce\r\nchaotic behavior is for the derivative of the map to stretch vectors in\r\nsome directions and to shrink vectors in the complementary directions.\r\nSuch behavior is called hyperbolicity. The system is called partially\r\nhyperbolic if in addition to the expanding and contracting directions\r\nthat are stretched and shrunk there is a third direction which is stretched\r\nless than the expanding direction and shrunk less than the contracting.\r\nIt has long been suspected that most partially hyperbolic systems should\r\nhave the same chaotic behavior as fully hyperbolic systems.\r\nIn the 1990's the work of Pugh and Shub (in collaboration with Grayson\r\nand Wilkinson) has made it possible to prove this in considerable generality.\r\nI aim to extend their work, by weakening the hypotheses in their main theorem\r\nand studying a number of particular examples of partially hyperbolic systems.\r\n",
