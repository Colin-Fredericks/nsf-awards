While much is known about the dynamics of translating media with constant length and transport speed, the dynamic behavior of translating media with variable length and/or transport speed is not well understood.  This proposal addresses new analytical and experimental techniques to analyze and control the vibration of translating media with variable length and/or transport speed.  A unified method that differs from classical parametric excitation approach will be employed to analyze the stability of both systems.  Analytical and computational methods will be developed to predict their free and forced responses.  Active and parametric control methodologies will be explored to dissipate their energies of vibration.  In conjunction with the experimental investigation, a novel scaled model will be developed for a high-rise, high-speed elevator.  Experiments will be conducted on the model to validate the theoretical predictions.  In collaboration with Otis Elevator Company, the methodologies developed for translating media with variable length will be applied to the design of high-rise elevators.  The developments for translating media with variable speed will be applied to wiresaw manufacturing processes and magnetic tape drive systems.  The success of this research will enhance our fundamental understanding in the general field of dynamic systems, as well as meet the immediate goal of enabling higher operating speeds in a variety of technological systems featuring translating media.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
