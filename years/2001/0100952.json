 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networks based on the exchange of social goods among actors can involve single connections or compound connections.  Each type of connection has different effects on network performance.  Consider, for example, an office manager who needs the work of all subordinates to complete a task. Since all subordinates must contribute to complete the task, this case involves single connections.  Further, since any one subordinate can disrupt the task, the subordinates exercise power over the manager.  In contrast, compound connections include a reserve of potential subordinates who can replace those who do not perform, and give power to the manager over subordinates.  This project uses laboratory experimental methods to investigate how different types of compound connections produce different power exchange outcomes. The experiment places subjects in separate rooms to negotiate through connected PCs.  The manipulation involves differences in the number and types of compound connections in the subjects' networks, and the outcome involves the gains made by network members in competing for points.  The results extend the scope of network exchange theory and its application to group behavior.",
