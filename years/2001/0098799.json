 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for the collider physics research program of the University of Nebraska.  The primary focus is the D0 experiment at Fermilab.  With leading roles in the continued analysis of existing Run I data (collected between 1992 and 1996) and in the D0 upgrade for Run II starting in March 2001, this group focuses on physics studies in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and searches for new particles.  Recent accomplishments (also a Nebraska PhD thesis) include a search for a supersymmetric partner to the top quark using the full Run I data set.  For Run II, this group has built electronics for the new Level-2 muon trigger.\r\n\tThe CMS experiment, currently under construction for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva Switzerland, will be the next major experiment for the University of Nebraska group.  On CMS, this group has the responsibility to coordinate the measurement of the pp luminosity.  On analysis, this group will extend its work on D0 by concentrating on new particle searches and QCD studies exploiting the enhanced physics reach of the 14 TeV LHC.  Lastly, the PI's are very heavily involved in undergraduate and graduate education projects as well as in novel outreach programs such as the separately-funded NSF-sponsored CROP program.\r\n",
