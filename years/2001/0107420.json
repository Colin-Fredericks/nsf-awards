 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sawyer\r\n0107420\r\n     The investigator studies ways to estimate the average amount\r\nof selection for or against new mutations at a particular genetic\r\nlocus using information contained in aligned DNA or protein\r\nsequences.  If the estimated amount of selection is significantly\r\nnegative, this is an indication that the region is under\r\nstabilizing selection and may have an important biological\r\nfunction.  If the estimated average amount of selection is\r\npositive, then new variants in this region are favored, as is\r\ncommon for some immune system genes.  Models that allow random\r\nvariation of the amounts of selection over sites are also\r\nconsidered.  The methods studied are computationally easy to carry\r\nout and have easily obtained significance levels, but assume\r\nstatistical independence between polymorphic sites instead of the\r\nmore usual assumption of tight linkage.  Studies have shown in\r\nmany cases that short-segment gene conversion and recombination\r\nact at a greater rate than point mutation, so that tight linkage\r\nis not always a reasonable assumption.  Simulations are carried\r\nout to test the assumption that small to moderate amounts of gene\r\nconversion and recombination are sufficient to guarantee enough\r\nindependence between sites so that the proposed estimators will\r\nhave desirable statistical properties.  The models are applied to\r\naligned sequences from public databases.  They are also applied to\r\nhuman SNP datasets, for which the assumption of sitewise\r\nindependence is clearer.\r\n     Recent advances in biology have made a vast amount of data\r\navailable about the human genome and about the genomes of other\r\nspecies.  Tools for understanding the significance of this data,\r\nand in particular the significance of variation in this data\r\nbetween individuals, have lagged behind.  One question is whether\r\nnew genetic variants at a particular genetic locus (or segment of\r\nDNA) have been favored on the average in the past, have rendered\r\ntheir owners less fit, or have had essentially the same effect on\r\nthe fate of individuals with those DNA variants.  Tests are\r\nproposed that give a computationally easy way of determining\r\nwhich of these three cases applies at a particular genetic locus.\r\nThese tests are based on the configurations of variant sites in\r\nDNA from several individuals at that locus.  The results of this\r\ntest can give information about the function of this stretch of\r\nDNA.  They can also give information about how a particular gene\r\nis affected by or is currently being affected by evolution.\r\nInformation from related biological species can give further\r\ninformation.  The difficulty of the proposed methods is that they\r\nassume that different portions of the genetic locus are evolving\r\napproximately independently.  For some genetic data (for example,\r\nSNP for \"single-nucleotide polymorphism\" data) this can generally\r\nbe assumed.  The sensitivity of the proposed methods to this\r\nindependence assumption for non-SNP data is tested.\r\n\r\n",
