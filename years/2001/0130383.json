More specifically, the quantum dynamics of a Cooper-pair box with a superconducting loop, as well as the flux-based qubit, in the presence of either classical or non-classical microwave fields are being investigated.\r\n\r\nThe control of quantum coherent Rabi oscillations in a superposition of two charge states, for both single-and multi-photon processes are being studied.  Under this project very novel quantum computing schemes for Josephson qubits coupled through photons, including the implementation of quantum communications between qubits is being investigated.  The local gate voltages and a microwave field can be used to control the device, which should be scalable to at least 10^8 qubits. Thus ways to implement scalable and well-controlled quantum computers, which are expected to be capable of performing certain tasks which no classical computers can do in practical time scales are being investigated.  Indeed, the Cooper pair box is a viable candidate for the implementation of quantum gates since it is a macroscopic two-level system that can be coherently controlled. Finally, young researchers are being trained in the fast growing area of quantum computing.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
