 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) \r\nUnderstanding biology at the molecular level is a daunting challenge for many students because it is abstract and not tangible. They are asked to make inferences about systems with which they have no experience and to provide answers to questions they have never asked. We are developing an inquiry-driven approach to help make the molecular world real and relevant to students, including those whose interests and career goals may lie outside the sciences. Our approach is based on the integrated use of computer visualization software and unique, 3-dimensional physical models of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecular structures created by state-of-the-art rapid prototyping technology at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. These physical models are used by students to make predictions about structure-function relationships that can then be tested experimentally. We are carrying out a multi-level evaluation of the synergy of physical and computer modeling to enhance student understanding of molecular structure/function relationships. This project builds upon the success of a CCLI proof-of-concept grant awarded to the PI and his co-workers to test this approach in a limited set of undergraduate biology and chemistry classrooms. We are now broadening the spectrum of educational settings in which this approach being field-tested, to include test sites that are diverse in terms of (i) institutions, ranging from a large research university (UW-Madison) to small liberal art colleges, a private engineering school, and a 2- year technical college, (ii) course diversity, including chemistry, biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and integrated science, (iii) level of instruction and diversity of student populations, ranging from introductory courses for majors and non-majors to advanced courses for biology and chemistry majors. This project also provides faculty development through participation in the design and construction of physical models specific to course needs and the sharing of their classroom experiences in an annual summer workshop. \r\n",
