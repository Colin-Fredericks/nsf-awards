 "awd_abstract_narration": "Configuration management (CM) is a software engineering discipline \r\nthat centers on managing the evolution of the artifacts that are \r\ncontinuously produced and changed over the course of a software \r\ndevelopment project.  The combined move towards developing software \r\nout of sets of components and managing software after it has been \r\ndelivered to its customers radically changes the nature of CM, \r\nbreaking several of its fundamental assumptions.\r\n\r\nAddressing these issues, the objective of this research is to \r\ndevelop and empirically evaluate the models, policies, and tools \r\nthat will lay the foundation for the creation of the next \r\ngeneration of configuration management systems---those capable of \r\nmanaging, in a seamless and continuous fashion, component-based \r\nsoftware throughout its life time.  The research hypothesizes that \r\narchitecture description languages are the key to providing this \r\nfunctionality: they create a single abstraction through which all \r\nCM functionality can be provided.  Specifically, we propose to \r\nbuild architecture-based CM models, associated new development \r\nand deployment policies, and the supporting tools necessary for \r\ndemonstration and evaluation.\r\n\r\nParts of the research will be used to seed the educational aspects \r\nof the proposal: to establish the undergraduate research factory in \r\nwhich teams of undergraduate students will be educated in carrying \r\nout research projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
