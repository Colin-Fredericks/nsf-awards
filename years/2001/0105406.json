 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the development, analysis \r\nand empirical evaluation of algorithms for information \r\nretrieval and data mining, primarily using spectral analysis. \r\nA partial list of the fundamental questions\r\nbeing addressed are:  How should data be stored,\r\norganized and processed so as to allow the most effective retrieval of\r\ninformation?  How can ``important'' structure and ``meaningful''\r\npatterns be found within a large data-set? How and when can this\r\nhidden structure be used to facilitate determination of missing data\r\nor to ``clean'' data that is imprecise or partially incorrect?\r\nWhat are appropriate models for data generation, and how can\r\nthese models be used to improve the design of data mining algorithms?\r\n\r\nThe researchers are studying applications that have already \r\nreceived a great deal of attention and on which\r\nempirical success has been achieved, including object\r\nclustering and web site ranking. In addition, they are designing \r\nand analyzing algorithms, and developing and analyzing models \r\nfor newer data mining problems, including collaborative filtering, \r\ntopic distillation, spam detection and prevention, and hierarchical\r\nclustering.  Matrix perturbation theory is the foundation for the \r\ndevelopment of theoretical results. The researchers are also studying\r\nnew techniques for speeding up the computation of the SVD.\r\nThe theoretical research is being complemented by\r\nexperimental evaluation on real data sets.",
