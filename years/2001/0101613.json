The four components of the project are Curriculum Development, Faculty Development, Student Outreach and Development, and Dissemination. The faculty development team at the College of Dupage has received mentoring in mecomtronics from the NJCATE. A Virtual Education Network is expected to facilitate rapid modification of modules and projects according to changing industry needs. Outreach includes workshops for 70 high school teachers, seminars for 60 college/university educators, and a high school summer camp for 20 students.\r\n",
