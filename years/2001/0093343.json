 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of my integrated research and educational\r\nplan is to develop interactive virtual environment sys-tems\r\nsupporting realistic aural/visual simulation of large 3D\r\nmodels containing multiple interacting users.\r\n\r\nResearch Plan\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the proposed research project is to\r\ndevelop efficient algorithms for simulating the propagation\r\nof light and sound waves through a virtual environment by\r\nscattering at surfaces of a 3D model. This research problem\r\nis central to providing a realistic experience in an\r\nimmersive virtual environment, as its solution enables\r\nglobal illumination and sound spatialization. It is also\r\nsignificant for several other applications, including motion\r\nplanning, inverse modeling, scene capture, heat transfer,\r\nradio power prediction, fire propagation, and traffic\r\nanalysis, which are all important in fields beyond immersive\r\nvirtual environments.\r\n\r\nFor simulations of both lighting and acoustics, the\r\nfundamental problem is to compute a solution to an integral\r\nequation expressing the wave field at every point in terms\r\nof the wave field on surrounding surfaces. The main\r\ndifficulty is that the wave field has discontinuities due to\r\nocclusions, caustics, and specular highlights, which induce\r\nlarge variations over small portions of the integration\r\ndomain (i.e. surfaces or directions). Previous integration\r\nmethods based on radiosity and Monte Carlo path tracing are\r\ngenerally not practical for typical virtual environments.\r\n\r\nI plan to investigate a hybrid beam tracing and path tracing\r\napproach. The general strategy is to trace beams that\r\npartition the space of rays into topologically distinct\r\nbundles corresponding to different sequences of scattering\r\nevents at surfaces of the 3D scene (reverberation\r\nsequences), and then use them to guide sampling in an\r\ninteractive path tracing algorithm. The motivation for this\r\napproach is that attributes of a relatively small number of\r\nbeams traced during the first phase can provide useful\r\ninformation about the wave field that can be used to guide\r\nand accelerate evaluation of samples during the second\r\nphase. This approach enables efficient methods for: 1)\r\nenumeration of reverberation sequences, 2) decomposition of\r\nintegration domain, 3) conservative approximation, 4)\r\nspatial coherence in ray intersections, 5) sampling of\r\nreverberation sequences, 6) progressive refinement, and 7)\r\noff-line precomputation. The challenge is to develop methods\r\nthat trace beams through 3D models quickly and reap the\r\nbenefits of the traced beams in useful applications.\r\n\r\nMy research plan is to investigate hybrid beam tracing and\r\npath tracing approaches to solve classical problems for\r\nvirtual environments. The new research contributions will be\r\nmade at four levels: theory, algorithms, applications, and\r\nexperiments. First, I plan to investigate new theory for\r\nmodeling wave propagation as a discrete set of reverber-\r\nation paths incorporating multiple scattering effects\r\nincluding diffractions. Second, I plan to develop new\r\nalgorithms that efficiently find significant reverberation\r\npaths with general types of scattering in general 3D models.\r\nThird, I plan to investigate new applications where the\r\nproposed approach for computing reverberation paths can be\r\nused to solve classical problems. Finally, I plan to perform\r\nexperiments to evaluate the results of computed simulations\r\nboth quantitatively and qualitatively in comparison to\r\nmeasured wave fields. The overall outcome of this research\r\nwill be a computational framework and a suite of methods for\r\ncomputing general reverberation paths in general 3D models\r\nand evaluating them in interactive applications.\r\n\r\nThroughout this project, I plan to investigate the synergies\r\nbetween sound and light and to apply the lessons learned\r\nfrom one wave phenomenon to the other. Based on historical\r\nprecedent, I believe that it will be possible to develop\r\nbetter simulations of virtual environments by studying both\r\nsound and light together.\r\n\r\nEducational Plan\r\n\r\nThe objectives of my educational plan are to teach students\r\nand to develop new methods for education. In particular, one\r\nspecial goal of mine is to enable the use of interactive\r\nvirtual environment systems in the educational process. I\r\nplan to investigate this novel media for education by\r\ndesigning new interdisciplinary courses that will allow\r\nstudents and teachers from widely varying backgrounds to\r\nlearn about and experiment with virtual environment systems.\r\nI also plan to develop new educational materials (textbook,\r\ncourse notes, software tools, and 3D models), to mentor\r\nstudents (graduate, undergraduate, and K-12), and to develop\r\noutreach programs for disadvantaged people (mentoring under-\r\nprivileged students and deploying handicap-assisting\r\napplications).\r\n\r\nBy both developing interactive virtual environment systems\r\nfor research, and investigating their use for teaching, my\r\nresearch and educational activities are uniquely integrated.\r\n",
