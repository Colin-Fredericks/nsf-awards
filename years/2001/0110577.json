The purpose of the conference is to\r\nencourage communication and the discussions to be conducted in an\r\natmosphere conducive to open interactions between the scientists,\r\nprovoking new and even speculative ideas for future research.  To\r\naccomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the\r\nconference activities of a significant number of leaders in the field.\r\nHowever, a science as rapidly developing as nuclear chemistry invites\r\nand needs cooperative efforts on all levels, including efforts both\r\nnational and worldwide in scope.  The participation of younger\r\nscientists is essential to address the future manpower needs of this\r\nrapidly changing field.  Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral\r\nresearchers and graduate students have been specially selected for\r\nparticipation in this conference and encouraged to present their ideas. \r\nTheir participation in this conference provides them with unique and\r\nextensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to new\r\nresearch opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for the\r\nleadership roles they will assume in the future.  This award will\r\nfacilitate participation from these junior scientists.\r\n\r\n",
