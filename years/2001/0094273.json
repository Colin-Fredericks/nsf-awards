 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to investigate the synthesis and physical property characterization of nanoparticles with coupled magnetic and electronic properties. Two types of systems will be studied, both based on III-V semiconductors: (1) Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS's) and (2) Heterostructured core-shell nanoparticles with a magnetic:semiconducting interface. Such materials are expected to combine the information storage ability of magnetic devices, with the processing ability of semiconductor devices. The miniaturization of circuits is expected to provide an economic impetus for such dual use devices. III-V based nanoparticle DMS's will be prepared through modified co-precipitation reactions of manganese and iron salts with indium or gallium in the presence of a pnictogen source such as phosphorous or arsenic. These materials will be characterized using standard techniques for structural and particle size determination of nanoparticles and the physical properties will be evaluated by magnetic susceptibility, absorption/luminescence spectroscopy, and coupled magnetic/optical techniques.  The structural and physical properties of DMS nanoparticles will be compared to heterostructured nanoparticles consisting of a magnetic transition metal pnictide core and a semiconducting main group pnictide shell. Techniques have been developed for producing transition metal pnictide nanoparticles (cores) and to be used as substrates for the nucleation/precipitation of  indium or gallium pnictide phases (shells). \r\n%%%\r\nThe diluted and heterostructured magnetic semiconductor materials prepared in the course of this research are expected to impact industries focused on information storage/transmission and development of magnetoresistive sensors. Accordingly, an important educational goal is to illustrate the relevance of  materials research to technological advances by fostering interactions between students and local industry. Additionally, modules emphasizing materials chemistry and nanotechnology will be incorporated into traditional inorganic courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels. \r\n",
