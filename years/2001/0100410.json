 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first question motivating the subject of our project is the\r\nfollowing: Let f be a holomorphic function in a neighborhood of the\r\norigin of affine n-space. Can the singularities of f(z)=0 get \"worse\"\r\nunder small perturbations of the function f? By \"get worse\" we mean:\r\nCan the critical exponent of f get smaller, where the critical\r\nexponent is the supremum of all exponents d for which the absolute\r\nvalue of f raised to the power -d is locally integrable.  This\r\nquestion, and its effective counterpart, play an important role in\r\nproving the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on certain Fano\r\nmanifolds (as has been recently demonstrated by Demailly and Kollar).\r\nWe plan to apply our method of \"algebraic estimates\" to this\r\nproblem. A related question which we will pursue is the following: Let\r\nR be a rational function with complex coefficients. How do we decide\r\nif R is in L^p?  To what extent is the L^p norm of R a continuous\r\nfunction of its coefficients? The third motivating question concerns\r\ndecay rates of oscillatory integral operators is one which has\r\nattracted much aattention is recent years: What is the best decay rate\r\nof such operators? We have been able to attack this problem in the\r\nmultilinear one-dimensional case when the phase function is a\r\npolynomial, and have succeeded in finding the best decay rate (modulo\r\nlogarithimic terms). Our method employs in an improved version of the\r\ncurved trapezoid technique developed by Phong-Stein. We plan to apply\r\nthis method to the higher dimensional case and in the case of damped\r\noperators.\r\n \r\nThe main themes of this proposal - oscillatory and singular integrals\r\nand the method of stationary phase - are central to the field of\r\nclassical analysis, with foundational results dating back to the\r\nnineteenth century: Harmonic Analysis plays a critical role in the\r\nsolution of wide spectrum of problems in physics and applied\r\nmathematics - solving the heat equation, wave equation, Laplace\r\nequation, Schrodinger equation all make use of the Fourier analysis\r\ntechnique.  The use of harmonic analysis in X-ray diffraction is\r\nindispensible to determining the structure of large molecules (such as\r\nDNA), and the Fourier transform method in signal processing is at the\r\ncore of much of the modern technology involving the transfer of\r\ninformation by electronic means.  In modern applications to a variety\r\nof questions, traditional techniques do not suffice and the need for a\r\nmore general theory has arisen. In particular, the issues of bounds\r\nand stability for oscillatory integrals and operators, and the related\r\nproblem of regularity of Radon transforms have been the focus of much\r\nrecent work.  The principal investigator, working with D.H. Phong\r\n(Columbia University) and Elias M. Stein (Princeton University), plans\r\nto continue investigating this circle of problems using the tools from\r\ngeometry and analysis which were recently developed in our joint work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
