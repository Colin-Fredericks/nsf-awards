 "awd_abstract_narration": "With advances in wireless communications, medicine, and biocompatible electronics, novel ideas to\r\nseamlessly integrate information technology and bioelectromagnetics toward the development of wireless\r\nimplantable biomedical devices need to be explored. Bioelectromagnetic phenomena are intrinsic to the\r\nvital function of all living tissues, and a thorough understanding of both the internal electromagnetic\r\nfields and the coupling of external electromagnetic fields to the human body represent a challenge that\r\nwill significantly contribute to the development of new biomedical devices for the 21st century.\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to bring about fundamental advances toward the development of novel\r\nwireless transcutaneous electromagnetic devices for biomedical applications by integrating in the same\r\nframework macro- and micro-scale phenomena. The study will start from considering the development of\r\nsuitable antenna systems for power and data telemetry between units internal and external to the human\r\nbody, to reach the level of understanding how induced and spontaneous electrical signals can be\r\nmeaningfully used in the development of biomedical devices. Macro-scale interactions of exogenous and\r\nendogenous electromagnetic fields in the human body will be interfaced with microbioelectromagnetic\r\nmodeling, with the focus on characterizing exposure and excited electrical activity at the cellular and\r\nmolecular level. Such studies will help in understanding and elucidating the mechanisms of interaction of\r\nelectromagnetic fields with biological tissues, with potential applications to neural responses to\r\nelectromagnetic excitations.\r\nFull-wave Finite-Difference Time-Domain based numerical methods will be used for this complete\r\nmodeling effort, with integration of quasi-static methods for the low frequency modeling of neural\r\nresponses. Experimental systems to test the performance of the developed implantable wireless links will\r\nbe fabricated, while computational models of the neural responses will be validated through collaboration\r\nwith researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\r\nThe impact of the proposed research activity will extend from the development of a epiretinal prosthesis\r\nto restore sight in over 10,000,000 visually impaired to the development of wireless devices for sensing\r\nthe daily evolution of cancer. Collaborations with the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute and biomedical\r\ncompanies are already in place to provide the necessary medical help and expertise.\r\nThis project will offer a unique research environment with strong interdisciplinary and multi-institutional\r\ncollaborations that will provide graduate and undergraduate students an unprecedented exposure to\r\ninnovative technologies for the 21st century. New educational approaches aimed to present a broader\r\nsystem-oriented view of the role of electromagnetics and bioelectromagnetics in today's and tomorrow's\r\ntechnology will be pursued to expose students early in their career to a new and timely perspective of\r\ncareers in engineering electromagnetics and bioelectromagnetics.\r\n",
