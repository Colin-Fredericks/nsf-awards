 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) This project involves a major upgrade to the Advanced Undergraduate Physics Laboratory at Caltech. Specifically, six new experiments are being developed -- The Integer Quantum Hall Effect, Superconductor Phase Diagrams, Heat Capacity, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Optical Pumping, and Gamma-ray and X-ray spectroscopy. Each of the experiments is adapting the work of both classic papers in the research literature and contemporary applications to the undergraduate lab. The first three experiments are completely new and are designed to add condensed matter experiments to the course. These experiments are all performed in a commercial cryogenic apparatus that is well suited for undergraduate teaching. The last three experiments are major upgrades of existing experiments, aimed at injecting more modern experimental techniques and equipment into the lab. In all cases the experiments are designed to demonstrate modern physics and experimental techniques that provide a useful learning experience for the student.",
