 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Theodore Cohen in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his research on lithium-ene cyclizations.  The project will investigate the scope and stereoselectivity of these ring-forming reactions; in addition, enolate-directed lithiations and the cyclopolymerization of dienes via titanium-ene intermediates will be studied.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Theodore Cohen is developing new, efficient methods for forming cyclic organic compounds.  These new methods for synthesizing cyclic compounds are most likely to find applications in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries.  New techniques for preparing polymers consisting of a series of rings in an ordered, controlled manner are also being investigated.  Variation of the polymerization procedures should result in new materials with novel physical properties.",
