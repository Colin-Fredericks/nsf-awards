 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed work is to develop an integrated computational-communication a chitecture\r\nfor large scale netwo ks of embedded systems,called cooperative computin .Unlike distributed comput-\r\ning,coope ative computing is pe formed ove a dynamic ad-hoc network with volatile nodes and connections,\r\nand expects statistically correct executions.E .ective esource management,in pa ticula power and energy\r\nmanagement,will be c ucial since most devices in the netwo k will be mobile and will ely on batte y.The\r\nbasic idea in coope ative computing is that nodes coope ate in pe forming a global task in an ad-hoc manne\r\nusing thei local esou ces and state information to att act task 's computation o communication.Caching,\r\nrouting,topology discove y,o any speci .c use -de .ned application,can be implemented as a global task\r\nover the cooperative computing model.\r\n     To effectively cooperate,the nodes that are involved need to know the esources and constraints they face\r\nin successfully accomplishing the ta get task.In such a power and esource constrained environment,the\r\ncoope ating nodes must intelligently make the best decisions to ensu e the quality of esult (QoR).\r\nWith these goals in mind,the p oposed esea ch is to develop a system a chitectu e to support coope ative\r\ncomputing ove dynamic netwo ks of embedded systems.Our resea ch will address the following issues:\r\nHow to de .ne a global task at the application and ope ating system levels?\r\nHow to prog am very large networks of embedded systems to execute a global task without handling\r\neach node individually?\r\nHow to implement self-outing using peer-to-peer communication only?\r\nHow to measure a pa tially successful execution?\r\nHow to predict the powe dissipation and energy consumption of individual nodes,and nodes cooper-\r\nating ac oss the network?\r\nHow to optimize a task to reduce its powe and ene gy budget running on individual nodes,and across\r\nnodes in network?\r\n     The system a chitectu e for coope ative computing is based on Smart Messages (SM),which can be\r\nviewed as intelligent ca ie s of data in a netwo k.Sma t Messages a e collections of code and mobile data\r\nthat migrate th ough the netwo k,a single network hop at a time,executing at each step.Smart Messages\r\na e self-outing,namely they a e esponsible fo dete mining thei own paths th ough the netwo k,utilizing a\r\nminimal set of facilities p ovided by nodes in the netwo k.An SM may be denied a equest to oute th ough\r\na node due to the node 's esou ce limitations,in pa ticula its emaining ene gy level.We conjectu e that\r\nSmart Messages p ovide a .exible support for a wide variety of applications,anging from data collection\r\nand dissemination,content-based outing and object t acking,to more t aditional dist ibuted computing\r\napplications in which execution of a task is sp ead across a collection of devices.\r\n     As pa t of this p oposal we plan to implement and extensively evaluate seve al p ototype implementations\r\nof the Smart Message a chitectu e.Ou testbed will consist of networks of embedded multicontrollers and\r\nPDAs based on Bluetooth sho t-range wi eless communication.",
