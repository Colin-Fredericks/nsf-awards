 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main thrust of this research is to establish in the setting of\r\nfunction fields analogues of major conjectures by Rohrlich and,\r\nShimura on the algebraic (in)dependence of coordinates of periods \r\nof certain abelian varieties.  The current step involves the \r\nanalysis of the structure of certain types of t-modules, which \r\ncorrespond roughly to abelian varieties.  With these tools, one \r\nexpects further progress on related questions.  In particular, \r\nthe PI and his coworkers will establish precise conditions for \r\nthe independence of the periods of certain one dimensional \r\nt-modules, called Drinfeld modules.  Another approach to \r\nNesterenko's recent work on the Ramanujan functions will also \r\nbe attempted by means of determining the rational solutions to a\r\ncertain differential equation.  This would allow the application \r\nof the PI's Lojasiewicz inequality rather than the original\r\nfundamental, but considerably more complicated, independence\r\ncriterion due to Philippon.  Moreover the PI will provide a \r\nquite general arithmetic version of the fundamental Lojasiewicz\r\ninequality which is best possible in its important respects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present proposal centers about the properties of numbers and\r\npolynomials.  One central question is whether those numbers which\r\narise in various contexts in mathematics (analysis or geometry) \r\nhave unkown linkages.  Some of the first research of this type \r\nover a hundred years ago resolved problems which had puzzled\r\nmathematicians for two millenia.  One main objective of the \r\npresent research is to show that such linkages do not exist in \r\na broad setting analogous to certain central puzzles of today.  \r\nIn that setting, polynomials correspond to integers and power \r\nseries correspond to real numbers. The core of this work will be \r\ncarried out by the PI together with M.A. Papanikolas and G.W. \r\nAnderson.  A coordination of quite diverse elements is crucial \r\nto establishing these results on the boundary between the broad \r\nfields of analysis, geometry, and number theory.  In the classical \r\ncase, the PI will try to develop an understanding of the behaviour \r\nof certain differential equations to simplify our view of certain \r\nrecent work of Nesterenko.  Just as one tries to show that there \r\nare no \"hidden\" linkages between values, one also strives to\r\nestablish that polynomial values cannot be \"unnaturally\" small.  \r\nThe PI has one good version of such a result, and he will extend \r\nits applicability even further.",
