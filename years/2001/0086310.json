 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northern Illinois University (NIU) will engage in a small, experimental project to improve the participation and retention of women in mathematics.  E-WOMS: Expanding Women's Opportunities through Mathematical Science, offers a twopronged approach to solving the problem of low continuation rates for women in college mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe first component of the project includes a novel collaboration among three units in NIU's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences-the Department of Mathematical Sciences, the Department of Communication, and the Women's Studies Program.  The objective of this component is to change negative campus perceptions regarding women's roles, abilities, and achievement in mathematics.  Graduate interns in Communication will work with the other two units in designing a public information campaign to educate the community during the funding period.  This activity will give the interns opportunities to translate their research and theoretical knowledge into practice, and then to reflect back on their experiences in final papers.\r\n\r\nThe second component consists of teaching interventions focusing on 60 women taking Calculus I during their first semesters at Northern (30 students each in fall 2001 and 2002).  The interventions will create a community of students engaged in collaborative problem solving and the other activities (both in class and in a separate support group) enhanced by an associated section of UNIV 101. An orientation class.  By enrolling in these courses together, attending presentations by professional women who use mathematics in their careers, and being offered ample opportunities for mentoring by members of the Department of Mathematical Sciences as the Women's Studies Program, the students involved will receive support and knowledge necessary to continue to take the higher mathematics courses required for many majors.  Throughout, particular attention will be paid to the fact that many NIU students come from rural communities in which there are few (if any) female models of achievement in careers involving mathematics and higher education.\r\n",
