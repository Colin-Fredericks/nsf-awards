 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0103985\r\nAlan Dow\r\n\r\nThe Principle Investigator proposes to focus on three \r\ncentral problems in set-theoretic topology which involve \r\nbasic countable convergence issues and set-theoretic \r\nindependence results. The first question, due to Efimov, \r\nis to determine if it is consistent that any compact \r\nspace that does not contain a converging sequence will \r\ncontain the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers. \r\nThe second, due to Bashkirov, is to determine if there \r\ncan be a countable bound on the sequential order of a compact sequential space. This problem can, in some ways, be viewed \r\nas a very interesting strengthening of the recently resolved Moore-Mrowka problem. The third is to continue a systematic \r\nstudy of the Stone-Cech remainder of the reals analogous to \r\nthat which has long been conducted for the remainder of the \r\nintegers. There appears to be many obstructions to progess \r\ncaused by the additional complexity imposed by the connectedness property.\r\n\r\nGeneral questions of the existence of converging sequences \r\nand the extent to which converging sequences fully determine \r\nthe topological structure arise frequently in a variety of \r\nsettings. These questions are particularly meaningful in the \r\ncontext of compact subsets of function spaces (natural\r\ninformative topologies on sets of real-valued functions). \r\nThe investigator is continuing to pursue lines of investigation \r\nthat have stimulated intensive interaction between the fields \r\nof general topology and set-theory for de\r\n",
