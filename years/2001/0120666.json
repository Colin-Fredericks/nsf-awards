 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project features seven interrelated activities designed to advance community college leadership in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) education, to encourage the development of ATE-related programs in more community colleges, and to share information about the value, accomplishments, and community impact of the ATE program in and beyond the education field. The activities build upon the successes of AACC's previous efforts supported by the National Science Foundation. They support the network of community colleges dedicated to improving SMET education, and help to expand and focus the future of the ATE program as it positions itself to meet the challenges presented by a new century and an increasing demand for a trained technical workforce. \r\n\r\nThere is activity in seven areas:\r\n* Three National ATE Principal Investigators Conferences in 2002, 2003, and 2004,\r\n* Development of an ATE Leadership Program to include three ATE Centers Meetings, three ATE Presidents Meetings, and a Summit on Technological Education that combines community college and business representatives to develop strategies to strengthen the nation's technical workforce and faculty pipeline,\r\n* Continuation of the AACC ATE Mentoring Program to help ten community colleges establish new programs in science, mathematics, engineering, and/or technology,\r\n* Two AACC Briefs, one focusing on the outcomes of the ATE Mentoring Program, and one focusing on impact and results of the ATE PI Conference.\r\n* A summary of recommendations and findings from the Summit on Technological Education,\r\n* Dissemination of information about ATE programs and goals through AACC publications, presentations, feature stories, conference proceedings, a listserv, and a Web page, and\r\n* Evaluation.\r\n",
