 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) Geology (42)\r\nAtomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy is typically an integral part of undergraduate chemistry education. The processes involved with AA are easily understood by students. An AA spectrometer is being used as a vehicle to introduce sophisticated analytical ideas and interesting challenges into several different chemistry courses. An introductory geosciences course is utilizing the instrument in the study of the geochemistry of natural waters. Finally, the AA is serving as an interdisciplinary bridge between the Departments of Chemistry and Geosciences. Analytical procedures from the educational and research literature are being adapted in order to achieve these objectives. \r\n\r\nThis project simultaneously addresses two main objectives. First, chemistry students have exposure to the AA instrumentation in the first semester, junior level analytical, and senior level instrumental analysis laboratories. Each exposure builds on the previous experience in a way otherwise not possible if students were to encounter AA only once. More sophistication and subtleties are then layered into the advanced labs. Improvements in instruction occur in a manner consistent with the philosophies that 'real samples' should be used when possible, interdisciplinary applications and opportunities should be exploited, effective communication of results is critical, and students should have input into experimental design.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this instrumentation is serving as a bridge between the Departments of Chemistry and Geosciences. Including geosciences in the implementation of this project realizes several key advantages. The Geosciences curriculum is being enhanced through the addition of sophisticated instrumentation, typically encountered only in chemistry. For those students electing to major in geosciences, it emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the geosciences early in their career. By creating a link between chemistry and geosciences courses, both sets of students must exchange knowledge about their respective disciplines in order to better understand the laboratory assignments. Geosciences classes are typically more attractive to non-science, mathematics, engineering, technology (SMET), and education majors than are other SMET classes. Thus, the interdisciplinary link means that the Department of Chemistry is able to reach these students in a small but novel way. \r\n\r\n",
