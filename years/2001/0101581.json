 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is helping to meet the growing demand for biotechnology technicians in Colorado's Front Range corridor by establishing close collaborations among K-12 school systems, two-year and four-year educational institutions, and the business community. The project is utilizing previous interactions with BioLink and BioTechEd, NSF-funded Advanced Technology Education efforts in the biotechnology area. High school teachers from throughout the region are being recruited and supported to develop biotechnology curriculum for their particular secondary system, they are attending the Biotechnology Institute established at the Community College of Aurora, and they are introducing into their curriculum biotechnology topics such as the handling and manipulation of DNA and proteins in a manner consistent with research and industry protocols. Once fully implemented, the project is impacting 9000 or more high school students over three years as the 75 teachers trained in the Institute implement biotechnology activities, modules, and courses in their high schools.\r\n\r\nFinal outcomes from the award will include:\r\n- an active, ongoing Advisory Committee to provide guidance on project activities and links to needed resources.\r\n- a total of 75 area high school teachers trained at the introductory and advanced levels in biotechnology topics.\r\n- weekend laboratory sessions for high school teachers.\r\n- on-line learning opportunities and resources to discuss and share implementation of Institute training in the classrooms, the opportunity to attend industry-related events, and assistance with guest speakers and field trips.\r\n- teachers with ready-to-use biotechnology equipment and supplies from a college-maintained lending library.\r\n- model curricula that additional teachers may use as they develop biotechnology courses appropriate to their district science standards.\r\n- information for students and their parents about career opportunities in biotechnology with special efforts to reach those from ethnically diverse neighborhoods and schools.\r\n\r\n",
