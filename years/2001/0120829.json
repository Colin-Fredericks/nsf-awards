 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New Mexico Museum of Natural History is developing a large format film on the Pantanal in Brazil, the world's largest wetland.  The film will focus on the Hyacinth Macaw, an indicator species whose health reflects the health of the entire ecosystem, and will explore the relationship between the climate, geology, hydrology and ecology of the region.  It also will examine three threats to the region:  a large scale river channeling project which would drain 50% of the marsh, gold mining activities that dump millions of tons of sediment into streams, and large-scale corporate farming which pollutes the region with pesticide and fertilizer run-off.\r\n\r\nScience content for the series will be under the direction of Dr. Richard Smartt, former Director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.  The series will be co-produced by Timothy Aydelott, from the museum, and Constance Bennecke, an independent producer in Brazil.  Barrie Howells will be executive producer and Rodney Taylor will be director of photography.  Both Mr. Howells and Mr. Taylor have extensive large format film experience.  Ralph Adler of RMC Research will conduct audience research during the planning phase\r\n\r\nThe major activities during the planning stage include:\r\n\r\nConducting audience research to determine the familiarity of the public with the ecosystem and with the concepts to be presented in the film.  In addition to topic testing, the research will assess the audience's current knowledge or misconceptions about wetland ecosystems and the Pantanal.\r\n\r\nConvening the project advisors to develop the science content, finalize content goals, and to suggest ideas and strategies for presenting the science.\r\n\r\nAttending a regional planning conference in the Pantanal to establish working relationships with scientists in the field.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a script treatment for the film.\r\n\r\n",
