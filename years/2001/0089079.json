 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59) \r \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to build upon a successful pilot project (EPTTS or Engineering Project Team Training System, which included the development of a student training module about cognitive style differences; a faculty training workshop which assisted instructors in adapting the module for their own classes; and an extensive assessment base which included qualitative data from focus groups and quantitative survey results from BESTEAM developed evaluation tools) and develop an integrated and longitudinal (involving students across their entire engineering education experience) engineering curriculum model to improve learning in project team environments. \r\n\r\nA primary goal of this effort is to design supportive faculty tools/aids (called modules) of team training skills that can be flexibly integrated into virtually any existing engineering program. A second major outcome of our efforts will be extensive faculty training via workshops and summer retreats in the adaption of the materials for use in their own classes. In addition, this project seeks to add to the literature base of engineering education by investigating how social cognitive career theory-SCCT- can help explain aspects of individual and team's behavior. Finally, by focusing on team skill building and related 'process skills', we expect that the BESTEAMS curriculum will act as a positive intervention in the retention of minorities and women in engineering. \r\n\r\n",
