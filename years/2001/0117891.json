 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the demand for error-free data transmission and data storage increases, \r\nerror control becomes increasingly important in data communication and data\r\nstorage systems.  It has become an integral part in almost every data \r\ncommunication or storage system design.  Today very sophisticated error \r\ncontrol schemes are being used in a broad range of communication and data\r\nstorage systems to achieve reliable data transmission and storage, such as\r\nwireless communication, satellite communication, optical communication, \r\nhard disc drives, compact disks and many others.  The objective of this \r\nresearch is to devise methods for constructing good error control codes and \r\nto develop efficient error control schemes which have great potential to \r\nachieve error-free communication and data storage for the future generation\r\nof data communication and storage systems.\r\n\r\nRecently, there have been dramatic developments in error control codes and\r\ndecoding algorithms.  Two families of powerful codes, known as turbo and\r\nlow density parity check (lDPC) codes, have been discovered and rediscovered.\r\nThese two families of codes with iterative decoding have been shown to \r\nperform close to Shannon's theoretical limits with reasonable implementation\r\ncomplexity.  As a result of their amazing error performance and practical\r\nimplementation, it is anticipated that these two classes of codes will have\r\nan enormous impact on virtually all applications of error control coding over\r\nthe next 10 years or so.  This research involves in two important aspects\r\nof these two classes of Shannon limit approaching codes: construction of LDPC \r\ncodes and turbo decoding of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes.  The construction of \r\nLDPC codes is based on combinatoric appraches, such as finite geometries over\r\nfinite fields, statistical experimental designs, permutation groups and\r\ngraphs.  In these approaches, points, lines, hyperplanes in finite geometries, \r\nbalanced incomplete block designs, affine permutation groups, and paths\r\nand independent sets of graphs are used for constructing LDPC codes whose\r\nTanner graphs do not contain short cycles.  All the construction methods\r\nare systematic and codes constructed have good structural properties which\r\nsimplify encoding and decoding implementations.  Turbo decoding of a RS code \r\nis based on binary decomposition of the code into a set of simple binary \r\ncomponent codes and formulating the code as a self concatenated code with the \r\nRS code itself as the outer code and the component codes as inner codes in a \r\nturbo coding arrangement.  The decoding is carried out in two stages, turbo \r\ninner decoding and outer algebraic soft-decision decoding.",
