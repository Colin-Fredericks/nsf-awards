 "awd_abstract_narration": "Philosophical analysis of the nature of space traditionally starts by considering mechanics theories of matter in motion in space - and so contrasts space with matter. Opinion then crudely divides into those -substantivalists - who take space to be a distinct substance from matter and those - relationists - who deny that space has any existence separate from matter. Historically, the dialectic between these two positions has been a fruitful source of innovation in physics; conversely, arguably all the most important thought in the field has paid careful attention to the role played by space in mechanical theories. Contemporary historiography in philosophy of physics holds that central to such thought is the analysis of absolute quantities and structures: e.g., Aristotle's theory held a crucial role for absolute place (namely the center of the universe) and Newtonian mechanics requires an absolute standard of constant motion. Further, many contemporary philosophers hold that theories which demand such absolute structures commit one to substantivalism.\r\n\r\nWhile agreeing with the importance of absolute structures, Dr. Huggett has argued that such an inference to substantivalism is unjustified in Newtonian mechanics - where it is most explicitly articulated - and in mirror symmetry violating quantum theories. He has also written on the nature of absolute structures in Aristotelian physics. This project extends his work to two areas under-investigated in this way. First, Kant argued that the distinction between left and right required absolute space; a modernized argument claims that the topological properties of space are absolute, and exceed the reach of relationism. This project will construct and investigate concrete relationist theories of topology, and consider whether they meet Kant's challenge. Second, contemporary theories of quantum gravity will be studied in the same framework. What absolute structures - if any - do string theory and canonical quantization require, and how do they bear on the substantival-relational issue?\r\n\r\nThe Dr. Huggett proposes to study further theories of topology and quantum gravity and to investigate the role and meaning of the absolute structures they entail. He intends to write a chapter (or paper) on each for a book on the topic currently in progress - his prior work on Newtonian mechanics, mirror symmetry breaking and Aristotle constitute the remainder of this work. The research leave brings the project close to conclusion. The primary goal of the project is to increase understanding in the philosophical and historical community of the nature of space according to physical theories, ancient and modern. More generally, as that understanding is disseminated by the community, the work increases appreciation for the world discovered by physics, ancient and modern, and the role of philosophical considerations in science.\r\n",
