The recent\r\ndiscovery, by Stamler and co-workers, of an S-nitrosylated derivative of hemoglobin (SNO-Hb)\r\nin vivo, and the ongoing elucidation of its biological activities, suggest a means to\r\nevade both such fates. Evidently, the previously unsuspected NO/Hb reaction channel - S-nitrosylation\r\n- can effectively compete with the Hb-Fe(II)-NO and nitrate forming reactions.\r\nMoreover, these studies suggest a dynamical cycle in which the NO-group is alternatively largely\r\nsequestered (Hb-Fe(II)-NO) or made available for delivery (Hb-SNO), in response to the cyclic\r\nvariation in oxygen tension during the arterial/venous transit. The implicated iron-to-sulfur NO-group\r\ntransfer chemistry appears to be linked to the cooperative oxygen delivery function of\r\nHb. The broad aim of this project is to generate experimental results that test these ideas, and\r\nprovide critical observations for further development of the model.\r\n\r\nA direct competition (competitive kinetics) method recently introduced by Gow et al.\r\nwill be utilized to characterize the relative rates of the reactions that occur upon exposure of\r\noxygenated Hb to NO and its congeners. The experiments are designed to detect the dependence\r\nof the relative kinetic behavior on the oxygen-saturation of Hb, and to probe the link between\r\nthis behavior and the allosteric state of Hb. The reaction competition is assessed by detection of\r\nthe heme-iron(II) nitrosyl-Hb, SNO-Hb, Fe(III)-metHb, and nitrate products through EPR\r\n(electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy, UV/VIS spectroscopy, and chemiluminescence\r\ntechniques. The chemical behavior will be characterized over a range of conditions -temperature,\r\npH, CO2 tension, organic phosphate concentration - that: 1) focus on the standard\r\nphysiological conditions relevant to testing the biological significance of the NO/Hb chemical\r\npathways; but also 2) embrace non-physiological conditions that have assumed a standard role in\r\nstudies of Hb allostery.\r\n\r\nExperiments designed to demonstrate that iron(II)-nitrosyl complexes in Hb can serve as\r\na labile, accessible reservoir, rather than a sink of NO-groups (alpha-heme-iron(II) nitrosyls) will\r\nalso be undertaken. EPR and chemiluminescence methods will be utilized to monitor the\r\nmigration of the NO-group during variation of hemoglobin ligation state (oxy, deoxy, met). This\r\nreactive behavior will also be studied under conditions of physiological significance and under\r\nconditions known to affect the allosteric behavior of Hb.",
