 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of opportunities exist for COLLEGE OF MENOMINEE NATION that require further \r\ndevelopment of SMET programs currently offered at the College. To forward its 8,000 \r\nyears of stewardship and expertise in sustainable forest management, the Menominee\r\nNation is committed to ensuring that future generations are prepared as stewards \r\nwell-schooled in sound sciences and best practices in Menominee autochthony. Our\r\nchallenge is to assure that quality in SMET education is commensurate with that \r\nstewardship.\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE OF MENOMINEE NATION will enhance student opportunities in science, math,\r\nengineering and technology through a planning process that will provide assessment \r\nof the SMET infrastructure and the development of an institutional plan to enhance its\r\nSMET program.  The process will also assess the needs of the communities on the \r\nMenominee Reservation, as well as the Oneida, Mohican and Potowatomi Nations and \r\nneighboring non-Indian communities to determine the constellation of SMET programs\r\nthat will promote sustainable development in the communities of northeastern \r\nWisconsin.  In addition, assessment of the current math offerings as a necessary\r\ninterface is a priority.  We envision such an analysis as the key to our delivery \r\nof student research opportunities in eco-toxicology, environmental science and \r\nenvironmental health. \r\n\r\n",
