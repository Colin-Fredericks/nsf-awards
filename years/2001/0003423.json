That study was called Deep Ocean Ventilation Through Antarctic Intermediate Layers (DOVETAIL) and included six components involving hydrographic measurements, natural tracer experiments, and modeling studies.  It was centered east of the Drake Passage where water masses from the Weddell Sea and the Scotia Sea come together in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence, and was carried out in cooperation with the national antarctic programs of Germany and Spain.   The objectives of this continuation are to participate in the international data analysis effort, to construct an integrated regional data base, the organization of a special DOVETAIL journal issue, and the organization of a final scientific workshop.\r\n\tVentilation of the deep ocean -- the rising of sub-surface water masses to the surface to be recharged with atmospheric gases and to give up heat to the atmosphere -- is a uniquely antarctic phenomenon that has significant consequences for global change by affecting the global reservoir of carbon dioxide, and by modulating the amount and extent of seasonal sea ice in the southern hemisphere.\r\n***\r\n",
