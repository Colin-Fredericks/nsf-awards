 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWe propose an equipment grant to enhance ongoing and future lightwave communications and\r\nradar remote sensing research and education at the University of Kansas. The instrumentation\r\nwe propose to acquire includes various lightwave components, a network analyzer, a portable\r\nspectrum analyzer, two arbitrary waveform generators, a high-speed data acquisition system, and\r\na high-speed oscilloscope. The lightwave components includes lasers with integrated electro-absorption\r\nmodulators, high-power erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA), a semiconductor\r\noptical amplifier (SOA), a 35-GHz photo receiver with amplifier, fiber-optic delay lines, optical\r\nsplitters/combiners, an extended DWDM-band tunable laser, and pump laser diodes for a Raman\r\namplifier.\r\nWe propose to use the lightwave equipment to upgrade our 10 Gb/s test beds to 40 Gb/s to\r\nsupport ongoing and future research activities. We will use the high-speed oscilloscope and\r\nspectrum analyzer for testing and calibrating our existing radars as well as the new ones being\r\ndeveloped for glacial ice studies and as prototypes for Mars observation. We will use the\r\narbitrary waveform generators as flexible signal sources to support activities related to ongoing\r\nefforts on the development of a pulse-compression LIDAR and also investigating optimized\r\nwaveforms for various remote sensing applications. We propose to use the network analyzer\r\nprimarily as a dedicated source and receiver for our antenna testing range, which is needed to\r\nsupport our radar development activities.\r\nIn lightwave communications research, the 40 Gb/s per optical channel is the next signaling rate\r\nto be deployed to meet society's insatiable communication needs. Extensive experimental\r\ntesting is required to study and evaluate the many questions critical to the implementation of this\r\nsignaling rate. The proposed upgrades to our testbed will allow us to evaluate the performance\r\nof components, subsystems, and systems at this signaling rate. To launch and then detect\r\n40 Gb/s signals for system evaluation, short-pulse lasers, power dividers and combiners, and\r\nwide-bandwidth photodetectors are needed. In addition, to manage fiber nonlinearities for these\r\nincreased signaling rates, distributed signal amplification with Raman amplifiers will need to be\r\nemployed.\r\nThree ongoing projects in remote sensing will benefit significantly from the proposed test\r\nequipment: (1) measurement of ice thickness and accumulation rate over the Greenland ice sheet;\r\n(2) design and development of a radar prototype for Mars; and (3) design and development of a\r\npulse compression LIDAR for a future satellite mission. The test equipment will allow us to\r\nimprove our existing coherent radar depth sounder for obtaining ice thickness data over a few\r\noutlet glaciers that are thinning and for which no ice thickness data are available. The ice\r\nthickness data are essential to the study of the dynamics of these glaciers. The Mars radar\r\ndevelopment involves design tradeoffs in modulation waveform, frequency, sidelobe levels, and\r\nantenna size. The test equipment will contribute to testing and evaluating an optimized\r\nprototype radar for a future Mars lander or/and orbiter, as well as investigating the use of single-sideband\r\nmodulation techniques to improve the sensitivity of our pulse compression LIDAR.\r\nCurrently 17 graduate students, seven undergraduate students, two post-doctoral research\r\nengineers, and five faculty are involved in the ongoing research projects. We anticipate similar\r\nnumbers of students and research associates to be involved in future lightwave communications\r\nand remote sensing research at this institution. Thus the proposed equipment is a significant\r\ncontribution to the research and education mission of the University of Kansas.",
