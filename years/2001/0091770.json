 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research addresses several main goals within the context of cyclopentadienyl metal complexes. Efficient synthetic methods will be developed for the synthesis of known cyclopentadienyl ligands and complexes as well as new chiral cyclopentadienyl and indenyl metal complexes. Chiral indenyl and cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing tethered donor ligands will be synthesized and coordinated to metals. Finally, the activity of the chiral complexes in enantioselective carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bond forming reactions will be explored. Ligand syntheses will be effected through exploitation of the cross-coupling reactions of 2-bromoindenyl complexes, the ring closing metathesis reaction (yielding indenes from phenyldienes), and the chromium(II)/nickel carbonyl addition method to convert bromoarenes or bromoalkenes and ketones or aldehydes to substituted indenes and cyclopentadienes.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Professor Ronald L. Halterman of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Oklahoma. Professor Halterman's studies are directed toward the synthesis of new catalysts designed to effect the formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds with precise control over the detailed three-dimensional structure (\"stereochemistry\") of the products. These studies, focused largely on the synthesis of new stereochemically defined \"scaffolds\" to support catalytically active metal centers, are of direct relevance to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and polymeric materials, endeavors in which the need for stereochemical control continues to grow.",
