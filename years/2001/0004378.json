The joint study will investigate gene regulation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).  The importance of MHC molecules to the immune response has made them a leading topic in the field of immunology research, and the role of transcription factors, such as the class II transactivator (CIITA), in the induction of the immune response has become a central focus.  The objectives of this project are to use an MHC class II deficient cell line to demonstrate the requirement of the CIITA for class II expression, and to characterize the important binding domains and enzymatic activities associated with other transcription factors. \r\n\r\nThis project offers the potential for broad application of the results in the fields of immunology and medicine.  The U.S. graduate student will have access to expertise and facilities at RIKEN's DNA Bank that will greatly facilitate the research. \r\n\r\n",
