 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Gordon Research Conference on Thin Film and Crystal Growth Mechanisms will be held at Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, July 1-6, 2001. The conference will cover liquid-phase crystal growth, vapor-phase crystal growth, thin film deposition, materials chemistry, and surface physics research. An aim of the conference is to develop strong interactions between these disciplines and emphasize how understanding of fundamental chemical and physical processes can be used to develop novel methods for the growth of nanostructures.\r\nThe program is organized around invited speakers, discussion leaders, a chair, and vice-chair; both contributed papers and posters are scheduled. Special efforts have been made to recruit a diverse group of participants, including foreign and American scientists, younger and older researchers, and industrial, national laboratory and academic researchers. Objectives are to stimulate communications among the broad community of researchers addressing crystal growth from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds--chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science, and to formulate and delineate critical research necessary to further basic understanding. \r\nThe conference is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues in crystal growth. Topics include: Crystal Growth from Solution; Novel Assembly; Organic Thin Films; Fundamentals of Nucleation and Growth; Dynamics of Structure Evolution; and Nanoscale Metals and Silicides. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established between universities, research institutions, and industry.\r\n%%%\r\nAn evaluation of the progress and status of crystal growth research issues along with current assessments of the most important developments will be of significant value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of electronic materials in computing, data processing, and communications. \t \r\n***\r\n",
