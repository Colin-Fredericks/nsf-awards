 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enzyme pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) is most well known as\r\nan enzyme of the C4 photosynthetic pathway where it catalyzes the\r\nformation of PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate), the primary CO2 acceptor\r\nmolecule, from pyruvate. Because it is a key enzyme in the C4 pathway,\r\nPPDK activity is highly regulated so the overall pathway can function\r\noptimally in CO2 assimilation. This regulation is conferred by\r\nreversible phosphorylation of a PPDK active-site threonine, with the\r\nenzyme being inactive in the phosphorylated state. A single bifunctional\r\nprotein kinase/phosphatase enzyme, PPDK regulatory protein (RP),\r\ncatalyzes this regulatory phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. PPDK is\r\nalso present in C3 plants although it does not participate in\r\nphotosynthesis. Further, it is present in all tissues of the plant but\r\nin very low amounts. Its function in C3 plants is essentially unknown,\r\nalthough it is proposed to participate in cellular metabolism and\r\nguard cell function. Recently, it was demonstrated that PPDK in leaves\r\nof C3 plants undergoes light/dark mediated regulatory phosphorylation\r\nsimilar to C4 leaf PPDK.  The major aim of this project is to further\r\ncharacterize C3 plant PPDK regulatory phosphorylation by identifying\r\norgan, tissue, cellular, and subcellular sites of regulatory PPDK\r\nphosphorylation. Further, the C3 RP or RP-like activity mediating\r\nreversible phosphorylation of PPDK in C3 plant tissue will be\r\nscrutinized in vitro for understanding its biochemical nature. Finally,\r\nthis project seeks to clone the gene for C4 PPDK RP from a maize cDNA\r\nlibrary. This will provide the \"ultimate\" tool for resolving the\r\nperplexing riddle of how this uniquely bifunctional enzyme is regulated\r\nin C4 plants, as well as the requisite gene probe for understanding its\r\nprecise expression in C3 and C4 plants. In summary, the experimental\r\noutcomes of this project will enable the hitherto unknown metabolic\r\nfunction(s) of PPDK in C3 plants to be elucidated.\r\n",
