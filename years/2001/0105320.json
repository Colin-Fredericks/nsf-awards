 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ohio State University, Arizona State University and Arizona Public Service Company will undertake a collaborative research effort in a fundamental study on the modeling of power system loads. In the next decades, the power systems of the United States will face bottlenecks of bulk power transfer capabilities because of the virtual absence of new transmission facilities. The increased utilization of the existing\r\nfacilities to cope with growing magnitude of bulk power transfers and third-party access will require a closer look at system dynamic performance. Accurate power system models are needed for accurate study of system dynamic performance. The motivation is to make load modeling accuracy commensurate with generation and system modeling accuracy.\r\n\r\n The main theme of this project is to utilize the advanced system identification concepts developed for generator parameter estimation and generator modeling for power system load modeling. Features of the load modeling include: automatic updating of the model, utilization of an artificial neural network model, and work with actual industrial data throughout the project. If successful, the work would be a major advance in the automated load modeling of power system loads as well as a significant increase in system modeling accuracy for dynamic studies. Therefore, the economic impact of the proposed research is significant in permitting operation of power systems closer to the stability limit by increasing the transfer capabilities and postponing the need for new construction.",
