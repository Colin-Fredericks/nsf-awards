The primary objective of this project is to develop new laboratory experiments that utilize a series of chemical processes and analytical techniques that are not traditionally covered in chemical engineering and/or chemistry curricula, but that are commonly encountered in industry. Using chemicals derived from food grade raw materials, intrinsically safe new laboratory experiments are being created for chemical engineering and chemistry courses. Laboratory modules based on each step of the olive oil manufacturing process are being developed. These modules range in complexity from fundamental engineering and science principles shown in gravity decantation of immiscible liquids to more complex principles required to describe filtration theory. Within these experiments, students are relating product qualities of flavor and aroma with chemical components. Advanced technology is being integrated into the project by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography to identify these compounds. The biomedical focus of these laboratories is to identify and quantify the presence of oleic and linoleic acids. Students conducting these laboratories are developing high level thinking skills by identifying the relationship between process variables and the resulting oil properties. \r\n\r\n",
