 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Dr. Roger Leblanc of the University of Miami is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemsitry Program.   The research focuses on the development of surfaces, based on Langmuir-Blodgett techniques, which have high specificity for target biomolecules, and would be used for sensor development.  The research is multi-disciplinary and will include the areas of synthesis, interfacial chemistry and analytical chemistry (sensor development and characterization).  The key qoals of the project are 1) synthesis of a lipid/organic monolayer at the water/air interface using combinatorial chemistry, 2) determine the monolayer  specificity toward target biomolecules, 3) determine whether the specificity of the monolayer be enhanced by using target templates during the synthesis, and 4) use the sensor with actual biological systems. \r\n\r\nThis is a novel research proposal at the frontier of biosensor development.  It has a degree of risk, however, the investigator makes a concerted effort to address the potential problems.  The potential for involvement of minority students is high.  The impact of this research will be felt in the areas of combinatorial synthesis, biochemistry, surface chemistry and sensor development.  In the future, there is potential for societal impact if sensor applications develop in biological systems.",
