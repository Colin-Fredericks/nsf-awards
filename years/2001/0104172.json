 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the travel, housing and registration costs of 18 students who would not otherwise be able to attend the 5th International Conference on Autonomous Agents (Agents 2001) to be held in Montreal, Canada, May 28- June 1, 2001. This conference is the premier conference on agent technology and will have associated with it many tutorials, workshops and other events given by leading researchers in this field. One valuable part of student training is participation in the excitement of an international conference where major researchers present their work and engage one another in dialogue. The goal of this proposal is to enable students who are deserving but may not have the financial resources available to attend. A committee of senior agents researchers and conference organizers has been formed to select students based on the following criteria: 1) those presenting papers or software systems; 2) those presenting in workshops or other associated conference forums; 3) those demonstrating financial need; and 4) new students to the area demonstrating benefit from attendance.",
