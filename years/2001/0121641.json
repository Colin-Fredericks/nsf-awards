 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will develop algorithms and systems enabling people\r\nto query and communicate a synthesized record of\r\nhuman experiences derived from individual perspectives captured\r\nduring selected personal and group activities. For this research,\r\nan experience is defined through what you see, what you hear,\r\nwhere you are, and associated sensor data and electronic communications.\r\nThe research will transform this record into a meaningful, accessible\r\ninformation resource, available contemporaneously and retrospectively.\r\nWe will validate our vision with two societally relevant applications:\r\n(1) providing memory aids as a personal prosthetic or behavioral\r\nmonitor for the elderly; and (2) coordinating emergency response\r\nactivity in disaster scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis project assumes that within ten years technology will be capable\r\nof creating a continuously recorded, digital, high fidelity record of\r\na person's activities and observations in video form.  This research\r\nwill prototype personal experience capture units to record audio, video,\r\nlocation and sensory data, and electronic communications. Each constituent\r\nunit captures, manages, secures and associates information from\r\nits unique point of view. Each operates as a portable, interoperable,\r\ninformation system, allowing search and retrieval by both its\r\nhuman operator and remote collaborating systems. An individual\r\ncannot see everything, nor remember everything that was seen or\r\nheard. The integration of multiple points of view provides more\r\ncomprehensive coverage of an event, especially when coupled with support\r\nfor vastly improving the memory from each perspective.  The research thus\r\nenables the following technological advances:\r\n\r\n* Enhanced memory for individuals from an intelligent assistant using an\r\nautomatically analyzed and fully indexed archive of captured personal\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n* Coordination of distributed group activity, such as management of an\r\nemergency response team in a disaster relief situation, utilizing multiple\r\nsynchronized streams of incoming observation data to construct a \"collective\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\n* Expertise synthesized across individuals and maintained over generations,\r\nretrieved and summarized on demand to enable example-based training and\r\nretrospective analysis.\r\n\r\n* Understanding of privacy, security and other societal implications of\r\nubiquitous experience collection.\r\n\r\nThe foundation for this work, the Informedia Digital Video Library,\r\nhas demonstrated the successful application of speech, image, and\r\nnatural language processing in automatically creating a rich, indexed,\r\nsearchable multimedia information resource for broadcast-quality video.\r\nThe proposed work builds from these technologies, moving well beyond\r\na digital video library into new information spaces composed of\r\nunedited personal experience video augmented with additional sensory\r\nand position data. Tools will be created to analyze large amounts\r\nof continuously captured digital experience data in order to extract\r\nsalient features, describe scenes and characterize events. The\r\nresearch will address summarization and collaboration of multiple\r\nsimultaneous experiences integrated across time, space and people.",
