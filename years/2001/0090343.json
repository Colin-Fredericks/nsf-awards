 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cognitive performance degrades with residence in Antarctica and mood alteration fits a seasonal change during extended residence in Antarctica. Although these changes suggest psychological response to certain physiological adaptations to cold and dim light, the exact mechanism linking these two sets of processes are poorly understood. This project has two objectives. The first is to determine whether long-term exposure to cold temperatures and/or to dim light, both of which are characteristics of polar winters in high latitude environments, are associated with significant changes in cognitive performance and emotional well-being. The specific aim is to determine whether physiological adaptation to cold, reflected in measures of core body temperature and thyroid hormone levels, and/or adaptation to dim light, reflected in measures of melatonin production, are independently or synergistically associated with decrements in cognitive performance and emotional well- being. An additional goal is to determine whether personnel at South Pole Station (latitude 90o S) experience greater physiological adaptation to cold and dim light and decrements in mood and cognitive performance than personnel at McMurdo Station (Latitude 77o 51' S) The second objective is to determine whether decrements to mood and cognitive performance can be effectively prevented or minimized. The project will involve the development of a management and informational infrastructure for the integration of research activities on the etiology and prevention of environmentally induced performance decrements in high latitudes. The project will involve graduate level training in human adaptation to polar environments. This project will lead to an improved understanding of the specific environmental conditions and physiological mechanisms that affect behavior and performance in the Antarctic and other high latitude environments.",
