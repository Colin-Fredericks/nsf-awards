Burghardt, Northwestern University\r\n\r\nThis is one of two identical proposals submitted by Northwestern University and Washington University.  A combined experimental and computational study is proposed to examine the entangled polymers in a time-dependent inhomogeneous flow generated by periodic forcing of a viscoelastic fluid past an axisymmetric stagnation point.  This is a collaborative effort between Wesley Burghardt of Northwestern University and Bamin Khomami of Washington University with the experimental part carried out in the former institution while the computational part in the latter institution.  These two investigators have collaborated successfully in an earlier study, with NSF support, of steady axisymmetric stagnation flow of viscoelastic fluids.  They are proposing to extend their work to time-dependent flows in order to test the best molecular rheological models in more complex flow situations.\r\n",
