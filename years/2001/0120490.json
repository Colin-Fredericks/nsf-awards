The Ship Acquisition and Upgrade Program provides funds for ship constructions, upgrades, acquisitions, and design studies. \r\n\r\nThis project will allow the PI to begin a conceptual design study for a deep submergence vehicle that may eventually replace the aging deep submergence vehicle (DSV) Alvin.  A submersible capable of operating to depths greater than 6000 meters would provide US scientists access to an additional 35% of the ocean floor to carryout studies pertaining to biodiversity, biomass, and processes at work on the abyssal plain and in deep sea trenches.  The study will include a detailed evaluation of new technology and hardware options.  Other countries, such as France, Japan, and Russia, already have manned submersibles capable of operating to this depth.\r\n\r\nThe Project Director, Barrie Walden is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in supervising the DSV Alvin, and other submersibles through his management of the DSF. ***\r\n\r\n",
