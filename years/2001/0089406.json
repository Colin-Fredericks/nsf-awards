The materials include two standard course modules and two case studies. These are pilot tested at the developing institution and at a number of other institutions over a two year period. A prospectus is developed for a textbook that treats event driven programming from a computer science perspective and helps to provide computer science graduates with a better understanding of the event driven paradigm and its application.\r\n\r\nEvent driven programming is becoming a significant factor in the design of new information and industrial systems and in integrating legacy systems with interactive technologies. Future graduates of computer science programs need to have a strong technical and conceptual background in event driven programming, and computer science faculty need to be able to teach these techniques and concepts effectively. The project includes professional development for computer science faculty, through tutorials at national and international conferences and through dissemination on the Web, to gain familiarity with event driven programming and its importance in the CS curriculum. \r\n\r\n",
