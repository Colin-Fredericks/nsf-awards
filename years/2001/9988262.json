 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concentrates on design of low-energy application-specific datapaths, low-energy schedules, and design tradeoffs with respect to number of datapaths, level of pipelining and scheduling approaches. Applications are to datapath design for low-energy implementation of digital signal processing and cryptography systems using programmable digital signal processors. A VLIW (very long instruction word) type programmable DSP (PDSP) is assumed. In such a PDSP, different datapaths can be independently activated through the VLIW instruction word. This research seeks modifications of datapaths in existing PDSP and design of new datapaths that do not exist in current PDSPs for low power implementations. The emphasis here is on simultaneous datapath and scheduling or software co-selection. It is important not only to design the best datapaths but also to design best scheduling approaches to reduce switching activity in the datapaths to reduce energy consumption. In the context of fixed and adaptive FIR digital filters and equalizers, the goal is to find datapaths which are best suited to transpose-form FIR filters, to use strength-reduced parallel structures to reduce the number of clock cycles and to perform scheduling by switching activity. In RLS adaptive filters for space-time adaptive processing and multi-user detection problems in wireless communications, a hierarchical scheduling approach is being explored. Here a globally parallel locally sequential partitioning approach is adopted where each partition is mapped to a distinct CORDIC datapath. Within each partition Givens' rotation operations are scheduled to reduce switching activity. In elliptic cryptosystem design, the goal is to reduce energy consumption by appropriate hardware-software codesign and parametric tradeoff analysis. \r\n\r\n",
