 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advance of high-speed deep-submicron VLSI technology requires chip\r\ninterconnect and packaging to be modeled by distributed circuits. Such a\r\ndetailed modeling level eventually results in large scale linear circuits to\r\nbe analyzed. Thus, the research objective is to develop new circuit order\r\nreduction approach to evaluate the circuit performance and characteristics\r\nin a reasonable time period and with a guaranteed performance, as required\r\nby real design practice.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the following tasks:\r\na) Develop new order reduction approaches that provide guaranteed performance;\r\nb) Derive correspondingly high efficiency numerical methods;\r\nc) Investigate the methods of maintaining preferred characteristics in the\r\nreduced order system as well as related implementation issues;\r\nd) Investigate wavelet method application in model order reduction and\r\nanalysis; and\r\ne) Contribute to graduate education at UT- Dallas and UNC-Charlotte.\r\n\r\nThe expected research results will provide efficient and performance\r\nguaranteed methods for order reduction and analysis of VLSI interconnect\r\ncircuits, and their corresponding algorithms and software for simulation\r\ntest.  It will also contribute to engineering and science aspects by the\r\nexpected research results and software, as well as to graduate education.\r\n",
