The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0179).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include Montana State University (Lead Institution), AdvR, Inc., Tektronix, Inc., Scientific Materials Corporation, IBM Almaden Research Center, ILX Lightwave Corporation, MSU Techlink Center, Gallatin Development Corporation, and Montana Board of Research and Commercialization Technology.\r\n\r\nProposed Activities\r\nThe partners will collaborate to develop the requisite technology and to incorporate it into various operational optical communications and computing systems.  The Lead Institution will do fundamental research and transfer the results to the partner companies.  Two companies will assist in the development of the technologies based on the research results.  Two of the partner companies will provide insertion platforms into systems level products.  One company will provide fabrication facilities for the products.  The not-for-profit partners will ensure a pro-business climate for establishment of new small and medium-sized companies.  The state partner will provide funds when needed to promote the development and commercialization of promising technologies.  This effort builds upon a new state-funded center for optoelectronics, named the Spectral Information Technologies Laboratory.  The charter of the laboratory includes the directive to perform transfer of technology that results form basic research on optics.\r\n\r\nProposed Innovation\r\nThe consortium of companies, university, and public partners cover the entire chain from research to development, to insertion, to fabrication to development of business opportunities, to funding for formation of companies necessary to transform new research into commercial activities.  The optical technologies covered will have a large role in the future of information technologies that underlie the current innovation economy of the last ten years.  \r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nMontana's economy is currently in the bottom 10% nationally.  The population of the state is below 750,000.  Creation of 2000 new high-tech jobs in the state will have a major impact.\r\n\r\nPotential Societal Impact\r\nThe proposed activity will use the research and education of the state university system to promote new high-paying jobs for bright Montana citizens.  Heretofore, most university graduates had very limited opportunity for jobs in the state, making the state a net exporter of highly educated talent.  The resulting income will raise the economic wellbeing for the entire state.\r\n\r\n",
