 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \rThe goal of this project is to enhance the quality and effectiveness of undergraduate instruction and training by incorporating gas chromatography-ion-trap mass spectrometry into the chemistry curriculum at the institution, using experiments adapted from standard literature. With the addition of a single instrument, the chemistry faculty is able to effectively educate students in the fundamental applications of mass spectrometry, mass spectral interpretation, and \"multidimensional\" analytical methods such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. In addition, thermochemical concepts are taught in the Physical Chemistry Laboratory in an entirely new and easily understood way. The addition of the GC-ITMS allows the merging of widely applied and relevant scientific instrumentation and technology with chemical education and training. The courses affected are Instrumental Methods for Chemical Analysis, Physical Chemistry Laboratory and Independent Study and Research. The incorporation of GC-ITMS into the curriculum also provides invaluable opportunities for faculty development and improvement through the design and implementation of new exercises that revolve around bench-top mass spectrometry as a teaching tool.\r\n\r\n",
