 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor William Simpson of the University of Alaska is funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry and Atmospheric Chemistry programs to perform experimental laboratory and field studies using the ultrasensitive method, cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS).  This CAREER proposal seeks to combine instrument development aspects with educational aspects, with the goal of introducing sensitive methods for atmospheric field study of the Alaskan troposphere.  Oxidation by nitrates, profiles of methane using near-IR CRDS and photochemistry of organic nitrates are the topics of interest.  The PI has a joint appointment at the Geophysical Institute and the Chemistry Department at the University of Alaska.   \r\n\r\nInstrument development for ultrasensitive atmospheric measurements is needed as our understanding of the atmosphere is refined.  This information is required for accurate modeling and prediction of global climate changes.  Methods such as cavity ring down spectroscopy, developed within the physical chemistry program, should be exploited to the maximum extent possible for these applications.   However, further work is needed to understand the limits of these methods in terms of spectral congestion, interferences, etc.   Professor Simpson's educational efforts include outreach to Native American students in the Fairbanks area.  His education plan incorporates the development of visual exercises for physical chemistry laboratory classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
