Each student is receiving a scholarship and participating in activities such as mentor relationships, co-op experiences, interview skills workshops, and a SWMET Scholars Club. The program is also developing a dynamic web page that is not only a storehouse for information; but also a clearinghouse for necessary program communications for students, faculty, and administrators involved in the program. The SWMET Club uses graduates of the SWMET Club to serve as mentors immediately upon graduation. These mentors, who have entered the workforce, represent their new employers, serving to strengthen relationships with area businesses. Area business and industry representatives are also serving in an advisory capacity.",
