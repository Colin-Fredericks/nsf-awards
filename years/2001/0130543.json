Objectives of this study are to (1) reconstruct pathways of invasions, from potential sources in the Caspian and Black Sea region to North America, (2) clarify genetic (evolutionary) relationships among sibling species and identify which subspecies are invasive, and (3) describe genetic traits of the invasive subspecies.  Using genetic markers, a genealogy (phylogeny) will be constructed to determine pathways of invasions and genetic relationships among physiological races of zebra mussels.  For this purpose, sensitive genetic markers (AFLPs) and powerful data analysis software (Dominant Marker Analysis Package) are currently under development.  This project will also involve collaborative efforts with scientists at the Russian Academy of Sciences, including a joint research cruise on the Caspian Sea to collect from sites where the zebra mussel species complex has probably evolved.\r\n\r\nThe zebra mussel ranks among the most hazardous exotic species that has entered North American waters, with an economic impact in the billions of dollars.  Despite intense ecological interest and efforts toward mitigation, little effort has been devoted toward understanding genetic and physiological mechanisms of zebra mussel invasions.  We do not know origins of North American populations, their genetic traits, and why they are so successful as invaders.  Information from this project will enhance our predictive power on range expansion and adaptive potential during invasions.  In addition,  as pathways of invasions tend to be shared by multiple species, information from this project will yield insight into general principles on mechanisms of invasions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
