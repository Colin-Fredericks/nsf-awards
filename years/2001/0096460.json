 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0096460\r\n\r\nSequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean by nutrient additions as well as  direct deep ocean injection of CO2 remains an active and controversial area of scientific  discussion and research.  Multiple scientific experiments have successfully demonstrated the efficacy of  short-term, small scale iron additions to spur phytoplankton growth. At least four  industries are now studying the feasibility of larger scale commercial operations  ostensibly to increase fish production and potential carbon trading programs in the future.  Presently there are no scientific or legal protocols to provide oversight to these operations  and guidance for the public to assess these commercial scientific ventures.\r\n\r\nWith support from this grant, the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) will convene a two-day workshop in the Spring of 2001 to define  the scientific and legal uncertainties surrounding C sequestration in the ocean. The  proceedings from the workshop will be published in a peer- journal. In  addition, the workshop will help form the issues and rationale for a larger symposium on  ocean carbon sequestration at some future time.\r\n\r\nASLO is well suited to conduct this workshop. The Society conducted one of the  first scientific symposia on Fe limitation of primary production in the ocean and the  proceedings were published in a special issue of Limnology and Oceanography, the societal journal, in 1992.  In addition, the Council of Environmental Challenges at MIT (an alliance of  academic and industry scientists) will co-host the workshop and provide logistical  support. The final agenda, however, will be determined by an independent steering  committee.  \r\n\r\n",
