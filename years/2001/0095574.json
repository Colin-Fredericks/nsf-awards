 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIndustrial sectors are continually evolving in terms of the variety of products they offer, the mix\r\nof their active producers, the prices these producers charge, and their productive efficiency. Using\r\nplant-level panel data from developing countries, this project characterizes the way that these\r\nevolutionary processes respond to trade policy reforms and to changes in the exchange rate\r\nregime. The analysis is based on structural models of industrial evolution that highlight producer\r\nheterogeneity, firm-specific productivity shocks, new firms' start-up costs, and uncertainty about\r\nthe future. By moving away from representative plant analysis, the project captures many micro\r\nfeatures of industrial sector responses that the existing trade literature misses.\r\n\r\nThe basic model used in this project quantifies an industry's dynamic response to changes in the\r\nintensity of import competition. It characterizes the time paths of firm-level capital gains and\r\nlosses, entry and exit patterns, price-cost mark-ups, job creation and destruction, average\r\nproductivity, productivity dispersion, and the menu of product varieties available to consumers.\r\nGeneralizations of the basic model are also analyzed. These allow firms to export some of their\r\noutput when it is profitable for them to do so, and/or to make investments that expand their\r\ncapacity or imperfectly control their productivity shocks. The generalized models address\r\nadditional issues, including the question of how import competition or exporting opportunities\r\nmight induce or discourage investment and productivity growth. All versions of the model\r\nquantify the role of expectations and policy credibility in shaping responses to policy reforms.\r\n\r\nThe models are econometrically fit to large data sets that the principal investigators have acquired\r\nfrom Colombia, Morocco, and Taiwan. For each country, these multi-year data sets contain\r\ndetailed plant- or firm-level information on sales revenues and input costs. Augmented by data on\r\ntariffs, the exchange rate, and the total value of imports, this cost and revenue information\r\nsupports estimation of the basic model. For the extended models, data on export revenues and on\r\nproductivity-enhancing expenditures (like fixed investment, worker training and technician\r\nsalaries) are also used.\r\n\r\nThe methodological contribution of the project is to adapt applied industrial evolution models to\r\nan open economy setting, and to implement these models using available micro data. In so doing\r\nthe project breaks new ground concerning the measurement of sunk start-up costs and firm-specific\r\nproductivity trajectories. The project also facilitates policy debates by quantifying many\r\ndimensions of industrial responses to policy reforms in a single integrated framework. The\r\nconsequences of commercial policy reforms that are of interest to business and labor (changes in\r\nprofitability, capital gains or losses, and job creation or job destruction) are measured and\r\ncompared to the consequences of interest to consumers (changes in prices and the available menu\r\nof product varieties).",
