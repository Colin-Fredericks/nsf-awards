 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for DMS - 0100782\r\n\r\n(1) What is the distribution of the eigenvalues of a\r\nrandom matrix, with certain symmetry conditions to\r\nguarantee the reality of the spectrum? What happens to\r\nthe distribution, when the size of the matrix gets\r\nlarge? What about universality in the limit?\r\n(2) What is the statistics of the length of the\r\nlongest increasing sequence in random permutation or\r\nrandom words (Ulam's problem). This question applies\r\nto models of interface growth, polymers in random\r\nenvironments, first passage percolation problem, and\r\n \"dimer\" configurations.\r\n(3) Integrals over groups  and symmetric spaces, (or\r\nover their tangent spaces) lead to a variety of\r\ninteresting matrix models. The coefficients of the\r\n(perturbative) expansions have striking combinatorial\r\nor topological significance and can be computed in a\r\nrecursive way. This work originates in the works of\r\nFeynman, 't Hooft, Bessis-Itzykson-Zuber and Witten,\r\nin the context of string theory.\r\n(4) The sample canonical correlation coefficients\r\n(maximum likelihood estimates) for the canonical\r\ncorrelation coefficients of two Gaussian populations\r\nare the test statistic for the statistical\r\nindependence of the two populations, as studied by\r\nHotelling, James and Constantine.\r\n(5) The four problems above and their\r\n\"time\"-perturbations are all solutions to integrable\r\nequations or lattices. For large random matrices or\r\npermutations, they are solutions to the Korteweg-de\r\nVries equation. In the finite case, they are solutions\r\nto the Toda lattice, and to two new integrable\r\nlattices, the Pfaff and Toeplitz lattices.\r\n%Besides matrix integrals solutions, these lattices\r\n%have interesting rational solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is fair to say that matrix integrals point the way\r\nto new integrable systems, but also to new\r\ncombinatorial and probabilistic questions !\r\nGeneral description: The problems above\r\nrelate to a number of important questions in physics,\r\nengineering and statistics:\r\nProblem (1) has its origin in the study of energy\r\nlevels (excitation spectra) of heavy nuclei in nuclear\r\nphysics (Wigner, Dyson). These levels are so intricate\r\nthat any explicit description would be intractable.\r\nFor that reason, Wigner proposed a statistical model\r\nfor these energy levels. Concerning problem (2), \r\nit is well known that a large percentage of computer \r\ntime is devoted to the rearrangement of the data used \r\nin the course of computations. How many data, after a \r\ncomplete reshuffling, are statistically still in order? \r\nThis question of random permutations also applies to\r\nstatistical mechanics, the basis of thermodynamics,\r\nand to questions of polymers. Some of the matrix \r\nmodels (3) provide toy models for string theory, \r\nan important set of ideas at the basis of the \r\nfundamental interactions in the physical world.\r\nIt turns out that certain matrix models, mentioned\r\nabove, are used in testing whether two sets of\r\nstatistical data are correlated, as sketched in (4).\r\nThe Korteweg-de Vries equation, the arch-type\r\n``soliton equation\", describes the propagation of\r\nwaves in shallow water; a similar non-linear partial\r\ndifferential equation governs the propagation of\r\nultra-short pulses in optical fibers, when the wave\r\nlength is long compared to the diameter of the fiber.\r\n",
