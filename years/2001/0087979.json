 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing - Other (35) \rThe interdisciplinary field of computational science combines simulation, visualization,\r\nmathematical modeling, programming, data structures, networking, database design, symbolic\r\ncomputation, and high performance computing with various scientific disciplines. Despite the\r\nshortage of computational scientists, a 1998 survey found only two undergraduate special degree\r\nprograms and 15 undergraduate courses in the field. Unfortunately, few computational science\r\ntextbooks are appropriate for undergraduate science students.\r\nAfter extensive discussions on enhancing computer use in the sciences, Wofford College\r\nfaculty members designed a curriculum for students majoring in science or mathematics, called\r\n\"Emphasis in Computational Science.\" A student electing this program will complete a science\r\nmajor, two existing courses (Programming in C++, Data Structures), two new computational\r\nscience courses (Scientific Programming, Data and Visualization), and a summer internship.\r\nThis project will create, evaluate, improve, and expand undergraduate computational\r\nscience course modules that are rich in applications. These materials will be developed in\r\ncollaboration with scientists and will be tested and evaluated at several institutions. With\r\ndissemination over the World Wide Web, the modules will instruct and provide applications that\r\nmany institutions can use in a variety of courses. The project will provide the materials and will\r\nbe a catalyst for improving undergraduate computational science education nationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
