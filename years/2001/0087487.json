 "awd_abstract_narration": "Toward building large-scale switches, the current industry focus is on increasing packet handling\r\ncapacities of switch fabrics from Gb/s to Tb/s. Although an increase in packet handling\r\ncapacities and line card data rates requires a corresponding increase in call handling capacities of\r\nswitches, this problem has received little attention. This is because most of the work on scalability\r\nof packet switch fabrics has targeted connectionless internet protocol (IP) routers, while call handling\r\narises only in connection-oriented networks. However, in the last few years, resource reservation\r\nto support Quality-of-Service (QoS) guaranteed flows has gained attention. Internet\r\nEngineering Task Force (IETF) is addressing this issue by augmenting IP routers with connection-oriented\r\ncapabilities.\r\n     In a connection-oriented network, the signaling protocol that is used to set up and release connections\r\nimpacts its call handling capacity. Signaling messages can be complex with many parameters\r\nand timers and the state information associated with calls can become unwieldy.\r\nConsequently, signaling protocols have traditionally been implemented in software. QoS control\r\nsolutions are being developed and evaluated based on the premise that call handling capacities do\r\nnot scale with the packet handling capacities of switch fabrics. This assumption regarding call\r\nhandling capacities has also relegated circuit-switched networks, including high-speed Wave-length\r\nDivision Multiplexed networks, to just serve as wires. This proposal challenges this basic\r\nassumption by demonstrating call handling capacities in the order of millions of calls/sec. Changing\r\nthis basic assumption regarding call handling capacities would indeed have a far-reaching\r\nimpact on both QoS control mechanisms for packet-switched networks, and on the use of emerging\r\nhigh-speed circuit-switched networks for challenging new applications.\r\n     Our solution approach is to implement signaling protocols in reconfigurable Field Programmable\r\nGate Array (FPGA) hardware. FPGAs can be reprogrammed as signaling protocols evolve\r\nwhile significantly improving the call handling capacities relative to software implementation. To\r\nmanage complexity, we propose to implement the basic and frequently-used operations of the protocol\r\nin hardware, and relegate the complex and infrequently-used operations to software. In contrast\r\nto stateless protocols, signaling protocols maintain state information for each call. To\r\nmanage associated memory requirements, we propose to maintain only the essential state information\r\nfor each call in hardware. In this project we propose to (i) implement a typical signaling\r\nprotocol in FPGAs, (ii) design a switch controller board using the signaling protocol FPGAs, and\r\n(iii) quantify measures of the implementation to demonstrate achievable call handling capacities.",
