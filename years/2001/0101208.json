This extends the theory of bifurcation in generic\r\nfamilies of dynamical systems to those with two time scales.\r\nEmphasis is placed upon relaxation oscillations, periodic orbits\r\nthat have both slow and fast segments.  The initial stages of the\r\nwork seek a classification of degenerate decompositions appearing\r\nin periodic orbits of one parameter families with relaxation\r\noscillations.  Geometric methods are used to determine\r\nbifurcations associated with each degenerate decomposition.\r\nNumerical investigation of examples is used to motivate the work\r\nand to ensure that the results are directly applicable to\r\nbiological models.  Together with collaborators Kathleen Hoffman\r\nand Warren Weckesser, the investigator is reexamining a classical\r\nexample, the forced van der Pol system that gave birth to the\r\ndiscovery of chaos for dissipative dynamical systems, and expects\r\nto give a full description of the bifurcations that occur within\r\nthis system.  He also develops algorithms for the computation of\r\nstructures that are difficult to compute with existing methods.\r\n     Rhythmic phenomena are ubiquitous in biological systems.\r\nExamples include the heartbeat, the cell cycle, circadian\r\nrhythms, legged locomotion, and electrical signals in the nervous\r\nsystem.  Most of these involve multiple time scales.  The\r\ninvestigator pursues new mathematical theory and computational\r\nmethods that apply to dynamical systems with multiple time\r\nscales.  Emphasis is given to models of neural systems, an area\r\nin which the presence and importance of complex dynamics are\r\nmanifest.  The investigations draw upon decades of research in\r\ncharacterizing generic phenomena observed in dynamical systems\r\nwith a single time scale.  The resulting body of mathematics,\r\nsometimes called chaos theory, needs extension and modification\r\nto fully explain the behavior of systems with multiple time\r\nscales.  Those extensions are the goal of this project.  On a\r\nlonger time frame, the project lays foundations for coming\r\ngenerations of biological models for cellular processes such as\r\ngene expression and signal transduction.  New biotechnology leads\r\nto ever more complicated reaction networks that are simulated as\r\ndynamical systems.  This project produces results that aid the\r\nimplementation and interpretation of such simulations of complex,\r\nmultiple time scale dynamical systems.\r\n\r\n",
