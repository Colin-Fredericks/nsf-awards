 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, auction theory has been asked to provide guidance to\r\npolicymakers in several important areas, including spectrum auctions,\r\nelectricity auctions, and Treasury auctions. Unfortunately, the received\r\ntheory had largely focused on auctions of a single object, and so had little\r\nto rigorously say about the most empirically relevant auction problems.\r\nRecent research by economists has begun to expand the boundaries of auction\r\ntheory and analysis so as to encompass multiple-item auctions. In prior\r\nwork, we have analyzed the theoretical properties of existing multiple-item\r\nauction formats, proposed new efficient auction formats for multiple items,\r\nproposed new applications for multiple-item auctions, and empirically\r\nevaluated recent applications of auctions for spectrum and electricity. This\r\nproject builds upon this recent work, by examining the following topics:\r\n* Development of the properties of a new, efficient ascending auction for\r\nheterogeneous commodities.\r\n* Understanding the theoretical underpinnings for efficient ascending\r\nauctions.\r\n* Analysis of auctions for heterogeneous commodities in environments with\r\ninterdependent values.\r\n* Study of auction theory with agency problems.\r\n* Use of the reserve price in mitigating the exercise of market power.\r\n* New applications for multiple-item auction designs.\r\n* Empirical analysis of the European 3G spectrum auctions.\r\nThe project includes a balance between further theoretical developments of\r\nmultiple-item auctions, and practical applications and empirical testing of\r\nthe ideas of auction theory.\r\n\r\n",
