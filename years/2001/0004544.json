These proteins are derived from the recombinant soluble core of cytochrome b5, expressed in E. coli from a synthetic gene.  The adsorption behavior of these proteins is tailored by conservative mutations of surface glutamic-acid and aspartic-acid residues.  The work explores the competitive equilibrium adsorption behavior of mixtures of these proteins of similar size but differing adsorption affinities.  Nonporous adsorbents are used for the initial equilibrium work to avoid complications from dynamical/transport effects which are investigated separately.  A shallow-bed, rapid-filtration technique is  used to observe adsorption, desorption, and displacement dynamics on a short time scale.  Specific topics being addressed include the effects of competitors on adsorption heterogeneity and adsorbent selectivity among proteins. \r\n\r\nRecombinant pharmaceutical proteins now make a substantial contribution to health care.  Examples include insulin for treatment of diabetes, tPA for unblocking coronary arteries in heart attacks, and new, effective medicines for anemia, hemophilia, and breast cancer.  The production of recombinant proteins generally consists of two stages, cultivation of bacteria or mammalian cells and then purification of the desired product from the complex mixture produced by the cells.  Protein purification is the more expensive stage and is the subject of intense research interest and commercial development.  This work addresses the fundamental behavior underlying the performance of the most widely-used purification method, selective adsorption of contaminants onto charged particles in ion-exchange chromatography.  The particular focus is the competitive adsorption of proteins - how the presence of contaminants can alter the adsorption behavior of a desired product.  This competition among proteins, which is essential to separating the mixture, is relatively little-investigated and poorly understood. Better understanding of these mechanisms will lead to better separation technologies and thus to higher-quality, lower-cost medical products. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
