Weertman\r\nNorthwestern U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract for NSF Proposal 0119281\r\n\r\nRequest for Travel Grant for Graduate Students to Attend a Conference on the Structure and Mechanical Properties of Nanostructured Materials\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funds to support 5 graduate students to attend a United Engineering Foundation Conference.  The title of the conference is Structure and Mechanical Properties of Nanostructured Materials:  Promoting a Synergy Among Computer Simulations, Experiments and Theory.    The students will be paired with an equal number of prominent senior attendees.  The graduate students will thus not only increase their professional and scientific education by attending an international conference on their thesis subject but also begin to network with leaders in their field. The scholarship offer would be limited to US citizens and permanent residents, and special consideration will be given to increase the diversity of the awardees to include women and underrepresented minorities. \r\n\r\n",
