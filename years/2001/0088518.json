 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to enhance the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at the institution by incorporating high resolution, computer-controlled ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectroscopy into three upper-level laboratory courses: Instrumental Analysis, Inorganic Synthesis, and Experimental Physical Chemistry. This is accomplished by adapting several new or classic laboratory experiments from the chemical education literature for use with the computerized Cary-14 and implementing them into the three formal laboratory courses currently taught by the Chemistry Department. The proposed experiments and instrumentation enhance the students' critical thinking skills, increase their familiarity with a wide variety of computerized equipment, and expose them to the scientific process of inquiry through investigation. As a result of this formal change in curricula, the students are better prepared to participate in independent research. The institution is a comprehensive, urban, commuter campus with an ethnically diverse student population and the chemistry department reflects that diversity. \r\n\r\nFunding provides an Aviv Instruments modernization of the current Cary-14 spectrophotometer including a thermoelectrically cooled heater in the cell housing, and release time for the PI and co-PIs to implement and adapt experiments for the Cary-14 and our laboratory courses. This project is for a duration of 33 months, as much of the first year is devoted to the instrument modernization and initial development of the laboratory experiments. These experiments are introduced into the formal laboratory courses in the second year of the grant, then evaluated, revised and reintroduced in the final year. The anticipated outcomes of this proposal include: 1) improved undergraduate laboratory experiments; 2) decreased time for data acquisition; 3) increased time for data interpretation and analysis; 4) increased understanding of digital data acquisition; 5) increased variety and quality of laboratory experiments; 6) increased hands-on-time for each student; and 7) integration of digital methods-instrumental output as well as Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint-into the reporting of experimental results. This project significantly improves the preparedness of our majors for research and future employment in academics and industry. Dissemination of results is accomplished through a web site linked to the chemistry department home page, publication in referred chemical education journals, and presentation at regional and national meetings.",
