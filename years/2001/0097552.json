 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systematics and evolution are central concepts in biological\r\ndisciplines.  Knowledge of the manner in which species are related to each\r\nother and the mechanisms by which they become distributed across the globe\r\nprovide a framework (in evolutionary trees for example) for organizing and\r\ncommunicating ideas and advances, for example in terms of biodiversity or\r\ncomparative genomics. Our program provides students with a coherent,\r\nhands-on introduction to research in systematics and comparative\r\nevolutionary biology, and serves a critical role in attracting, inspiring\r\nand educating undergraduate students in the fundamental importance of these\r\nbiological disciplines.  Students enrolled in the AMNH REU program have at\r\ntheir disposal world-class collections of fishes, dinosaurs, reptiles,\r\namphibians, mammals and invertebrates, as well as cutting edge research\r\nfacilities in the Molecular Genomics laboratories, and the museum's\r\nresearch library.  Project titles, while all concerned with the basic role\r\nof evolution and systematics, span a range of topics as broad as those\r\nbeing investigated by the museum's curators, including the use of genetic,\r\nhistological, anatomical and paleontological data types. The American\r\nMuseum of Natural History is an inspirational place for young scientists to\r\nwork, and an REU program is a wonderful way for us to bring a critical mass\r\nof bright young scholars into our departments and expose them to the\r\nchallenge and excitement of an original research program.\r\n",
