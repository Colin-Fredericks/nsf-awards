 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at University of Kansas\r\nhas developed a summer program to help undergraduate students understand\r\nhow scientific research is conducted.  To achieve this goal, 30 students\r\n(10 in each of the years 2001-2003) will be recruited to spend 10 weeks at\r\nthe University of Kansas campus in Lawrence, Kansas.  Students in the\r\nprogram will learn about research in two main ways.  First, each student\r\nwill be paired with a faculty mentor and will complete their own research\r\nproject.  Participating faculty have varied interests (ecological study at\r\nmany spatial scales; research on evolutionary patterns and processes at\r\nseveral time scales), so a diversity of research projects will be done.\r\nSecond, students will participate in many group activities including weekly\r\nseminars and tours of research facilities.  Students will also get\r\nadditional research exposure by presenting their results at a research\r\nsymposium and attending a national scientific meeting in their discipline.\r\nAn objective of this program is to provide research experiences for\r\nstudents who are unlikely to have this opportunity at their home\r\ninstitution and therefore help encourage a diverse population of students\r\nto consider scientific careers.  Thus, although recruitment will be\r\nnationwide, a particular focus will be to attract students from smaller\r\ninstitutions with fewer research faculty, and students from institutions\r\nwith high minority enrollment.  In particular, students from Haskell Indian\r\nNations University, Lawrence, KS will be encouraged to become involved.\r\n\r\n",
