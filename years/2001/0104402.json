One of \r\nthe primary goals is to prove a nonlinear stability result \r\nfor the Einstein equation in the cosmological case. For large \r\ndata, global existence is a very hard problem, and here the \r\naim is to identify and study model problems as well as lower dimensional problems derived by symmetry reductions. The \r\nstructure of cosmological singularities will be studied \r\nfrom the point of view of the BKL proposal.  For flat, \r\nspatially compact spacetimes, global constant mean curvature\r\nfoliations will be studied, in particular their asymptotic \r\nbehavior in the expanding direction and near the singularity.\r\n\r\nThe Einstein equation, which describes the interaction of \r\nmatter with spacetime geometry, is one of the fundamental \r\nclassical field equations of modern physics. According to the \r\nworld view of modern physics, our universe is described on \r\nlarge scales by one of the simplest solutions to the Einstein equations, the Friedman-Lemaitre solution. According to this\r\npicture, the universe has developed from a singularity (big bang) \r\nand is expanding. The work in this project is concerned with \r\nthe nonlinear stability of this model, the behavior of spacetime \r\nin extreme conditions near the big bang and its ultimate fate \r\nin the expanding direction.\r\n",
