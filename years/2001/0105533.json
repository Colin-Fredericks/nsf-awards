 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis research involves two applications of graph algorithms; the first\r\nregards communication in networks, the second involves solving flow\r\nproblems in structured networks.  The investigators study algorithms\r\nfor finding paths connecting many communicating parties in a network.\r\nThe goal is that the paths do not overutilize any particular link in\r\nthe network.   The second item the investigators will study  is\r\nthe famous problem of routing the maximum amount of flow through\r\na network. This problem is itself interesting and has numerous\r\napplications in fields as diverse as transportation and computer vision.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the investigaters study low congestion routing in\r\nnetworks.  This problem is easy in a relaxed fractional setting but\r\nnotoriously difficult in an integral setting.  Recent work has\r\nestablished relationships between a cut based upper bound and the\r\nfractional lower bound on this problem.  These results will lead to\r\nbetter understanding of the integral version of this problem.\r\nResearch on this problem has made use of techniques from linear\r\nprogramming, randomized rounding, combinatorial graph theory, as well\r\nas geometric embeddings of graph metrics. For the maximum flow\r\nproblem, the investigaters study ideas in a recent maximum flow\r\nalgorithm in order to extend them to the minimum cost flow problem.\r\nThe investigators also study the maximum flow problems on planar and\r\nother restricted classes of graphs.",
