The Society has held this meeting since its founding in 1939, missing only two years during World War II.  This is an indication of its commitment and succeeding in holding meetings of the highest scientific quality, as well as a reflection of the community's interest on the field of developmental biology.  In all the scientific sessions work on diverse organisms including plants, invertebrates and vertebrates will be presented.  Sixty-nine speakers have been invited to tell us about some of their latest findings in the following areas: Gamete Formation and Function, Organ Building, Patterning of the Nervous System, Diversity of Form, Color Patterns, Analysis of Complex Systems, Cell Interactions and Signaling Pathways (2 session), Cell Motility and Guidance, Regulation of Proliferation and Cell Growth, Cell Fate Determination, Plasticity of the Differentiated State, and Developmental Biology and Medicine.  An additional thirty speakers have been chosen from submitted abstracts for platform presentations, allowing the inclusion of the latest results and providing an opportunity for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to talk about their works.  Special interest workshops on Stem Cells, Left-Right Asymmetry, Developmental Biology and Disease Vectors, and Imaging and Cell Marking will be held.  The Education Symposium will center on the very current topic of Ethics and it will include a discussion period with audience participation.  Local teachers and high school students will be invited to attend this session.  We expect an attendance of about 700 people, and most of them will present their new data in the two dedicated poster sessions, one after lunch and the other in the evening.  We are certain that this format allows us to continue to emphasize the best science and to provide a forum to bring together junior and senior investigators, and to allow them to exchange ideas on science, education and the role of science in today's society.  Merit-based travel awards will be available to students and junior postdoctoral fellows, as well as Latin American faculty and students to attend the meeting.        \r\n",
