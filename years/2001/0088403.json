 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThis project is enhancing the Environmental Studies Program at Gettysburg College by introducing a Spatial Analysis Laboratory and associated curriculum to provide rigorous education and hands-on training in spatial information technologies that are critical to environmental analysis and problem solving. Complex environmental problems are commonly situated in geographic contexts. These problems can be addressed by analyzing spatially referenced data through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), and remote sensing (RS). The project goal is giving undergraduate students a strong foundation in the fundamental concepts, methods, and environmental applications of these technologies so that they will be prepared to assume leading roles in environmental research and policy analysis in the private and public sectors and graduate research contexts. The project is adapting three successful programs to fit the needs of undergraduate environmental studies students: programs at Middlebury College and Mount Holyoke College as well as the core curriculum in GIS developed by the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA). The NCGIA curriculum is being modified and extended by including content on GPS and RS. Three new courses are being implemented: (1) Introduction to Geographical Information Systems, (2) Environmental Applications of Spatial Information Technologies, and (3) Remote Sensing of the Environment. Laboratory components of the courses are promoting active and collaborative learning through individual and group projects. Students are examining environmental issues by exercising a student-developed and maintained (with faculty supervision) environmental database for the surrounding region-an innovative feature of the laboratory components. The project also integrates spatial information technologies into undergraduate thesis research. Interdisciplinary instruction and research is being conducted using ArcInfo, ArcView, and Idrisi GIS and image processing software.",
