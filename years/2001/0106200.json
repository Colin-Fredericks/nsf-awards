 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modular representation theory of finite groups of Lie\r\ntype is a major, active topic of mathematical research.  \r\nThe area has both inspired and been strongly\r\ninfluenced by developments in other areas, e.g., \r\nthe cohomology of groups and Lie algebras,\r\nquantum groups, characteristic zero representation theory,\r\nperverse sheaves, and the theory of finite dimensional algebras.\r\nThe project treats both the\r\ndescribing and  non-describing theories.  The \r\ndescribing (resp., nondescribing) theory concerns \r\nthe modular representations in which the underlying module \r\nis taken over a field having the same (resp., different) \r\ncharacteristic as the defining characteristic of the group.  \r\nIn the describing theory, the investigators look for \r\nan increased role of the relatively\r\nunexplored area of affine Lie algebra representations in\r\npositive characteristic.   In the non-describing theory,\r\nthey plan to attack several important conjectures \r\naimed at finding a unified approach valid for all types.  \r\nThey also continue to explore possible analogies between the two theories.\r\nFinally, Parshall continues his recent work on cohomology\r\ncomputations, while Scott extends his recent computational work.\r\n\r\n     In mathematics, a \"group\"  is an abstract embodiment of symmetry. \r\nIn addition to applications to other parts of mathematics, concrete \r\nrealizations of groups can provide powerful constraints on the behavior of\r\ncomplicated physical and communications systems. This project concentrates\r\non determining the ways in which the most important abstract finite groups\r\nfind concrete representations as square matrices over finite number systems.\r\nThe groups and representations the investigators study comprise the most\r\nimportant basic ingredients for creating a general theory of all finite\r\ngroup representations. Over the past century, similar theories for\r\ncontinuous groups have played a large role in quantum theory and the theory\r\nof elementary particles. Their finite analogs have already proved valuable\r\nin the design of communications and data storage devices, though this finite\r\ntheory remains very incomplete. In the future,  one reasonably expects that\r\nthe finite discrete worlds of computers and communications will become even\r\nmore important. The task of creating a viable general theory of finite group\r\nrepresentations -- as is the investigators' long-term goal -- is, thus, a\r\ncentral problem for the future.",
