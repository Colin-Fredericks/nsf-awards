 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nIn 1998 we initiated the biology/chemistry double major with a biotechnology emphasis that introduces students to research-based experiences and culminates in a senior research experience. Unfortunately, many students have had difficulty transitioning from the lower level courses to the upper level courses that require a greater level of independence in the laboratory. In order to develop a stronger, more comprehensive program, we are now adapting the Project Kaleidoscope model and curricular materials from Ferris State University and Bates College to our courses in biotechnology. Utilizing the principal investigator system of investigative labs, we are integrating authentic research experiences and creating a community of scholars beginning in the first courses of the program. Courses are being designed to foster the sequential development of undergraduates by employing laboratory exercises that build upon one another from course-to-course and year-to-year. Five sophomore and junior level courses including plant physiology, cell biology, vertebrate systems, biochemistry I and biochemistry II are being revised to incorporate faculty research interests and to involve students in independent research projects much earlier in their academic career. This provides students a more comfortable transition from investigative laboratories to full research driven laboratories. In each course, students use sophisticated instruments to collect and analyze data and ultimately present their results to each other and the scientific community. In order to develop an enhanced sense of community we have developed an annual Biotechnology Welcome experience, a Biotechnology Awards Banquet, and Biotechnology Discussion and Advising Groups. These opportunities mimic professional meetings and informal scientific exchanges and allow students to interact with each other and with the faculty members in the program on a more consistent and less formal basis. \r\n\r\n",
