 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing a comprehensive program in chemical technology over a three-year period. The county where this community college is located is home to a large number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the region faces a shortage of well-qualified chemical technicians, especially those trained in instrumental analytical techniques relevant to those encountered in local industry. Recent funding from NSF's Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program has enabled purchase of sophisticated, modern instrumentation which forms the foundation upon which the chemical technology program is being built. The new curriculum incorporates the Voluntary Industry Standards (VIS) of the American Chemical Society. With this institution having an ethnic minority enrollment that exceeds 80%, a significant impact on the employment of technicians from underrepresented groups is expected.",
