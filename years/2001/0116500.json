X-ray fluorescence is an instrumental technique for identification and concentration determination of elements in solids or liquids.  An XRF spectrometer uses X-rays to excite an unknown sample.  The excited elements in the sample decay and re-emit their own \"characteristic\" fluorescent X-rays.  The spectrometer detects the fluorescent X-rays and quantitatively determines which elements are present in the sample. The XRF being acquired is an Oxford Instruments Model ED2000 equipped with a Vacuum System (XA620) and a Sample Spinner Assembly (XA618).  It can analyze elements in the mass range from Na(11) to U(92), from low ppm to high percentage levels.  Measurements can be made in the standard air path, an optional helium path for liquids, or  in vacuum for low atomic number elements.  Non-homogeneous samples such as particulates on filter papers can be optimally measured with the use of the ED2000 sample spinner.\r\n  \r\nThe availability of an XRF unit at Lamar University will greatly enhance our capabilities in particle-related research and education, promote inter-disciplinary collaboration among departments, reduce long-term operation costs for elemental analyses, and strengthen our efforts in obtaining external research funds at Lamar University.  Both currently funded and future proposed projects will be directly benefited by this acquisition, including measurement and analysis of outdoor/indoor particulate matter, development of sorbent technology for metal and mercury emission control, chemical characterization of industrial sludge, and development of a super-porous titania-based photoreactor for environmental applications. In addition, both undergraduate and graduate students at Lamar University will have an opportunity, either through research or classroom instruction, to obtain first-hand experience in understanding and operating this modern, advanced chemical-analysis technique.  The impact of this acquisition on research and instructional infrastructure at Lamar University will be considerable.  It will also enhance service to the area K-12 students and efforts in recruiting potential students to science and engineering programs. \r\n\r\n",
