 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to sponsor travel expenses for graduate students and junior faculty members\r\nto attend the 7th IEEE Real-Time Technology and Application Symposium (RTAS) to be held\r\nin Taipei, Taiwan and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Real-\r\nTime Systems. RTAS provides a forum for presenting the latest advances in real-time systems\r\nresearch and for discussing the practical challenges encountered and the solutions adopted. A\r\nspecial mission of RTAS 2001 is to foster discussion and technology exchange in the real-time\r\ncomputing and communication communities between Asia and North America. As such, we have\r\ninvited Dr. C. L. Liu (who developed the rate-monotonic scheduling theory in the 70's and is\r\ncurrently the president of National Ching-Hua University in Hsin-Chu, Taiwan) to serve as the\r\nHonorary Chair, and top-notch researchers in both Asia, Americas, and Europe to serve on the\r\nTechnical Program Committee. In addition to single-track technical sessions, we will also organize\r\ntutorials and workshops that address practical, temporal QoS issues in application domains or over\r\nthe Internet.\r\n\r\nThe symposium, as many other academic activities, relies on the experience of senior members\r\nof the community but requires fresh ideas and new people to join the community. As such, and\r\nto encourage graduate students and young faculty members to participate in the exciting technical\r\nprogram, we are requesting support to defray the travel expenses for graduate students and junior\r\nfaculty attendees. The total amount requested is $12,000 on the basis of an average travel grant\r\nof $1,200 for each selected junior faculty participant and $800 for each selected graduate student.\r\nWe believe attendance at this Symposium will be very beneficial to young scientists who otherwise\r\nwould be unable to participlate in the gathering. Contacts for future (international) collaborations\r\nwill be made and idea exchange will certainly occur. Travel support for student and junior faculty\r\nattendance will be advertised nationwide and women, minorities and disabled students will be\r\nespecially encouraged to apply for sponsorship.",
