 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project goal is to identify genes whose induction is necessary for an\r\neffective hypersensitive disease resistance response in cotton.  Two\r\nvaluable plant resources are available for this work:  Im216, an Upland\r\ncotton line whose level and breadth of resistance to bacterial blight are\r\nexceptional, and a set of near-isogenic cotton lines (isolines) possessing\r\nthree individual, race-specific B genes for bacterial blight resistance in\r\ncombinations of 0, 1, 2, and 3 genes (a gene pyramid).  Also, a subtracted,\r\nnormalized cDNA library enriched in sequences that are induced during the\r\nhypersensitive response of Im216 to Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum\r\n(Xcm) has been prepared.  The first objective is to prepare a similar cDNA\r\nlibrary from the pyramided isoline with 3 B genes and to isolate from the\r\ntwo libraries a set of 500-1000 distinct clones of genes that are induced\r\nby Xcm race 1, which has at least one avirulence gene that is recognized by\r\neach of the B genes in these lines.  The second objective is to array the\r\nchosen cDNAs and screen them with RNA-derived probes prepared from\r\ninoculated plants to identify genes that are induced during the\r\nhypersensitive responses elicited by Xcm race 1.  Since Im216 and the\r\npyramided isoline each have two B genes that are absent from the other\r\nline, results will show whether there are genes whose induction is\r\nregulated by specific B genes.  Results will also identify genes whose\r\ninduction is triggered by all three individual B genes of the isoline\r\npyramid and genes whose quickness of induction correlates with the number\r\nof B genes in a given cotton line.  The third objective is to isolate and\r\nsequence full-length cDNA clones of genes that meet one or more of the\r\nfollowing criteria:  (i) induced by all B genes, (ii) quickness of\r\nexpression correlates with level of resistance, (iii) deduced protein\r\nsequence and time of induction suggest they code for enzymes of phytoalexin\r\nbiosynthesis.  This set of genes will be available as a resource to the\r\nscientific community.  Inducible resistance responses are the most\r\neconomical defense that is known against plant disease.  They require no\r\napplication of agrichemicals.  They cost the plant little energy, since the\r\nresponses are produced only when and where an infection occurs.  They are\r\nrelatively safe, since anti-microbial substances accumulate mainly near\r\ninfection sites and are non-persistent.\r\n",
