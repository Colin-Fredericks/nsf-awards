 "awd_abstract_narration": "Online computation involves optimization problems for which the input is\r\nrevealed progressively. Online algorithms base their decisions only on the\r\npast without knowledge of the future, much in the same way that a stock\r\nmarket investor or a robot that explores an unknown environment decide\r\nabout their next action. Naturally such problems of decision-making with\r\nincomplete information arise in many areas. During the last decade\r\nresearch in the area of online algorithms has been very intensive. Still,\r\nsome of the fundamental problems remain unresolved and important problems\r\narise from new applications. The project deals both with old and new\r\nonline problems.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important fundamental unsolved problem is the k-server\r\nproblem. The objective is to settle the k-server conjecture and to\r\ninvestigate other variants of the problem such as the k-taxicab problem\r\nand the CNN problem. Another objective is to design and analyze\r\ncompetitive algorithms for a related problem, the online matching problem\r\non Euclidean spaces; some interesting variants of the problem seem to play\r\na central role in new e-commerce applications. For all these and many\r\nother problems, one algorithm, the generalized Work Function Algorithm,\r\nseems to have almost optimal competitive ratio. The research addresses the\r\nroots of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nResearch deals also with the pertinent problem of indexing of databases;\r\nthe size of datasets of real applications has been increasing dramatically\r\nand so does the importance of good indexing schemes. Competitive analysis\r\ncan be used to quantify how much the performance of indexing schemes is\r\naffected by changes in a database. Finally, the techniques of competitive\r\nanalysis are a useful tool to address specific game-theoretic problems in\r\nnetworks.\r\n",
