To be more specific, we will study the thermodynamic\r\nlimit of the colored Jones polynomial using various probabilistic\r\nmodels; to explore beyond a simple formulation of the Casson\r\ninvariant we found; to understand the congruence relation among\r\nOhtsuki's invariants through congruence subgroups of the modular\r\ngroup; to find the normal form of a degree 1 map from a knot\r\ncomplement to another knot complement; to study the cohomology of\r\nknot complexes; to explore the applicability of classical\r\ntechniques in 3-manifold topology to the study of Vassiliev\r\ninvariants; and to continue the study of value and root\r\ndistributions of the Jones polynomial.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of knotting is a fundamental feature of the space\r\nthat we live in, and knot theory is thus an important part of\r\nmankind's scientific knowledge because it is aimed at\r\nunderstanding the interplay of mathematical formulae and space\r\nstructures. It is no wonder that concepts and tools originated\r\nfrom knot theory have been used in many areas of mathematics, as\r\nwell as in chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science. For\r\nexample, geneticists utilize knot theory to understand the\r\nprocesses of DNA replication and the function of enzymes that\r\n\"unknot\" DNA strands, and chemists use knot theory to understand\r\nand distinguish between different types of molecules. Our ability\r\nto discern different knots could well be served as a test of our\r\nscientific understanding of space structures.\r\n",
