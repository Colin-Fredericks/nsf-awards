 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Lawrance at Otterbein College to acquire automated DNA sequencing equpiment.  Otterbein College is a comprehensive liberal arts college of approximately 3,000 students founded in 1847 and located in Westerville, Ohio.  The DNA sequencing equipment will be used in a variety of contexts (including faculty/undergraduate student research projects, course associated laboratory experiences, middle school teacher preparation, general undergraduate education and in collaborations with scientists at academic research institutions and the private sector) to make the technologies associated with the completion of the human genome project available to more than 250 undergraduate students annually.\r\n\r\nThe research applications that will be supported by the grant include student/faculty research projects focusing on the genes responsible for transplant rejection, autoimmune diseases, and sugar transport; the genetic structure of populations of endangered species; and in the analysis of antibodies produced against tumors.  Teaching applications will include lecture and laboratory experiences associated with disciplinary courses including Introductory Biology, Immunology, Human Genetics, Molecular Phylogenetics, Microbial Physiology, Human Microbiology, Cell Biology, Advanced Biochemistry and Developmental Biology. Interdisciplinary teaching applications will include the Integrative Studies (general education program) course Biological Sciences:  Being in Nature and an education course, Introduction to Life Science, to be team taught by members of the Biology and Education Departments.  \r\n\r\nThe automated DNA sequencing equipment will be utilized in activities that are aligned with Otterbein's new strategic plan to modernize its science facility, enhance interdisciplinarity and research based instruction, attract more science students, increase diversity and enhance support for student research.  The equipment will also be used in a variety of outreach programs, including programs for underrepresented minority youth.  The equipment will serve as a catalyst for further infusion of the research oriented biology of the 21st century into introductory and advanced level courses in Life Sciences, as well as courses in Chemistry, Education, Nursing and Otterbein's general education program. Ultimately, the project will contribute to greater scientific literacy and encourage more students to pursue careers in science and science education.\r\n\r\n",
