 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to enhance our understanding of the role that\r\ninternational trade and U.S. trade policy has played in American economic\r\nhistory.  This project focuses specifically on the antebellum period, from\r\nroughly 1815 to 1860.  (My previous research focused on the late nineteenth\r\nand early twentieth century period, from 1870 to 1913.)  The short term\r\nobjective of the research is to produce articles for publication in\r\nscholarly economic journals.  The long term objective is to produce a\r\ncomprehensive book-length study of the history of trade and trade policy in\r\nthe United States.  The research on the antebellum period focuses, in\r\nparticular, on three issues. The first issue is the extent to which the\r\nUnited States possessed market power in terms of its cotton exports.  By\r\nestimating the elasticity of export demand facing the United States, the\r\nresearch will give us some indication of the possible economic gains from\r\nimposing an optimal export tax during this period.  The second issue is the\r\nrole of import tariffs in supporting the early growth and development of the\r\ncotton textile industry.  Economists have been divided about whether the\r\ncotton textile industry depended on tariff protection or not, and this\r\nresearch aims to provide greater insight into the role of import protection\r\nduring this period.  The third issue is the pre-Civil War political conflict\r\nbetween the North and the South over the tariff.  This research will focus\r\non Congressional votes on the tariff issue in the antebellum period and\r\ndetermine whether Midwestern economic interests played a critical role in\r\nsupporting the anti-tariff views of the South and thereby helped push\r\ntariffs down from 60 percent in the early 1830s to 25 percent by 1860.\r\n\r\n",
