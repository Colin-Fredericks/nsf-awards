 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large Second-order Cone Programming: Algorithms and \r\nApplications.\r\n\r\nPI.  Donald Goldfarb and Garud Iyengar.\r\n\r\nAbstract. \r\n\r\nSecond-order cone programs (SOCPs) are convex optimization \r\nproblems in which a linear function is optimized over the \r\nintersection of an affine linear manifold with the Cartesian \r\nproduct of second-order (Lorentz) cones.  Linear programs (LPs), \r\nconvex quadratic programs (QPs),  and quadratically constrained  \r\nconvex quadratic programs can all be formulated as SOCPs, as \r\ncan many  other problems that do not fall into these three problem \r\nclasses. On the other hand, since a second-order cone constraint \r\nis equivalent to a linear matrix inequality, semidefinite \r\nprograms (SDPs) include SOCPs as a special case.  Computationally \r\nspeaking, an SOCP falls  between an LP or a QP and an SDP. Interior \r\npoint methods solve all of these problems in polynomial time. \r\nAlthough, the  computational effort required to solve an SOCP is \r\ngreater than that required to solve an LP or a QP, it is \r\nsubstantially less than that required to solve an SDP of similar \r\nsize and structure. However, in many ways, an SOCP is closer to \r\nan SDP than an LP or QP since its feasible set is non-polyhedral. \r\nThe proposed research focuses on several aspects of  SOCPs, \r\nincluding the development of numerically stable algorithms for \r\nSOCPs that take advantage of sparsity in the data, the study of \r\nSOCP-based approximation algorithms for hard combinatorial optimization \r\nproblems, the study of computational aspects of cut generation methods \r\nfor mixed 0-1 SOCPs and the applications of SOCPs in robust financial \r\noptimization. \r\n\r\nSOCPs are excellent models for applications that arise in a broad range \r\nof fields from  engineering, control, and finance, to robust and \r\ncombinatorial optimization. The wide applicability of SOCPs and the \r\nneed for efficient, numerically stable algorithms to solve them makes \r\ntheir study worthwhile.  \r\n",
