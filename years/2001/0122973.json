It blends new understandings in human cognition; economics, economic history and institutions; new methods of data analysis; and evolutionary theories of economics and society to focus on change. Any serious study of change in economies, polities and societies must acknowledge uncertainty. To do so effectively, however, the starting point must be an account of human cognition, through which human beings individually and in larger groupings understand and by means of which they generate change. This Symposium will address the cognitive foundationos of change, and the consequent processes of change at social, political and economic levels. Recent advancements in network analysis offer promise of a theoretical approach that can yield empirically testable models, and thus the Symposium will address the role of networks in a theory of social and economic change. \r\n\r\nThe proposed Symposium will bring together scholars from diverse relevant disciplines (including, but not limited to, economics, economic history, technology studies, intellectual history, human cognition and sociology, organization and management studies). \r\n\r\n",
