The project builds upon previous work by the research team that shows the considerable success of non-profit LMIs in placing economically disadvantage women and minorities into IT occupations.  The study targets women and minorities in IT occupations who come from five broad educational groups: four-year college degree programs, two-year college degree programs, short-term public or private job training programs, graduate degree programs, and high school education.  The study focuses, in particular, on the new community-based institutions and community colleges engaging in workforce development.  Because these programs target disadvantaged adults, they are placing a disproportionately large share of underrepresented minorities into occupations.  This project has the potential to provide valuable insights about the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women and underrepresented minorities in IT careers.\r\n",
