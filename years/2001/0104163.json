Schoen\r\n\r\nProfessor Schoen is proposing to study the existence of an extremal metric\r\nwhich defines the Bartnik quasilocal mass for a domain in a spacetime of\r\ngeneral relativity. This would yield an existence theorem for\r\nasymptotically flat solutions of the static vacuum Einstein equations with\r\nsuitable boundary conditions. It is part of a variational approach for\r\nconstructing three dimensional geometries. Schoen's second project\r\ninvolves the construction of special lagrangian, and more generally\r\nminimal lagrangian, submanifolds in Calabi-Yau and Kaehler-Einstein\r\nmanifolds. The approach is to construct hamiltonian stationary\r\nsubmanifolds by direct volume minimization among lagrangian submanifolds,\r\nand to obtain sufficient regularity to show that they are minimal\r\nlagrangian. Schoen's third project is to further develop the harmonic map\r\napproach to prove the rigidity of smooth actions of lattices in semisimple\r\nLie groups on compact manifolds. Professor Mutao Wang proposes to study\r\nthe mean curvature flow for special classes of submanifolds of\r\ncodimension greater than one. The major thrust is to obtain stability and\r\nregularity properties of the flow. Dr. Baozhang Yang will study singular\r\nbehavior of Yang-Mills connections in arbitrary dimension. This study will\r\ninclude an investigation into the structure of blow-up sets and asymptotic\r\nbehavior near singularities.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis research project concerns the study of geometric shapes which\r\noptimize certain physical and geometric energies. For curved spacetimes in\r\ngeneral relativity, there is no natural mass-energy density which can be\r\nassigned to the gravitational field, so Bartnik proposed to measure the\r\ngravitational mass of a region in a spacetime by minimizing the total mass\r\nof all physical spacetimes which contain this region as a subset. This\r\nminimal mass spacetime, if it can be shown to exist, will be a static\r\nsolution of Einstein's equations. One of the goals of this project is to\r\nfind a way to construct such static solutions, and to use them to study\r\nthree dimensional geometry. It is expected that three dimensional spaces\r\nhave natural geometries on them which are uniquely characterized by their\r\ncurvature properties. Another goal of this project is to construct certain\r\nspecial surfaces in Calabi-Yau manifolds, the spaces of string\r\ntheory. These (three dimensional) surfaces, called special lagrangian\r\nsubmanifolds, are analogous to soap films in that they are surfaces of  \r\nleast possible area. Finally, it is proposed to study the evolution\r\nproblem for surfaces which is called the mean curvature evolution. This is\r\nan evolution problem which moves a surface in space in such a way that its\r\narea is decreased most rapidly. Understanding the behavior of this\r\nevolution is important for simplifying and smoothing complicated surfaces\r\nin an optimal way. Mathematically this is a difficult problem because the\r\nsurfaces may develop singularities such as cone points and tears which\r\nmust be accounted for. \r\n\r\n",
