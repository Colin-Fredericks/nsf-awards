The purpose of this workshop will be to survey and assess the current state of knowledge, research, education, and training in the fire safety field. The results of the workshop will help to define how best to marshal U.S. intellectual, financial, and institutional resources to develop the knowledge necessary to save lives and reduce injuries and property loss from fire. The final report will specifically address the potential of the National Science Foundation to serve as an incubator for basic and interdisciplinary research, professional collaboration, graduate and undergraduate education, and technology transfer in the field of fire safety. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
