 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer architecture research is based on experimental evaluation of application behavior.\r\nOne critical issue in the architecture of high-end enterprise servers is the design of the memory\r\nhierarchy, which must be designed to support current and future data-intensive applications.\r\n\r\nFew evaluations of the memory behavior of large commercial applications exist, especially in the\r\npublic domain. The research proposed here is based on a collaboration between IBM and USC to\r\ntake advantage of the IBM Watson Server Performance Laboratory to explore the memory\r\nbehavior of high-end commercial applications.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, it is proposed to use the IBM MemorIES board to collect bus activity\r\ntraces from a modern server machine running large, finely tuned OLTP, DSS and Web workloads.\r\nBecause of the sheer size of the traces, samples of transaction records will be collected only \r\nin selected time intervals.\r\n\r\nBesides obtaining traces, the goal of this project is to characterize the memory\r\nbehavior of these applications, to evaluate alternative memory hierarchies for future\r\nhigh-end commercial servers, and to explore new multiprocessor architectures for\r\ncommercial systems. \r\n\r\nThe experimental environment provided by the IBM Watson Server Performance Laboratory\r\ncost millions of dollars and years of effort to setup. This proposed research will leverage these\r\nefforts. It is a unique opportunity to collect and disseminate traces and experimental data\r\nwhich would be practically impossible to obtain under any reasonable research budget.",
