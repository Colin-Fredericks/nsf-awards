 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the Louisiana EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement project are focused on improving Louisiana R&D competitiveness, building partnerships among EPSCoR universities and establishing collaborations between the academic and private sectors.  To accomplish these objectives, Louisiana proposes the Micro/Nano Technologies for Advanced Physical, Chemical and Biological  Sensors Initiative.  Nine universities and several businesses, divided into three teams will collaborate to develop a multi-disciplinary research initiative within the state.  The universities will form a Research Consortium.  The member institutions are the University of New Orleans, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Tulane University, Xavier University, Southern University, Louisiana Tech University, Grambling University and the University of Louisiana at Monroe. \r\n\r\nThe proposed scientific program of the three Consortium teams will focus on the design and fabrication of electromagnetic materials with enhanced properties using nanometer-scale material structures and ultra-thin films.  Team 1, Nanomaterials, will develop nano-scale functional materials that provide the critical building blocks enabling sensor technologies in integrated microsystems to be developed for rapid chemical processing and analysis.  Team 1 will fabricate and process nanomaterials in different environments for subsequent use by Teams 2 and 3.  Team 2, Microfabrication, will focus on integrated combinatorial, microscale systems for rapid (bio) chemical synthesis and materials discovery.  This team will collaborate with Team 1 to develop nanoscale materials and sensors that can be integrated into emerging microsystems and with Team 3 to develop nanoscale sensors and arrays for studying neural function.  Team 3, Neural Signaling, will address fundamental issues of cell-to-cell communication and inter-cellular communication using nanotechnology magnetoliposomes and novel microsensors.  This latter effort will expand the neurosciences capability of the biological education and research programs at Xavier University and of the Teams 2 and 3 participants.  \r\n\r\nVideo conferencing capabilities will enable monthly meetings of the Consortium participants.  In addition, multi-institutional courses will be offered via the existing video conferencing capabilities, allowing all institutions in the state to benefit from the Consortium's research. \r\n",
