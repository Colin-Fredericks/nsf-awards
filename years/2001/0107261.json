The program's awards provide\r\nopportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide 24 months of support to Dr. Stephen F. Marino to work with Professor Andreas Plueckthun at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is the generation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) amenable to structural studies.  GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that are primary receptors responsible for olfaction, vision, taste, hormonal and neuronal action.  Between 1 and 3% of the vertebrate genome is thought to code for GPCR-like sequences and they are the primary targets of up to 50% of all pharmaceuticals.  Structures of other GPCRs would allow the scientific community to understand how GPCRs can bind diverse ligands such as peptides, nucleotides, amino acids, lipids, ions, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe Plueckthun lab has pioneered ribosome display applications, making it the best place to conduct this research.\r\n",
