 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technology is rapidly becoming the enabler of the new economy. Significant advances in technologically- oriented industries have created new infrastructure for both business and social interaction while transforming the way we live, learn and work on a day- to- day basis. These advances will continue to have a profound impact on the supply and demand for skilled labor in the new millennium. Indeed, approximately 50% of all jobs in the United States are expected to be either in or closely related to information technology (IT) and telecommunications products and services, by the year 2006. Consistent with the demographic composition of the surrounding community, our campus serves a non- traditional, ethnically diverse student body. This project enables low- income, minority and/or female students who meet established academic criteria to obtain Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degrees in computer science, mathematics or engineering. These students are eligible for transfer to an upper- division school or to enter the workforce directly in their chosen field. Thus, the goals of this project include: (1) Increasing the number of low- income, minority and/ or female students obtaining degrees in computer science, mathematics and engineering; (2) improving the overall quality of education for all students majoring in computer science, engineering and mathematics and; (3) enhancing the professional development and career choice opportunities of participating students. Over the two- year project period, scholarships are being distributed to students in computer science, engineering and mathematics. Measurable criteria including grade point averages, retention rates and graduation rates are utilized to determine the degree of academic achievement, retention and professional development/ graduation among scholarship recipients versus non- recipients. \r\n",
