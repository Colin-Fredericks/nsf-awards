 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research and educational initiative to develop a new all-metal magnetic random access memory device, based on nano-contact ballistic magnetoresistance and current-induced magnetization switching is proposed.  The following research goals are planned:\r\n-       To understand the mechanisms that govern the electrical transport on magnetic nanoconstrictions\r\n-       To understand the mechanisms for domain wall propagation using\r\nhigh-speed current pulses \r\n-       To design and fabricate a prototype magnetic random accessmemory based on these new concepts for detection and recording.  In this project, we offer a completely different operating principle for magnetic random access memory devices (MRAMS). Instead of exploiting giant magnetoresistance in multilayer devices for readback, we propose a scheme which is fundamentally different from the conventional approach in usual MRAM'S, which rely on external currents to produce magnetic fields higher than the coercivity of the ferromagnetic layers. In this\r\nmethod, we will utilize the so called \"s-d exchange\" interaction to move domain walls.  The principle is to use pulsed current to move domain walls in the direction of electron velocity. The educational efforts include the training of graduate and undergraduate students specializing\r\nin magnetism, and the development of a web-based teaching tool that visually demonstrates some of the key aspects of magnetic behavior. This project will produce animation videos of magnetic phenomena derived from actual experimental results and will be disseminated electronically via the internet to reach a broad audience.  The goal is to enhance the understanding of magnetism and promote enthusiasm towards science and technology. These efforts will utilize the existing technical expertise and experimental capabilities in surface science, nanolithography, scanned probe microscopy, magnetic imaging, and device fabrication. This\r\nproject is leveraged upon the results of an NSF CAREER award, and represents a related but distinct research direction.\r\n\r\n",
