 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for DMS - 0104397.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will study two groups of problems related to\r\nphysical models of topological string theory and two-dimensional\r\ngravity and their interaction with geometry and other branches of\r\nmathematics. Based on physical ideas and methods, E.Witten\r\nconjectured that certain topological invariants of the moduli spaces\r\nof Riemann surfaces with higher spin structures assemble in a\r\ngenerating function that can be determined by an infinite system of\r\ndifferential equations (the so-called Gelfand-Dickey hierarchy).\r\nThe goal of the first part of the proposal is to study geometric and\r\nalgebraic structures related to this conjecture by using techniques\r\nfrom the theory of Gromov-Witten invariants and quantum\r\ncohomology. Besides exposing deep connections between seemingly\r\nunrelated areas of geometry and analysis, a goal of this part of the\r\nproject is to develop tools for analyzing more general cohomological\r\nfield theories of spin type and the corresponding spin analogs of\r\nquantum cohomology and Gromov-Witten invariants.  The second part of\r\nthe proposal is related to applications and generalizations of the\r\nso-called chiral de Rham complex, a canonical sheaf of vertex\r\nalgebras introduced in joint work with Malikov and Schechtman. The\r\nmain goal here is to find a rigorous geometric foundation for the\r\nphysical models of two-dimensional superconformal field theory on\r\nsmooth varieties and orbifolds.\r\n\r\nString theory is a proposed physical theory which attempts to unify\r\nall kinds of forces and, in particular, combines Einstein's theory\r\nof gravity with the quantum theory. Because this theory cannot yet\r\nbe verified on experiments, physicists working in string theory are\r\ntesting it on sophisticated mathematical models. Often the same\r\nphysical quantity can be computed by more than one method which\r\ngives answers expressed in terms of very different mathematical\r\nstructures. This suggests the existence of deep ties between various\r\nseemingly remote parts of mathematics and leads to formulation of\r\nnon-trivial conjectures connecting different mathematical objects,\r\nusually geometric and analytical in nature. The goal of the current\r\nproject is a mathematical study of some of these conjectures and\r\ninteractions. Besides producing new mathematical results, it should\r\ngive mathematical verification of some physical models and provide\r\nmore direct links between mathematical and physical methods of\r\nanalysis of these models.\r\n",
