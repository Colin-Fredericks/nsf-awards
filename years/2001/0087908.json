 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to improve the success of UVI students in their first two years of chemistry by creating laboratory environments that interest and intrigue students, that give them individualized, real-world laboratory projects, that create a sense of what chemists do and the tools they use, and that instill professional behaviors and attitudes. Students formerly saw the laboratory portion of these courses as a series of isolated experiences culminating in calculation and reporting exercises that were barriers to overcome. The students often placed little importance on what they were doing and did not develop any sense of the nature of real investigation. Faculty in the Department of Chemistry are adapting and, with appropriate modifications, implementing the innovative laboratory curriculum developed at Hampden Sydney College. The UVI chemistry curriculum now focuses on exposing all chemistry students, including Freshmen, to extended and individualized research experiences using a full range of appropriate chemical techniques including instrumental techniques.\r\n",
