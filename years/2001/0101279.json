They are: \r\no\tArctic science planning-coordinating science planning for the arctic research community at several levels, including continuing examination of logistical requirements with the goal of improved access for all researchers in the Arctic;\r\no\tOrganizational support for research programs included in the Office of Polar Programs Arctic Sciences Section-the Arctic System Science Program (ARCSS), the Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP), and the Arctic Natural Sciences Program (ANS);\r\no\tDevelopment and coordination of arctic science educational activities; and\r\no\tInformation and outreach activities to disseminate information about arctic research to the scientific community, policy and decision-makers, and to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
