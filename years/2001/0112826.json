 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nGibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant growth and\r\ndevelopment. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis of GA\r\nsignal transduction in arabidopsis. Loss-of-function spy mutations suppress the phenotypes\r\ncaused by GA-deficiency; thus, the SPY protein is a suppressor of GA signaling. SPY has\r\nextensive sequence similarity to animal O-GlcNAc transferase, which catalyzes the addition of a\r\nsingle O-linked N-acetylglucosamine to specific serine and/or threonine residues of nuclear and\r\ncytosolic proteins. O-GlcNAc modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins is about as\r\ncommon as phosphorylation and is believed to be a regulatory modification. The work proposed\r\nhere will test the model that SPY-catalyzed protein O-GlcNAcylation acts to negatively regulate\r\nGA signaling and begin to determine the details of how SPY functions in signaling pathway(s).\r\nSPY produced in insect cells is itself O-GlcNAc-modified and has GlcNAc transferase\r\nactivity toward gp40, a plant nuclear pore protein that is known to undergo terminal O-GlcNAc\r\nmodification. SPY is a component of a multiprotein complex present in both the nucleus and\r\ncytosol of arabidopsis and cauliflower. When GA-deficient plants are treated with GA, a\r\ndecrease in the GlcNAc modification of several proteins is detectable 1 hr after treatment. spy\r\nmutations have similar effects. These data indicate that protein GlcNAcylation plays a role in\r\nGA signaling.\r\nA number of arabidopsis proteins that putatively interact with SPY's tetratricopeptide\r\nrepeats in yeast have been identified. One of these proteins is GIGANTEA (GI), a protein\r\ninvolved in a number of processes that are also affected by GA. Consistent with the physical\r\ninteraction between SPY and GI, with respect to the control of flowering time, spy is weakly\r\nepistatic to gi.\r\nThe goals of this work are to: 1) characterize the protein modification that is produced by\r\nSPY and determine the identity of its substrates; 2) determine if the localization or activity of\r\nSPY is regulated by determining if changes in GA levels or mutations affecting GA signaling\r\nalter the localization, posttranslational modification, protein associations, or activity of SPY; and\r\n3) perform additional tests on the proteins identified in the two-hybrid screens to identify the\r\nproteins that physically interact with SPY and then genetically characterize the function of the\r\ninteracting proteins. As part of the third goal, genetic and physiological studies will be\r\nperformed to further define the functional interrelationships between SPY and GI.",
