 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Hawai'i at Hilo, on behalf of the state of Hawai'i, has requested NSF\r\nsupport for a planning grant designed to help Hawai'i set priorities for the improvement\r\nof the state's basic science and engineering research infrastructure. The project's\r\nobjective is to design a statewide science and technology (S &T) plan that will stimulate\r\neconomic opportunities and wealth building capacity. The planning process will examine\r\nactivities that have the potential to:  (1) affect greater participation in academic research\r\nand development (R&D) and (2) significantly improve the status of science and\r\ntechnology (S&T) education and workforce development. The planning process will\r\nanalyze the state's current S&T infrastructure and inventory current research personnel\r\nand facilities. This analysis includes identifying: S&T areas of current research\r\nexcellence as well as areas with the potential for future national R&D competitiveness.\r\nThe planning process will result in a coordinated state-wide effort to improve academic\r\nR&D capabilities in targeted disciplines, enhance training and education for students in\r\nscience and engineering, and increase efforts to promote transfer of technology from the\r\nstate's universities to Hawai'i's private and public sectors.\r\n",
