 "awd_abstract_narration": "Group communication services form important building blocks for applications in dynamic\r\ndistributed systems, where processors and communication links can repeatedly fail and recover.\r\nSuch dynamic behavior is especially descriptive of mobile environments, in which processors can\r\nchange their physical location continually. The key features of a group communication facility are\r\n(1) indicating to each processor with which other processors it can currently communicate, and (2)\r\nletting processors within a group communicate with each other in an ordered and reliable manner.\r\nA typical approach to developing fault-tolerant software is to assume certain limitations on the\r\nbehavior of faulty components. However, in reality there is a non-zero probability that any such\r\nassumptions will be temporarily violated; in fact, this probability grows with time. In particular,\r\nmobile communication networks are exposed to environmental noise whose level is hard to predict\r\nin advance. Thus, it may be too optimistic to approach correctness by assuming that the system\r\nis consistent initially and each subsequent step maintains consistency. Self-stabilizing algorithms\r\ncope with temporary faults in an elegant way. A self-stabilizing algorithm can be started in any\r\nglobal state, which could be reached due to an arbitrary combination of failures, and always en-sures\r\nthat the task of the algorithm is achieved, assuming that the designer's assumptions hold for\r\nsufficiently long intervals.\r\nThe goal of this research is to design self-stabilizing group communication services and apply\r\nthese services to mobile networks.\r\nOne part of the research will focus on the specification and design of initialized group services,\r\nin which the establishment of a new group ensures that messages related to previous incarnations\r\nare discarded. Various synchrony assumptions will be considered in order to identify the necessary\r\nand sufficient conditions for the specified initialized group services. One approach to be investi-gated\r\nis using transient fault detectors that will trigger the establishment of a new group whenever\r\ninconsistency is detected. Impossibility results will be developed to indicate which system assump-tions\r\nare necessary; lower bound results will be proved to shed light on the degree of optimality of\r\nthe solutions obtained. A second part of the research will study how different mobile applications\r\ncan take advantage of the self-stabilizing group communication services developed. A third part\r\nof the research will explore the interactions between the group communication services and other,\r\nlower level, mobile services.\r\nGroup communication services have been incorporated in several existing academic and indus-trial\r\ndistributed systems. However, none of them is self-stabilizing and none of them is specifi-cally\r\ntailored for mobile environments. Self-stabilization and group communication are important\r\nparadigms for the design of dynamic communication networks, and in particular wireless net-works.\r\nThere is no doubt that the new methods developed in this project will contribute to future\r\nimplementations of robust group communication systems.",
