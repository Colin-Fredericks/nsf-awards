This region is important for the development of an integrated geological and spatially-referenced data system as it is of fundamental significance to the geologic evolution of southwestern North America.  In addition, such a system is timely as it can be used to address practical problems such as the effects of urbanization and dwindling water resources.  Construction of this data system will involve three main efforts: 1) compilation of many large, scattered and heterogeneous earth science data sets into verified, standardized, and documented data bases; 2) construction of web-based interfaces that allow any interested party to access these data, receive robust metadata describing the data and how best to use them, and receive information on how to add data to the system via structured protocols; and 3) the design and construction of an extensive collection of public domain software (a toolbox) that would empower users with the capability to use and update the data in a substantial way.  This project will leverage considerable support from several federal and state agencies including NASA, the U. S. Geological Survey, the National Imaging and Mapping Agency, and the Arizona Geological Survey. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
