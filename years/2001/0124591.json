 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biochemical Engineering Conference serves as the premier meeting for the Biochemical Engineering community. The focus of this Conference will include important core areas of Biochemical Engineering (fermentation/cell culture and downstream process development) as well as exciting new frontiers of Biochemical Engineering (nanotechnologies, the \"omics\" of proteomics, genomics and physiomics, marine and environmental biotechnology). The Conference will illustrate how the same engineering fundamentals (unit operations, mass and energy transport, thermodynamics, and kinetics) that form the basis of traditional areas of Biochemical Engineering are being applied to drive advances in both areas. In addition to the regular sessions, two workshops are planned. A workshop entitled \"Biochemical Engineering Education: fundamentals versus state-of-the-art\" will focus on the often-competing needs to incorporate engineering fundamental into the curriculum as well as state-of-the-art applications. This workshop will feature representatives from industry and academe. A second workshop entitled \"New Directions in Biochemical Engineering Research\" will focus on potentially new areas for research in Biochemical Engineering. The discussion will have as panelists both academic and industrial representatives. Each panelist will be asked to prepare a single transparency and speak for no longer than 5 minutes. Following the presentations, input from the audience will be requested. \r\n \r\n",
