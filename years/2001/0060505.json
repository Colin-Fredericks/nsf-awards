 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the development of a neutral, high\r\nflux/fluence nitrogen atom beam source for application to the high rate growth of III-V nitride\r\nsemiconducting materials over large areas.  The proposed source is based on Physical Sciences Inc.'s\r\n(PSI's) proprietary MID-JET technology.  This technology employs an electrode-less discharge\r\ncontained by vortex flow, rather than a dielectric tube commonly used in traditional sources.  The\r\ndischarge is formed at 1 atm which results in efficient Ion recombination and a charge-free beam.\r\nPreviously, high flux, high fluence oxygen and fluorine atom beams have been demonstrated using a\r\nMID-JET with a gas temperature of ~ 3000 K. However, to produce a nitrogen atom beam, the basic\r\nconfiguration of the MID-JET must be changed to obtain the > 5000 K temperatures required to\r\ndissociate nitrogen. In Phase I, PSI will examine at least two new configurations via modeling, select\r\none, and fabricate and test an experimental source for nitrogen.  Techniques for combining the nitrogen\r\nbeam with a gallium source will be examined via detailed numerical modeling.  If successful, PSI will\r\ndemonstrate a charge-free nitrogen atom source with a fluence of about 10 21 atoms/s, 2 to 3 orders of\r\nmagnitude higher than that generated by currently available sources.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a charge-free, high flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam for the growth of III-V\r\nnitride materials which can replace existing plasma-based tools. The source can allow higher growth\r\nrates over larger areas of high quality material with application to the fabrication of high power/high\r\ntemperature semiconductor devices and blue illumination sources (including those for flat panel\r\ndisplays).\r\n",
