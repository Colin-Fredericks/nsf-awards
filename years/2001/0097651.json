 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program.  Two principal concerns inspired the Oklahoma Weather Center (OWC) in previous years to establish summer REU programs: 1) the general lack of opportunities for undergraduates to gain research experience to complement their academic careers and 2) the lack of participation by women and members of ethnic minorities in research in atmospheric science.  The OWC in Norman boasts a unique environment that encompasses all aspects of meteorological research and can provide students with the opportunity to enhance their undergraduate careers.  Over a three-year period, thirty undergraduate students will participate in the OWC REU program.  The students will be involved in a variety of activities throughout the summer.  Each student will: 1) be matched with an atmospheric scientist based on his/her interest and abilities to conduct research on a related topic, 2) attend atmospheric science lectures, 3) participate in various workshops (technical writing, numerical modeling, meteorological tools, graduate school preparation, etc.), 4) participate in field trips and tours to regional sites, 5) discover various research methods, 6) possibly collect and analyze field data (depending on availability of field programs each summer.) and finally 7) present their research in a written and oral format.  The planned  activities will introduce and expose each student to the many research possibilities within atmospheric science.  The various opportunities will also assist the students with their decisions regarding graduate school and potential futures as research scientists.\r\n\r\nThe students will conduct their research under the supervision of mentors from the OWC.  The OWC is a unique confederation of federal, state, and University of Oklahoma organizations that work together in partnership to improve understanding of events of Earth's atmosphere.  Organizations of the OWC that will participate in the REU are: Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms, Center for Computational Geosciences, Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies, Environmental Verification and Analysis Center, Oklahoma Climatological Survey, School of Meteorology, National Severe Storms Laboratory, Norman National Weather Service Forecast Office, Storm Prediction Center, and WSR-88D Operational Support Facility.",
