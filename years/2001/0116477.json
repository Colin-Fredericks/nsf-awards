 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Lee and Underwood at California State\r\nUniversity Long Beach to acquire an imaging system comprised of a fluorescence\r\n-capable microscope with motorized stage, CCD camera, computer, and software.  \r\nThis system will provide unbiased stereology capabilities, as well as the ability to \r\n1) visualize immunofluorescent labeled samples; 2) produce 3-dimensional (3-D)\r\nreconstructions; and 3) establish image databases accessible via the internet.\r\n     The goal of Dr. Lee's research is to understand the effects of memory\r\nformation and hormones on neurogenesis in the zebra finch hippocampus.  The\r\nhippocampus of adult birds and mammals retains the capacity for substantial\r\nplasticity including the birth of new cells (cytogenesis) and neurons\r\n(neurogenesis) in response to a number of environmental influences including\r\nlearning and memory formation.  Dr. Lee recently found that hippocampal cells\r\nare also born as a result of injury and collect around the damaged site in the\r\nzebra finch brain.  Injured brain areas become rich in aromatase as well, an\r\nenzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen.  Estrogens, in turn, are known\r\nto promote differentiation and survival of neurons.  These intriguing results\r\nare being used to investigate factors influencing cytogenesis and\r\ndifferentiation of new cells into neurons and glia.  The aim then is to exploit\r\nthe ability of the avian hippocampus to respond to environmental influences by\r\ntraining birds on learning tasks, lesioning the hippocampus, injecting them\r\nwith BrdU (a mitotic marker), and assessing the patterns of cell proliferation,\r\nmigration, and/or differentiation through the use of immunohistochemical\r\ntechniques.  New BrdU-positive cells will be visualized and counted using the\r\nMicroBrightField StereoInvestigator imaging system; double labeling procedures\r\nwill be used to determine whether new cells are neurons or glia.\r\n     The goal of Dr. Underwood's research is to understand the relationship\r\nbetween chromosomal abnormalities, a biased sex ratio, and the evolution of\r\n\"excess\" males in the madrone butterfly.  Dr. Underwood's research led to the\r\ndiscovery of abnormalities in chromosome pairing during germ cell formation in\r\nthe madrone butterfly.  One subspecies shows a normal complement of 26\r\nbivalents; however, another subspecies shows extreme variations from cell to\r\ncell within the same individual.  The primary sex ratio of the abnormal\r\nsubspecies is 75% male while the normal subspecies appears to have a normal sex\r\nratio of 50% males.  Butterflies have chromosomal sex determination.\r\nSpermatogenesis is extremely abnormal with multivalent chromosomal associations\r\nand lagging chromosomes formed during metaphase and anaphase, and the\r\nproduction of micronuclei associated with sperm nuclei.\r\n     NSF funding will also make it possible to digitize samples obtained from a\r\nvariety of research projects.  This will result in public databases to be used\r\nby interested scientists with access to the internet and thus offers an\r\nunparalleled opportunity to share information both locally and globally.\r\nIndividuals from multiple labs will perform procedures remotely thus broadening\r\nthe scope of research and increasing the opportunity for publication and\r\ndissemination of results, while minimizing labor and the number of animals.\r\nBeyond the immediate research applications, instructors and their students will\r\nbe empowered through accessibility to data previously reserved for only a\r\nselect few.  Image databases, accessed as classroom exercises, will expose\r\nstudents to topical and exciting new research as well as train them in the use\r\nof 21st century technology thus advancing science and giving them a competitive\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n",
