 "awd_abstract_narration": "WTTW, the public television station in Chicago, is developing a science education project targeted at children aged 6 to 10.  The major components of the project will be a 13-part animated television series, an interactive webpage and multiple outreach components for individuals and families.  The television series features a pair of animal astronauts -- an eager dog named Billie and a reluctant flea named Miles -- as they travel through space in search of science adventure.  The two work together to explore problems, solve mysteries and survive adventures while aboard their doghouse-shaped spaceship and on the worlds they discover throughout the universe.  In each episode, using an inquiry-based method of problem solving, Billie and Miles embark on a new adventure and explore a single science concept in depth, approaching it from many different ways appropriate to their respective personalities.  \r\n\r\nScience content for the series is being developed by Ian Saunders, previously Head Science Writer for Bill Nye the Science Guy;  Dr. Edward Atkins, President of Science Productions for TV who has developed science programming for Children's Television Workshop and WNET; and Dr. Jose Rios, Assistant Professor for Science Education at the University of Washington, Tacoma.  The series will be produced by WTTW in partnership with Nelvana Ltd., the animation company for The Magic School Bus.  Formative evaluation during the planning phase will be conducted by Dr. Barbara Flagg of Multimedia Research.\r\n\r\nThe major activities during the planning stage include:\r\n\r\n1)  Convening the core advisors to develop the science content bible, finalize age-appropriate content goals, suggest ideas and strategies for presenting the science, and organizing principles consistent with the National Science Education Standards and the AAAS Benchmarks.  \r\n\r\n2)  The group also will examine a range of creative issues that bear directly on the effective delivery of science content.  \r\n\r\n3)  Development and formative testing for a short animation prototype that will illustrate one of the series' science concepts.  This segment will be tested to assess the appeal of its style and its efficacy in communicating science.  \r\n\r\n4)  Continuation of work with Nelvana to develop character sketches and background, create storylines and write a pilot script. \r\n\r\n5)  Validate and expand on the current outreach concept.\r\n\r\n",
