The work will make extensive use of field-theoretic techniques with an emphasis on non-perturbative methods. Research will focus on electronic materials and systems for which the Fermi liquid paradigm does not apply and often does not even provide a qualitative description of the correlated electronic states. Research areas that will be engaged include: disordered systems in two dimensions, including the transition between plateaus in the quantum Hall effect; spin-charge separation in lattice gauge theories on high temperature superconductors; correlation functions for Haldane-gap spin chains; the existence of Lifshitz points in chiral field theories; and tunneling into a fractional quantum Hall device.  The techniques of integrable field theory will be used, which include conformal field theory, the Bethe ansatz, and the exact scattering matrix description. \r\n%%%\r\nThis award supports fundamental theoretical research and education on strongly correlated electron materials and systems. The PI will apply state-of-the-art field theoretic techniques to central problems in the field of strongly correlated electron materials with an aim to understand how electronic states arise that differ from the Fermi liquid states observed in ordinary metals. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
