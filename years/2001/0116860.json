The conference is being held at Itasca Community College, Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Teams of high school, two-year and four-year faculty will work towards developing articulation agreements that will ensure seamless and successful educational experiences for engineering students. The outcome of this forum will be the creation of a National Collaboration for Engineering Education, a partnership that will be instrumental in reversing the current trend of declining engineering enrollment in the face of increasing need for engineers. The partnership will also be instrumental in raising the numbers of students from underrepresented groups who pursue engineering careers.",
