 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0097291\r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue operations of the Planning and Data Management Office (PO/DMO) of the U.S. Joint Global Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS) U.S.JGOFS planning has been funded at some level  since the inception of the program in 1986, and a specific Data Management Office grant was added in  1994.  Overall, the goal of the PO/DMO is to support the completion of U.S. JGOFS activities and the  promotion of JGOFS accomplishments.  The Office will work especially toward securing the JGOFS legacy through support of synthesis efforts and outreach to fellow oceanographers, earth system scientists and  the public at large. Of key importance will be the production of a high-quality data archive that outlasts the  U.S. JGOFS Program and serves future generations of biogeochemists studying ocean processes, especially in the context of global change.  \r\n\r\nA ramping down of research funding to U.S. JGOFS PIs has been underway for the past four years, but activities continue at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) and Hawaii Ocean Time Series (HOT) stations and in the Synthesis and Modeling Project (SMP) though 2003, with projects funded in  2001/2002 presumably ending in the  2004/2005 time frame.  The PO/DMO activities under this award will be directed toward providing logistical support for the final stages of these projects.  Activities described in this proposal would thus continue through 2003, when the U.S.JGOFS community  is expected to host the last major International  JGOFS Open Science Conference in Washington, DC.  Thereafter, the top priority of the PO/DMO will be  to produce and distribute the final U.S. JGOFS data products on CD/DVD or other more permanent  media. \r\n\r\n",
