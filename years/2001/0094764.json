 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scholarships for low-income, academically talented students in computer science and mathematics. It is also fashioned to directly effect and subsequently increase retention and graduation rates in computer science and mathematics. Furthermore, the Scholarship Program improves and enhances the networking of students with potential future employers as well as strengthens relationships between Huntingdon College and the related employment sector and graduate schools. Additionally, a versatile scholarship model is created that will serve as an example to other liberal arts colleges who desire to enhance their computer science and mathematics departments. Finally, this program promotes mathematics and computer science as dynamic areas of study to college-bound students and gives Scholars (i.e. Scholarship recipients) teaching and instruction experience. All scholarship recipients are assigned to faculty mentors who meet with their Scholars on a weekly (in some cases daily) basis to evaluate, plan, and assess student projects and matters within the program and departments. Scholars participate in specialized training to prepare them to serve as peer mentors to one or two underclassmen (i.e., freshman or sophomores majoring in computer science or mathematics). They present lectures or demonstrations in local elementary, junior high, and high school classrooms. In addition, Scholars engage in contemporary issues debates and forums. Scholars also participate in co-curricular opportunities including research with department faculty members as well as observe and work with professionals in the discipline-related professions. This unique scholarship program improves education for students in computer science and mathematics, increases retention of students to degree achievement, improves professional development, and strengthens partnerships in the employment sectors.",
