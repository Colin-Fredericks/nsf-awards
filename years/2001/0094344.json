 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports Dr. Shannon Stahl, Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin at Madison, for his work under a Career Award. The project will involve (1)  mechanistic studies designed to clarify how palladium couples the oxidation of organic substrates to the reduction of dioxygen, and (2) application of mechanistic insights into developing novel oxidation catalysts. The award also supports development of a new freshman/sophomore course in introductory inorganic chemistry that will integrate modern research developments into classroom teaching, including such topics as transition metal catalysis, green chemistry, fuel cells and batteries, and elements of bioinorganic chemistry.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that selective oxidation of organic molecules lies at the heart of commodity and fine chemical industries, this work will facilitate the design of new, more efficient and selective oxidation catalysts. Graduate students and post-doctoral associates will be trained in an active area of current interest in catalysis. Undergraduate students will be exposed to and taught elements of chemistry that are currently of high research priority in the important spheres of green chemistry and energy.",
