 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project leverages several K-12 outreach programs at the University of Washington to help increase the subject-matter understanding of precollege mathematics teachers and their students while increasing the Fellows' understanding of teaching and learning. The College of Arts and Sciences, as home of the departments that teach mathematics and the sciences, has a long history of preservice and inservice teacher preparation. The proposal seeks to place 12 graduate students (recruited university wide) as GK-12 Fellows in local elementary and junior high mathematics classes. The project will involve a coordinated program of selection, initial preparation, in-depth preparation, on-going mentoring and assessment. Feasibility has been demonstrated by a two-year pilot project supported by the UW President's Fund and NSF. Fellows will receive initial preparation in instructional methods of inquiry based mathematics by Lillian McDermott and the Physics Education group followed by Developing Mathematical Ideas session to analyze student thinking given by the Expanding a Community of Mathematics Learners local systemic change project. This GK-12 projects extends partnerships with local school districts already involved in systemic change efforts and strengthens on-going attempts to help teachers implement curricula that meet state and national standards.",
