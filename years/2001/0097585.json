 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Michigan.  Brian Coppola is the site's Program Director and Seyhan Ege as Co-Program Director will assist him. In addition there will be available 48 faculty as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2001-2003), the students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program, where they will join 50-60 other students.  The focus of the program is designed to provide the students with the experience of doing research in a large graduate department of a Research-I institution. Students will have access to all of the research groups of the Chemistry Department including interdisciplinary programs in materials chemistry, bio-related chemistry, medicinal chemistry and environmental chemistry. A relationship is established between each of the students and research group before arriving on campus.  The program concludes with each student presenting his/her research results at a regional research meeting.\r\n",
