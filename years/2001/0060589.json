 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lays the foundation for developing and implementing an in-situ feedback control instrument for Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) of complex oxides.  If successful, the project will result in real time in-situ feedback monitors addressing the quality of the actual film being deposited by a complex oxide MOCVD tool for process development and for production. The program is specifically focused on lead zirconium titanate (PZT) for non-volatile ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) fabrication, but the resulting technology will be applicable to other oxides.  This project will develop a real-time in-situ Spectral Ellipsometry film analysis tool that can feedback into process control. Specifically, the developed technology will monitor the optical constants, thickness, composition and surface/interface morphology.  Phase I will focus on development of  ex-situ sample-data libraries (calibrated to physical measurements) and refine the tool design.  In Phase II, a film analysis unit will be mated to an existing pilot production reactor.  The unit will be implemented, data libraries refined, and feedback control software and hardware developed. \r\n \r\nPhase III commercialization will consist of marketing complete oxide MOCVD systems with Spectral Ellipsometer based in-situ process monitors that enable real time feedback for quality control of deposited films.  This will enable high yield economical manufacture of complex material based devices such as \r\nnon-volatile memories and  infrared detectors, among others, at levels far above those now possible.\r\n\r\n",
