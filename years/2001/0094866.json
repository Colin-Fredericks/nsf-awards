 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scholarships and reduces economic barriers to full-time enrollment for up to 40 full-time, Pell eligible students majoring in engineering, computer science or mathematics at Montgomery College each year. These students, known as Montgomery College NSF CSEM Scholars, are provided with a challenging and supportive program that prepares them for majors in engineering, computer science or mathematics at a four-year college. Selected students participate in a paid internship program the summer before transferring to a four-year institution. In addition to grade point average, selection criteria includes a student essay and letters of recommendation from individuals such as teachers, counselors or job supervisors who can address the applicant's potential to succeed in engineering, computer science or mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe centerpiece of support services for Montgomery College NSF CSEM Scholars is an expanded, comprehensive mentoring program that provides students with interdisciplinary faculty mentor teams composed of faculty from computer science, mathematics, engineering, and the basic sciences. This mentoring process continues at the four-year institution with a continuing mentor from Montgomery College during the student's first year after transfer. At Montgomery College, student's mentoring team may include a faculty member from a four-year institution once a student has decided upon a transfer institution. Scholars are required to enroll in a one credit course that includes seminars by scientists and engineers as well as resume writing, interviewing, preparing for transfer and graduate school and applying for internships.\r\n\r\nScholars have many opportunities outside of the classroom to interact with their peers, faculty and business leaders. As these opportunities are evaluated, the college develops models of pathways that lead to bachelor's degree completion in engineering, computer science or mathematics for students who start their college education at a community college. \r\n\r\n",
