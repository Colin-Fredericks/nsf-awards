The researchers will undertake a study of charge-transfer coupling dynamics in liquid-liquid two-phase microparticles.  The goal of this proposal is to combine several unique microelectrochemical and spectroscopic approaches developed by co-PI's for characterization of charge transfer processes at the interface between two immiscible liquid phases.  These electrochemical and optical techniques will be used to probe heterogeneous reactions in two-phase microscopic particles.  Among such microparticles are microemulsions, biological cells and organelles, and phospholipid vesicles.  Although these systems are very different, their common feature is the presence of a micrometer or susbmicrometer-sized liquid-liquid interface either clear or covered with a molecular film of a surfactant (e.g., phospholipid).  The main focus will be on experimental and theoretical studies of coupling of electron transfer (ET) and ion transfer (IT) processes at microscopic liquid interfaces.  The approaches developed for model liquid interfaces will then be used to probe the dynamics of charge transfer coupling in biological systems.\r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  Results of this research should significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer reactions at liquid interfaces with important implications for biological cells, sensors and biomedical systems.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of postdocs and graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of their research in scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific meetings.\r\n",
