 "awd_abstract_narration": "This document describes a proposed software system, called INBOUNDS (Integrated\r\nNetwork-Based Ohio University Network Detective Service), that will address the\r\ndifficult research problem of security in the dynamic real-time Internet environment\r\npopulated by both legitimate users and hostile intruders.\r\n    Internet security is becoming more critical by the day. Successful attacks on banks,\r\nschools, government agencies, and corporations that do business online are becoming\r\nmore and more common, and the frequency of these attacks and the amount of damage\r\ndone is rising rapidly. Commercially available firewalls and intrusion detection systems\r\nare currently the only weapons with which to defend against the threat, but they are\r\nobviously not capable of keeping up with the ever-changing attack strategies of hackers.\r\n     Thus, we propose INBOUNDS a real-time network based intrusion detection and\r\nresponse system under development at Ohio University's Laboratory for Real-Time,\r\nSecure Systems and Applications. INBOUNDS detects and responds to suspicious\r\nbehavior by using TCPTrace (a network traffic analysis tool) and DeSiDeRaTa (dynamic,\r\nreal-time resource management middleware). INBOUNDS is intended to function in a\r\nheterogeneous environment with fault tolerance, very low overhead, and a high degree of\r\nscalability. A prototype of INBOUNDS is currently being used for around-the-clock\r\nintrusion detection and response at Ohio University and we propose to add functionality\r\nthat will enable INBOUNDS to deal with the following important types of attacks:\r\n    Large-scale, distributed denial-of-service attacks\r\n    Abnormal network protocol behavior including SYN and RESET attacks\r\n    Suspicious keywords in interactive sessions/email\r\n    Suspicious patterns of data, such as the fan-out patterns commonly seen with\r\n    email viruses\r\n    Communication over unusual network ports, which are common when attackers\r\n    target seldom used and insecure servers\r\n    Connections from unknown/unusual hosts\r\n    Abnormal data patterns for a particular time of day\r\n    Unusual data patterns on known ports, such as would be seen when at attacker\r\n    installs programs using the fingerd port as in the Morris Worm",
