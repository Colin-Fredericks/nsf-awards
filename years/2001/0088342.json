 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology - Cognitive (73) \r\nIn order to teach students psychology, it is essential to provide them with opportunities to measure and analyze real samples of behavior. In this proof of concept project, we are exploring the use of new technology, namely DVD recordings, to bring behavior samples into developmental psychology courses in a more efficient and structured way than has typically been done in undergraduate psychology classes. Through contacts with researchers in child development, we are obtaining copies of videotaped experimental sessions, and transcribing them on DVDs for ease of use and presentation in the classroom. This project includes three components: (1) technical demonstration of editing, compressing, and transferring laboratory segments of developmental research sessions to DVD with a quality acceptable for use in the classroom; (2) obtaining subject and investigator releases in accordance with intellectual-property and privacy issues that will allow us to expand the project for full development; and (3) obtaining reliable data demonstrating effective educational use of this new format for delivering examples of behavior during standard classes. Although our work in this project is focused primarily on issues in developmental psychology, the considerations we address are general; they could deal equally well with many instructional topics. A critical aspect of this process is depicting a range of behaviors ranging from normal to a variety of abnormal developmental patterns. This is facilitating improved learning by students because they are more fully able to understand the range of behaviors that one sees in studying a particular aspect of development. Psychological research on learning and memory has shown that the greater the range of examples portrayed, the better able students/learners are at generalizing what they learn to new circumstances. \r\n\r\n",
