 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThere are three major barriers to increasing female involvement in science, mathematics, and technology:  1) inequitable treatment of females in classrooms, 2) lack of self-confidence, and 3) lack of successful mentors.  The WE*CAN (women Engineers * Changing Attitudes Now) grant will address these barriers through extensive modeling, direct teaching, and mentoring.\r\n\r\nIn WE*CAN grant there are four objectives and ten activities which will address engineering and gender equity concerns.  The objectives include:\r\n\r\n1) mentoring young women from elementary school to undergraduates,\r\n2) informing young women about engineering careers and providing them opportunities to experience engineering activities,\r\n3) informing teachers, counselors, and parents about engineering and gender equity issues, and,\r\n4) disseminating information about gender equity and engineering through the WE*CAN program and future WE*CAN activities.\r\n\r\nThe activities included in this grant are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) establishing a WE*CAN mentoring program,\r\n2) establishing a WE*CAN web page,\r\n3) presenting information about the field of engineering while modeling gender equity to K-12 groups,\r\n4) teaching engineering to elementary students in the Super Saturday program,\r\n5) teaching engineering to middle school students in the Summer Camp for Academically Talented Students (SCATS) program,\r\n6) conducting a WE*CAN engineering day\r\n7) creating an all female team for the BEST (Boosting Engineering, Science and Technology) robotic competition,\r\n8) teaching elementary girls in an engineering enrichment program,\r\n9) providing a workshop for teachers and counselors in the field of engineering and gender equitable teaching and counseling strategies, and\r\n10) disseminating information at conferences and events about gender equity and engineering.\r\n\r\nParticipants from the first grade through the university level will experience a hands-on and minds-on approach to the field of engineering in gender equitable environment.  Participants will experience support through the WE*CAN mentoring program.  A strong focus will be placed on mentoring young women as a way on increasing self-esteem.\r\n\r\nSeveral activities in the WE*CAN grant are integrated with existing programs in an attempt to make the seeds of this program sustainable in future years\r\n",
