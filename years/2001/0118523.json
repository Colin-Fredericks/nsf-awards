These funds are used to facilitate the participation of young investigators (students, post-doctoral fellows and young faculty) and to maintain reasonable registration fees for all participants. The symposium will be held from September 23 - 27, 2001 at the Snow King Resort in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The 2001 ISSI-3 symposium has a strong emphasis on the role that affordability, reliability and design play in developing new materials for use in aerospace applications. Invited and contributed presentations will outline the design and business constraints associated with the introduction of new materials, address reliability and performance issues specific to intermetallic alloys, and highlight recent advances in the understanding of processing-structure-property relations in intermetallic alloys. \r\n%%%\r\nThis meeting provides a forum in which engineering designers interact with materials and process engineers. ISSI-3 builds on the past success of previous ISSI conferences that were attended by over 200 participants from approximately 19 countries and received extremely high satisfaction ratings. \r\n***\r\n",
