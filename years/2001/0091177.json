 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temperature controls plant growth and development and is ultimately one of\r\nthe most significant factors limiting crop productivity.  As temperature\r\ngoes above or below a plant's optimal range plant growth is affected.  The\r\neffects of temperature and methods for reducing damage by both high and low\r\ntemperature has been the topic of a Gordon Research Conference every other\r\nyear for a little over 10 years.  In 2001 this conference will be held\r\nagain so that researchers can share the latest research in this field.  The\r\ntopics to be covered in the conference were selected from topics suggested\r\nby previous participants and past chairs of this conference.  In addition,\r\nthe co-chairs searched recently published papers to see where interesting\r\nwork was being reported.  Two general themes emerged.  Past participants\r\nwanted to hear about genomic approaches to studying temperature stress and\r\nthey wanted to hear about industry efforts.  One of the most important\r\noutcomes from a Gordon Conference is the interaction between early career\r\nand more established scientists.  This is of benefit both to the early\r\ncareer scientists, who become known in the field, and to the established\r\nscientists, who hear new ideas and innovative research that might otherwise\r\nhave trouble getting noticed.  At this conference one session will be set\r\naside for presentations from early career scientists.  Speakers for this\r\nsession will be selected from among those applying to present posters.\r\nWinners will receive funding from this grant to allow them to attend this\r\nconference.  The winners will be announced at least three weeks ahead of\r\nthe meeting giving winners time to prepare talks.  The competition will be\r\nannounced on the meeting web site and in an email message to everyone who\r\nattended the last two conferences.  The conference vice chair will be\r\nresponsible for selecting the winners and working with the winners to help\r\nmake the most of this opportunity. \r\n",
