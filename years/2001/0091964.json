 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nDenson\r\n0091964\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall electrical signals are critical to normal brain function.  The signals arise because of the movement of electrically charged particles called ions into and out of nerve cells (the most common ions are sodium, potassium, and chloride).   Ion movement into and out of nerve cells is controlled by special proteins on the surface of nerve cells that act as switches and are called ion channels.  We can measure the ion charges that move through one ion channel at a time using sensitive recording methods.  One ion channel type switches on movement of potassium ions: a function that is important for rhythmic activity of repetitively firing nerve cells.  Such cells control repetitive activities like breathing, heart rate, and wakefulness. This project will  investigate two ways by which these potassium ion channel switches are turned on and off.  First, some lipids activate the channels while some do not; we hope to find out why.  Second, molecular biological methods have shown that potassium channel switches appear to vary slightly among different types of nerve cells, but the difference is enough to allow for the  interaction of some potassium channels but not others with other cellular proteins that make turning on the ion channel switches easier.  We hope to investigate the differences and the way that the extra proteins affect potassium channels.\r\n\r\nThis work is important for two reasons.  First, this research will provide an understanding of how fats and other lipids could alter brain function.  Second, this research will describe how some potassium channels are controlled and, therefore, provide an idea of how rhythmic activity in the brain (and its consequences) are regulated.\r\n",
