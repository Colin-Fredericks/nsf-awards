There are not nearly enough trained scientists to do the\r\njob and remote sensing methods have severe limitations for most taxa. This project examines the idea\r\nthat it is now possible to rapidly build communities of people (academic taxonomists, amateur natural\r\nhistorians, environmental educators, concerned citizens and students) and institutions (universities,\r\nenvironmental NGOs, governmental agencies and schools) to produce important scientific data about\r\nbiodiversity. Building monitoring communities is made possible by digital technologies that permit three\r\nkey advances:\r\n1) Rapid Color Guides, the production on demand of high quality yet relatively inexpensive mini color\r\nfield guides (here called Rapid Color Guides, Foster 1998) that will allow amateurs to correctly identify\r\nmany more species in the field.\r\n2) Spatial Coordinates, the ability to accurately record (within a 3 m radius under the best conditions) the\r\nspatial coordinates of individuals or populations using new GPS (Global Positioning System) units.\r\n3) E-Vouchers, the availability of very high quality digital cameras that are field portable and relatively\r\neasy to use that can capture an electronic record of observations in the field.\r\n\r\nAlong with the wide acceptance of the WWW, these advances permit people to gather and share\r\nbiodiversity information in unprecedented ways. Three studies are planned and prototyped to examine\r\nthis general claim. First, the variety of taxa recorded during Massachusetts Biodiversity Days, a three-\r\nday statewide citizen-based effort to monitor biodiversity already established in Massachusetts\r\n(http://data.massgis.state.ma.us/Biodiversity/BiodiversityDays.htm) will be expanded. Taxonomic\r\nspecialists using digital cameras and printers will design Rapid Color Guides for taxa, which are common\r\n(e.g. ants, bumblebees, spiders, weeds) but rarely recorded by observers because of the lack of a suitable\r\nmethod to identify them.\r\n\r\n",
