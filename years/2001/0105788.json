 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Investigator studies intersection theory on and the\r\ncohomological field theory arising from the moduli of algebraic\r\nspin curves and stable spin maps. Especially important in this\r\nstudy is the exploration of the plethora of similarities between\r\nGromov-Witten theory and cohomological field arising from higher\r\nspin curves and spin maps. Also important in this research is the\r\nstudy of the many relations between these cohomological field\r\ntheories and integrable hierarchies, including significant recent\r\nprogress toward proving some remarkable conjectures like the\r\nW-algebra conjecture and Generalized Witten Conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe research in this project is concerned with connections between\r\nalgebraic geometry and physics, and it has implications for both\r\nsubjects.  Algebraic geometry, which is the study of solutions to\r\npolynomial equations, and especially the sub-discipline of\r\nalgebraic curves, which is one of the main foci of this research,\r\nhave many applications.  The most notable of these applications\r\nare in secure electronic communications (cryptography and error\r\ncorrecting codes).  Recent research has shown that algebraic\r\ngeometry also has significant ties to high-energy physics and\r\nplays an important role in helping us understand the fundamental\r\nnature of the universe.  Conversely, physics has helped us better\r\nunderstand some important aspects of algebraic geometry and its\r\napplications.  This research is focused on studying and further\r\ndeveloping some of these important links.",
