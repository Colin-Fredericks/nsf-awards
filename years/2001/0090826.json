 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cell was discovered in the C17th by the Dutch scientist van Leeuwenhoek\r\nwhen he invented the microscope. The use of lenses and microscopes to make\r\nscientific observations has had a profound effect on man's history and his\r\nunderstanding. The discoveries of Galileo, Newton and Einstein are the best\r\nexamples of this. The 1990s were declared the decade of the brain and by\r\ncoincidence, in 1990 a new microscope was invented which allowed scientists\r\nto see far deeper and more clearly into (brain) tissue than ever before.\r\nThis grant is concerned with the development of new chemical compounds that\r\nwill exploit the unique advantages of this microscope for the very first\r\ntime. Specifically, we will use organic chemistry to make the\r\nneurotransmitters that are biologically inert until they are activated by\r\nlight. These molecules can be used to release the neurotransmitter deep\r\ninside cells and so stimulate a single synapse in the brain in a\r\nreproducible and precisely controlled way. The synapse is the basic unit of\r\nall the electrical circuits in the brain. The ability to use these chemicals\r\nto stimulate single synapses in living brains (from mammals such as rats or\r\nmice) will allow us to start to develop realistic theories of the basic\r\nmolecular and cellular mechanisms which underlie neuronal network formation,\r\nlearning and memory.\r\n",
