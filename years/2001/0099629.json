 "awd_abstract_narration": "0099629\r\nSingh\r\n\tThis study will investigate the toughening of highly cross-linked thermosetting polymers by the incorporation of various nanoparticles. A direct fabrication technique will be used to independently control the reinforcement geometry (size, size distribution and morphology), reinforcement material, reinforcement volume fraction, and interfacial adhesion characteristics. The effects of these reinforcement parameters, on the fracture mechanisms, fracture toughness and material response, will be characterized by direct experimentation. Based on this fundamental characterization analytical/numerical models will be developed to predict the overall material response and toughness. \r\n\tThe education component of this investigation is targeted towards increased integration between undergraduate education and research with special emphasis on increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in engineering. Undergraduate students will be recruited to work on various tasks relevant to the research component. At the same time, specific research findings and projects will be introduced into undergraduate courses that focus on the behavior of materials. Also, students will make periodic visits to local high schools and setup in-house laboratory demonstrations.  These activities will expose high school students to the excitement and challenges of innovative materials based on cutting-edge nanotechnology. Finally, results from the education and research activities will be published regularly on a dedicated web page, which will enable concurrent feedback and interaction unlike traditional paper-based publication.\r\n***",
