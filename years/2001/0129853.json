 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will be devoted to the growth of III-V diluted magnetic semi-\r\nconductors (III-V DMSs) ternary compounds in which the anions are re-\r\nplaced with a member of the 3d-transition group. The motivation and goal of\r\nthe program are to explore and establish the conditions for successful growth\r\nof single crystals which will be materials suitable for investigating the ex-\r\ntraordinary physical phenomena originating in the large magnetic moments\r\nof 3d-transition-ion (3d-TMI) and their role as acceptors. The simultaneous\r\npresence of free holes and the large magnetic moments provide the ingredi-\r\nents for novel phenomena associated with spin-polarized charge carriers. The\r\ngrowth will initially focus on the incorporation of Mn, Co and Fe into GaAs,\r\nInP, GaP and InSb by thermal diffusion and melt growth.  Spectroscopic\r\n(Fourier Transform Infrared, Raman and photoluminescence, modulated re-\r\nflectivity/transmission and magneto optic characterization at Purdue and\r\nthose based on magnetic, electron-paramagnetic-resonance, and non-linear\r\nspectroscopy by international collaborators will provide invaluable feedback\r\nto the crystal grower. Another collaboration will address the production of\r\nultrapure starting material and fabrication of substrates suitable for molec-\r\nular beam epitaxy (MBE). Basic science and device related work will be ini-\r\ntiated during this phase.  Besides the crystal growth program implemented\r\nby the Co-PI, students will participate in the characterization activities and\r\nwill acquire a healthy appreciation of growth techniques. This exposure and\r\ninvolvement will prepare them for the scientific/technical workforce of the\r\n21st century.\r\n\r\n   The aim of the program is to provide a \"steady state-\" supply of well\r\ncharacterized III-V diluted magnetic semiconductors to our ongoing research\r\non collective and localized excitations of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic\r\ncharacter.  The access to bulk single crystals as well as material as MBE-\r\ngrown epilayers and quantum well structures will give the participants the\r\nintense excitement of basic research significant in device applications.\r\n\r\n",
