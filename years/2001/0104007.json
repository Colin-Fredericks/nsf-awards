Schoen, of constrained variational\r\nproblems for lagrangian cycles. In its most basic form the problem \r\ncan be posed as follows: Consider a symplectic\r\nmanifold with a metric compatible with the symplectic form. Fix a \r\nhomology class that can be represented by a lagrangian cycle. \r\nFind a lagrangian cycle that minimizes volume \r\namong all lagrangian cycles representing this class and derive optimal regularity of this cycle. \r\nIn the case that the symplectic manifold is Kaehler,\r\nwith Kaehler-Einstein metric, sufficient regularity of the minimizer \r\nimplies that the minimizer is both lagrangian and minimal (zero mean curvature). \r\nIf the first Chern class is negative such submanifolds could be unique, in a suitable sense,\r\nand then useful in understanding the geometry of the ambient manifold. \r\nIf the Kaehler manifold is a Calabi-Yau manifold sufficient regularity implies \r\nthat the minimizer is a calibrated submanifold, a special lagrangian submanifold.\r\nWe propose to investigate the existence and regularity of this and \r\nrelated varitional problems and to study the consequences of these results on the\r\ngeometry of Kaehler-Einstein manifolds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA consequence of the proposal is an existence theorem for special \r\nlagrangian submanifolds of a Calabi-Yau manifold.\r\nThis result is an essential part of the program proposed by \r\nStrominger-Yau-Zaslow for the geometric construction of \"mirror\r\nsymmetry\". Mirror symmetry is one of the most interesting and \r\nimportant problems currently being studied in mathematics and \r\ntheoretical physics. At its core it proposes a duality between a class of \r\nmanifolds called Calabi-Yau manifolds. This duality allows \r\ncomputations to be performed on one manifold that yield a result for its \"mirror\". \r\nThus computations that are otherwise extremely difficult can be achieved.\r\nThe realization of mirror symmetry will effect such diverse subjects \r\nas algebraic geometry, differential geometry, topology, partial \r\ndifferential  equations and string theory.\r\nThe current interest in this subject helps bridge the gap between \r\nphysics and mathematics. In two-dimensions our proposal has some \r\nclose analogies to a well-known model problem\r\nin non-linear elasticity. The regularity theory developed here will \r\nshed light on the difficult regularity problems of that theory. \r\nFinally this problem is the first attempt to make a systematic study \r\nof a variational problem with a geometric constaint. \r\nThis idea will have other important applications in \r\ngeometry and its applications.\r\n",
