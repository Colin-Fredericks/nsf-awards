 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the tremendous growth of the Internet and the ability to transport information at very high data\r\nrates has come the realization that traditional assumptions on the stochastic nature of network traffic\r\nows are inadequate. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that long-range-dependence is\r\nan important characteristic of traffic ows in current networking infrastructures. On the other hand,\r\nthe performance of networks and their ability to offer Quality of Service (QoS) depend on accurately\r\ncapturing (and exploiting) probabilistically rare phenomena. Studies of network performance with\r\nlong-range-dependent inputs are still very much in their infancy, and to-date have addressed only the\r\ncomputation stationary buffer over ow probabilities.\r\n     In contrast, there is a crucial need to study the rare excursions of the underlying stochastic pro-\r\ncesses which capture the salient characteristics of network ows, and to understand how such excursions\r\naffect network dynamics. These issues are important from the point of view of transient characteristics\r\nof networks. For example the QoS perceived by users depends not only on the magnitude of loss but\r\nhow it takes place. In some applications consecutive losses even if rare can make transmissions to be\r\nseverely degraded while in TCP, losing a small number packets often can result in deterioration in\r\nperformance. To study these effects we must develop new results on the duration of over ows and the\r\namount of information lost during typical over ows.\r\n     The goal of our research is to provide analytic insights, quantify performance, develop approaches\r\nto measure relevant traffic parameters and provide rules-of-thumb for use in resource management and\r\nscheduling traffic in networks with long-range dependent characteristics to meet QoS requirements.\r\nThe specific tasks that will be pursued to achieve our objectives are:\r\n    Study the buffer over ow asymptotics for multi-buffered systems with heterogeneous longtailed\r\n    inputs.\r\n    Develop results for the heterogeneous sub-exponential case.\r\n    Characterize the transient behavior during over ow periods for systems with longtailed and\r\n    sub-exponential inputs with a view to understanding actual QoS given to users.\r\n    Develop methods for differentiating between traffic types and estimating relevant parameters.\r\n   Incorporate the insights obtained from the above analyses into our overall objective to define\r\n   engineering rules for resource management and scheduling various types of sessions in networks.\r\n     As a result of these investigations we will have a complete catalog of results to handle the very\r\ndiverse types of traffic which are present in networks. By considering both the stationary and transient\r\ncharacteristics we will provide insights on the dynamics of loss which is essential to provide fine tuning\r\nin order to deliver QoS at the application/user level which stationary analyses do not provide.\r\n     The research spans fundamental modeling and analysis as well as statistical testing. On the theo-\r\nretical side the implications go beyond the traffic engineering context and are expected to contribute\r\nto applied probability, queueing analysis and asymptotic approximation. On the applications side, the\r\nproposed work will provide insights and results of potential use in next generation networks.",
