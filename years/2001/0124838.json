It is modeled on the extremely\r\nsuccessful European mathematics centers in Oberwolfach and\r\nLuminy, and the US physics center in Aspen.  It is a\r\ncollaborative Canada-US venture. BIRS will pursue an extremely\r\nbroad program, embracing all aspects of the mathematical\r\nsciences, from the most fundamental work on the great problems of\r\nalgebra, geometry and analysis to modern pure and applied\r\nmathematics, theoretical and applied statistics, financial and\r\nindustrial mathematics, the mathematics of information technology\r\nand computer science, and bio-mathematics. Conferences on math\r\neducation, and Schools ranging in level from high-school to\r\npostgraduate will also be regular features.\r\n\r\nA conference center in Germany called Oberwolfach has played an\r\nenormously important role mathematics for more than half a\r\ncentury.  Conferences there bring the greatest mathematicians\r\nfrom around the world to Germany, and this flow of people and\r\nideas is often credited with aiding the quick recovery of German\r\nmathematics from the devastation it suffered during the war.  It\r\nalso helped by introducing generations of graduate students to\r\nthe great men in their fields and to each other.  The Oberwolfach\r\nmodel was so successful that the French eventually copied it at\r\nthe center in Luminy.  Senior US mathematicians are often\r\nvisitors to these centers, but often graduate students and\r\nyounger mathematicians from the United States and Canada are not\r\ninvited, and there are many other ways in which those centers\r\nbenefit Europe much more than the US. The physics center in Aspen\r\nhas provided a resource for the US physics community that has\r\nprovided related services, and the mathematicians who happen to\r\nhave been involved have been impressed with what can be done in\r\nthis mode. It has long been a dream of North American\r\nmathematicians to have a conference center of their own that\r\nwould provide similar opportunities here, and the goal of the\r\nBanff International Research Station is to provide this important\r\nresource for mathematics and related fields.",
