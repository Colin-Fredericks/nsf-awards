 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study questions in the deformation\r\ntheory of global Galois representations. Let a two\r\ndimensional mod p Galois representation be given.\r\nSerre has conjectured this representation \"comes from\"\r\na modular form. His conjecture necessarily implies the mod p \r\nGalois representation is the mod p reduction of some p-adic\r\nGalois representation. The author plans to continue his\r\nstudy of whether such deformations exist independently of\r\nSerre's Conjecture, and if they can \r\nbe arranged to be potentially semistable in the sense of Fontaine. \r\nSuch constructions, especially combined with recent work of Taylor,\r\ncould be regarded as providing evidence for Serre's Conjecture.\r\nThere are interesting cases that are still open, such as reducible\r\nresidual representations and representations of the absolute\r\nGalois group of totally real fields.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research falls under the general area of Number Theory,\r\nwhich has its roots in the study of whole numbers and their \r\nvarious properties. Natural questions that arise in this field, \r\nsuch as properties of prime numbers and how frequently they occur,\r\ncan have applications to coding theory and cryptography. The proposed\r\nresearch is also related to Galois Theory, the study of symmetries\r\nof solutions to equations. Studying these symmetries\r\ncan shed light on the understanding their solutions, a\r\nbasic mathematical question.\r\n",
