 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"New techniques for analyzing the representation of auditory stimulus features by ensembles of cortical neurons.\"  This project is concerned with the analysis of stimulus-related information contained in firing patterns of ensembles of 16 or more simultaneously-recorded neurons in auditory cortex.  Statistical pattern recognition techniques are used to characterize relationships between the acoustic properties of sounds in space and information-bearing features of neural responses.\r\n\r\n",
