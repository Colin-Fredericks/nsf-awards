 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently combinatorial methods have played important role in mathematical research.  The theory of symmetric polynomials and other (non-symmetric) classical polynomials is particular important due to its applications in topology, representation theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory as well as mathematical physics.  Schur polynomials and Schubert polynomials stand out as one of the major combinatorial objects in connections with  the enumerative geometry of manifolds, Yang-Baxter equations, Hecke algebras and quantum groups.  In order to make this area of investigation accessible to a wide audience we are holding an NSF/CBMS regional conference on Algebraic Combinatorics at North Carolina State University in Raleigh during June 4-8, 2001. The principal speaker is Professor Alain Lascoux, from Universite de Marne-la-Vallee, who will give a series of 10 lectures on ``Multivariate Polynomials''.  As a leading figure in algebraic combinatorics, Professor Lascoux (himself and jointly with his coauthors) developed many key concepts and tools in this field. During the 10-hour lectures he will present the theories\r\nof multi-Schur functions, lambda-rings, divided differences as well as applications to Yang-Baxter equations.  The lecture notes of Prof. Lascoux will be published by CBMS within one year after the conference. The conference's main purpose is to attract newcomers and the secondary purpose is to provide a venue of discussions for experts.",
