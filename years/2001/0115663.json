 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Focused Research Group (FRG) will investigate the fundamental role of disorder as major factor underlying the structure and dynamics of molecules, films and bulk quantum systems.  The investigative technique is precision neutron scattering at the Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble and at ISIS, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK, currently the leading neutron facilities in the world.  The goal in education is training in neutron scattering for graduate students and post doctoral associates in preparation for the Spallation Neutron Source being built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and to develop lasting collaborations in Europe for young scientists.  The scientific topics include the location, orientation, tunneling and diffusion of simple and polar molecules on smooth and chemically active surfaces (e.g. MgO), and on rough novel materials (e.g. nanotubes), investigating helium and hydrogen film growth, layer transitions, layer modes on surfaces and the characteristic three dimensional excitations of bulk quantum fluids in fully filled porous media.  An aim is to relate excitations to structure (e.g. gaps in modes to localization) in one dimensional (1D), 2D and 3D disordered quantum  systems and the existence of well-defined modes to Bose Einstein condensation and superfluidity.  The underlying physics has analogies in high Tc superconductivity and application in catalysis and porous media development.  The graduate students and post-docs participating in this project will benefit from the international collaborations and the use of cutting edge research tools.  They will be exceptionally well trained for careers in academe, industry and government.  This project is co-funded by the International Division of the Social, Behavioral and Economics Directorate and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research is dedicated to revealing the impact of disorder on the structure and dynamics of molecules, films and bulk quantum systems.  The investigative technique is precision neutron scattering at the Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble, France and at ISIS, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK which are currently the best neutron facilities in the world.  The goal in education is to provide broad training in neutron scattering for graduate students and post doctoral associates so that they can capitalize on the outstanding new scientific opportunities that will be created by the Spallation Neutron Source now being built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It is also to develop lasting scientific collaborations in Europe for young scientists.  The scientific topics begin with the location, orientation, tunneling and diffusion of molecules on surfaces; surfaces of materials that are important as catalysts in chemical reactions (e.g. MgO) and structurally important materials (e.g. nanotubes).  They continue to the investigation of film growth, layer transitions, layer modes and the dynamics of three dimensional quantum fluids in porous media and their to relation Bose Einstein condensation.  The underlying science has analogies in high temperature superconductors and the motivations run from basic concepts in disordered systems to tailoring catalysts and developing new porous materials.  The graduate students and post-docs participating in this project will benefit from the international collaborations and the use of cutting edge research tools.  They will be exceptionally well trained for careers in academe, industry and government.
