 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Florida A&M University will sponsor a Research Experience for Undergraduates titled, the Florida A&M University Inter-Disciplinary Research Experience for Undergraduates (FAMU-IREU).  Participants will consist of undergraduate students majoring in chemistry, biology, physics, computer science, engineering and mathematics.  The FAMU-IREU will be offered to students who will be classified as juniors or seniors during the following Academic Year.  Participants will work in teams to solve real-world problems.   Each team will consist of participants from different disciplines.  Team members will blend the theories from these disciplines to develop and analyze solutions to complex problems taken from scientific, industrial and governmental organizations. Each team will develop a research paper that includes computer simulations and analyses.  \r\n\r\nThe FAMU-IREU Program will begin on May 15, and end on July 31.  Participants will be recruited from predominantly undergraduate universities throughout the United States.  Based on the local cost of living, each participant will receive $1,200.00 for housing and meals. Each participant in the will receive a stipend in the amount of $2,200.00 and some support for travel to and from the FAMU-IREU Program.  The point of contact person is Dr. Roselyn Williams, Department of Mathematics, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida 32307, PH (850) 599-3595, E-mail rwilliams3@famu.edu.\r\n",
