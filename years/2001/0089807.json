Efrimov of the University of Central Florida and Dr. Laurent Sarger of the Unviersity of Bordeaux I and the Center for Molecular, Optical and Oscillation Physics.  The proposal addresses problems related to the selffocusing of laser beams that result in damage to the laser's optical components.  One of the most important parameters of optical materials used in multi-channel laser systems is the nonlinear refractive index (n2), which drives the selffocusing process.  Materials, which have low n2 values, such as fused silica, may reduce damage during\r\nlaser beam transport and focusing. In this collaboration the investigators will compare the nonlinear refractive index for samples of fused silica fabricated with different technologies and the linear optical and spectral properties of the samples. They will also determine the features of linear and nonlinear optical properties fluctuations.  The project takes advantage of US and French complementary expertise in the fields of linear and nonlinear optical properties, laser-induced breakdown, structure, and technology of silicate glasses.  The joint efforts will advance understanding of the principle of high quality fused silica selection for optical components in multi-channel high-power laser systems.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover the expenses of visits of US investigators. The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States.\r\n",
