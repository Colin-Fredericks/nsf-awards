 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 00-119.  This Nanoscale Exploratory Research award is part of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI).  It will exploit self-assembly of block copolymers of styrene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene into a core-shell cylinder-in-cylinder morphology, followed by crosslinking of poly(cyclohexadiene) (PCHD) and removal of the polystyrene (PS) segments, as a means for producing novel functionalized PCHD nanotubes.  PCHD may be aromatized to poly(phenylene) (PP), a strong, crystalline, and thermally stable engineering polymer.  As an alternative, PCHD can be carbonized by pyrolysis.  These materials will be thoroughly characterized in terms of their sized, shapes, surface chemistry and mechanical properties.  To conduct this work, an interdisciplinary collaboration between the polymer chemistry group of Dr. Jimmy Mays (University of Alabama at Birmingham, UAB) and the polymer physics/morphology group of Professor Sam Gido (University of Massachusetts, UMass) is proposed.\r\n%%%\r\nComposites incorporating such nanotubes could lead to a new class of robust, lightweight, high strength materials.  By controlling molecular weight and processing conditions, we should be able to create nanotubes of varying radius, wall thickness, and aspect ration.  By varying the composition of the block copolymer, other shapes besides tubes (cylinders, plates) can also be made.  Reactive hydroxyl groups present on the surface of these molecular objects can be used to manipulate their processing characteristics and to provide strong bonding to matrix materials.  The PP nanotubes may be insulating or they may be made conducting by doping.  Such materials could be used as component in a smart composite designed to transmit an electronic signal, for example, if impacted.  Opto-electronic, nanoprobe, and medical applications are also envisioned for these materials.\r\n",
