 "awd_abstract_narration": "CRHSP-28 is a novel Ca 2+ -sensitive regulatory protein, abundant in epithelial cells that are\r\nspecialized in exocrine protein secretion. This includes Paneth cells that secrete antimicrobial\r\npeptides, chief and pancreatic cells that secrete digestive enzymes, lacrimal cells for corneal\r\nfunction and goblet cells that secrete mucin for tissue barrier protection. Introduction of\r\nrecombinant CRHSP-28 into permeabilized acinar cells completely reverses the decreased Ca 2+ -dependent\r\nsecretory capacity caused by the leakage of cytosolic proteins from the cell interior,\r\nindicating a direct role for CRHSP-28 in the secretory pathway. Consistent with a coiled coil\r\ninteraction motif near its amino terminus, CRHSP-28 exists as a dimer in cytosolic extracts, and\r\nis associated with a large molecular complex in membrane/cytoskeleton fractions. Further,\r\nCRHSP-28 is concentrated around secretory granules in the apical regions of exocrine cells, and\r\nspecifically associates with a 70 kDa binding protein (pp70) that co-purifies with secretory\r\ngranule membranes. Significantly, soluble forms of this binding protein associate with taxol-stabilized\r\nmicrotubules when analyzed in the absence of Ca 2+ ; however, when exposed to\r\nelevated Ca 2+ , pp70 undergoes a complete translocation to an actin-rich detergent insoluble\r\nfraction. Based on biochemical and immunohistochemical data, CRHSP-28 and its associated\r\nproteins are proposed to regulate the delivery and movement of secretory granules through the\r\nsubapical actin cytoskeleton in a Ca 2+ /calmodulin dependent manner. The triggering mechanism\r\nfor this effect is theorized to entail the acute serine phosphorylation of CRHSP-28 by the\r\nmultifunctional CaM kinase II. Thus, the primary objective of this project is to elucidate the\r\nprecise biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which this novel CRHSP-28-mediated\r\npathway regulates Ca 2+ -stimulated exocrine secretion. The Specific Aims of this project are:\r\n1). To test the idea that the Ca2+/calmodulin regulated phosphorylation of CRHSP-28 is a\r\nkey signaling mechanism by which the protein modulates secretion. Experiments will first\r\naddress the identity of the Ca 2+ -sensitive serine phosphorylation sites on CRHSP-28.\r\nPhosphorylation sites will be mapped in vitro and in intact cells, and verified by transfection of\r\nphosphorylation mutants into cultured T84 cells. The effects of normal and mutated forms of\r\nCRHSP-28 will then be evaluated for their ability to alter secretagogue-stimulated mucin release\r\nfrom these cells. Similarly, CRHSP-28 mutants will be expressed and purified in bacteria and\r\ntested in permeabilized acinar cells to assess their effects on digestive enzyme secretion.\r\n2). To evaluate the concept that CRHSP-28 functions in the secretory pathway of exocrine\r\ncells through dynamic interactions with other key regulatory proteins. These studies will be\r\ncentered on identifying the molecular identity of the 70 kDa CRHSP-28 binding protein that \r\ncopurifies with secretory granule membranes, binds to taxol-stabilized microtubules,\r\nand translocates to detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fractions in the presence of elevated Ca 2+ .\r\nCRHSP-28 affinity chromatography and cDNA library screening will be used as purification\r\ntechniques. Following cloning, tagged proteins will be expressed in cells to characterize the\r\nmolecular interactions of CRHSP-28 with itself (as a dimer) and the 70 kDa binding protein\r\nusing coimmunoprecipitations and dual immunofluorescence labeling. This approach will allow\r\nfor identification of the specific sites that mediate these interactions, as well as the effects of\r\nsecond messengers and phosphorylation in regulating binding. Complementary studies will be\r\nconducted using tagged recombinant proteins for in vitro binding assays. Identification and\r\ncharacterization of CRHSP-28 protein interactions within the cell is key to understanding its\r\nregulatory function.\r\n",
