 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Clemson University GK-12 Project is to improve student performance and the teaching of mathematics and science in the middle grades in Title I and \"impaired\" schools in the school districts of Anderson and Pickens county through the use of inquiry based learning exemplifying a standards-based approach. Benefits are to improve the perception of K-12 mathematics and science education among professional graduate scientists and mathematicians in academe and industry, to increase knowledgeable participation and support by scientists and mathematicians of K-12 education; to improve the perception of collegiate education and the professorate among professional K-12 teachers and administrators, and to improve the teaching skills of graduate students in mathematics and science disciplines through practice and training in the inquiry method with practice in the K-12 arena. Benefits to the teachers include a stipend, content resource support, graduate credit, improved laboratory equipment and manipulatives, and role models for their students. The University will benefit through closer ties with the local schools. The Fellows will have improved presentation skills through mentoring from the teachers.  Graduate students in Biological Sciences, Computer Science, Geological Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics will undergo in-depth training in teaching methods, familiarization with South Carolina frameworks and performance standards, a series of seminars with their mentoring teacher to develop demonstration lessons and ways in which the Fellows will provide content resources for NSF sponsored exemplary curricula, several of which have been developed at Clemson University. Fellows will team with mentoring teachers to provide professional development to colleagues in their schools.\r\n\r\n",
