 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe goal of this project is to determine how pink salmon in the northern Gulf of Alaska are affected by variation in the plankton production system during their first months at sea. This will be accomplished through an integrated project that includes field sampling, laboratory analyses and modeling. Pink salmon occupy surface waters of the continental shelf in the summer and fall after entering marine waters in the spring. In that period they grow rapidly and their feeding changes from small zooplankton in the summer to large zooplankton in the fall. This project will document temporal and spatial variation in prey use and availability, it will assess the effects of the shelf environment by measuring condition of pink salmon, and it will use spatially- explicit foraging/bioenergetic modeling to understand observed patterns in feeding, growth and condition. Fish of hatchery origin, identified by thermal otolith marks, will be of particular interest, as the marine survival of each hatchery cohort will be available a year after those fish enter the marine environment.\r\n\r\nSpatial and temporal variation in pink salmon diets and surface zooplankton will be described through laboratory analyses of field samples, and the basis for diet shifts to larger prey will be determined by calculations of prey selectivity. Standard length/weight condition measures will be calculated, and the energy content of salmon will be measured by calorimetry. The relationship between condition, growth and the environment will be examined. Habitat quality over the continental shelf will be assessed with spatially explicit models with foraging and bioenergetic components that produce weight- specific estimates of growth potential. Bioenergetic modeling will also be used to estimate daily ration and seasonal consumption by pink salmon. The relationship between diets of pink salmon and other planktivorous fishes will be assessed.\r\n\r\nThis research will contribute directly to accomplishment of the GLOBEC program goal of understanding how production of upper trophic level species is linked to variation in oceanographic conditions. It is widely accepted that production of salmon in the GOA is determined by planktonic production. Detailed descriptions of spatial and temporal variation in diet, prey availability, temperature, and fish condition will substantially enhance our understanding of the connections between the marine environment and salmon production.\r\n\r\n",
