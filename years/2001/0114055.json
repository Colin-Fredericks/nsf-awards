This will comprise the initial (phase I) technician support for this laboratory that is under the supervision of Dr. Brad Singer. The new technician will be a full-time employee whose responsibilities shall include: (1) day-to-day operation and maintenance of ultra-high vacuum, mass spectrometry, laser, furnace, electronic, and computer systems, (2) scheduling analytical work, training students and outside users, (3) supervision of sample preparation, including training and oversight of graduate students, (4) irradiation and safe handling of radioactive and hazardous materials, (5) development of the UW-Madison nuclear reactor for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, (6) completing computer automation of the gas extraction and mass spectrometry system that was built by Dr. Singer, and (7) archiving and management of analytical data. In addition, the new technician will assist in implementing capabilities for the measurement of radiogenic 4He and cosmogenic 3He. The laboratory is currently engaged in, or beginning, several research projects that span many Earth Science disciplines and involve faculty plus graduate or undergraduate students from UW-Madison or collaboration with other institutions. The technician will contribute to bringing the laboratory  from its developmental state to one of full productivity.  Moreover, the technician will help to expand the capabilities of current equipment so that the laboratory may fulfill its potential in both geo- and thermo-chronology.\r\n***\r\n",
