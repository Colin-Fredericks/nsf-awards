The researchers will be undertaking a study of new insights to borate glasses: structural changes induced under high pressure; and short range and intermediate range order deduced from spectroscopy and properties.  The objective of the study is to systematically characterize the physical properties and atomic arrangements in these glass systems.  Density, thermal properties, optical transmission, time of flight mass spectroscopy, infrared, Raman, NMR, NQR, and neutron scattering measurements have been performed on glasses to learn about the atomic arrangements present and the quantitative relationships of the physical properties to the structure.  The understanding of the novel processing technique (solution chemistry, rapid cooling, and shock compression) on the values of the intrinsic physical properties contributes to revealing the structure of the glass network.  This combined with looking at the intermediate range order by spectroscopic observation has a potential of good insight into the glass structure.  Undergraduate students in both the U.S. and Japan will be involved in the joint research. The project brings together the efforts of four laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific meetings.\r\n",
