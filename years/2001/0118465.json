 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Adria LaViolette, Lynn Koplin will direct archaeological\r\nexcavations at Gede on the Kenyan coast, where she is conducting research\r\nfor her doctoral dissertation.  The project examines social\r\ndifferentiation in areas of earth-and-thatch domestic architecture at the\r\nmajor 11th-16th-century Swahili stonetown site.  Because archaeologists have\r\nprimarily concentrated on the stone components of these large,\r\narchitecturally-mixed sites, currently little is known about activities,\r\ndiet and material culture among the majority, the inhabitants of earthen\r\ndwellings, often assumed to have been undifferentiated non-elites.  The\r\nproposed research will compare frequency and spatial organization of craft\r\nproduction, diet and wealth between stone and earth-and-thatch components of\r\nthe same town, with a view to elucidating social differentiation within\r\nearth-and-thatch areas.  When the distribution of activities and goods in\r\nnon-stone neighborhoods are better understood, spatial variation in\r\nproduction and consumption may suggest axes of social differentiation, with\r\nwhich to trace social reorganization through time.\r\n\r\nThe need to focus on intrasite variation, expressed in\r\narchaeologically-recoverable forms of production and consumption, is\r\nimportant as archaeologists attempt to elucidate indigenous forms of social\r\ncomplexity in sub-Saharan Africa.  This is especially important as it\r\nrelates to Swahili society, which until recently was attributed to external\r\nfactors.  This research is part of a new impetus on a larger level to search\r\nwithin Africa for the constitutive dynamics of African societies, and on\r\nSwahili sites in general this requires dismantling monolithic conceptions of\r\nthe society by examining the overlooked majority, those in non-stone\r\ndwellings.  Beyond the level of Swahili archaeology, this research draws on\r\nand will contribute to archaeological literature on the East African Iron\r\nAge, rise of complex societies, spatial organization and activity areas. \r\nThe changes that accompanied the foundation, growth, contraction and\r\nabandonment of Gede fit into the larger history of the Iron Age\r\nefflorescence on the continent, and Africanist archaeologists are attempting\r\nto fill out the magnitude of activities such as pottery making, increased\r\ntrade, specialized production, farming and other foodways that accompanied\r\nsocial expansion.  Additionally, preliminary insights into the principles\r\norganizing neighborhoods of earthen architecture will engage the\r\nanthropological debates on spatial organization.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
