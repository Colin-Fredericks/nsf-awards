 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific component of this CAREER activity focuses on experiments and theoretical approaches that explore the importance of noise and randomness in two biological systems:  (i) the actin propulsion engine and (ii) stochastic gene expression in bacteria.   The goal of the first project is to unravel the biophysical mechanism of force generation and self-organization of polymerizing actin filaments.  Theoretical efforts will focus on developing realistic models that incorporate the recent biochemical data of actin propulsion engines.  In a synergistic manner, experiments will be performed that explore the propulsion of well-defined cargo such as polystyrene beads, phospholipid vesicles, and micro-fabricated cylinders.   The main goal of the second project is to quantitatively understand stochastic gene expression in prokaryotic cells.  Using analytical and numerical tools, stochastic expression will be modeled theoretically.  The theories will be tested by exploring stochastic gene expression of single genes and simple genetic networks in prokaryotic cells using fluorescent reporter proteins.   The educational component of the activity focuses on the development of an infrastructure for biophysics at MIT thorough a number of different mechanisms, including a new seminar series, new courses, and journal clubs.  This award is jointly supported by the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.",
