 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop new reagents subject to thermal activation for bonding water-soluble microbicidal polymers and surfactants to the lumen surface of a variety of opaque tubing materials at temperatures compatible with the plastics.  Materials have been developed with bulk physical properties needed for transport of water and aqueous mixtures; however, the development of biofilm on the wet surfaces is a continuing serious problem in the dental, pharmaceutical, food processing, and marine transport industries.  Surface modification of water lines could decrease the formation of biofilm while retaining the desired bulk properties of the tubing.  Photochemistry has been proven commercially successful in enhancing the surface properties of medical devices with radical-based surface modification initiated by RF plasma or ultraviolet light.  However, these energy sources are not effective for modification the inner surfaces of 'opaque' tubes such as water lines used with dental units and plastic plumbing in pharmaceutical plants.  This project is designed to develop latent-reactive radical generators activatible with external source energy that penetrates these 'opaque' devices.  This innovative approach to scheduled activation of radical generators is expected to facilitate the coupling to many 'inert' surfaces that cannot be activated with external light or plasma sources.\r\n\r\nMicrobial colonization and biofilm formation remain a major cost and threat to human health and product quality for dental and pharmaceutical industries, health care and public lodging, and marine vessel utilization.  Successful development of microbicidal and antifouling coating technology for the luminal surface of opaque transport and storage vessels for aqueous liquid ingestible products, constitute a significant market.\r\n",
