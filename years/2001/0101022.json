The proposed \r\nresearch is to develop an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach initiated very \r\nrecently. A main object of study in this approach is a diffusive Lagrangian \r\npath inverse that allows a natural formulation, including a viscous \r\nanalogue of the inviscid Cauchy formula. The solution is built using a \r\nproduct expansion near the identity transformation. It is proposed to study \r\nthis construction and apply it to randomly forced flows. In addition, the \r\nstudy of quenching of flames by strong random flows in turbulent \r\ncombustion is proposed.\r\n\r\nFluids and plasmas exhibit many active scales of motion, and are \r\nnotoriously difficult to compute and predict accurately. The reason is that \r\nthe equations describing them are not well understood. It is proposed to \r\nstudy mathematically the processes of transport of momentum and heat \r\nunder extreme conditions\r\n",
