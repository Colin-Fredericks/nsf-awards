 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) \r\nThis proof-of-concept project is designing an interdisciplinary curriculum to educate students from diverse disciplines about environmental management systems (EMS). The primary goal is to help students understand the importance of environmental issues through an integrated approach drawing on science, business/economic, legal, social, and engineering concepts. EMS are \"next generation\" responses to pollution prevention that go beyond environmental regulatory compliance by integrating science, quality management and systems engineering practices to improve environmental performance. As such, the project applies selected science, business and engineering applications to an issue of broad public interest and concern. The first core activity of the project is the development of a model curriculum so that students can better understand the benefits of environmental management in real-world settings by interacting with faculty from diverse disciplines and with professionals from engineering, sciences, and business. Working with a group of universities and companies, the project team is designing and testing interdisciplinary learning modules on EMS. These learning modules are being designed for face-to-face as well as web-based delivery and include a variety of active learning strategies such as class discussions, case studies, and internships. The project advisory group, composed of faculty from academic institutions, and business and environmental practitioners, play a central role in the design, evaluation, and dissemination of the materials. The project is engaged in both formative and summative evaluation activities, including evaluations by the advisory group, students, practitioners, project evaluators, and participating partners. A second core activity is designing outreach efforts to diverse student populations. To facilitate outreach, project deliverables are being disseminated through a variety of means including the project website, presentations, publications, advisory group follow-up, and informational sources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
