 "awd_abstract_narration": "BES-0093513\r\nCostello\r\nAs we begin the 21st century, we do so with the realization that the traditional engineering\r\nof previous decades is changing at a rapid pace. To keep in line with the advances in technology,\r\nwe are constantly adapting, improvising, and developing new strategies that enable us to\r\napproach engineering research and education as an integrated system in touch with the\r\ntechnological advances around us. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to use the\r\ninterdisciplinary background of the PI to address the multi-faceted needs of today's engineer by\r\nengaging them in research and education at the interface of engineering and science.\r\nWork in the PI's lab is focused on the application of molecular and microbiological\r\ntechniques to the study of natural and engineered systems. The PIs  model system is the methane oxidizing bacteria, or methanotrophs. Methanotrophs are ubiquitous throughout terrestrial and aquatic environments and are important in the global carbon cycle, climate change, and the remediation of hazardous wastes. Because of this, they provide an interesting framework within which to ask questions that integrate science and engineering in both research and education. \r\nIn this proposal, the PI has developed a long-term educational plan that coordinates directly with her interests in the research of methane oxidizing bacteria. The PI will redesign a suite of core classes in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department that will focus on educating engineering students in the concepts of modern biology by integrating biology into the curricula in the context of engineering topics. In addition, she will foster collaborative, multi-disciplinary educational and research interactions with engineering and science departments at Syracuse University. The effectiveness of these undertakings will be measured using a number of\r\nassessment tools and an independent advisory board established by the PI.\r\nIn addition to educational initiatives, this project will enable students to carry out\r\ninterdisciplinary research characterizing population shifts in methane-oxidizing bacteria in\r\nresponse to soil acidification. A combination of molecular biology and environmental\r\nengineering tools will be used to test the hypothesis that natural acidic deposition (acid rain)\r\nexerts selective pressure on methanotrophic diversity and is a significant factor in controlling\r\nchanges in the methane oxidation characteristics of natural populations of these bacteria.\r\nSpecific questions to be answered include 1) What are the dominant methanotrophs present in\r\nsoils of the Adirondack mountains and 2) How do natural methanotroph populations respond to\r\nacidification of their environment? Answering these questions will expose students to various\r\ntheories, techniques, and experiences that span both engineering and science disciplines. ***\r\n",
