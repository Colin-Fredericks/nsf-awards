 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will identify and overcome the difficulty associated with the reliable operation of MEMS devices, RF-MEMS in particular. This objective is addressed through the integrated modeling of  electromagnetic/thermal/mechanical couplings in MEMS devices, experimental validation of the model, and quantification of the coupling effects for device reliability.\r\n\r\nTo meet the need of simulating RF MEMS, the proposal research aims at the development of an integrated multi-physics model and its experimental verification. Research issues are 1) what is the coupling among electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical effects in MEMS, 2) what numerical solution algorithms are suitable for an integrated multi-domain model, 3) what types of experiments can effectively verify the multi-domain coupling models. Each research issue is approached as follows (in numerical order):\r\n\r\n1. The model will be developed for 1) Joule heating caused by RF excitation, 2) thermal strain caused by temperature change, 3) electrostatic pressure caused by the electric field, and 4) electric charge redistribution caused by mechanical deformation.\r\n\r\n2. Considering the size and possible ill-condition of the FE matrix resulting from the proposed multi-physics model, the incomplete LU (ILU) preconditioner developed by a PI, will be used with robust solvers based on GMRES.\r\n\r\n3. The direct observation of temperature distribution of a RF-MEMS switch during its operation will be done using a high resolution infrared imaging system and a high-speed digital signal analyzer, to verify the developed coupling model.\r\n\r\nThis project combines our modeling and experimental expertise in electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical science and engineering to address the highly multidisciplinary reliability problems associated with RF MEMS applications.  Our theoretical and experimental tasks are very complementary to each other and will serve well to achieve our research goals. The aimed simulation tool, combined with our experimental capabilities, will help us develop RF MEMS with high performance and reliability, and will significantly contribute to technologies related to wireless telecommunications.\r\n",
