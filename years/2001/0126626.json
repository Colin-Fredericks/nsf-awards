Greenfield\r\n\r\nA series of two workshops (a planning meeting and a larger conference) will bring together international scholars to formulate a research agenda and a program of research activities.  The cultural construction of learning and its relation to development is the rationale for the workshop.  A developmental perspective will guide the organization of the workshop topics:  (1) Learning in infancy across cultures; (2) Learning in childhood across cultures; (3) Adolescent learning across cultures; (4) Adulthood learning across cultures; and (5) Learning and aging across cultures.  The objective will be to scrutinize learning similarities and differences as a way of understanding development.  The multiphase approach will help learning scientists understand the developmental precursors and learning phenomena, as well as developmental consequences.  \r\n\r\nThe results of the workshop will include a reseach agenda to guide the development of future research projects about children's learning in varying cultural contexts.  Another anticipated outcome will be a book that can serve as an international textbook on the role of cultural differences and universal stages in human development.\r\n\r\n",
