 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work has pointed out the existence of power-laws in the degree distribution of real-world\r\nnetworks. In retrospect, these findings while widely publicized are perhaps not surprising; power-laws\r\nfor various notions of size in real-world phenomena have been known for several decades.\r\nNevertheless, these findings have sparked extensive interest in the structure and macroscopic properties\r\nof the Internet. Such interest is timely; recent work has also revealed that network topology properties\r\nmay impact protocol performance\r\n     Generating realistic topologies is a prerequisite for understanding the impact of topology on pro-tocol\r\nperformance. Our recent work on topology generation motivates the proposed research and is\r\ndriven by the perceived dichotomy between structural generators those that explicity embody some\r\nnotion of hierarchy in constructing topologies and connectivity-based generators those that at-tempt\r\nto generate topologies with power-law degree distributions.\r\n     Our preliminary research on this larger question reveals several interesting results: that real net-works\r\nare well-modeled by connectivity-based generators, and that these generators result in graphs\r\nwith a continuum of levels of hierarchy. Continuing on from this work, our proposed research will at-tempt\r\nto increase our fundamental understanding of the structure of real networks, and their impact on\r\nprotocol performance. Conceptually, our proposed research has three interrelated parts: understand-ing\r\nhierarchy in real networks, devising structural models for topology construction based on Highly\r\nOptimized Tolerance, and examining more closely the impact of topology on protocol performance.\r\n     The structure of networks, and their impact on protocols, has received little attention until recently.\r\nIn terms of broader impact, this work has the potential for making fundamental progress in the areas\r\nof topology modeling. In a larger sense, it may develop methods that can be used to understand the\r\nphysical processes that lead to the development of other real-world networks, such as the Web topology\r\nand social networks.",
