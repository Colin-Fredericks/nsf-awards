 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: An Integrated Cyclostationary Signal Processing Framework for Optimized and Robust Wireless Communications\r\n\r\nPI: Dr. Erchin Serpedin\r\n\r\nABSTRACT: \r\n\r\nThe successful evolution of the future high-speed wireless communication networks requires significant advances in adaptive signal processing algorithms that are currently employed for synchronization, estimation and equalization of time-varying channels. This research involves the development of a general and novel framework for designing robust and optimal spectrally efficient channel estimation, synchronization, and equalization algorithms. Key elements of the work include development of a unified framework for designing and analyzing non-data aided joint carrier frequency-offset/Doppler shift and symbol timing estimators in time-selective and flat-fading channels, development of a robust non-data aided framework for estimation and equalization of time- and frequency-selective fading channels, and development of a robust non-data aided space-time signal processing framework for synchronization and estimation of multipath signals arriving at an antenna array. The proposed research offers a wealth of innovative educational projects for course and laboratory instruction.\r\n\r\nLevel of Effort Statement:\r\n\r\nAt the recommended level of support, the investigator will make every attempt to meet the original scope and level of effort of the project.\r\n\r\n",
