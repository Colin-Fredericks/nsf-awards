 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hutlee/Umyuarchdelee proposal (Athabascan/Yupik words for leader, boss, a \r\ngood thinker)is a five-year project based on a hybrid of models with proven success \r\nin educating minoritystudents. The project will include academic enhancement for \r\ngatekeeper math and sciencecourses integrating active learning pedagogies, intensive \r\nsessions, and relevant ways of learningfor Native students. To sustain student success \r\nthe project will provide faculty \"sponsorship,\" vigilant student support skills, \r\nincorporate a \"Master Learner\" curriculum to strengthen students-social contexts, \r\nand integrate job shadowing and internships with industry and Native\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe Interior-Aleutians Campus and Bristol Bay Campus service area comprises 235,000 \r\nsquaremiles and 74% Native population. Less than .5% of the students enrolling through \r\nthese two campuses are full time students. Recruiting students from 90 (of Alaska's\r\n220) villages, this project proposes to enroll five cohorts in a two-year village-based\r\nprogram. Through course work and intensive weeklong sessions during the semester as\r\nwell as intensive math summer sessions, student cohorts will build an academic learning\r\ncommunity. This learning community will carry on after students complete project\r\ncoursework and transition to urban-based four-year SMET degree programs.\r\n\r\nStrategic goals of this project are:\r\n* To increase Alaska Native participation and success in SMET degree gatekeeper courses.\r\n* To significantly increase the number of Alaska Native students who pursue baccalaureate\r\n degrees in SMET disciplines or enter SMET careers.\r\n* To develop a collaborative program among the University of Alaska Campuses, industry,\r\n and Tribal organizations to strengthen SMET academic infrastructure for Alaska Native\r\n students.\r\n* To provide faculty and students with the tools and education to actively use technology in\r\n academic courses.\r\nThe Hutlee/Umyuarchdelee method of delivering gatekeeper math and science courses will\r\ninclude curricular enhancements that employ active learning pedagogies and include a holistic\r\npedagogical philosophy. Methods of curricular enhancements are:\r\n* Additional faculty contact time extending math courses from three to five days by adding\r\n math labs which integrate methods for active learning such as hands-on manipulatives.\r\n* Six and eight weeks summer math intensives with relevant industry internships.\r\n* Weeklong semester-based intensive sessions that integrate academics, problem solving,\r\n and Master Learner curricular activities.\r\n* Building a student cohort academic learning community.\r\n\r\nPotential impacts of the Hutlee/Umyuarchdelee project are:\r\n* To develop SMET knowledgeable Alaska Native engineers.\r\n* To develop SMET knowledgeable Alaska Native leaders who will participate in making\r\n decisions about tribal lands that will forever change the lifestyles, economics, and\r\n existence of rural Alaskan communities.\r\n* To develop curricula and a delivery model which will impact not only students and\r\n communities affected though this program, extend to other SMET students in different\r\n geographical areas.",
