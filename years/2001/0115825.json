 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Mark W. Miller at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus to establish a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSCM) facility at the Institute of Neurobiology.  This facility will be shared by the investigators and students of the ten laboratories that comprise the Institute.  These laboratories utilize a variety of model systems, ranging from synapse development and specification in the cockroach to retinal aging in the human, to address some of the most challenging issues facing modern Neuroscience.  While diverse in scope, these research programs are unified by certain methodological considerations and limitations.  In particular, they share a need to localize specific proteins, messenger RNAs, or physiological events, within highly complex tissues.  The elaborate three-dimensional structures of neurons, their remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, and their intricate sorting and trafficking capabilities present formidable obstacles to studies requiring the precise localization of fluorescent signals or markers.  In many cases, however, the limitations previously imposed by these factors have been overcome by the introduction of the confocal microscope, an instrument that enables investigators to detect and localize fluorescent signals with a resolution that greatly exceeds the capabilities of traditional microscopy.  \r\nThe research conducted at the Institute of Neurobiology is dedicated increasing our understanding of the structure and function of nervous systems.  Specific programs include: (1) Neuropeptide Y and GABA Expression in the Aging Ground Squirrel Circadian System (Dr. N. Lugo), (2) Dendritic Remodeling of Ganglion Cells after Optic Nerve Injury (Dr. R. Blanco), Survival and Regeneration of Human Spinal Cord Neurons (Dr. D. Kuffler), (4) Ultra-fast Imaging of Subcellular Calcium Signals in Vascular Smooth Muscle (Dr. L. Santana), (5) Role of Engrailed Paralogues in Specification of Neuronal Anatomy and Synaptic Connections (Dr. J.M. Blagburn), (6) Cotransmitters and the Regulation of Complex Behavior (Dr. M. W. Miller), (7) Retinal Aging in Human Populations in Puerto Rico (Dr. E. Kicliter), and (8) Functional Role of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors in a Rhythm-generating Neuronal Network (Dr. W. Krenz).  \r\nIn addition to the direct enhancement of these research projects, the proposed facility will have a broad impact on the educational goals and capabilities of the Institute of Neurobiology.  Numerous graduate students affiliated with the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine and the Department of Biology at the UPR Rio Piedras campus conduct their research at the Institute.  Moreover, many advanced undergraduate students receive research training by participating in an Independent Investigation course, for which they may receive both credit and funding.  Finally, the Institute hosts a summer program in Tropical Neuroethology that brings undergraduate students from around the country to Puerto Rico for an intensive 5-week research experience.  The creation of a shared Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope facility will clearly enrich these educational programs and enhance the training objectives of the Institute of Neurobiology.  \r\n",
