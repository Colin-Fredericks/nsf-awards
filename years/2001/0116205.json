Interest in the use of distributed generation and storage has increased substantially over the past five years because of the potential to provide increased reliability and lower cost of power delivery to the customer. The advent of competition in the electric power industry and customer choice have, in part, been the stimulus for this increased interest. Also contributing to this trend has been the development of small modular generation technologies, such as fuel cells, microturbines, photovoltaic systems, wind energy systems and diesel engines. In addition, flywheel type energy storage/discharge systems hold promise to provide ride-through and enhance battery life in existing UPS systems. Industry estimates are that distributed resources (DR) will account for up to 30% of new power generation by the year 2010. The environmental benefits of DR that feature renewable resources, combined heat and power, and hybrid systems are substantial. In supporting customer choice, distributed power may be the long-term foundation of competition in electric power industry.\r\n\r\nAlthough the application of distributed generation and storage can bring many benefits, the technologies and operational concepts to properly integrate them into existing power systems must be developed to realize these benefits and avoid negative impacts on system power quality, reliability and safety. The current power distribution system was not designed to accommodate active generation and storage at the distribution level particularly to supply energy to other distribution customers. The technical issues to allow this type of operation are significant.\r\n\r\nIn view of all of the above, this project proposes to purchase advanced equipment, which will be dedicated to supporting and enhancing research in the distributed energy systems area. The new DES laboratory will have necessary facilities to conduct research, education and training in the following areas: Microturbines, Fuel Cells, Wind and Flywheel type energy systems. This project will foster the development of innovative power converter topologies, advanced electric generators and electronics needed for utility interconnection and the control and operation of DES. It will aid in the development of new protection systems for the safe and reliable operation of DES. It will also aid in investigative methods to improve the reliability of DES. The laboratory will also assist in the development of new stand alone hybrid DES such as: Fuel Cell & Battery combination for residential power systems and Microturbine & Flywheel type continuous power systems for critical loads such as buildings. Development of modular power electronic converters along with modular electric generators for the next generation of DES will be an important activity pursued with the acquired equipment. The proposed DES laboratory will also assist in the education of undergraduate, graduate students and industry personnel in this important area.\r\n\r\nThe proposed DES laboratory will be developed in cooperation with DES technology companies, local utilities, power electronics & electric machine industries. The power electronics and electric machines research program at TAMU has established long standing cooperative research programs with leading utility companies and industries. Working together, the proposed laboratory will pave the way for advanced DES development and education.\r\n",
