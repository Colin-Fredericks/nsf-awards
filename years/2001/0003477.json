This project will examine the geochemistry in detail of occurrences of ultramafic rocks that seem to spatially be associated with boundaries of precambrian blocks, thus suggesting subduction.  A sea-floor ophiolitic geochemical signature would considerably strengthen this option whereas absence would point to alternatives including strike-slip assembly.  Results are expected to influence understanding on how the continental lithosphere of much of the western United States was assembled. \r\n",
