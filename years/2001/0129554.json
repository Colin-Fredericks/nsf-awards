 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed workshop is a follow-up activity to a pilot effort funded by the EHR/REC as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) in FY 2000 that focused on evaluator capacity building and the importance of cultural context in conducting evaluations. This proposal builds on the strategies and activities implemented in the pilot workshop and will incorporate lessons learned and feedback from the pilot workshop participants.\r\n\r\nMajor objectives for this workshop would be to provide participants with:\r\n1. an introduction to the role and importance of program evaluation in urban school\r\nsettings\r\n2. a general overview of major evaluation theories/approaches that have defined the field\r\nof educational evaluation\r\n3. a closer look at a few emerging evaluation theories/approaches that accept cultural\r\ncontext as an important factor in program evaluation.\r\n4. preliminary considerations of culturally responsive approaches in the design and\r\nimplementation of program evaluations.\r\n5. A videotape and accompanying CD of the workshop will be developed by a professional\r\nmedia company for use in future professional development workshops and recruitment. The\r\nworkshop participants and evaluation facilitators will receive copies of the videotape and\r\nCD.",
