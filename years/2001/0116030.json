 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Human Factors Psychology program at the University of South Dakota (USD) will purchase an ASL Model ETS-PC eye tracker for the purposes of improving its capacity to meet critical strategic research and research training objectives. This device will enable researchers to accurately and precisely measure an observer's 'point of fixation' in the visual field, thus allowing powerful, objective and verifiable inferences to be made regarding heretofore unobservable behavioral processes. The ETS-PC instrument has many advanced features making it uniquely compatible with the program's wide range of needs for performing quality transportation research both in the laboratory and in the field (e.g., while studying driving behavior with the USD advanced instrumented research vehicle). Three faculty members, designated as major users of the purchased device, will use the eye tracking system to significantly expand both the depth and breadth of their existing experimental research programs in transportation human factors. Four innovative projects will investigate perceptual and cognitive mechanisms mediating: (1) the legibility distances afforded by computer-enhanced symbol highway signs, (2) the visual advantages afforded by fluorescent colored traffic control devices, (3) the visual effectiveness of novel temporal-chromatic lighting signatures generated by next-generation emergency vehicle lighting technologies and (4) the visual workload demands imposed by advanced transportation-related graphical displays and interfaces. The purchase of the ETS-PC eye tracker will enhance current research capabilities and provide senior research personnel with new opportunities to attract external support from our traditional as well as new funding sources. The impact of these developments will also extend to the quality of the research training experience for graduate students enrolled in USD's Ph.D. program in Human Factors Psychology.",
