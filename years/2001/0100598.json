 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project, which is divided into several parts,\r\nis concerned with several interrelated areas of\r\nalgebraic geometry centered around the birational geometry \r\nand the Hodge theory of algebraic varieties. In the first part,\r\nthe investigators intend  to construct differentials on certain \r\nuniversal spaces arising in algebraic geometry, and apply these to\r\nthe study of algebraic cycles. In the second part\r\nthe investigators, in collaboration with D. Abramovich\r\nand K.  Karu, intend to extend their previous work to the\r\nprove the strong factorization conjecture for birational maps.\r\nThis conjecture says that any birational map between smooth\r\ncomplete varieties has a particularly simple structure: it\r\nis a sequence blow ups followed by a sequence of blow downs\r\nwith smooth centers. In the third part, the investigators\r\nwill apply the previously established weak factorization \r\nconjecture to compare the Hodge structure of two birationally \r\nequivalent minimal models. In the fourth part, one of the \r\ninvestigators intends to  extend their previous vanishing\r\ntheorems and apply them to the study of birational\r\ninvariants. In the fifth part,  one of the investigators will \r\nattempt to relate the Hodge theory of higher homotopy groups to \r\nthe intersection theory of algebraic cycles. In the\r\nsixth part,  one of the investigators intends to study a class \r\nof surface singularities, which are important for birational\r\ngeometry, over fields of positive characteristic. In the\r\nsixth and final part,  one of the investigators  intends to \r\nextend the theory of toroidal embeddings by taking into account\r\ncertain stratifications.\r\n\r\n Algebraic varieties are geometric objects which provide a\r\nrich set of models for a number of phenomena within mathematics\r\nas well as in neighboring fields of science such as physics and\r\ncomputer science. They have the advantage of  being describable \r\nin finite terms, as solutions to a finite system of algebraic\r\nequations. However, these descriptions are often complicated and \r\nnot unique; deciding when two such descriptions lead to equivalent,\r\nor even approximately equivalent, varieties is very difficult.\r\nApproximate equivalence is made precise by the notion of\r\nbirational equivalence. One of the goals of this project is to \r\nstudy the finer structure of the birational equivalence relation.\r\nAnother goal of this project is to introduce and study certain\r\nnatural birational invariants, that is, measures\r\nof the geometric complexity of algebraic varieties. Some of\r\nthese invariants count the number of harmonic (energy\r\nminimizing) objects associated to the algebraic variety.\r\nThese two goals are related since the investigators expect that the\r\nfine structure of the birational maps will yield insights into\r\nthe properties of these invariants.",
