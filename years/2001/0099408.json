 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and his colleagues study noncommutative algebra\r\nand associated noncommutative geometry. The proposal consists of two topics:\r\nthe classification of graded domains of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three,\r\nor the classification of noncommutative projective surfaces; applications\r\nof dualizing complexes. The classification question is one of the most\r\nimportant questions in noncommutative algebra and noncommutative projective\r\ngeometry. Derived categories has been used in many areas of mathematics,\r\nand it has been proven that the dualizing complex is an effective tool in\r\nstudying noncommutative rings. More applications of dualizing complexes are\r\nexpected to be discovered.\r\n\r\nNoncommutative algebra plays an important role in Mathematics and Physics.\r\nFor example, quantum groups introduced in the 1980's are essentially a family\r\nof noncommutative and noncocommutative Hopf algebras. Some classes of\r\nsubtle symmetries appeared in Mathematics and Physics can be expressed by\r\nusing noncommutativity. The aim of this proposal is to develop effective\r\nmethods, to understand the structure of noncommutative algebra, and to\r\nexplore its interaction with other field such as statistical mechanics,\r\nquantum field theory, and noncommutative geometry.",
