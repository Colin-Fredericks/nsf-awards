The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a six month postdoctoral research fellowship for Dr. Bruce Knuteson, University of Chicago, to work with Dr. Bolek Pietrzyk at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland.  This project is co-funded by the Math and Physical Science Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThe Standard Model is a very successful theory of elementary particles and their interactions, accurately predicting (or at least accommodating) nearly all particle physics measurements to date.  The PI is interested in understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model through the analysis of particle interactions at extremely high energies.\r\n\r\nDr. Pietrzyk works on ALEPH, one of four large experiments on the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) colliders at CERN.  In the past ten years, the ALEPH experiment has made precision tests of the standard model.\r\n",
