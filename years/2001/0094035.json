 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives: The PI's research goal is to combine cultured living cells with microfluidic devices in order to 1) recreate, in vitro, the size range and variety of interactions between the cell and its environment as found in vivo, and 2) simultaneously analyze large numbers of cells and culture conditions at a single-cell level. As described in detail later, the long-term focus will be to answer central neurobiology questions which are unapproachable with present cell culture technology because they require the interrogation of large numbers of single cells and the microengineering of their environment. \r\n\r\nHis educational objective is to teach instrumentation and novel technologies to bioengineers and biologists with a strong emphasis on understanding the underlying scientific principles on which the instrument operates, on interactive laboratory classes, and on creatively measuring phenomena encountered in everyday life. Included in this educational endeavor will be a comprehensive introduction to microfabrication technology as an enabling tool for bioengineers and biologists at the graduate and undergraduate level, as well as a web-based K-12 outreach effort.\r\n",
