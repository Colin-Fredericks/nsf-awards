 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue to develop and demonstrate a computational tool for detailed simulation of Rapid thermal processing (RTP) in a distributed computing\r\nenvironment by taking advantages of the findings in Phase I. RTP has become a key technology in the\r\nfabrication of advanced semiconductor devices. As wafers get larger and chip dimensions smaller, the\r\nunderstanding of the highly coupled physics such as radiative heat transfer, transient fluid flow and heat\r\ntransfer as well as chemical reactions through numerical modeling using high-performance computing is\r\nthe key to the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors. In Phase II, A 3D surface radiation\r\nmodel based on the modified discrete transfer method (MDTM) will be developed to treat radiative\r\ntransfer in the lamphouse and process chamber as a whole process. The detailed pattern effects will be\r\ntaken into account by rigorously solving time-domain Maxwell's equations through a finite volume\r\napproach. The rarefied gas dynamics in low pressure RTP will be modeled by adding Burnett terms into\r\nthe Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations that contain various multi-disciplinary physical\r\nmodels will be solved by a 3D unstructured finite volume method. To address computationally intensive\r\n3D simulation needs, an efficient parallel strategy will be implemented in the solution procedure. Data\r\ncommunication among parallel processors will be conducted by the Message Passing Interface (MPI)\r\nlibrary.  To accelerate the overall solution convergence and improve the parallel performance, the\r\nalgebraic multi-grid (AMG) method will be used to solve the discretized equations in each processor. It is\r\nexpected that the proposed simulation tool can be used to systematically investigate the underlying\r\nphysics occurring in RTP systems, and to help in the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors.\r\n\r\nThe proposed simulation tool will significantly benefit the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries that require a detailed understanding of multimode and highly coupled transport phenomena.  The potential applications include the design, optimization, and control of RTP reactors and many other manufacturing and materials processing systems.\r\n",
