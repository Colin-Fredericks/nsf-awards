 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nA new type of actuation device has been conceptualized that meets the needs of large     1) displacement, 2) force and 3) bandwidth within a package more compact than currently available magnetostrictive and stack-type piezo actuators of similar rating.  The actuation mechanism relies on micro-scale electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumping of a dielectric liquid with a small concentration of free charges. \r\nAnalytical and numerical studies have shown the EHD-pumped actuator to be capable of delivering equal force and bandwidth to magnetostrictive and stack-type piezo actuators of the same size, but with considerably greater displacement. Research is proposed to further analyze the new concept to establish a parametric understanding of the actuator with respect to geometry, fluid, and temperature constraints. Research is also proposed to experimentally verify the viability of the promising concept. A multitude of prototypes will be designed, fabricated, and tested to provide experimental benchmarking of the model predictions. \r\nIt is envisioned that 1) tools for the design, fabrication, and deployment of the EHD pumped actuator, 2) working prototypes providing force, bandwidth, and size capabilities superior to comparable magnetostrictive and piezo type devices will be developed. It is expected that these actuators will substantially impact the field of active sound and vibration control\r\n",
