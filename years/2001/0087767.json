 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nMass spectrometry is central to most strategies for solving structural problems in chemistry. The lack of a reliable mass spectrometer in the Department of Chemistry is the weak link in ongoing efforts to adapt and implement discovery-based activities into several laboratories. Specific, multi-week investigational experiments that exploit mass spectrometry (as well as complementary spectroscopic techniques) have been identified in the chemical literature and will be adapted and implemented into our curriculum in core courses (Organic Chemistry I and II, Inorganic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry I and II, and Advanced Analytical Chemistry), advanced elective courses (Advance Organic Chemistry, Organometallic Chemistry, and Spectroscopy and Molecular Structure), and a non-majors course (Chemistry in Context). A modern mass spectrometer will also significantly enhance the undergraduate research program offered within the context of Independent Studies projects and the summer research experience. The recently distributed pamphlet \"Investigative Experiments for the Undergraduate Chemistry Curriculum\" is to be expanded to include the new experiments and the current experiments upgraded to include mass spectra.",
