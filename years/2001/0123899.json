 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, problems in science education in American high schools, colleges, and universities have been widely publicized and have aroused great concern. In particular, the traditional lecture approach, common in college and university introductory science courses, often fails to help students master key concepts. Students may learn to follow recipe-like algorithms for solving problems, but they lack understanding of some of the most basic ideas. A number of strategies have been developed to improve the teaching of these courses, several of which can be used in a variety of disciplines. Over the past ten years, we have established that one effective way to improve student learning in undergraduate science courses is to incorporate cooperative learning exercises into otherwise traditional lectures, using a strategy called \"Peer Instruction\"(PI). Use of PI has spread rapidly around the world; many faculty tell us that they have found PI both successful in improving their students' learning and easy to implement and adapt to their particular contexts. Peer Instruction is used widely in physics, chemistry, and astronomy, and implementation is beginning in biology, engineering, and mathematics. The goals of this project are to make Peer Instruction easier to implement for instructors, and to reinforce active learning habits for students in Peer Instruction-taught classes, through development of web-based electronic resources. Specifically,the project is developing Internet utilities that allow instructors to download class-ready materials and to automate production of a course web site for courses taught using Peer Instruction. A self-test and self-study facility for students is also being developed. These resources aim to lower the threshold to implementing Peer Instruction or similar techniques to promote cooperative learning.",
