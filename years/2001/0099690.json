We propose to\r\nidentify the critical parameters in problems of this type that admit exact\r\nsolutions, and to describe as explicitly as possible the associated optimal\r\ncontrol policies and stopping rules. It is expected that tools from\r\nstochastic analysis, martingales, convex duality theory, partial\r\ndifferential equations, and variational inequa-lities, will prove crucial in\r\nthe resolution of these questions; and that valuable new tools will have to\r\nbe developed, in order to deal with the non-standard issues that will arise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe optimization questions that we plan to study over the next five years\r\nshare a common feature, in that they involve elements of both  Stochastic\r\nControl  and of  Discretionary  Stopping. Such questions arise, for\r\ninstance, in  target-tracking models, where one has to stay close to a\r\ntarget by spending fuel, to declare when one has arrived \"sufficiently\r\n close\" to the target, and then to decide whether to engage the target or\r\nnot. Combined stochastic control / optimal stopping problems also arise in\r\nMathematical Finance:  in\r\n.  the context of computing the upper- and lower- hedging prices of American\r\n   contingent claims under portfolio constraints;  in\r\n.   portfolio/consumption optimization with an embedded \"retirement option\";\r\nand in\r\n.   the study of dynamic measures for managing risk.\r\nThe resolution of such problems, as suggested in this proposal, is expected\r\nto advance significantly our understanding of stochastic optimization and\r\nthe frontiers of its applications.  The strong involvement of graduate\r\nstudents in our research activities is expected to continue, and to be a\r\nmajor factor in the advancement of Applied Probability and of the\r\nMathematics of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Original Message -----\r\nFrom: Pang, Jong-Shi <jpang@nsf.gov>\r\nTo: <ik@math.columbia.edu>\r\nSent: Thursday, June 07, 2001 11:06 AM\r\n\r\n\r\n> Professor Karatzas,\r\n>\r\n> Did you see the following email of mine sent May 30, 2001?

Before I prepare\r\n> the paperwork, I need to clarify one thing about your salary.\r\nSpecifically,\r\n> are you drawing 1 month salary from your current grant, which expires\r\n> 07/31/01?\r\n> If you are, then I will recommend a start date of 08/01/01 for your new\r\n> grant.\r\n> Otherwise, we can keep your requested 07/01/01 start date.  I plan to\r\n> recommend\r\n> a continuing grant to fund the requested amount of $358,529 for 60 months.\r\n>\r\n> I will need an abstract for the project, to be sent to me by email (do not\r\n> send attachments).\r\n> This abstract shall be no more than one page in\r\n> length, and shall consist of two paragraphs. There shall be no special\r\n> symbols or equations. The first paragraph shall\r\n> be a technical description of the project, aimed at professional peers.\r\n> Often the proposal summary is an appropriate start,\r\n> phrased in the third person. The second paragraph will be a nontechnical\r\n> description that presents the work, its motivation,\r\n> and its significance. Think of the audience as a Congressman who asks\r\n\"What\r\n> are you doing?\", \"Why would you do that?\"\r\n> and \"What does it mean?\".\r\n>\r\n> The abstract is put in a public database, and may be read (and they have\r\n> been read in the past!) by Congressmen and\r\n> their staffers, so the second paragraph is important. Include any\r\nreference\r\n> to areas of important federal interest, such\r\n> as training or applications of strategic Federal interest.\r\n>\r\n> I will initiate the paperwork for my recommendation once I receive an\r\nanswer\r\n> to the salary issue and also\r\n> the abstract.\r\n>\r\n> Best regards,\r\n>\r\n> Jong-Shi\r\n>\r\n>",
