 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children live in complex economic environments. They make choices about what\r\nto consume and they earn money. Children save, exchange goods, make\r\ndecisions under uncertainty, and they share and bargain among themselves and\r\nwith their parents and other adults. There are two main reasons why it is\r\nimportant to improve our understanding of these sorts of economic behavior\r\nin children. First, a better understanding of the development of children's\r\neconomic behavior will lead to a better understanding of economic behavior\r\nin adults. Many economic norms, habits, and preferences are acquired in\r\nchildhood and this study will improve our understanding of how these\r\ndevelop. Second, many of the decisions children make have consequences for\r\nthe rest of their lives. We believe that an understanding of children's\r\nbehavior based on economics will make it possible for society to help\r\nchildren make better decisions as children.\r\n\r\nThe first goal of our research is to determine whether economic models are\r\napplicable to children. If so, at what age does economics become useful for\r\nunderstanding which different aspects of children's behavior? Second, we\r\nwill use computer based economic experiments to construct a panel data set\r\nthat will provide basic information on how children's economic behaviors,\r\nsuch as rationality, altruism, risk behaviors, and bargaining, develop with\r\nage. Our third objective is to develop an understanding of how demographic\r\nvariables and family policies influence children's preferences and economic\r\nskills. A very practical and important benefit of this research will be a\r\nbetter understanding of how parents, schools, and society can better prepare\r\nchildren for the complex economic environment they will face as adults.\r\nCurrently there is almost no research on how children acquire economic\r\nskills. Parents rely on information from folklore, their own experience, and\r\nadvice from unscientific studies and reports. Schools do not explicitly\r\nteach what we, as economists, would regard as some of the most important\r\neconomic skills. Children are left to acquire basic economic decision making\r\nskills haphazardly. This research will provide some of the basic descriptive\r\ninformation needed to improve this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
