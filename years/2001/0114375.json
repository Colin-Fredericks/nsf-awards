 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the formation of The Center for Gravitational Wave\r\nPhysics.  This Physics Frontier Center is devoted to development of\r\ngravitational wave phenomenology: the physics and astrophysics that can\r\nbe explored by gravitational wave observations in all wavebands.  It is\r\norganized in three tightly-linked Major Research Components: i)\r\nlearning how to exploit the fundamentally new perspective that gravitational\r\nwaves offer, when compared to electromagnetic observations; ii) using\r\ngravitational wave observations to test and contribute to the\r\nunderstanding of strong-field, dynamical gravity; and iii) developing\r\nmodeling tools that combine detector and source science to provide\r\nquantitative assessments of the ``science reach'' of advanced detector\r\ndesigns.  To achieve its goal of crystalizing the formation of this new\r\nfield, the Center functions as a National Facility with a substantial\r\nvisitor program; workshops, conferences and institutes devoted to\r\ncritical research areas where the focused attention of experts can be\r\nexpected to lead to breakthroughs or rapid advancements; and a\r\nsubstantial, interactive interface to Center activities (seminar,\r\ncolloquia, workshops and research group meetings) for off-site Center\r\nmembers and program participants.  The Center's education program\r\nemphasizes middle school children nationwide, through an affiliation\r\nwith the educational public television program \"What's In The News?\".\r\nThree special programs form the core of its outreach program:  to\r\nwomen, through its participation in the Women In Science and\r\nEngineering \"Expanding Your Horizons\" workshop (focused on grades 7--9)\r\nand the Women In Science and Engineering Research mentoring program\r\n(focused on first and second year undergraduate women), and to upper\r\ndivision and graduate Hispanic students, through a special liaison with\r\nthe University of Texas, Brownsville.\r\n\r\nThe forthcoming generation of ground and space-based gravitational wave\r\ndetectors have unleashed exciting challenges and opportunities at the\r\ninterface of general relativity, astrophysics, and experimental\r\nphysics. The waves they will detect arise in strong, dynamical\r\ngravitational fields, offering the first opportunities to test the\r\nunderstanding of fully non-linear relativistic gravity.\r\nSimultaneously, the observations' astrophysical implications are likely\r\nto be novel, diverse and rich as they reveal the inner dynamics of\r\nprocesses hidden from electromagnetic astronomy: e.g., the collision of\r\nblack holes in the center of a galaxy at high redshift.  A new field of\r\nphysics --- gravitational wave phenomenology --- is thus poised to\r\nemerge; however, lacking a tradition of large experiments,\r\ngravitational physics lacks also a community of phenomenologists ready\r\nto fully exploit the rich physics that the forthcoming observations\r\noffer.  The Center for Gravitational Wave Physics provides the\r\nintellectual platform upon which existing expertise can be combined and\r\nfocused in a synergistic manner, crystallizing the formation of a\r\ncoherent, flourishing field that can fully realize the promise that\r\ngravitational wave observations hold.\r\n",
