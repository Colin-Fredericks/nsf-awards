 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this new RUI award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Dr. Donald W. Slocum and Dr. Robert W. Holman in the Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky.   The work involves detailed studies of directed ortho-metalation reactions involving organolithium reagents in various hydrocarbon solvents with added Lewis base ethers  like THF and bis-chelating amines like TMEDA.   The reactions involve alkylation of aromatic substrates like anisole, dimethylanaline, and dimethylbenzylamine, where coordination of the heteroatom is believed to facilitate addition of the alkyl group at the ortho position.   NMR studies will be carried out using 13C and 7Li isotopes.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a growing effort in chemical research at Western Kentucky  University, and involve undergraduates in original research of interest to chemists in both academia and industry seeking improved methods for the synthesis of useful organic compounds.   The PI has active collaborations with area industries, and one of them is providing financial support.   Many of the students are expected to find work in local industries or go on to advanced degrees.",
