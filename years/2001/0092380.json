 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research endeavors to consolidate and extend gains in the systematic processing of nanostructured polymeric materials.  Most specifically, for electro-optic materials, attention will be paid to improving thermal/photochemical stability and material optical loss, while continuing to improve electro-optic activity and material processability.  This will be accomplished by incorporating free radical scavenging moieties and effecting more systematic crosslinking exploiting the structural features of dendritic supramolecular building blocks.  Chromophores will continue to be improved exploiting lessons learned from previous research.  Moreover, the development of improved octupolar, as well as dipolar, chromophores will be undertaken.  Chromophore ligands will be used to develop new two-photon polymeric materials exhibiting record levels of optical nonlinearity, which can be exploited for sensor protection, optical circuit fabrication, medical imaging, and ultrafast all-optical switching.  Dendritic ligands will also continue to be developed to further refine light harvesting relevant to optical amplification and solar cell applications. \r\n%%%\r\nThis research is tied together by a common theoretical basis and by a modular approach that permits material components to be applied to several applications.  The development of multiple use materials and nanostructural construction concepts my enable a relatively small, but focused, materials research effort to have high impact on a number of diverse technologies.\r\n",
