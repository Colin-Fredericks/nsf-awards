Goldman\r\n\r\nThis project continues the PI's investigation of locally \r\nhomogeneous geometric structures on manifolds, their moduli \r\nspaces and their symmetries. The holonomy correspondence \r\nrelates moduli of geometric structures to the representation \r\ntheory of the fundamental group.  The primary geometric \r\nstructures of this investigation include conformally flat \r\nLorentz and Riemannian structures, real projective and affine structures, and real and complex hyperbolic structures. \r\nDynamical questions concerning both the action of the \r\nfundamental group, various flows (including and generalizing\r\nthe geodesic, horocycle and frame flows) and the automorphisms \r\nof the moduli space will be studied. The close interaction \r\nbetween the dynamics of the mapping class group and the \r\nglobal topology of the moduli space is especially notable.  \r\nThe moduli spaces often possess symplectic structures which \r\nlead to important and mysterious algebraic constructions, \r\nsuch as the Lie algebra based on curves in a smooth surface.\r\n\r\nThese objects play an increasingly important role both \r\nin mathematics and physics.  Lorentzian manifolds arise as \r\ncosmological models in relativity. Moduli spaces have become \r\ncentral in quantum physics, and mapping class group actions \r\nand Teichmuller space have become prominent in 2-dimensional \r\nquantum gravity.  This study lies in the interface between geometry/topology, dynamical systems, analysis and algebra. \r\nDespite their complicated nature, the examples studied are\r\nextremely explicit.  Thus one can profitably investigate \r\nthem experimentally. Our current computer technology is \r\nappropriate for such projects. With Dr. Richard Schwartz \r\nand the support of the University of Maryland Mathematics \r\nDepartment, the Experimental Geometry Lab has been operating \r\nfor over a year. This lab has included software projects \r\nperformed by postgraduates, graduate students, and especially undergraduates.\r\n",
