The US organizer is Marleigh Sheaff, Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin.  The South African co-organizer is John Sharpey-Schaeffer, Director of the National Accelerator Centre.  The participants supported include postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.  This is the ninth in a series of schools/workshops organized by the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA).  About half of the 80 student participants will come from developing countries in Africa, the Near East, and South Asia.  The purpose of the workshop is to encourage increased participation by young physicists from these parts of the world in elementary particle physics experiments by providing them with the information and skills needed to undertake detector development for these experiments.  In addition, it is hoped that participation in this school will stimulate future collaborations among the students and senior lecturers.  The agenda includes lectures on state of the art instrumentation techniques and several hands-on laboratory courses.  This award is supported jointly by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Physics.\r\n\r\n",
