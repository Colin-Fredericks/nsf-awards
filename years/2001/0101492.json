 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nJackson State Community College (JSCC) is partnering with Austin Peay State University, the University of Tennessee at Martin, and Arkansas State University to develop three comprehensive articulation programs in Precision Agriculture: a 2+2 program, a 4+1 program, and a 3+1 program. These partnership programs ultimately lead to a Bachelor of Science degree in Precision Agriculture. The unique feature of these articulation agreements is that students not only transfer from the community college to the university, but also from the university to the community college. This inverted degree program with a \"reverse transfer\" format allows students to graduate from both JSCC and a four-year institution, with the fourth year spent at JSCC. JSCC holds technologically sophisticated equipment not available at the partnering universities, and it has developed a number of innovative courses to provide experiential learning opportunities to students in this field. The Precision Agriculture program provides students with theoretical background and hands-on experience in agronomy, GIS, GPS, and computer science. A unique combinations of courses and experiences train students to work in the precision agriculture industry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
