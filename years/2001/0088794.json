 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nThis is a three-year project aimed at mathematical sciences departments to provide excellent mathematical instructions for a verity of students studying undergraduate mathematics. The joint project of the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematicians and Education Reform Forum is an integrated program of six national workshops, networks of mathematical sciences departments, programs at national meetings, and publications. Two workshops are held each academic year, one in the fall and the other in the spring. Participation in the workshops is department based with each participating department represented by a faculty team of 2 to 4 members. Workshops are held at college campuses in cooperation with the mathematical sciences departments. While highlighting the needs of particular student groups, the program also focuses on critical issues that cut across all institutions. The calculus reform movement provides momentum for continuing reform efforts throughout the undergraduate curriculum. Reform efforts are put in the context of the institutional role of mathematical sciences departments and their relationships with partner disciplines. The project builds a network of mathematical sciences departments, including a significant number of departments in doctoral granting institutions, which are building strong undergraduate programs for the diverse groups of students they instruct.
