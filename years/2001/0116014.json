 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discovery Place in Charlotte, NC is planning and coordinating a visit by Chinese delegates to designated United States Science Museums toward identifying cooperative endeavors related to public understanding of science.  Planning also will be done for a separate delegation of informal educators from Japan.  Discovery Place will work with the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) to assist in planning and arranging portions of each delegation's visit in order to help science center professionals from all three countries meet and learn more about each other's institutions, programs and priorities.  Through this networking, U.S. institutions will be encouraged to participate in exchanges and cooperative projects.  The meetings also will help all sides identify potential partners and develop the relationships necessary to pursue joint activities such as staff exchanges, cooperative development of exhibits and programs and design of workshops.  \r\n\r\nSpecific planning activities to be undertaken by Discovery Place include:\r\n\r\n Identifying appropriate museum and media production sites for the Chinese delegation to visit;\r\n Coordinating the purposes of the visit with these sites;\r\n Working with The Institute of Pacific Asia (IPA is the NSF grantee that is handling the administrative          aspects of the Chinese and Japanese visits) to develop a specific agenda for each site visit;\r\n Coordinating with ASTC to arrange such activities as:\r\n Presentations by members of the Chinese and Japanese delegation in ASTC conference sessions,\r\n Participation by members of the Chinese and Japanese delegations in ASTC conference events and sessions,      and Assisting IPA in developing an agenda for a one-day US/China delegation meeting immediately following     the conference.\r\n\r\nThis project provides rare opportunities for informal science educators and policy makers to explore a wide range of program options for the United States, China and Japan to inform the public and build support for science.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
