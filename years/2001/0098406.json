What mathematics or science content do well-qualified and supported beginning teachers know, and what is the quality of their mathematics and science instruction?\r\n2. How does the teaching quality of second-year teachers vary with the extent and nature of district- and school-level support provided during their first year?\r\n3. What gains do teachers who fail the portfolio submission upon resubmission make?\r\n4. What professional development benefits accrue to teachers who score the portfolios?\r\n5. What aspects of Connecticut's program are transferable and under what conditions?\r\n6. How can preservice faculty use the portfolios to improve their courses?\r\n",
