 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an SGER to do an exploratory study to assess the effects of student/faculty collaboration through a variety of quantitative and qualitative measures designed to determine the extent to which these interactions affect students' learning, critical thinking skills, career choices, and persistence.  As an exploratory study, the goal is to identify characteristics that predict which students are most likely to benefit from an undergraduate research experience.  The study will also examine different models of undergraduate research used by faculty and determine whether some approaches are more effective than others.   Finally, the study will examine factors influencing students' decisions of whether or not to take part in a research opportunity, with special attention aimed at uncovering hindrances that may prevent members of underrepresented groups from participating.\r\n\r\n",
