Wheelwright. \"Inbreeding, Female Mating Fidelity, and the\r\nMajor Histocompatibility Complex in Savannah Sparrows\"\r\nFemale birds often copulate outside of the pair-bond to produce broods of mixed paternity, and in some\r\nspecies, as many as 60% of young derive from extra-pair fertilizations. The ubiquity of this infidelity has\r\nimportant implications for our understanding of avian biology. Recent work has linked female mating\r\nfidelity to the ecology and evolution of male parental care, social mating systems, breeding dispersion and\r\nsynchrony, and the form and function of elaborate sexual displays. Despite its importance, the adaptive\r\nsignificance of multiple mating remains controversial. While several recent studies support the idea that\r\nextra-pair copulations (EPCs) allow females to obtain good genes for their offspring (by trading-up) on\r\nthe genetic quality of sires), many others have found no relationship between female mating fidelity and\r\ntraits likely to reflect male quality. Indeed, much variation in female mating fidelity remains unexplained,\r\nand few feasible alternatives to the good genes hypothesis have been pursued in the field.\r\nA corollary to the good genes hypothesis proposes that females do use EPCs to increase the quality of\r\nyoung, but it is the interaction between maternal and paternal genomes\"and not male quality per se\"that\r\nis the target of female choice. This individual optimization or genetic compatibility hypothesis has\r\nnow been explored in snakes, lizards, and pseudoscorpions, but few studies in birds have considered the\r\nimportance of genotype-dependent mating preferences and optima. Preliminary work with Savannah\r\nsparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), however, strongly suggests that females pair nonrandomly (and\r\ndisassortatively) with respect to the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc), a group of genes responsible\r\nfor eliciting the adaptive immune response of vertebrates. Moreover, a female's genetic similarity to her\r\nsocial mate predicts her fidelity: females paired to similar males are more likely to produce extra-pair\r\nyoung than females paired to dissimilar males. These results parallel similar studies in mice and humans,\r\nand suggest either that the benefits of genetic diversity (at the Mhc) drive female mating patterns or that the\r\navoidance of inbreeding is an ultimate cause of social and genetic mate choice in Savannah sparrows.\r\nWith NSF funding, new molecular and analytical techniques will applied to samples obtained during\r\nprevious field work. Preliminary results with Savannah sparrows are based on 38 pairs nesting on Kent\r\nIsland, New Brunswick, Canada in 1995. To determine whether females choose within- and extra-pair\r\nsires according to their Mhc genotype, and to incorporate other potential determinants of female mating\r\nfidelity (such as adult age, timing of breeding and phenotypic quality), the analysis will be extended to\r\npairs nesting in 1994. In addition, the importance of overall levels of genetic relatedness to female mating\r\nfidelity, the occurrence of egg (embryo) mortality, and the survivorship of nestlings and fledglings will be\r\nassessed by surveying sparrows during the 2002 and 2003 breeding seasons. Both the costs of inbreeding\r\nand the benefits of Mhc heterozygosity predict that females should avoid fertilizations from genetically\r\nsimilar males.\r\nThis research benefits from the prior development of a species-specific Mhc probe and nearly 15 years\r\nof field and molecular work on the Kent Island population of Savannah sparrows. This study will provide\r\none of the first tests of the importance of the Mhc to social and genetic mating patterns in a free-living\r\npopulation of songbirds.",
