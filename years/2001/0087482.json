 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this work is to support the understanding and development of protocols\r\nthat can provide personal privacy over the Internet. While there have been some protocols\r\nproposed and implemented that hide the IP address of network communicators, there has been\r\nno systematic study of such protocols, nor have methods of analyzing the anonymity and security\r\nof those protocols been developed. A thorough understanding of anonymity is important not only\r\nfor the development, analysis, and use of anonymous protocols for personal privacy, but also for\r\nunderstanding how network attackers can hide their location and for developing methods to track\r\nthose attackers. Our eventual goal is to develop new techniques and protocols for anonymity,\r\nincluding a \\logic of anonymity\" similar to those developed for authentication protocols that\r\ncan be used to describe and analyze anonymous protocols.\r\nThis proposal considers a number of contributions on this research area. Our first contri-\r\nbution will be to take a more general view of anonymous communication than previous work\r\nby considering protocols and techniques for hiding the identity of a responder from all other\r\nparties, and for providing completely anonymous communication in which both the initiator and\r\nresponder are anonymous to each other and all other parties. The former technique is useful\r\nfor anonymous web sites (rather than just anonymous web browsing); the later technique is\r\nuseful for true two-party privacy over the Internet. Our second class of contributions will be to\r\nconsider generalized protocol construction. This extends our past work, which de-coupled the\r\nforward and reverse paths of anonymous communication, giving rise to a large family of anony-\r\nmous protocols. We will continue investigation of those protocols, and examine what network\r\nsupport is available for anonymous communication and what support might best be provided in\r\nthe future. Our third contribution will be to provide a formalism for anonymous protocols such\r\nthat beliefs regarding entity identities can be reasoned by stating assumptions and deriving log-\r\nical conclusions from following steps of defined protocols. Fourth, we will consider the network\r\nperformance of anonymous routing protocols in an in-depth fashion, including not only latency\r\nand traffic, but also requirements of streaming media applications and traditional TCP-based\r\nbulk-data transfer applications. Finally, we will consider heretofore ignored security concerns\r\nof existing protocols, initially considering path analysis attacks and attacks that cause some\r\nparticipants to be unfairly accused by third parties. The formalism provided by our proposed\r\nlogic of anonymity will be a foundational component of our security analysis work.\r\nCollaboration between these our two institutions will allow us to leverage the existing\r\nstrength in networking at the University of Massachusetts and the existing strength in secu-\r\nrity at Purdue.\r\n1",
