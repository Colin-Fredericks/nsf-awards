 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) The interdisciplinary field at the interface of physical and life sciences is undergoing explosive growth. More and more Physics departments are hiring faculty in this field, yet those faculty complain of the lack of a suitable textbook to teach their subject at the undergraduate level. Indeed the core foundational material for this subject can be taught successfully at the sophomore level. The same course can also introduce much foundational material for later study in nanotechnology. The objective of this project is to create a text Biological Physics and a suite of ancillary materials, including Web materials, to address these needs, which will be of interest and useful to undergraduates in Physics, Biology, Biophysics, Biochemistry, Materials Science, Chemical and Bio-Engineering, all the way up to advanced graduate students. The text will be class-tested by faculty interested in teaching this material at a variety of institutions, and it will be published by a major textbook firm.\r\n",
