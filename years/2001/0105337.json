In network operations, raw data typically arrive\r\nin streams, and decisions must be made by algorithms that make one pass\r\nover each stream, throw much of the raw data away, and produce ``synopses''\r\nor ``sketches'' for further processing.  Moreover, network-generated massive\r\ndata sets are often distributed:  Several different, physically separated\r\nnetwork elements may receive or generate data streams that, together, comprise\r\none logical data set.  The enormous scale, distributed nature, and one-pass \r\nprocessing requirement on the data sets of interest must be addressed with \r\nnew algorithmic techniques.\r\n     Two programming paradigms for massive data sets are \"sampling\" and\r\n\"streaming.\"  Rather than take time even to read a massive data\r\nset, a sampling algorithm extracts a small random sample and computes\r\non it.  By contrast, a streaming algorithm takes time to read all the input, \r\nbut little more time and little total space.  Input to a streaming algorithm \r\nis a sequence of items; the streaming algorithm is given the items in order, \r\nlacks space to record more than a small amount of the input, and is required\r\nto perform its per-item processing quickly in order to keep up with\r\nthe unbuffered input.  The investigators continue the study of \r\nfundamental algorithms for massive data streams.  Specific problems of\r\ninterest include but are not limited to the complexity of proving properties \r\nof data streams, the construction of one-pass testers of properties of \r\nmassive graphs, and the streaming space complexity of clustering.",
