 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves developing new connections between the areas of\r\nmachine learning, on-line algorithms, and optimization, and using\r\nthese connections to address fundamental problems in all\r\nthree areas.\r\n\r\nIn machine learning, one focus of this research is how to best combine\r\na small sample of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data\r\nin order to produce high quality predictions.  This type of problem\r\nhas become especially important given the explosion of data now\r\navailable over the web.  This research is exploring how techniques\r\nsuch as network flow and graph cuts from the optimization literature\r\ncan be used to provide a new means of attack, and how to best make a\r\nnumber of design choices that arise in this approach.  Another basic\r\nquestion this work investigates is what kinds of concepts can be\r\nautomatically learned in the presence of highly noisy data, and to\r\nwhat extent substantially new types of algorithms may be possible.\r\nThe PI recently gave the first algorithm to learn a class of concepts\r\nin the presence of noise that is provably not learnable by a wide\r\nclass of techniques known as Statistical Query methods.  The current\r\nresearch aims to expand on this work and explore the extent to which\r\nit can be pushed much further.  The types of learning problems being\r\nstudied have close connections to problems of decoding random linear\r\ncodes and finding approximate shortest lattice vectors that arise in\r\ncryptography.  Improvements to the learning algorithms should impact\r\nour understanding of those problems as well.\r\n\r\nAnother major thrust of this research is the use of techniques from\r\nmachine learning to address problems in online algorithms.  In\r\nparticular, the highly-developed \"weighted experts\" technology in\r\nmachine learning suggests new approaches for combining multiple online\r\nalgorithms that may simplify a number of longstanding open problems.\r\nThis work is studying the extent to which this connection can provide\r\ninsight into several basic questions, such as dynamic optimality in\r\nsearch trees and the weighted caching problem.  Finally, this research\r\nis also studying a number of basic approximability questions, as well\r\nas exploring new frameworks for the analysis of local search\r\ntechniques.",
