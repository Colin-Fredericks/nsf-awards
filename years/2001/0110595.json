 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underrepresentation of minorities in the science, mathematics, engineering, and technology\r\nworkforce is still a national problem, ten years after the National Science Foundation (NFS) initiated\r\nthe Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program. By all accounts great\r\nprogress has been made, but not enough to turn the problem around. As one of the six oldest National\r\nScience Foundation (NSF) Alliances in the nation, Alabama has been in the forefront of efforts to\r\nincrease the quantity and the quality of underrepresented minorities receiving baccalaureate degrees in\r\nscience, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) fields. Many of the Alabama Alliance's\r\nprograms have been replicated by other alliances. The Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority\r\nParticipation (ALSAMP) began in 1991 with a baseline of 431 minority SEM undergraduate degrees\r\nand reached a peak of 979 in 1999, a 127% increase. The baseline minority SEM enrollment for\r\nALSAMP is 3,301. The minority SEM enrollment for the 1999-2000 academic year is 5,876, a 78%\r\nincrease. These are indicators of success for ALSAMP Phase I and Phase II.\r\n\r\nThe ALSAMP Phase III proposal is designed to a) sustain the B.S. Degree production levels\r\nand student retention rates specified as Phase II goals and b) define a baseline level of and commitment\r\nto a significant increase in the number of previous, current, and future baccalaureate recipients entering\r\neither a SMET graduate program or a graduate program in teacher education. Thus, the project\r\napproach for LSAMP will involve sustaining and institutionalizing current LSAMP Phase II activities\r\nand the implementation of new LSAMP Phase III activities as given below.\r\n\r\nPrograms to be Sustained and Institutionalized                                New LSAMP Phase III Programs\r\nLSAMP Summer Bridge Program                                                      GRE Preparation for All Students\r\nLSAMP Scholars Program                                                                 Undergraduate Research for All Students\r\nSummer Research Internship Program                                            GRE Required for All LSAMP Students\r\nLSAMP Graduate Bridge Program\r\nSEM Student Mentoring Program                                                      Increase Number of SMET Students                                                                                                                         Entering Graduate School through Tracking                                                                                                            Effort\r\nDrop-In Centers/Cooperative Learning                                            Intensify Recruitment of Technology                                                                                                                       Students\r\nSummer Research Conference                                                           Increase Collaboration with Other                                                                                                                           Programs\r\nPublication of The National LSAMP Magazine                                   National LSAMP Publication in Phase III                                                                                                                 Budget\r\n\r\nThe major portion of the Phase III budget will support these new programs. Consequently, the\r\nPhase II programs will be sustained by cost sharing from participating institutions, support from\r\nprivate sources, and institutionalization. During the next five years, LSAMP will define a baseline\r\nlevel of and commit to a significant increase in the number of baccalaureate degree recipients entering\r\neither a SMET graduate program or a graduate program in teacher education. This effort will involve\r\npreparing students for success in graduate school and placement in a graduate school of choice.\r\nStudents will be tracked through graduate school by means of the LSAMP Success Link Program\r\nand a graduate student database will be maintained by the Alliance.\r\n\r\nCollaboration with other NSF programs will be increased substantially, particularly with the\r\nNSF Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate Program and the NSF Urban Systemic\r\nProgram. Program activities will be disseminated through the publication of the National LSAMP\r\nMagazine and a full-time program evaluator will be appointed to oversee assessment and evaluation\r\nactivities.",
