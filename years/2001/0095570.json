 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organizational culture is a familiar concept to both researchers and\r\nmanagers.  It is frequently cited as the source of a firm's efficiency or as\r\nthe cause of problems in firm adaptation or mergers.  However, in spite of\r\nits familiarity, it has been difficult to capture exactly what\r\norganizational culture is and how it affects firms.  We propose a series of\r\nstudies that use an experimental procedure to create something very similar\r\nto culture in the laboratory.  The basic elements of culture, based on\r\ncommon threads in the research literature, are that it is something that\r\narises through shared history and understanding between members of an\r\norganization, that it depends on the organization's history and can\r\ntherefore vary greatly between firms, and that it allows members of a firm\r\nto coordinate activity and therefore perform more efficiently.\r\n\r\nOur experiments use a task that allows \"firms\" consisting of two or more\r\nsubjects to develop culture through repeated interaction.  In our\r\nexperiments, language serves as a metaphor for culture - subjects need to\r\ndevelop a way to refer to unknown and complex objects using simple, short\r\nphrases in order to perform a task quickly.  These \"cultures\" that subjects\r\ndevelop end up being based on the group's shared history in performing the\r\ntask (what aspects of the objects did they focus on initially?), they end up\r\nbeing idiosyncratic and varying greatly between groups (as an example: one\r\ngroup came to refer to an object as \"Macarena\" while another group referred\r\nto the same object as \"coffee cups\"), and they end up allowing the groups to\r\ncoordinate and improve efficiency (the one word descriptions allowed groups\r\nto jointly identify objects quickly).\r\n\r\nOur initial experiments investigate what happens when two groups that have\r\ndeveloped culture independently - and have become efficient at performing\r\nthe task - are merged.  Not surprisingly, differences in cultures lead to\r\ndecreases in the efficiency with which the merged group performs the task.\r\nIn addition, subjects are not aware of how difficult it will be to integrate\r\neven these simple cultures, leading them to overvalue the merged firm.\r\nFinally, once culture conflict arises, subjects blame the source of the\r\nfailures on incompetence on the part of other subjects rather than on the\r\ndifficulty in integrating different cultures.  Future experiments will\r\nfurther explore the last phenomenon by more closely examining the extent to\r\nwhich subjects place the blame for merger failure on others rather than on\r\nculture incompatibility.  One implication is that managers may fire\r\nemployees too frequently, blaming low performance on their incompetence\r\nrather than on the need for cultural integration.  We will also explore how\r\ncultural integration is related to whether members of an organization have\r\ncommon or opposed incentives.\r\n",
