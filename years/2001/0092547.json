 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the conference is for individuals from leading edge projects who are creating ways to focus professional development on actual classroom practices and, more specifically, using video as a tool for professional development, to:\r\n\r\n     * share lessons they have learned about video tape design, platforms and software that facilitates video              case study, and the use of videos with teachers; and\r\n\r\n     * identify issues that still need to be addressed related to the use of video to improve instruction.\r\n\r\nResearchers and Developers of such video programs will convene for three and one-half days to consider these lessons and issues, using four of five \"cases\" of video development and use to focus the discussion.  Based on these discussions, a monograph in print and web-based formats will be produced, which discusses the important challenges faced by professional development leaders as they develop and use videos in their own settings.  The monograph will capture the lessons learned about overcoming these challenges and about using videos successfully in a side range of settings.\r\n",
