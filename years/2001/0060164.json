 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and evaluate a new class of mixed proton and electron conducting materials which are capable of operating at intermediate temperatures (400-700C).  These materials could be used as membranes in a wide variety of hydrogen separation applications resulting in an efficient, economic, and selective process.  The composite materials of interest will be based on a proton conducting oxyacid salt and a metallic or ceramic electronically conducting component.  Composite powders of different components and compositions will be fabricated using various preparation techniques.  These will then be fabricated into dense membrane disks, which will subsequently be tested for their structural, electrical, and transport properties with the proton and electronic conductivity being of particular interest.  The composite materials showing the most promise will then be incorporated into laboratory scale membrane separation configurations and evaluated for their ability to mediate hydrogen. \r\n\r\nThe development of a new membrane-based hydrogen separation process will have multiple applications for use in industry.  It would allow for the separation and purification of hydrogen in one step.  Furthermore, these membrane systems could act as novel reactors for carrying out different chemistries such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions at potentially lower costs and higher yields. \r\n",
