 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\n\r\nTeamCoach is a web-based interactive coaching system designed specifically for engineering student design teams. TeamCoach consists of two components: (1) a CD-ROM designed to provide simulated scenarios of issues relevant to the student team's current situation allowing the student to model, practice and receive feedback and (2) a 'smart' internet program designed to record information about individual team preferences and team compositions in order to generate training material specific to each individual on a specific team at a specific stage of development. This research advances current training methodologies by allowing students to practice and receive feedback in private 'role-play' scenarios that are customized to the specific individual and team composition. This methodology also provides documented team skill acquisition for assessment purposes. TeamCoach provides diagnostic assessment and feedback to the teams on an ongoing basis. Summative evaluation questions addressed in this study are: (1) Is there a difference (pre/post) in the ways that students understand and value teamwork? (2) What do students perceive as the critical issues facing their team? (3) How effective are the teams in analyzing their current functioning and making appropriate corrections? (4) Do students demonstrate a measurable change in the identified skill set? \r\n\r\nThe results from this research project are being disseminated through the ASEE Annual Conference, journal articles and a user's group web-site where results, trial training modules, ideas for potential training modules and additional research questions are posted.\r\n",
