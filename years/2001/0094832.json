 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this grant is to provide support for a series of workshops aimed at bringing focus to critical manufacturing technology challenges and fostering cooperative activity between government agencies, industry and academe.  Support for the workshops will be provided by NSF together with the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, and industry.  The workshops will address topics including shared knowledge repositories and learning systems; knowledge-based design; integrated, interoperable enterprises, especially web-based; science-based modeling and simulation for manufacturing; emerging manufacturing technologies and processes; web-enabled manufacturing; and intelligent controls.  The workshops will invite broad representation from all manufacturing domains to develop a comprehensive suite of goals and requirements for use in focusing manufacturing research and development.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will foster cooperation among government, industry and academe, and it will provide focus for Federal participation in manufacturing research and development.",
