How much improvement in student performance on map skills tasks would be expected after using the curriculum? \r\nHow can teachers tell whether student learning has occurred?\r\nWhat is the relationship between teachers' spatial abilities and the likelihood they would use the materials?\r\n\r\nThe project will develop quantitative, reliable field-based assessments of map skills and use them, along with other instruments, with three populations:  elementary students using the materials; children over the 7-15 age range who do not uses the materials; and preservice elementary teachers.  Results from these assessments will be used in a redesign of the materials.\r\n",
