 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the device size continues to shrink and integration density continues to increase, the size and spatial confinement effects on heat removal become increasingly important. A rapid emergence of nanotechnology as a nation's high-priority field and renewed interest to thermoelectrics add significance to the research on thermal management of nanoelectronic devices and circuits proposed in this NSF-CAREER project. Beside its fundamental science value, investigation of phonon transport at nanoscale is crucial for future progress in electronic and optoelectronic device technologies. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are (i) comprehensive investigation of heat conduction in nanoscale semiconductor structures, devices and circuits; (ii) derivation of new thermal management rules applicable to scaled-down devices; (iii) fundamental study of the effects of phonon confinement and boundary scattering on phonon propagation; and (iv) improvement of reliability of nanoelectronic devices and circuits.\r\n\r\nThe proposed education plan aims at jump-starting a new engineering specialization - Devices and Circuits with emphasis on nanotechnology and nanodevices. It will be accomplished by active course development, increase of the laboratory component of the curriculum, and student involvement in research. The cross-disciplinary nature of the project will allow students to gain a variety of skills required in a contemporary high-tech job market.\r\n\r\nInvestigation of thermal management of nanodevices will be carried out in a newly established Nanoelectronic Materials and Device Laboratory. The outcome of this research will add to the core knowledge of nanostructures, phonon transport, and quantum confinement. It will lay down the foundation of the novel enabling technology utilizing active phonon engineering. \r\n",
