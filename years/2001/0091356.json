 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need to improve the success rate at which new technologies can be introduced into the workplace.  A methodology and service,  ATTAIN(TM), has been conceived to accelerate the integration of technology by rapidly and aggressively identifying critical processes and practices in the organization and shifting them in value-added ways at the level of worker cognition and operational specifics.  This method has been shown to be highly successful, but is labor intensive, expensive, and requires highly skilled practitioners.  Furthermore, the method upon which ATTAIN is based is not sufficiently targeted.  That is, more often than not, businesses have only 3-4 workplace processes or practices that need to be changed in order to increase the company's competitiveness.  The original method does not single these out as more important than other elements of the workplace.  To date,  increasing the effective incorporation of new technology by changing workplace practice and worker cognition through specialized simulation training, but not at identifying the most appropriate target for the technology implementation or change has been very successful.  The work of Phase II will involve integrating the current methods with those of another company.  Their method has been shown to identify the \"vital few\" practices that mitigate a company's overall competitive survival and which are the most appropriate targets for change.  Phase II has two goals.  First, a hybrid method that is quicker and more targeted will be developed.  Second, a practitioner training approach and supporting materials that make it possible for professionals without extensive experience to deliver the method in a high quality manner will be developed.\r\n\r\nTraining and licensing practitioners in a hybrid method of workplace learning will contribute significantly to the problem of efficient and successful technology integration and implementation of new technologies.\r\n",
