 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project provides the principal investigator (PI), an assistant professor of mathematics,  with academic training in biostatistics so that he (1) can develop a new career that will significantly help his home institution to achieve its strategic goals in science, (2)  can become a significant collaborator with and resource for his colleagues in the biological sciences, providing a unique mathematical perspective on significant biological questions and their statistical ramifications. The grant activity will enhance the teaching of statistics at the lower division undergraduate level as well as the possibility of  collaborative teaching of a biostatistics course in the upper division. To obtain the requisite training in biostatistics and life sciences generally, the applicant will spend one academic year as a visitor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in the Division of Biostatistics.  The grantee will take course work in biostatistics and the life sciences, participate in departmental seminars, and frame a program of research  designed to complement the biological research of the Science Department at BHSU.  This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
