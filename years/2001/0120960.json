Moorhead\r\n\r\nWith this award under the MPS Internships in Public Science Education Program, Minnesota State University Moorhead (MSUM) and the MSUM Regional Science Center (RSC) will develop a traveling public exhibit and associated curricular material in each of four topics : dark matter in spiral galaxies, probability games of chance and beyond, X-ray microtomography, and green chemistry.  The underlying theme of these topics is 'Seeing is Believing'.  Using regional resources and examples, participating teachers and students will be able to visualize the underlying concepts and develop material to increase public understanding of this topical research.  Each summer five teachers, six undergraduates, and a member of the White Earth Tribal and Community College staff will work with MSUM scientists and educators and RSC staff to develop material for two projects.  Exhibits will be introduced to the general public during a multi-day exhibit at WETCC scheduled to coincide with the White Earth Reservation's annual pow-wow.  Exhibits will then be displayed at the Regional Science Center over the summer and circulate through local classrooms during the academic year.  Curricular materials will be disseminated through a yearly educational workshop offered at MSUM.   \r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n***",
