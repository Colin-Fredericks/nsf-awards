From analysis surface images from the laboratory, the surface currents in the wave boundary and small-scale wave breaking will be measured. A wave boundary layer is defined as a top layer within a depth of order (kp) -1 . kp is wavenumber of dominant wind waves. The method developed here will overcome the problem of having sensor in the boundary layer, a difficulty of early measurements. The surface waves and near surface turbulence will also be measured at the same time. These will make it possible to access the interactions among surface currents, waves, and turbulence, to quantify these quantities for parameterization. Recent free surface turbulence studies have showed there are fundamental differences between wall boundary layer turbulence and free surface turbulence. At sea, wind blows over the ocean surface generating waves and shear currents. The ocean surface layer is more complex due to the existence of these energetic waves. Wave breaking and surface drift can enhance one another. The surface shear currents are inherently unstable due to Craik-Leibovich span-wise instability. The Langmuir circulations increase the vertical mixing which reduces the surface shear. It is questionable that a simple wall turbulence analogy would adequately represent the dynamics of a free surface boundary layer. To assess the contributions from different ocean surface processes, it is critical to observe key surface quantities, such as surface waves, surface current, surface turbulence, rate of wave breaking, and vertical transport\r\n",
