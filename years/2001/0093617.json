Childress\r\nAffiliation:\t\tUniversity of Nevada Reno\r\n\r\n\r\nCAREER: A Comprehensive Experimental and Theoretical Investigation into Membrane Fouling\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Abstract\r\n\r\nThis investigation takes a comprehensive approach to evaluating experimentally and theoretically the effects of both membrane and colloid properties on membrane fouling. The overall approach is to couple the extended DLVO theory with transport and deposition equations appropriate for crossflow membrane filtration. The specific goals are to develop methodology and to evaluate several fundamental membrane and colloid characteristics; to develop a particle deposition model that incorporates short-range acid-base forces of both the membranes and colloids; to perform a systematic experimental investigation to evaluate the overall impact of physico-chemical factors on membrane fouling; and to compare the theoretical predictions with experimental results. Additionally, particle deposition will be directly observed using AFM, and the extent of deposition will be related to flux decline using a deposited layer resistance model.\r\nColloidal fouling will be considered within the framework of particle deposition, that is, the capture of colloidal particles from flowing suspensions by solid surfaces. From a broader perspective, an understanding of the principles governing the transport and interaction of colloidal particles in flowing suspensions is extremely important to many disciplines of science and engineering. Therefore, this research has numerous implications for other fields in which particle deposition plays a crucial role. Within the framework of membrane processes, this project has direct application to reduction of colloidal membrane fouling.  Possible measures  include optimization of feed stream pretreatment (to change the colloid characteristics), modification of the membrane surface, and selection of the most appropriate membrane based on feed stream characteristics. The CAREER education plan involves the development of a science and technology outreach program for 8th grade girls. The main objective of the program is to encourage the understanding that math and science are important and relevant to the girls' lives and to actively support the girls in pursuing education and employment in these areas.\r\n",
