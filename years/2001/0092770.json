 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the rapid emergence of Internet related applications, providing integrated services such as data, voice, and video in mobile computing systems has become increasingly important. However, mobile communication\r\nsystems such as cellular networks are primarily designed for supporting voice. Due to the different workload characteristics and quality of service (QoS) requirements of integrated services, prior resource\r\nmanagement techniques may not be efficient for handling the increasing demand of emerging applications. To address this issue, the research focuses on the design and evaluation of (1) bandwidth management schemes\r\nto provide QoS guarantees and efficiently utilize the frequency spectrum; (2) cache management mechanisms to reduce the bandwidth and power consumption; and (3) efficient protocols to allow mobile devices to power\r\noff most of the time. The research proposes to integrate these three components to provide a resource management infrastructure that can efficiently support integrated services in mobile computing systems. The\r\nresearch results will be used and emphasized in the wireless networks and mobile computing courses developed in this project.",
