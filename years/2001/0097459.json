 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an REU Site in psychology at Middlebury College in Vermont.  The program is designed to provide undergraduate students the foundation of skills and knowledge necessary to become independent in the conduct and evaluation of research.  The program will provide ten students with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor for eight weeks during the summer.  At least half of the students will be recruited from schools other than Middlebury College.  Research projects will cover a wide range of psychological topics, such as improving children's memory, gender differences in spatial reasoning, the relationship of attachment style to the evaluation of romantic relationships, and the effect of motivation on cheating behavior.  In addition, interns will participate in a weekly seminar to develop their understanding of the research process.  Weekly seminar topics will include a discussion of ethical issues in psychological research, the use of statistical software for cleaning and describing data, and a presentation by former psychology students now in graduate school about their research experiences.  A special component of the program involves the participation of a student mentor who, in addition to participating as a research intern, will work closely with the co-PIs to unify the group of research interns, provide guidance and advice to interns, and help organize and facilitate workshops and social activities.  Because Middlebury College is a highly competitive liberal arts college with a strong record of mentoring undergraduates in the sciences, it is an ideal setting for this program.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
