Demographic changes have been especially dramatic in No. Carolina and Georgia, two states among the top ten in terms of percentage increases in foreign-born populations during the 1990s.  Changes in the demographic composition of local communities in these states have created an acute need for a sound knowledge base regarding the socialization influences and outcomes in these populations.  Moreover, community leaders, outreach service providers, and educators will need reliable data and culturally relevant theoretical frameworks to disseminate knowledge about socialization processes among children and adolescents from immigrant families. The purpose of this project is to create a multidisciplinary and cross-institutional research team from three universities in the southeastern United States through a series of workshops.  The workshops  are designed to develop a strategic plan for research on the socialization of children and adolescents in immigrant families.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
