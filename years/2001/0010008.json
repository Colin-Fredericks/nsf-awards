 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to understand the lubrication and friction conditions in Tube Hydroforming processes. By achieving the project objectives it will be possible to evaluate various candidate lubricants regarding their suitability and application in tube hydroforming. The lubricants to be evaluated must be environmentally friendly and non polluting while providing adequate lubricity and a low coefficient of friction. Thus, it will be possible to improve process conditions and part quality. \r\n\r\nTube Hydroforming is a relatively new process that is being used increasingly in manufacturing automotive components. The process offers advantages in reducing part weight and assembly operations, and in  increasing part stiffness and properties. In tube hydroforming a tubular preform is placed between two die halves, the preform is internally pressurized while the tube ends are fed or pushed axially towards the die center. Thus, the tubular preform is expanded to achieve the internal geometry of the dies, hopefully without defects, i.e. fracture or wrinkles. The results of this project will improve lubrication conditions in tube hydroforming and will make the process more reliable, robust, cost effective and more widely used.  \r\n",
