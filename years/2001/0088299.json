It requires faculty to be mentors and role models in stimulating pre-college and undergraduate students in science to explore new frontiers and horizons through their own investigative studies. This project is using an analytical scanning electron microscopic system (SEM-EDS) in a variety of undergraduate courses and independent study, thus providing undergraduates with additional opportunities to develop their analytical skills. Use of this instrument is also engendering interest in science at the pre-college levels in local area schools. After completing a prerequisite Web-based course on microscopic theory and techniques that we have developed, relatively inexperienced students are able to acquire experimental data efficiently and effectively in many diverse and multidisciplinary undergraduate research projects. The project is also adapting the ExCEL model developed at Iowa State University. [See K.P. Constant, et. al., \"Extended Classroom for Enhanced Learning!\" at www.mse.iastate.edu/excel/main.html.] The value of SEM-EDS in the classroom and field is well documented by ExCEL and elsewhere. [For examples, see (1) K. Burton and D.L. Farkas, \"Telemicroscopy - Net Progress,\" Nature, Vol. 391 (1998) pp. 540-41; and (2) G.E. Sosinsky, T.S. Baker, G. Hand, and M.H. Ellisman, \"The Electron Microscopy Outreach Program: A Web-Based Resource for Research and Education, J. Struct. Biol., Vol. 125 (1999) pp. 246-252.] Viewed from a broader perspective, this project builds on our established and successful undergraduate research program that has led to a growing number of student presentations at off-campus events, some student publications, and most importantly, to greatly enhanced opportunities for JSU graduates to pursue graduate study. Collaborative student/faculty research is being disseminated through student presentations and/or publication in recognized journals. Dissemination of the educational value of using a SEM is being carried out through several \"expeditionary learning events\" that include science workshops sponsored by the Alabama Science in Motion/Biology, and a Web page promoting \"Scientific Inquiry Through SEM-EDS.\" \r\n\r\n",
