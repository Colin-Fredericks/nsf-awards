 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of new applications have recently emerged that require the storage,\r\nmaintenance, and analysis of massive amounts of data. Examples such as web\r\nsearch engines, data warehouses, and large scientific data repositories \r\noften involve multiple terabytes of data that are simultaneously searched and \r\nexplored by many users. This research project investigates fundamental \r\nalgorithmic problems arising in the context of such large data sets, studies \r\nthe complexity of these problems, develops new techniques for their efficient \r\nsolution, and experimentally validates proposed techniques in the appropriate \r\nsystem and application context. The main focus is on problems arising in \r\ndatabases and in searching and analyzing the World-Wide Web.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, the research focuses on problems concerning the storage, \r\nmaintenance, partitioning, indexing, and approximate representation of very \r\nlarge data sets, and the efficient exploration, analysis and precise and \r\napproximate querying of such data. The types of problems that are studied can\r\nbe grouped into two categories, one consisting of problems motivated mainly \r\nby applications in the database area, and one motivated by applications in \r\nweb search and analysis. In the first category, the project studies \r\nmulti-dimensional data partitioning problems arising in selectivity estimation\r\nand indexing, feedback-based approaches to selectivity estimation, association\r\nrule mining problems, and the approximate and precise evaluation of complex\r\nqueries on large data sets. The problems studied in the second category are\r\nconcerned with online search on the web, the study of random graph models for\r\nthe web, and efficient computing with large web graphs and hypertext \r\ncollections.\r\n\r\n",
