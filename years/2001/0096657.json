 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Museum of Comparative Zoology's collection of amphibians and reptiles is one of the world's largest and most important resources for systematic herpetology.  Information stored in it is of great scientific value.  More than half the world's species are represented, including representatives of all families.  It is exceptionally rich in primary type specimens and important historical collections, which have figured prominently in the development of herpetology as a discipline and in the development of faunal work for particular areas or taxonomic groups.  The collection is heavily used by the international scientific community, as documented by the high frequency of loan requests, by the large number of primary research publications that are based wholly or in part on MCZ specimens, and by the many visitors who come to work in the collection.  The present project would relieve serious overcrowding by the purchase of a compactor system and new cabinets, making this important resource more easily accessible to the community.  The project is part of the second phase of a three-phase plan to renovate the physical facilities of the Department of Herpetology and modernize the Department's operations.",
