 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for a two-day meeting.  The meeting will host system reform researchers in science, mathematics emphasizing technology.  These researchers represent a number of distinct disciplines including mathematics and science education, organization research, technology and policy.  The goal of the meeting is to produce a working research framework by taking stock of the research from these cross-disciplinary fields.  The framework will bring some coherence to the systemic movement from the perspective of research.  The deliverable will be a report that compares and contrasts what research models work and don't work in an effort to better map this now burgeoning field.  The ultimate deliverable will be a series of adaptation studies that will shed light on the possibility for research based systemic studies fundable in ROLE's quadrant IV.",
