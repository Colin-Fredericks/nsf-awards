The motile growth cone at the axon tip senses guidance cues in the environment and directs growth of the axon.  Although considerable work has focused recently on guidance molecule activity, the mechanisms by which these molecules function in vivo to coordinate axon pathfinding are largely unknown.  Dr. Halloran's research focuses on one family of potential axon guidance molecules, the semaphorins.  The semaphorin gene family is highly conserved from invertebrates to humans. This suggests that semaphorins have crucial functions for embryonic development and survival.  Semaphorins have been implicated in the regulation of axon pathfinding, sometimes acting as inhibitory guidance molecules, and other times attractive.  The semaphorin gene family is very large and diverse, however little is known about the in vivo function of most family members.   \r\n\tThe aim of this proposal is to understand the in vivo function of one semaphorin of unknown function, sema3D, and to determine how it directs the growth of axons during nervous system development.  The potential role of sema3D in guiding growth cones of two neuronal types will be investigated.  Dr. Halloran's strategy is to manipulate sema3D gene expression in the developing zebrafish and analyze the resultant effects on axon growth by time-lapse video microscopy of living axons in vivo.  The examination of the effects of altered sema3D expression on growing axons should reveal how the axons are normally guided by sema3D.  The proposed experiments will likely provide novel insights into how semaphorins regulate growth cone motile behaviors within the complex in vivo environment.  The ultimate goal is to better understand how the wiring of the nervous system is established during embryonic development. \r\n\r\n",
