 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award provides support for a two-day workshop on the plant hormone cytokinin to be attended primarily by U.S. and Czech scientists. The workshop will be held in Prague on June 28 and 29, prior to the meeting of the International Plant Growth Substances Association (IPGSA) in Brno, to maximize participation. The objective is to enhance existing and initiate new collaboration, particularly between junior faculty, postdoctoral students, and graduate students, with the goal of extending research partnership to the next generation of scientists. The funds will be used for organization of the workshop and for travel of young scientists (faculty, postdoctorals, and graduate students) to the workshop and the IPGSA meeting. The program will include reviews of recent advances in cytokinin research and discussions of future opportunities. Recent findings in selected areas will be introduced by lead scientists, followed by round-table discussions and small group sessions. The subjects will include: (1) biosynthetic and metabolic pathways; (2) receptors and signal transduction pathways; (3) genomics and proteomics; (4) genetic and functional analyses including mutants, knock-outs and transgenics; (5) methods and significance of cytokinin quantitation; (6) antibodies and immunology; and (7) regulation of cytokinin levels and physiological significance. This workshop should promote innovative research through collaborations between U.S. and Czech laboratories.",
