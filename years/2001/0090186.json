The conference chairs are Drs. David\r\nCase and Michael Nilges. The purpose of the conference is to bring together scientists\r\nworking at the forefront of biomolecular NMR, to foster the free exchange of cutting-edge,\r\npre-publication work, and to establish directions for exploiting computation to solve\r\ndifficult problems in the field. Gordon Conferences provide a valuable means of\r\ndisseminating information and ideas in a way that cannot be achieved through the usual\r\nchannels of communication, that is, publications and presentations at large scientific\r\nmeetings. This meeting is the second of what is intended to be a biannual conference.\r\nComputation plays a crucial role in virtually every aspect of biomolecular NMR, from data\r\nacquisition and analysis to structure determination. In order to reflect the full breadth\r\nof the field, a broad, multinational representation of scientists engaged in both\r\nexperiment and computation has been assembled. Central themes of the conference will be\r\nthe interdependence of experiment, theory, and computation, and the contributions that\r\ncomputation can make to advancing the frontiers of biomolecular NMR. Sessions will be\r\ndevoted to new sources of structural and dynamical information, computer-aided assignment,\r\ntreatment of dynamic disorder and structural heterogeneity, intermolecular interaction and\r\ndrug discovery, and NMR and structural genomics.",
