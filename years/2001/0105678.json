 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Algorithms for approximation and graph problems\r\nPI: Richard Cole\r\nCCR-0105678\r\n\r\n\r\nThis research concerns the finding of approximate solutions.\r\nIt is often the case that finding exact solutions is vastly too\r\nexpensive in terms of the time required, to the point of\r\nbeing infeasible.  Yet fairly accurate solutions which are\r\n\"good enough\" may be obtainable in a much shorter time, and\r\nconsequently be more practical.  The specific problem domains\r\non which this research focuses range from pattern matching\r\n(for example, devising algorithms to find similar and/or\r\nrepeating patterns in DNA sequences) to intrinsically\r\nintractable problems such as the travelling salesman problem\r\n(which amounts to finding a shortest route connecting a\r\ncollection of cities).\r\n\r\n  The research on string matching is considering new notions\r\nof approximation so as to devise efficient algorithms for a\r\nbroader class of approximate matches than is feasible presently;\r\nboth searches between pairs of strings and against a database\r\nof strings are being studied.  The second part of our research\r\nfocuses on NP-hard problems.  We are looking at multicost\r\nshortest path problems (e.g. with a cost comprising both\r\ntime and price) in which one seeks all non-dominated solutions,\r\nat improving the quality of approximations for the Travelling\r\nSalesman Problem in the plane, and also at improving the\r\napproximations obtainable for generalized Steiner Tree problems.\r\n",
