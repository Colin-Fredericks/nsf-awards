McCarty, Director of the Western Region Hazardous Substance Research Center, Stanford University, to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Jaeho Bae, Department of Environmental Engineering, Inha University, Korea.  The joint study will investigate the process of biological degradation of chlorinated ethenes.  Principal objectives of the project include development of a numerical model that integrates the many factors involved in the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes, and to verify the model using field data.\r\n \r\nBecause of their wide use in industry, chlorinated ethenes have become major contaminants of groundwater and soil.  Remediation of groundwater contaminated with chlorinated ethenes is very difficult because they are dense, only partially soluble in water, and relatively resistant to chemical and biological degradation.  Nevertheless, biological reductive dechlorination is one of the promising methods for bioremediation of contaminated sites, as it may be cost-effective compared to chemical and physical treatment, and it is also environmentally friendly as contaminants are degraded into non-toxic ethene.  The multiple processes involved in reductive dechlorination are highly complex, and our knowledge of this process is still rather limited.  This project will combine the complementary expertise and facilities of the American and Korean laboratories to advance our mutual understanding of the process.\r\n\r\n",
