 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will address several problems involving general relativity,\r\nthe generation of gravitational radiation, relativistic\r\nhydrodynamics, radiative transport, and stellar dynamics.\r\nA common thread uniting the different theoretical topics \r\nis the crucial role of gravitation, especially relativistic\r\ngravitation as described by Einstein's field equations of\r\ngeneral relativity. Compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) \r\nwill provide the principal forum, and the understanding \r\nthe dynamics of matter in a strong gravitational field \r\nwill be a major theme. Some of the topics that will be \r\ninvestigated include the inspiral and coalescence of binary \r\nneutron stars and black holes, the generation of gravitational \r\nwaves from binaries and other promising astrophysical sources \r\nof gravitational radiation, gravitational collapse, the \r\nstability of rotating neutron stars and supermassive stars \r\nand the final fate of unstable stars, and the formation of \r\nsupermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies and quasars. \r\n\r\nMost of the topics that will be addressed represent \r\nlong-standing, fundamental problems in theoretical\r\nphysics requiring large-scale computation for solution. \r\nHence the approach will involve to a significant degree\r\nlarge-scale computations on parallel machines, \r\nas well as analytical modeling. Many of the numerical \r\ncalculations will be carried out using the  computational \r\nresources of the UIUC's National Center for Supercomputing \r\nApplications (NCSA). Utilizing and developing new algorithms \r\nfor these computers and visualization tools will help advance\r\nstate-of-the art computing in the US.  The results of the \r\ncalculations will have an important bearing on forthcoming \r\nastronomical observations, including those planned for \r\ngravitational wave interferometers, such as LIGO and LISA. \r\nThe theoretical modeling of gravitational waveforms which \r\nwill be performed by Shapiro and his group will provide\r\nessential input for the identification of sources of\r\ngravitational radiation  by these instruments.",
