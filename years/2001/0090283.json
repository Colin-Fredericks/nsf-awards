 "awd_abstract_narration": "DEB-0090283\r\nDr. Douglas E. Soltis\r\n\r\nThe flowering plants, consisting of approximately 300,000 species, are by far the largest group of land plants, yet their origin and early diversification have long been problematic.  However, extensive collaborations among plant scientists using molecular tools are clarifying the major lineages of flowering plants and their relationships.  At the same time, numerous breakthroughs have also occurred in the field of paleobotany, and views of early angiosperm diversity have greatly improved through the recent description of numerous fossils.   Integrating these fossils into the tree of living taxa remains essential for understanding both the origin of living flowering plants and the origins of morphological features.  Such attempts at integration have been rare for any group of organism; there has been surprisingly little communication between paleontologists and plant scientists who study the relationships of living organisms (i.e., systematists).  \r\n\tThis RCN grant will facilitate, coordinate, and stimulate research at the interface of paleobotany, geology, and systematics/phylogenetics.  Scientists in the network will explore the ways in which flowering plant fossils can be appropriately integrated into the tree of life that is now available for living organisms, with the ultimate goal of forming a comprehensive \"family tree of relationships\" for both living and fossil flowering plants.  They envision five components for discussion:  (1) Careful evaluation of the fossil record, including the establishment of a priority list of the best fossils for detailed study; (2) Critical appraisal of the age of fossils; (3) Construction of a morphological data set for fossils and extant flowering plants; (4) Integration of fossils into the flowering plant tree; and (5) Calibration of the times at which major groups of flowering plants diverged.  The group will implement annual meetings, workshops, student travel awards, student research training awards, and website development.  With the recent developments in both paleobotany and the study of relationships among living flowering plants, the timing is appropriate for integration of these fields.  The theory and methodology developed will be applicable to the integration of paleontology and living organisms on a broader scale.",
