 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the preparation and study of new microstructures based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels that are coated with a lipid membraned and fabricated within a microfluidic channel.  The lipid coating provides a thin permeability barrier and the hydrogel network serves as dynamic scaffolding.  These soft microstructures can be used to regulate the flow of fluids in microfluidic devices without external intervention, and they may serve as models of cell and tissue surfaces.  Harnessing their potential requires the development of new hydrogels as well as a deeper understanding of the assembly of lipid coatings at the gel-liquid interface.  The major objectives of this project are: (1) to develop methods for fabricating lipid-coated microgels, (2) to characterize the structure and study the transport properties of the lipid coating, and (3) to study changed in the permeability of the lipid membrane induced by specific chemical or biological agents.  The main methods to be employed are the design and synthesis of new monomers and reactive lipids, microfabrication and photopolymerization, chemical modification of hydrogels, and a variety of scanning confocal microscopy, and electrical measurements.\r\n%%%\r\nThe understanding gained from these studies will help to lay the foundation for the long-term objective of fabricating artificial cells, and the research undertaken will provide interdisciplinary training to students and postdoctoral associates in polymer chemistry and materials science.\r\n",
