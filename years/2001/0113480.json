Over our four years of experience in operating a high-resolution X-ray CT scanner dedicated to the geosciences at the University of Texas, we have identified the types of quantitative analysis whose necessity arises repeatedly in addressing research questions. These include identifying, separating, and characterizing up to thousands of individual objects within a scan volume, quantifying three-dimensional fabrics and textures, and measuring local and dispersed volume properties such as fracture apertures and porosity. We have laid the foundation for progress in each of these areas by developing algorithms and complete software applications in support of some of our joint research projects with outside investigators. We propose to build upon this foundation by expanding and generalizing these programming efforts, creating a suite of tools that will greatly expand the value and utility of CT data, as well as any other volumetric data set. Graduate research projects will provide the setting in which these tools are applied and tested. \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
