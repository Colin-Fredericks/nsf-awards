To be effective, this cleanup effort will require a\r\nvariety of remedial technologies. While natural attenuation is a demonstrated \"technology\" for\r\nthe remediation of certain contaminated sites, the processes that constitute natural attenuation,\r\nincluding sorption, biodegradation, and abiotic transformation, are only generally understood.\r\nThe least studied of these processes is probably abiotic transformation of organic pollutants by\r\nminerals, both alone and in the presence of natural organic matter--the focus of this proposed\r\nresearch. Abiotic transformations are likely to be particularly important under conditions\r\ninhospitable to microbial growth, such as high pollutant concentrations and low temperatures.\r\nSince these conditions prevail at many contaminated sites, it is important to quantify to the\r\nfullest extent possible the contribution of mineral mediated transformations to pollutant natural\r\nattenuation.\r\nThe specific objectives of this research are: (1) identification of the pollutants and pollutant classes likely to undergo significant abiotic transformation in the presence of minerals\r\nand compounds representative of natural organic matter (NOM), (2) correlation of reaction rates\r\nwith the molecular properties of the pollutant and NOM model compound, and with solution\r\nconditions such as pH, ionic strength, and temperature, and (3) identification and evaluation of\r\ntechniques for enhancing abiotic pollutant natural attenuation.\r\nWhile there is international recognition of the need for interdisciplinary research on complex environmental problems such as pollutant natural attenuation, there is no consensus on\r\nhow best to train scientists and engineers to conduct interdisciplinary research. The educational activities described in this proposal seek to train students in these strategies, and to identify effective practices for teaching environmental scientists and engineers to be interdisciplinary. Specific objectives include (1) implementation of an interdisciplinary undergraduate research program in which students from chemistry and environmental science and engineering departments serve as visiting researchers in each others' laboratories and (2) development of an interdisciplinary graduate course addressing pollutant natural attenuation. A suite of techniques will be employed to assess the effectiveness of these educational activities, including student portfolios and written self-assessments, student questionnaires, and interdisciplinary peer and faculty review of student reports and presentations.***\r\n",
