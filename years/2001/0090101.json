Bleiler\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for speakers and others at\r\nsemiannual conferences in the series known as the ``Cascade Topology\r\nSeminar,'' over a three-year period beginning in 2001. These\r\nconferences will be held at various universities in the northwestern\r\nUnited States and southwestern Canada, including the Universities of\r\nOregon, Washington, and Puget Sound, and Boise, Portland, and Oregon\r\nState Universities.  Typically there will be half a dozen principal\r\nspeakers on topics ranging widely over geometry and topology, the\r\nmajority from outside the home institutions of the Seminar, and more\r\nthan fifty participants altogether, roughly half of them faculty and\r\nhalf of them graduate students, as well as an occasional undergraduate\r\nstudent. Participation by younger mathematicians, by women, and by\r\nunderrepresented minorities is encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe mathematics presented in meetings of the Cascade Topology Seminar\r\nranges widely over topology and geometry.  Topological issues include\r\nalgebraic and geometric methods for describing and characterizing\r\nspatial problems such as the challenge of recognizing whether two\r\nknotted curves in three-space are essentially identical.  Geometric\r\ntopics addressed in the Seminar include differential geometry, which\r\nemphasizes measures of the curvature of spaces and the consequences of\r\ncurvature for analytic problems, as well as algebraic geometry, which\r\nhas its roots in the study of families of solutions to polynomial\r\nequations.\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0090101\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Steven A.
