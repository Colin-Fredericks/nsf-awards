 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\nThis project is designed to stimulate interest in engineering and increase retention in engineering programs by developing a web-based laboratory course that enhances the freshman engineering experience. In this course, students complete a comprehensive, hands-on project, in this case a robot, incorporating a broad spectrum of concepts that will be expanded in detail in subsequent advanced courses. The courseware/laboratory system design consists of WebLAB, which is web-based courseware with built-in instrument controls, and the e-LAB instrumentation device, which is a computer-controlled laboratory instrument box connected between a test circuit wired on a protoboard and the student's computer. The web-based courseware contains all the engineering concepts and instructions to successfully build a robot and to understand all aspects of its operation. The modules contain background material, tutorials, structured questions, calculations and verifications of theory, graphing tools, laboratory report preparation through the use of templates, report questions that require independent and collaborative research, experiment evaluation and feedback, and integrated assessment tools for evaluating module effectiveness. Project assessment includes content and delivery evaluation by faculty and students at this institution and at two other diverse institutions. Results are disseminated by publications and conference presentations, and courseware is widely available on the internet and easily adaptable by other engineering and technical institutions.",
