 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and her colleagues collaborate in a group\r\nproject at the Center for BioDynamics (CBD) to provide\r\ninterdisciplinary education and training for graduate students\r\nand postdoctoral-level investigators in the context of a vigorous\r\ninterdisciplinary research program that focuses on areas of\r\nmutual interest in mathematics (especially dynamical systems),\r\nbiology, and engineering.  Disciplines include mathematics,\r\nbiomedical engineering, aerospace/mechanical engineering,\r\nbiology, psychology, and physics.  Training extends beyond the\r\nusual classroom activities by engaging participants in a variety\r\nof research projects as well.  One of the major topics is dynamics\r\nof the nervous system.  The projects, which involve experiments,\r\nmodeling, and analysis, all deal with the variety of rhythms in\r\nthe nervous system and the potential functions of these rhythms\r\nin key cognitive states and processes such as attention,\r\nawareness, learning, and recall.  A second major topic is\r\ndynamics of gene expression.  Progress in genomic research is\r\nleading to maps of the building blocks of biology and fueling the\r\nstudy of gene regulation, where proteins often regulate their own\r\nproduction or that of other proteins in a complex web of\r\ninteractions.  CBD projects focus on using techniques from\r\nnonlinear dynamics, statistical physics, control theory, and\r\nmolecular biology to model, design, and construct synthetic gene\r\nregulatory networks, and to probe naturally occurring gene\r\nregulatory networks.  The third major topic is the dynamics of\r\npatterns and waves.  Training activities include two weekly\r\nworking seminars, extra journal clubs and reading groups,\r\nseminars to educate the CBD members in the research going on\r\nwithin the Center, and a CBD-initiated team-taught course.\r\n     The Center for BioDynamics (CBD) helps to advance\r\nunderstanding of difficult interdisciplinary problems at the\r\nintersection of mathematics, biology, and engineering, and it\r\ntrains mathematicians, scientists, and engineers for the 21st\r\ncentury workforce.  It does this by combining traditional\r\nclassroom education with significant engagement of students and\r\npostdocs in interdisciplinary teams working on current problems.\r\nThe disciplines involved are mathematics, biomedical engineering,\r\naerospace/mechanical engineering, biology, psychology, and\r\nphysics.  One of the major topics is dynamics of the nervous\r\nsystem.  The projects in this topic seek to shed light on the\r\norigin of the electrical activity in the brain, and how the brain\r\nuses this activity to process sensory information, to think, and\r\nto regulate movement.  A second major topic is dynamics of gene\r\nexpression.  The web of interactions among the proteins that are\r\nproduced by genes is complex; the projects associated with this\r\ntopic involve the design and construction of artificial gene\r\nregulatory networks, and techniques to better understand\r\nnaturally occurring gene regulatory networks.  The third major\r\ntopic is the dynamics of patterns and waves, occuring in a\r\nvariety of applications.  Training activities include two weekly\r\nworking seminars, regular sessions to read scientific journals,\r\nseminars to educate the CBD members in the research going on\r\nwithin the Center, and a CBD-initiated team-taught course.  The\r\nproject is supported by the Computational Mathematics, Applied\r\nMathematics, Computational Neuroscience, and Biological Databases\r\nand Informatics programs and by the MPS Office of\r\nMultidisciplinary Activities.\r\n",
