The technical program of the meeting includes the five mini-symposia of Bioinformatics, Nanotechnology in Biomedicine, Functional Imaging, Modeling as a Tool in Neuromuscular and Rehabilitation Research, and Neural Imaging and Computational Imaging. The mini-symposia will introduce prospective investigators to the state-of-the-science in these increasingly important areas of biomedical engineering research.\r\n\r\nSupport is being provided to cover partial travel costs for 20 speaker-participants in the mini-symposia. Individuals who receive support are to be selected based on the following: participation in the mini-symposia; young investigators; diversity (gender; minority; disabled); symposia organizers.\r\n\r\nParticipants in the mini-symposia will learn about current research that will contribute to the development of technologies leading to new applications in medicine.  Each recipient of support is expected to submit a report describing the research discussed at the mini-symposia having the greatest potential for dramatically influencing the development of new medical technologies.\r\n",
