In\r\nparticular it will study the interrelation of their\r\ntopological and algebraic properties. This subject\r\nrecently got a new powerful tool, the so-called\r\ntheory of amoebas. Mikhalkin will work on further\r\ndeveloping this theory and will make use of amoebas\r\nfor investigating algebraic varieties. Amoebas have\r\nalready proved to be an extremely useful tool in\r\nseveral areas of Mathematics, including Algebraic\r\nGeometry, Topology and Complex Analysis. Earlier\r\nMikhalkin used this tool in the proof of topological\r\nuniqueness  of maximal arrangements of plane real\r\nalgebraic curves (in the context of Hilbert's 16th\r\nproblem). A part of the project is to obtain a\r\ngeneralization of this result in higher dimensions.\r\nThe other part of the project is based on the same\r\ntechnique but will investigate complex algebraic\r\nhypersurfaces by constructing and analyzing certain\r\nsingular Lagrangian fibrations over PL-complexes.\r\nSuch fibrations give a hope to extract topology\r\nhidden in the Hodge structure of algebraic varieties.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic varieties and, in particular, real algebraic\r\nvarieties are fundamental mathematical objects naturally\r\noccuring in modern-day Physics, Optics, Mechanics and\r\nRobotics. For instance, all possible positions of a\r\nmechanical linkage (e.g. an arm of a robot) form a real\r\nalgebraic variety. The question of topological classification\r\nof plane real algebraic curves (1-dimensional varieties)\r\nposed by Hilbert over 100 years ago is still open. A\r\nrecent advance by Mikhalkin in this problem relied on\r\na new mathematical notion, that of amoeba, introduced\r\nby Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinski. Algebraic amoebas\r\nare regions in space which are associated to varieties.\r\nThese concave regions with \"tentacles\" and \"vacuoles\"\r\nresemble in shape biological amoebas.\r\n",
