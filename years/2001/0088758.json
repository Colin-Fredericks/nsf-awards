 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) \r\n\r\nThis project adapts a proven online Web-based learning system for the mathematics curriculum and develops curricular materials for the first calculus course. The system provides electronic homework, allowing instructors to easily create assignments that help students understand and master the material covered in class. It has already been extended in chemistry to support more interactive learning activities such as guided discovery and intelligent tutoring. The products of this project include a suite of basic online homework activities that cover the curricula of the first semester of the calculus course sequence, interactive guided discovery modules focused on topics and concepts where animation and simulation can be employed to support learning, and intelligent tutors that focus on difficult but key concepts in the curriculum and adaptively assist students in developing their understanding of them. All interactive activities are integrated into the basic online system, which records student progress for instructor review. A computer laboratory is created to support students doing online learning activities. Math faculty will create content for the homework system and interactive activities. Project staff modify the system to better support mathematics, train instructors in system use, help design interactive activities, and implement many of these activities. This project addresses a critical national need to improve the mathematical preparation of undergraduates from a wide variety of disciplines. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
