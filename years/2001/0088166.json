 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \r\n\r\nThe Department of Chemistry is in the process of restructuring the organic chemistry laboratories through introduction of Problem-Solving Laboratories (PSL), the addition of microscale experimental techniques, and the introduction of modern instrumentation. Use of a new Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer is being incorporated into the design of new laboratory procedures for two terms of organic chemistry. The PSL approach and individual experiments are being adapted from those used at other institutions and reported in the chemical literature. The new PSL format, facilitated by use of the FTIR spectrometer, is increasing the quality of our laboratory instruction by providing a collaborative learning environment, allowing students time to design experiments and express ideas, and giving students experience with modern instrumentation and techniques. This laboratory design provides students with a more realistic experience of chemistry, challenging and developing their critical thinking skills, and better preparing them to make informed decisions relating to science. It is anticipated that this laboratory modification and style will attract more students,\r\nparticularly women and under-represented minority groups, to the study of science. Project results will be disseminated at local chemical education meetings, in standard pedagogical journals, and at regional and national meetings of the American Chemical Society and/or the Biennial Conference on Chemical Education.\r\n\r\n",
