 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to create and disseminate instructional materials on nanoscale science and technology for use in undergraduate science and engineering curricula. A text, demonstrations, and laboratory experiments are being developed around the themes of nanoparticles, nanoporous materials, and nanoarchitectures. Examples of nanoparticles include colloidal metals, ferrofluids, semiconductor quantum dots, and artificial atoms. Nanoporous materials include aerogels, dendrimers, micelles, and zeolites. Nanoarchitectures focuses on nanotubes, amorphous metals and quasicrystals, giant magnetoresistance (GMR) structures, LEDs/diode lasers, self-assembly, and surface reconstruction. Collectively, these products illustrate the importance of surface effects, the limitations of scaling laws, and the onset of quantum effects as nanoscale dimensions are approached. They also demonstrate the tools and techniques required for nanoscale studies, including scanning probe microscopies, lithographic and contact printing techniques, and mechanical, electrical, optical, and magnetic characterization of materials and devices. The project is being conducted with assistance from experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories, and with resources from the University of Wisconsin-Madison NSF-supported Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) on Nanostructured Materials and Interfaces. The inherently interdisciplinary themes of nanoscale science and technology will be adapted for use in a variety of science, mathematics, engineering and echnology (SMET) classes through a pair of workshops. The first workshop aims to acquaint leading individuals from various SMET disciplines with the materials being developed so as to customize them for use across disciplines. The second workshop aims to introduce publishers and textbook writers to the materials. In addition to publications, products, and presentations, dissemination involves partnerships with www.SMETE.ORG, a Core Integration project of the NSF National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL); and with the University of Wisconsin System, through its Department of Defense-supported Academic Advanced Distributed Learning Collaborative Laboratory. A collection of web-based learning objects is being created from the instructional materials that will be readily accessible, adaptable, and affordable. Field testing is an integral part of the project and includes volunteers from the full spectrum of post-secondary institutions. Evaluation of the project is being conducted using a variety of tools and techniques. Project participants include undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctorals, who have the opportunity to contribute to this integration of cutting-edge research and education. The project aims to enhance science literacy and help attract a diverse group of talented undergraduates to technical careers and to teaching careers.",
