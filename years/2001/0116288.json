 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0116288\r\nJack Morava\r\n\r\nThe central idea of this proposal is a mathematical \r\ndefinition for the physicists' notion of topological \r\ngravity (analogous to Segal's mathematical definition of \r\nconformal field theory) as a representation of a monoidal \r\ncategory with manifolds as objects, using the geometric \r\nrealization of a category of cobordisms between those \r\nobjects as its morphism spaces; these spaces are unions of \r\nclassifying spaces for the diffeomorphism groups of the \r\ncobordisms. In two dimensions, the resulting category \r\nis quite similar to that considered by Segal, but it \r\ngeneralizes very naturally, e.g. to four dimensions, \r\nwhere it has close connections with classical general \r\nrelativity; but there is also a version for topological \r\n(i.e, non-smooth) four-manifolds, lacking any clear \r\nclassical analog. Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten theory fit \r\nnaturally into this framework, which predicts that such \r\ninvariants should have higer-order `gravitational \r\ndescendants', e.g. higher-codimension versions of the \r\nwall-crossing obstructions. In dimension two, this formalism \r\nfits in well on the one hand with work of Madsen and \r\nTillmann on Mumford's conjecture, and on the other with the \r\ntheory of a `large' quantum cohomology studied by Kontsevich, \r\nManin, Witten, and others. One concrete goal of the project\r\nis to construct a cohomological theory related to the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta-invariant of a three-manifold, \r\nas Casson's invariant is related to Floer homology.   \r\n\r\nClassical mechanics studies the trajectories of point \r\nparticles in a smooth geometric background, and much \r\nrecent work in string theory can be formulated in similar \r\nterms, with the background replaced by the \r\n(infinite-dimensional) space of smooth loops in some \r\nambient manifold.  However, the mathematics of these \r\nfree loopspaces is quite challenging, and their topology \r\n(not to mention their geometry) is not yet well-understood.\r\nAn added complication is that the models studied in \r\nquantum field theory involve topology change in a \r\nconceptually intrinsic way, and thus seem often to call, \r\nnot for the free loopspace itself, but for a suitable\r\ncompletion with nice properties -- whose nature is still \r\nbeing worked out.  This proposal suggests that the desired \r\ncompletion is an analog, for free loopspaces, of the dual \r\nof a finite-dimensional smooth manifold (as studied in the \r\n1960's by Whitehead, Spanier, Atiyah, and others). This \r\npoint of view seems compatible with work of Chas and \r\nSullivan on string topology, with work of Cohen, Jones, \r\nand Segal on Floer homotopy type, and with work of Ando \r\nand myself on the Witten genus. \r\n",
