 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues develop an\r\ninterdisciplinary training program that would give graduate\r\nstudents substantive training in both mathematics and biology.\r\nThe goal is to produce students competent in both disciplines,\r\nwith genuine expertise in applied mathematics and some specific\r\narea of biology: biofluids, ecology and evolutionary biology,\r\nneuroscience, or physiology.  Training is built on the Special\r\nInterest Group, which includes faculty members from both\r\nmathematics and biology, students and postdocs, and\r\nindustry-based researchers where appropriate.\r\n     Modern biology is increasingly mathematical and\r\ncomputational.  Education and training in components of both\r\ndisciplines is needed to prepare people for the 21st century\r\nworkforce, for leading-edge research, and for teaching.  This\r\npilot project includes innovative aspects in its thematic\r\norganization, flexible arrangement of both common and\r\narea-specific content, interdisciplinary teaming, combination of\r\ntheoretical and experimental training, and involvement of\r\nindustrial partners.  The combination is promising for fostering\r\nlong-term changes by growing a generation of scientists,\r\nmathematicians, and engineers who share language and skills well\r\nenough to take up and solve key problems.",
