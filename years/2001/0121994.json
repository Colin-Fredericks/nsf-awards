The initiative consists of three integrated and complementary programs: 1) A traveling exhibit entitled in Earthquakes and Tectonics of the Pacific Northwest, 2) a visiting geologist program to interact personally with local schools and citizen groups, and 3) a new generation Internet exhibit entitled, Northwest Origins: Geologic Evolution of the Pacific Northwest that explores the initiative topics and promotes engaging visualization of the large-scale tectonic processes that have created the Pacific Northwest over geologic time. The initiative is in response to the recent major earthquake that broadly affected residents\r\nthroughout western Washington and Oregon. Personal experience with a major seismic event has greatly heightened public interest in tectonic processes active in the Pacific Northwest. The goals of the project are to better educate citizens and students about the geologic events that\r\ncreate earthquakes, the different tectonic settings in which earthquakes occur, the role these tectonic processes have played in creating the lands of the Pacific Northwest over geologic time, and the significance of ongoing research programs. \r\n",
