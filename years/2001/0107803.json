 "awd_abstract_narration": "Herschel Rabitz of Princeton University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program for research that deals with development of new theoretical concepts relevant to the control of quantum phenomena and the extraction of mechanistic and other physical information from the control process.  The project has four components: (A) design and analysis of molecular controls, (B) exploration of special control objectives, (C) development of closed loop algorithms to guide laboratory learning control, and (D) development of closed loop algorithms for extracting molecular interactions from laboratory control experiments. Components (A) and (B) aim to attain physical insights into the control of quantum phenomena through theoretical and computational analysis. The emphasis in items (C) and (D) is on bolstering the emerging closed loop laboratory capabilities for controlling quantum processes by the introduction of new algorithms. Close connections exist among all of the proposed research categories, with some of the design and analysis studies serving as forerunners to the closed loop algorithm development. Although this research is theoretical and computational in nature, it aims for direct impact on emerging laboratory control experiments. Several collaborative laboratory ventures have therefore been established, with the objective of transferring the proposed concepts and algorithms into the laboratory for rapid implementation. Collectively, the research aims to advance the capabilities to manipulate molecular processes and more general quantum phenomena while simultaneously extracting as much physical information as possible from the efforts.\r\n\r\nSince the invention of laser, chemists have dreamed of selectively exciting regions within a molecule and thus causing a controlled chemical reaction to occur.  Long ago it was realized, however, that energy redistributes in molecules so rapidly that it is it not possible to concentrate enough energy in a selected bond to cause it to break.  With the advent of laser pulse modulation techniques and the application of quantum control theory, it now appears that laser selective chemistry could potentially become a reality with ultimately practical applications.",
