 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed ARW is to provide a forum for free-spirited exchange and debate of views,\r\nvisions, and ideas. The format includes both prepared invited presentations and ad hoc\r\ncontributions with uninhibited exchange of views and rebuttals. Some of the key luminaries\r\nwill come to share their opinions and to lead the discussions on where the technologies \r\nare going and/or should be going. Balanced representations of advocacy and opposition\r\nwill be intentionally sought.\r\n\r\nEach day will start with presentations given by key speakers on subjects in one or two\r\nchosen themes. It is then followed by debates and invited talks by other participants.\r\nAll oral presentations (in morning sessions) are to focus on the presenter's views and\r\nprojections of future directions, assessments or critiques of important new\r\nideas/approaches, and NOT on their own achievements. The presenters are asked to be\r\nprovocative and/or inspiring.\r\nLatest advances made and results obtained by the participants will be presented in the\r\nafternoon sessions in the form of posters and group/individual discussions.\r\n\r\nThe day will be concluded by an evening panels session that attempts to further the\r\ndebates on selected controversial issues connected to the theme of the day. Each session\r\nwill be chaired by one forceful character that will invite 2-3 attendees of his/her choice\r\nto lead with a position statement, all other attendees being the panelists. The debate\r\nwill be forcefully moderated and irrelevant digressions will be cut off without mercy.\r\nModerators will be also assigned a hopeless task to forge a consensus on critical issues.\r\n\r\nFor these considerations, a format has been choosen that is less rigid than normal workshops to\r\nallow and encourage uninhibited exchanges and sometimes confrontation of different views.\r\nA design a central theme will be designed together with the speakers for each day.\r\n",
