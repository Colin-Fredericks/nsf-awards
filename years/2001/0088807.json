 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59) \r\n\r\nThere is a growing need for accessible design (AD) products and services for individuals with disabilities. Relevant laws mandating accessibility apply to jobs, public facilities, public transportation, public sources of information including public internet services, telecommunication products and services, and the full spectrum of electronic and information technologies. These laws and others not only mandate accessibility, but in many cases they mandate the use of AD principles in the design process. However, the lack of designers and engineers with knowledge of and expertise in AD principles is a national problem. Faculty, and hence students, are not aware of the need for more coverage of AD principles and issues. \r\n\r\nTo address this need, we are developing curricular material on AD principles and issues that is modular and hierarchically structured in cooperation with business and academic partners. The hierarchical approach means that the material is designed for use in introductory engineering courses as well as in advanced theory and design courses. The modular approach allows integration of the material in small parts: a lecture topic, homework problems, course demonstration or laboratory experiments. The long-term goal of this project is to have accessible design material integrated into the undergraduate engineering curricula of colleges and universities throughout the United States.",
