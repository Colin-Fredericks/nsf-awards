 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Children's Museum of Houston, in cooperation with Scholastic Entertainment, the National Weather Service and the American Meteorological Society (AMS), will develop, produce and nationally circulate two (2) copies of a 2,500-sq.ft. interactive exhibit.  Using the popular icon of the Magic School Bus, the exhibit will take young children on a journey of discovery to explore the science involved in the Earth's weather.  The exhibit, \"The Magic School Bus Gets Weather Wise,\" and accompanying educational materials and programs will be bilingual in Spanish and English and will support national and Texas standards for science and mathematics learning for children aged 5-10.  It is estimated that the exhibit and programs will serve 2,000,000 children and adults in 36 national venues over six (6) years.\r\n\r\nWeather Exploration Stations will precede the exhibit to encourage community engagement prior to the exhibit's arrival at the host venue.  AMS scientists, local meteorologists and media weathercasters will assist visitor experiences and help museums with strategies for publicity campaigns and development of local programming.  \r\n\r\nThe visiting audiences of children and their families will learn meteorology is a study of weather, there are different types of weather, a variety of tools are used in predicting weather and the water cycle plays a role in weather events.  Visitors will read data from maps, graphs, thermometers, anemometers, experiment with variables and model weather conditions using interactive exhibit components.\r\n\r\n",
