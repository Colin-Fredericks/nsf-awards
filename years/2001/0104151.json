The geometric problems consist of studying the\r\n dynamics of flows on flat surfaces with cone angle singularities. \r\nA particular example is the study of billiards in polygons with angles that \r\nare rational multiples of pi.  The particular aspect of this study will be to\r\n attempt to find the asymptotic growth rate for the number of periodic orbits.\r\n For some billiards such as the square, the growth rate is known.\r\n Other more interesting examples are certain right triangles.\r\n The principal investigator will study additional examples such as the\r\nsquare with a slit or barrier. The idea is to find asymptotic quadratic\r\nestimates. The topological problems concern the mapping class group of a \r\nsurface. This group is one of  the main objects of study in surface topology. \r\n One of the recent developments in group theory is to study the large scale\r\nor asymptotic geometry of a group.  The principal investigator proposes to\r\nstudy the large scale geometry of the mapping class group with a goal of\r\nshowing that the mapping class group is quasi-isometrically rigid. \r\n\r\n \r\nIn the field of dynamical systems one studies the motion of objects. \r\nThe field had its origins  in the study of the motion of the\r\nplanets.  Billiards are another closely related example. There one has a\r\npoint mass  that moves in straight lines so that when  it  encounters\r\nthe boundary of a region, it rebounds so that the angle of reflection\r\nequals the angle of incidence. Billiards have been studied for over 100\r\nyears. In order to understand such a dynamical system one\r\nneeds to understand the long term behavior of the orbits. One particular\r\nexample of this long term behavior are the study of the periodic\r\norbits.  These are the  orbits that repeat themselves. The study of\r\nperiodic orbits for billiards in polygons in the plane is the main subject\r\nof this proposal.  \r\n",
