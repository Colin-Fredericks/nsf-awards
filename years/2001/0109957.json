 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dillon\r\n0109957\r\n     The principal investigator and his colleagues develop\r\nmathematical models and computational methods for analyzing the\r\nmotion of eucaryotic cilia and flagella, the growth and\r\ndevelopment of the vertebrate limb bud and tumor growth.  The\r\nobjective of the cilia modeling is to develop three-dimensional\r\nmodels for an individual cilium or flagellum and for\r\nthree-dimensional arrays of cilia.  These models incorporate\r\ndiscrete representations of the axoneme's ultrastructure\r\nincluding the individual dyneins and microtubules, as well as a\r\ncontinuous description of the fluid mechanics using the immersed\r\nboundary method.  Vertebrate limb development is a widely-used\r\nmodel system for the study of development.  The investigator and\r\nhis collaborators have developed a 2D model for vertebrate limb\r\ndevelopment that describes limb bud outgrowth and predicts the\r\nspatio-temporal distribution of growth factors and morphogens.\r\nThe major goals of the limb development modeling are to further\r\nvalidate the 2D model, to extend it to three dimensions in order\r\nto determine what signals cells see as a function of their\r\nposition in the three-dimensional limb bud and developmental\r\nhistory and, from this, to suggest how the signals can be\r\nintegrated by cells to produce the observed spatial patterning.\r\nLimb development and tumor growth are moving boundary problems\r\nthat involve tissue growth, the transport of growth factors and\r\ncontrol of gene activity.  The investigators are developing an\r\nimmersed boundary model for tumor growth along with the limb\r\ndevelopment model.\r\n     These mathematical models focus on the complex biological\r\nsystems involved in cell motility, vertebrate development, and\r\ntumor growth.  An important aspect is the development of\r\ncomputational tools for the study of these processes.  Thus, the\r\nciliary model is used for the computational study of dynein\r\nactivation mechanisms in cilia and flagella and the multiciliary\r\nmodel for the study of mucociliary interaction.  The vertebrate\r\nlimb development model may be used as an aid in interpreting\r\nexperimental results, to help identify new experiments, and to\r\ntest hypotheses that may be difficult to test experimentally.\r\nBecause each of the models described in this proposal includes a\r\nfluid-mechanical representation, there is a unifying element in\r\ntheir mathematical description.  The computational methods are\r\nbased in part on the immersed boundary method, and the computer\r\ncodes share many of the major subroutines.  An important aspect of\r\nthis proposal is the development of parallel numerical methods\r\nfor the solution of these problems; advances in this area can be\r\nused in a variety of problems in the field of computational\r\nbiofluids.\r\n",
