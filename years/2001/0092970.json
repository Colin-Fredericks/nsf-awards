 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animation is a tremendously powerful medium of expression.\r\nIdeas that would be complex or even impossible to express\r\nwith still images or words can easily be conveyed using\r\nanimated sequences. Unfortunately, even when the concept to\r\nbe conveyed via animation is simple, the process of\r\nproducing the animation is inordinately difficult. Indeed,\r\nthis is one of the reasons computer animation has become so\r\ndominant - it holds the promise of automating, and thus\r\nsignificantly simplifying, the production process. Sadly,\r\nthe process of transferring ideas into computer animations\r\nis still far from simple. For example, the animated feature\r\nfilm Toy Story 2 required extremely hard work by as many as\r\n200 highly skilled computer and animation experts for more\r\nthan three years.\r\n\r\nMy career goal is to develop the concepts and algorithms\r\nthat will enable effortless, rapid development of realistic\r\nanimations that effectively convey the creator's purpose.\r\nThis research hopes to create the theoretical and\r\nexperimental foundation for building much more powerful\r\nanimation tools than exist today. Such tools will sharply\r\nreduce the production time needed by skilled animators and,\r\nmore importantly, enable average computer users to express\r\ntheir ideas through animation. Such tools will also help\r\neducators teach more effectively and allow each one of us to\r\nbecome creators and directors of personal and fictional\r\nstories. Only when animation production is easier will\r\nanimation be as commonplace on the web as images and text\r\nare today. Moreover, intuitive methods for creating\r\nrealistic human motion will further enable the creation of\r\nhuman avatars in tele-presence applications, new\r\nanthropomorphic human-computer interfaces, and realistic\r\ndigital actors in feature films and video games. Computer\r\nanimation will not achieve its full potential until 1)\r\nanimation tools require little or no skill, 2) an animator's\r\ncreativity is not stifled by the limitations of the\r\nanimation tools, and 3) the animation systems are available\r\nto every person with a computer and a story to tell. I hope\r\nto significantly contribute towards these goals.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of this research is the observation that the\r\nanimator's creativity will not be fully realized until it\r\nbecomes easier to produce realistic motion sequences. This\r\nproblem is tremendously challenging because the underlying\r\nphysical models of motion are difficult to create and\r\ncontrol. I believe that the solution lies in the creation of\r\nhighly-flexible realistic motion libraries, together with\r\ntools to modify them intuitively and extensively. The power\r\nof libraries stems from the ability to reuse already\r\nexisting high-quality motion, reducing the need for\r\nanimation skills. In this paradigm, the process of animation\r\nturns into selecting the specific motion library, and\r\nmodifying a set of motion properties that transform the\r\noriginal motion into a final animation.\r\n\r\nIn my research, I propose to develop a methodology for\r\ncreating and using realistic motion libraries flexible\r\nenough to be used in a wide range of applications. In 1995,\r\nI proposed the use of motion transformation as new way to\r\ncreate animations  - a method fundamentally different from\r\nthe traditional way of creating animations from scratch.\r\nThis transformation approach is particularly useful for\r\nmodifying realistic motion data captured from real-world\r\nactors. Unfortunately, during the transformation process,\r\nmuch of the realism tends to be lost. Recently, I published\r\na novel transformation approach which demonstrates that\r\nanimations can be intuitively transformed into a wide range\r\nof new sequences without violating the fundamental dynamic\r\nproperties of motion. The realism is preserved by\r\nmaintaining a model of the dynamic and biomechanic\r\nproperties of the animated character.\r\n\r\nIn the future, I will further develop mathematical models\r\nthat can be combined with real-world data to create reusable\r\nmotion libraries. Aside from preserving the realism of\r\nmotion, the most important requirement for effective motion\r\nlibraries is the flexibility with which the libraries can be\r\nadjusted to meet the needs of an animator. I plan to achieve\r\nthis flexibility by decomposing a character's motion into a\r\nfundamental component and a style component in a way\r\nthat allows us to independently transfer these components to\r\nnew characters. For example, the animator can produce a\r\nchild's cheerful run sequence by starting with a running\r\nmotion library extracted from the captured human run. This\r\nmotion can be modified by applying a happy, exuberant motion\r\nstyle, which is then transferred to an animated character of\r\na small child. Such decoupling of the fundamental motion,\r\nstyle, and performing character provides an extremely\r\npowerful and flexible animation paradigm that can produce a\r\nwide range of animations from a very small motion dataset.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the educational component of this proposal\r\nis to demonstrate the utility of advanced animation tools in\r\neducation and story-telling. I am particularly interested in\r\nintroducing these new animation tools to Seattle high-school\r\nstudents to verify that our research does indeed empower\r\nevery story-teller with an accessible medium of expression.\r\nI am also planning a project-oriented animation course\r\nintended for undergraduate and graduate students involved in\r\nanimation research, as well as in art and music. Together,\r\nthe students will work on using our tools to create an\r\nartistic short film project. This synergistic effort will\r\nexpose the artists to the latest animation technology and\r\nprovide direct user feedback to students involved in\r\nresearch. In addition, the created motion libraries as well\r\nas the animation tools, will be freely distributed through\r\nthe web and CDs with the hope that they will help animation\r\nbecome an effective communication medium across educational,\r\neconomic and cultural boundaries.\r\n\r\n",
