The participants will spend the summer together in Madison, Wisconsin in day-to-day interaction with senior researchers from the University of Wisconsin as well as with senior visitors. Participants will benefit from access to the major research library and other research facilities at the University, opportunities to establish continuing contacts and collaboration with other participants in the program, and advice and support in developing long term research programs.\r\n\tThe Summer 2001 program will focus on the study of probabilities of both large and small deviations in random systems, in 2002 the program will be devoted to shapes, waves, and interfaces generated by spatial interactions, and in 2003 the focus will involve spatial processes and stochastic geometry. Each of these programs will begin with survey lectures in the given areas of focus by experts from the U.S. and abroad. Three such lecture series are typically planned to begin each program, with each series consisting of five to eight hours of material. After the opening lectures there are follow up lectures on related material, and additional talks by participants, visitors, and local experts. In addition to the lectures, the intern program seeks to generate interactions between senior faculty and participants, as well as those between the participants themselves. These interactions can take the form of study groups, small group discussions, and sometimes one on one discussions. The program lasts about eight weeks.\r\n",
