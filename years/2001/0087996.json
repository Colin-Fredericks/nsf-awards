 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Systems Science (40) \r\nComputers are an increasingly important tool in the Earth Sciences and are used for research in fields such as paleoclimatology, seismology, and hydrogeology. Many students now entering graduate school, embarking on consulting careers, or obtaining jobs with state and federal governments are called upon to use computers to model complex systems or to acquire and handle digital datasets. Others are required to critically evaluate modeling projects reported in the geological literature. Despite these trends, undergraduate geology programs have been slow to initiate courses that develop skills in these emerging areas of study and employment. Furthermore, computer science offerings are not geared toward students in the Earth Sciences. This project is developing a course within the geology curriculum to meet the need for instruction in modeling in the earth sciences at the undergraduate level. \r\n\r\nThis course is making use of the reservoir/flux modeling software STELLA(r), developed by High Performance Systems, Inc., to teach the fundamentals of systems thinking and model construction, with application to a wide variety of geological problems. At the same time, students are learning how to program in the FORTRAN 90 computer language and are learning the basics of the Linux/Unix operating system. The project is adapting modeling which has been done within a number of different research contexts. The course differs from computer methods courses developed by other university geology departments in that it is teaching students computer skills by focusing on computer modeling of geological and environmental problems. \r\n\r\nThe final products of this project will include a detailed package of course notes, exercises, and debugged STELLA(r) and FORTRAN programs available free of charge to faculty interested in using these exercises in their courses. Colleagues at other institutions will be made aware of the availability of these exercises through an article in the Journal of Geoscience Education and through presentations at the annual Geological Society of America and/or Council on Undergraduate Research meetings.\r\n",
