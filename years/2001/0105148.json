The\r\nquantitative genetics measures of inbreeding depression and\r\nheritability quantify these effects, and ideally such measures would\r\nbe available for both small and large populations of the same\r\nspecies.  This study is using innovative molecular genetic methods to\r\nmeasure these quantities in populations of Aquilegia (Ranunculaceae;\r\ncolumbines) that vary dramatically in total population size.  DNA\r\ngenotypes will be used to determine how related inviduals are within\r\nthe populations; statistical models will then be used to estimate the\r\nquantitative genetics parameters describing inbreeding depression and\r\nheritability.  Because populations of different sizes will be studied,\r\na relationship between these measures and population size can be\r\ndetected if it exists.\r\n\r\nConservation biology has increasingly relied upon molecular genetic\r\nvariation.  However, to fully understand how that variation relates to\r\nadaptive differentiation, evolutionary potential, and resistance to\r\nthe threat of extinction--all critical concerns of conservation\r\nbiology--a better understanding of the quantitative genetic basis of\r\nadaptive traits is critical.  Furthermore, the assumptions mentioned\r\nabove about how population size affects that basis require empirical\r\ntesting in natural populations.  This novel study addresses and\r\nempirically tests important phenomena in biological conservation using\r\nmeasurements of quantitative genetics in field environments.\r\n",
