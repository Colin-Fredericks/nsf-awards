 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technology for a Sustainable Environment: Novel Hydrogen Reactor/Separator Design for a Fuel Cell Vehicle Infrastructure\r\n \r\nJames M. Fenton\r\nUniversity of Connecticut\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis project explores the merits of a new type of membrane for high-temperature hydrogen purification so that pure hydrogen can be obtained directly from a hydrocarbon steam reformer. The new membrane is fabricated from a class of ceramic compounds called perovskites that can be formulated to be both electron and proton conductors. These conductivities allow the hydrogen produced by the reforming reaction to be converted to electrons and protons on one surface of the membrane and converted to pure hydrogen on the other surface. In addition to producing pure hydrogen for fuel-cell use, extracting the hydrogen directly from the reformer shifts the reaction equilibrium to favor the formation of more hydrogen. Samples of these membrane materials are being fabricated and their properties determined for use in this application. Hydrogen permeability is measured and calculations performed to design an integrated reformer-purifier.\r\n\r\nCurrent proton-exchange-membrane fuel-cell systems require a complex fuel processor containing several components to produce a hydrogen gas of suitable purity for use in the fuel cell. This new hydrogen reactor/separator provides a smaller, simpler fuel processor for use in fuel cell systems. For on-board vehicular hydrogen production from gasoline, fuel-cell-system power density will be increased, startup time and transient thermal response will be improved, and cost reduced. Also, for either vehicles or stationary power generation, this unit will allow use of the existing natural-gas infrastructure for the formation of a hydrogen infrastructure through a network of small, low cost natural-gas reformers. These advances could have a significant impact on the rate of fuel cell commercialization to maintain a sustainable environment.  Pollution that now results from fuel combustion will be prevented.\r\n",
