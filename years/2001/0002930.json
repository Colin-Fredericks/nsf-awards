 "awd_abstract_narration": "0002930\r\nIt is now well recognized that shape-memory materials derive their unusual and inherently nonlinear and anisotropic properties from the fine-scale rearrangements of phases, or ``microstructures,'' and  that the  strain produced in the pseudoelasticity effect, as well as that recovered during the shape-memory effect, depends on  crystal orientations. Specially oriented single crystals of some shape memory materials can produce sizeable strains (~ 10%) due to phase transformations.  Practical shape-memory materials are typically polycrystalline in nature, and because of their thermo-mechanical processing history, they are initially textured. It has recently been recognized that the initial crystallographic texture of sheets, wires and rods of shape-memory alloys  is crucial in determining the overall properties  of these materials. The pronounced anisotropies caused by the initial texture need to be properly accounted for in developing a robust computational capability for the improved design of geometrically-complex engineering components made from shape memory materials. We shall  \r\n\r\n   Experimentally study the effects of initial texture on the thermo-mechanical response of the  shape-memory alloy Ti-Ni, in both bulk form, and thin films. This material is finding increased use as a functional/smart-material for a variety of applications. Ti-Ni alloys in thin-film form are promising materials for microactuators, because of the enhanced rate of heat transfer in thin films.\r\n\r\n  Develop constitutive equations and computational procedures for modeling and simulation of the important pseudoelasticity and shape-memory effects observed  in these materials.  \r\n\r\nThe mathematical models and procedures that we plan to develop should be useful\r\nin the design of components for enhanced  thermo-mechanical  performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
