The University of Oklahoma Norman campus will acquire the Equinox 55 (Buncker Optics INC) Fourier-Transform Raman (FT-Raman) system and a far-infrared spectral range expansion package. The instrument will have impact on an existing interdisciplinary research program of faculty in the Physics and Astronomy, and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  The researchers seek a fundamental understanding of polymer electrolyte and intercalation materials for next generation  lithium rechargeable batteries. The new instrument will enhance an existing interdisciplinary research and will benefit graduate and undergraduate students. It will be integrated into an active education and research program which includes junior and senior undergraduates as well as in an existing summer REU program. \r\n\r\nThis is an award from the Major Research Instrumentation program to the University of Oklahoma Norman campus.
