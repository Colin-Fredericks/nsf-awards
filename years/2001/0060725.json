 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of developing an innovative manufacturing process for prototyping and batch manufacturing high-aspect ratio microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and related microparts and microstructures. The goal is to replace an electrodeposition-based micromachining technique, requiring the use of a $10-20 million synchrotron (the so-called LIGA process) with an innovative extrusion-like process performed in an automated desktop machine selling for $250,000 or less. By supplying the MEMS industry with capital equipment for the manufacture of LIGA-type microstructures at a cost two orders of magnitude lower, this project could greatly accelerate the commercialization of MEMS and other microscale devices, and make the U.S. more competitive in this rapidly-growing global industry. If successful, the resulting technology could also significantly reduce time-to market for new products, fabricate much taller structures than are possible with LIGA, and provide better control over the uniformity of material properties.\r\n\r\nCommerical applications cover many highly-miniaturized sensors and actuators in a variety of industries, allowing reduced cost, weight, size, and power consumption.\r\n",
