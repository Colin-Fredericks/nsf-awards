The current state of knowledge seems inadequate \r\nfor explaining what kind of topological information the \r\ninvariants carry, and therefore what kind of applications \r\nin three-dimensional topology they might have. However it\r\nhas revealed (through the frameworks of TQFT and Vassiliev \r\ntheory) a wealth of very interesting algebraic structures, \r\nwhich seem to be specifically related to topology in three \r\ndimensions, and so should be thought of as kind of \r\n``new algebraic topology'' in three dimensions.\r\nRoberts intends to try to bridge the gap between this new \r\ntopology and classical algebraic topology. There are three \r\nmain areas of investigation. The first is K-theory, which \r\ncould help to explain the relationship between quantum knot \r\ninvariants and Vassiliev invariants (for example, why the \r\nJones polynomial is a polynomial). The second is Rozansky-Witten theory, a very interesting new example of a TQFT which \r\nprovides new hints about intepretation of the invariants, \r\nand could have additional applications in complex or \r\nhyperkaehler geometry.  The third is the hyperbolic volume \r\nconjecture of Kashaev, Murakami and Murakami. This conjecture \r\nseems to fit into a general pattern of ideas relating \r\nquantization (and specifically, 6j-symbols) to classical\r\ngeometry; ideas which might provide a conceptual context \r\nfor the conjecture.\r\n\r\nTo a mathematician, a knot is what you get by tangling up a \r\npiece of string and then gluing its ends together. It is clear \r\nthat there are qualitatively different ways of doing this; \r\ntrying to describe and understand these ways forms a branch \r\nof topology, which might be thought of as what remains of \r\ngeometry when quantitative questions are ignored. The main \r\ntools of knot theory are \"topological invariants\", numbers \r\nwhich can be associated to knots and which encode some\r\ninformation about their structure. During the last sixteen \r\nyears, ideas borrowed from the physics of quantum field \r\ntheory have led to the discovery of many new and beautiful \r\ninvariants called \"quantum invariants\", but because of this \r\nunusual origin, their meaning remains very mysterious, and \r\ntheir potential unfulfilled. The goal of the project is to \r\nuse some new ideas to try to explain this mystery and to\r\nbridge some of the gaps between geometry, topology, and \r\nphysics. The work should contribute to the healthy exchange \r\nof ideas between these disciplines, and stimulate new work in each.\r\n \r\n",
