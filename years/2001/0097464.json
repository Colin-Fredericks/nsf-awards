Our goal is to expose students to the techniques, attitudes, and rewards of computer science research and to provide encouragement and direction in the pursuit of such a career through close collaboration with a faculty mentor on a significant project. We will make extensive efforts to include qualified female and minority group students among the participants. Each year a partner undergraduate institution will be selected where there is presently insufficient infrastructure for a strong undergraduate research program in computer science. One faculty member from the partner institution will be invited to participate in this program, joining three or four Hope College faculty members as research mentors. In addition, two students from the partner institution will join three Hope College students and three students from other institutions as student participants. The student participants will reside on the Hope College campus, spending a minimum of 40 hours per week on research activities for a 10 week period. Each participant will work in close collaboration with a faculty mentor and be given exclusive use of a workstation on the Hope College Computer Science network. The development of communication skills will be emphasized by having participants present their results during summer seminars, at their home institution during the following academic year, and at a regional or national conference. In addition, the participants will prepare a research report and an online poster describing their work.\r\n",
