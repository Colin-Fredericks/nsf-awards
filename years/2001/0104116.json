The first item is a joint\r\nproject of the two principal investigators and returns to previous\r\njoint work on the wave trace for a manifold with boundary, in order to\r\nsharpen and simplify the earlier results by defining the wave trace,\r\nnot as a trace on the space of initial data of the wave equation, but\r\nas a trace on the space of boundary data.  The second item is a joint\r\nproject of Guillemin and K. Okikiolu and involves refinements of a\r\nrecent result on ``two-tiered'' asymptotics for Szego estimates. The\r\nthird item is a joint project of Guillemin with C. Zara, and concerns\r\nthe interplay between graph theory and topology on GKM manifolds. The\r\nfourth item is a joint project of Melrose and P. Loya extending the\r\nAtiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem to manifolds with corners. The\r\nfifth item involves on-going work of Melrose and R. Mazzeo and the\r\nbeginning of a project with D. Grieser to analyze the Laplacian on\r\nsingular algebraic varieties by blow-up and pseudodifferential\r\nmethods. The sixth project involves Melrose, A. Hassell and A. Vasy in\r\nthe description of scattering by potentials which are smooth up to\r\ninfinity. The final item is a joint project of Melrose and J. Wunsch\r\nin which the propagation of singularities for waves on manifolds with\r\nconic singularities is investigated.\r\n\r\nA common theme of the items above is the wave equation and related\r\ntechniques. For instance, one of the important applications of the joint\r\nproject of the two principal investigators will be to the understanding of\r\nthe reflection of waves in a domain in the plane. For a convex planar\r\ndomain the results of this project should shed light on the celebrated\r\nproblem: \"Can one hear the shape of a drum\", that is, do the frequencies of\r\nvibration of a planar domain, corresponding to the head of a drum,\r\ndetermine its shape? Earlier work of the investigators showed that these\r\nfrequencies of vibration determine the so-called \"length spectrum\" of the\r\ndomain, namely the lengths of inscribed polygons of minimal\r\ncircumference. One result of the investigation above should be a\r\ndetermination of the SHAPES of these polygons as well.\r\n\r\n",
