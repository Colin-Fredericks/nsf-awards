 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The project is adapting problem-based learning and infusing modern technology and modern teaching methods into the required first two years of undergraduate laboratories for physics majors. These courses lay the foundation of experimental physics methods and techniques for majors. A thorough examination of the construction of the current courses reveals that significant improvements can be made by implementation of social psychological principles, modern educational methods and modern experimental techniques. In the laboratories, instead of being told what to measure, the students are given modern equipment and taught experimental techniques to enable them to construct their own measurements. Students do projects where the results are used later in the course or in other courses, connecting the activities of the laboratory to real situations. Preliminary efforts in this direction have produced strongly positive results. To evaluate this ambitious and non-traditional approach, there is a sophisticated assessment strategy to be administered by outside assessors. The success of this program will not only benefit one institution, but others dedicated to undergraduate laboratory education.\r\n",
