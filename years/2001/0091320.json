 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Philip Reid of University of Washington is funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on the effects of solvent on chemical reactions relevant to the environment.   Halooxide photochemistry is important in the atmosphere; while the gas phase photoreactivity has been well studied in the laboratory, not much is known about photoreactivity of these compounds in the condensed phase (e.g. rain droplets).  The PI proposes to continue detailed studies on OClO photochemistry in both gas and condensed phases using resonance Raman spectroscopy (intensity and time-resolved) as well as femtosecond pump-probe measurements.  The PI then proposes to study ClOCl, nitrosyl halides and alkyl nitrates in a similar manner to establish general trends in these systems.  \r\n\r\n A successful outcome of this proposal would be a model for the prediction of solvent effects on the photoreactivity of small molecules. The proposed work is especially timely because of recognition by atmospheric chemists that heterogeneous reactions can contribute significantly to overall processes, and therefore must be included in models of the atmosphere. \r\n",
