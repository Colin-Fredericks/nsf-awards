This four day meeting is recognized internationally as top solid state NMR meeting  in the US.  This meeting will focus on the application of NMR to key problems in materials science including nanoparticles and interfaces.  Currently 20% of the speakers are women and 13% are minority.  Historically, the conference is well attended by students.  This support is targeted at partially funding students and postdocs to enable them to attend the meeting.  The meeting will occur from July 29-August 3, 2001.",
