 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT (DMS-0099767)\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator proposes to study the sharp regularity\r\nproperties of operators associated to domains of finite type in dimensions\r\ngreater than two, and to apply the results to the study of the boundary\r\nbehavior of holomorphic functions in these domains. He also proposes to\r\nstudy corresponding properties on certain nilpotent Lie groups. The\r\noperators under consideration include the Szego and Bergman projections, and\r\nthe relative fundamental solutions to the Kohn-Laplacian. In particular, the\r\nprincipal investigator hopes to find an appropriate metric that controls the\r\nsize of the distribution kernel for the Szego projection on diagonalizable\r\npseudo-convex domains of finite type, and on convex domains. He hopes to\r\nstudy the boundary behavior of holomorphic functions in certain\r\nnon-diagonalizable domains, and in this context, he proposes to study\r\nvariants of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. Appropriate nilpotent Lie\r\ngroups can model many of these problems, and the principal investigator\r\nproposes to study the corresponding convolution operators on the groups. The\r\ndistribution kernels of these operators have singularities that are more\r\ncomplicated than the classical Calderon-Zygmund singular integral operators,\r\nand the problem thus leads to interesting questions in harmonic analysis.\r\n\r\nInteresting questions and results in mathematics often arise at the\r\ninterface of two or more areas of research, since in such situations, deep\r\nresults in one field can shed light on previously intractable problems in\r\nanother. The research outlined in this proposal is directed towards\r\nquestions at the interface of modern harmonic analysis, several complex\r\nvariables, and linear partial differential equations. For more than forty\r\nyears these areas have enjoyed a very profitable symbiotic relationship. For\r\nexample, attempts to solve the Levy problem in complex analysis led to the\r\ndevelopment of deep results about hypo-elliptic partial differential\r\nequations, and these problems, in turn, led to developments in harmonic\r\nanalysis on nilpotent Lie groups such as the Heisenberg group. Many of these\r\nrelated results dealt with integral operators that are modeled on the\r\nclassical singular integrals such as the Hilbert transform and the Riesz\r\ntransforms whose study goes back to the middle of the twentieth century. In\r\nrecent years, it has become clear that new problems in complex analysis\r\nrequire the understanding of new kinds of operators in which the\r\nsingularities of the kernel are considerably more complicated than the\r\nclassical singular integrals. The research described in this proposal is\r\ndirected toward understanding these more complicated situations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
