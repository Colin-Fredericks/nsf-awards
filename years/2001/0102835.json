 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morris Brown College requests as Planning Grant of $50,000 form the National Science\r\nFoundation to support TranSMET -Phase I, a period of academic self-assessment,\r\nunderstanding, and planning around those issues of infrastructure, faculty and student\r\npreparedness that pose barriers to desired student outcomes in the science, math, engineering,\r\nand technology disciplines. The 10 month planning phase is designed to culminate in 1) a\r\ncomprehensive five-year proposal that will catalyze the pedagogical reformation of Morris\r\nBrown College by 2) conducting a thorough analysis of the College's SMET infrastructure and\r\nprograms and to develop a realistic and workable plan for implementing changes; and 3 )\r\ndeveloping a process of consistent assessment and evaluation of SMET programs. With the\r\nformation of TranSMET Morris Brown College plans to design a series of three retreats\r\n(meetings and workshops). Phase I of the project will culminate in a complete analysis of its\r\ncurrent SMET infrastructure, the formation of a permanent assessment and evaluation process\r\nfor all present and future SMET programs, and fmally the development of a comprehensive\r\nmulti-year proposal to increase minority participation in the SMET \"knowledge workforce.\"\r\n",
