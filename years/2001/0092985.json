 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two main objectives: 1) to understand the current communication and coordination activities in the Hospital Operating Room (OR), focusing on the surgical team as the center of activity, and 2) to develop and test a theory of situated learning of decision skills.  The first objective will be met through observations of surgeries and interviewing key personnel.  We will collect video data, audio data, and code the communication activities between personnel in the room using verbal protocol analysis. We will also conduct a series of structured interviews with surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists and OR staff to specifically ask these personnel about communication and coordination practices. The second objective will be met by developing a part-task simulation of the surgical environment using computer-based training, and measuring the ability to teach key situation assessment skills for various surgical cases with this simulation. This research will impact our understanding of surgical decision making, and provide a tangible means to train surgical decision making in a safe, simulated environment.  The impact of this research will be to reduce medical error, improve training practices, and improve team communication and coordination in the OR.",
