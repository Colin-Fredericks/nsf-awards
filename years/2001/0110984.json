 "awd_abstract_narration": "0110984\r\nMutational and biochemical studies will be combined to define the structural basis for\r\ncatalytic activity and feedback regulation in the 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate\r\nsynthase (DAHPS) isozyme family in Escherichia coli. This work will be complemented by\r\nstructural studies of the enzyme by x-ray crystallography, carried out in the laboratory of\r\ndepartmental colleague and co-PI, Robert Kretsinger. DAHPS catalyzes the first step of aromatic\r\nbiosynthesis, the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P).\r\nThe three DAHPS isozymes in E. coli have similar catalytic properties, but differ in that each is\r\nspecifically feedback regulated by one of the three aromatic amino acid end products. The crystal\r\nstructure of DAHPS(Phe) complexed with PEP and metal cofactor has established that the enzyme\r\nhas an embellished (beta /alpha)8 barrel fold. In order to define the role of the required metal in catalysis, a strategy will be implemented to engineer metal-independent derivatives of DAHPS(Phe) by site-directed changes, loop transplantation and DNA shuffling. The strategy was derived from the superpositional analysis of the structures of DAHPS(Phe) and its metal-independent homologue, KDOP synthase. A model for the DAHPS reaction mechanism will be tested that involves the formation of a covalent Schiff's base intermediate between PEP and an active site lysine. An intramolecular signal transduction pathway responsible for the allosteric transition from R state to T state, based on changes in the three dimensional structure of the enzyme complexed with Phe, will be dissected by combined mutational, kinetic and crystallographic analysis. The organization of the regulatory site of the enzyme will also be confirmed by assessing the effects of mutations targeted to critical residues in the structural model. Lastly, rational design will be used to restructure the regulatory site such that inhibitor specificity is switched from phenylalanine to tryptophan or tyrosine.\t\r\n",
