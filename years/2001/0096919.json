A series of inorganic nitrates will be studied using variable temperature solid-state NMR spectroscopy and variable temperature diffraction measurements. The atomic positions and electrostatic interactions will be characterized. These measurements will then be correlated with the measurement of the motion of the nitrate ion, from NMR spectroscopy, and will be used to develop an atomic-level model that is consistent with the temperature dependent behavior. With this model, a greater understanding of the relationship between dynamics and electrostatic interactions in inorganic nitrates will be obtained. This work will also lead to a better understanding of the formation of ionic materials that contain polyatomic ions.\r\n\r\nThis project initiates a collaboration between investigators from the United States, South Korea, and Australia that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The United States group will provide the solid state NMR measurements, the South Korean group will provide the neutron diffraction measurements, and the Australian group will provide the single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. This collaboration has the potential to be long term and to provide fundamental understanding of many important solid state inorganic materials. \r\n",
