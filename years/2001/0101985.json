 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Teachers Enhancement Network for Elementary Teachers (NTEN) will electronically provide professional development to elementary teachers on science concepts based upon selected kit-based curricula from FOSS, STC, BSCS Science and Delta Education II.  The project will assist elementary teachers in deepening their science content knowledge and improve their ability to incorporate technology into their classes.\r\n\r\nThe development team will consist of MSU and other faculty with NTEN experience (from the Keystone project), K-6 master teachers and instructional technologists.  Each module will be of 4-6 weeks' duration. Initially, four modules will be pilot tested with 25 teachers.  A second pilot for 50 teachers will occur in the second year of the project.  NTEN will specifically target teachers of Native American and other minority students.  The project will provide an Instructional Technology and Technical Support team to module instructors and participants.  This team will provide training in using technology to the instructors and develop an online professional development package for participants.  Furthermore, the Support team will provide an electronic listserve and chat room to establish a distance learning community for NTEN participants.  As further support, teachers will be encouraged to participate in school teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
