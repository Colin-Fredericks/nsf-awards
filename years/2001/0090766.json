 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is proposed to investigate the extent and roles of polypeptide \r\nsignaling in plants.  Animals and yeast utilize polypeptide signals for \r\nregulating a host of physiological processes, including stress, \r\nreproduction, development and defense, and many others. Until 1991, when \r\nthis laboratory discovered the first polypeptide signal in plants, the \r\naccepted dogma was that plants did not utilize polypeptide signals, but used \r\nsmall chemical hormones such as auxin, cytokinins, gibberillins, ethylene \r\nand abscisic acid as regulators of physiological processes.  Since the first \r\nisolation of a polypeptide signal in 1991, four new polypeptide signals have \r\nbeen identified in other laboratories, and five more have been identified \r\nand purified in our laboratory.  The signaling polypeptides in plants \r\nreported to date are involved in defense, development, and reproduction.  \r\nThus, we expect many more to be identified in the near future.  We have \r\ndeveloped a novel, rapid assay to identify polypeptide signals in plants \r\nusing suspension-cultured cells, which respond to receptor-mediated \r\npolypeptide signals by causing the pH of the cell culture medium to \r\nincrease. Using the assay to monitor the signaling polypeptides during \r\npurification, we have identified five receptor-mediated polypeptide signals \r\nfrom tobacco, tomato and alfalfa and are utilizing the assay to investigate \r\nthe presence of polypeptides throughout the plant kingdom. We have \r\nextensively studied the first discovered polypeptide defense signal that is \r\nreleased upon herbivore and pathogen attacks.  It is an 18 amino acid \r\npolypeptide isolated from tomato, that is derived from a 200 amino acid \r\nprecursor.  We have published extensively on its signaling pathway in plants \r\nand have identified and isolated its receptor on tomato cell membranes.  We \r\nare currently isolating the receptor gene for studies of the structure and \r\nfunction of the receptor in tomato cells.  We are also seeking the genes for \r\nthe new polypeptides we have isolated to determine their precursors, the \r\nmode of release and action, and their localization in plants.  We will \r\ncontinue to identify and isolate the receptors of these polypeptides and \r\nbegin to learn the broad fundamental principles that underlie polypeptide \r\nsignaling in plants.  Our studies of signaling polypeptides and their \r\nreceptors in plants will provide an entirely new understanding of plant \r\nsignaling for defense and development, with important relevance to ecology \r\nand agriculture.\r\n\r\n",
