 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nWe are creating an Integrated Histology Laboratory (IHL) that provides hands-on histology experiences for undergraduates majoring in biology, chemistry, environmental science, and science education, as well as those involved in faculty-directed, student research. The IHL includes a JB-microtome and related equipment, a vacuum oven, and fume absorbers. The IHL allows the Biology and Chemistry Departments to further increase student training in the process of science, gives students experiences with modern histological technology, and promote scientific collaboration. Exercises in our organismal courses and some of our senior-level capstone courses are being re-designed to take advantage of the pedagogic opportunities created by the IHL to develop laboratory skills and improve critical thinking. In the Biology Introductory Sequence, students currently use prepared histological slides to understand the relationship of structure and function in a diversity of organisms. Based on that foundation, students in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and Teacher Education are being introduced to the techniques of modern histological analysis and their utility in exploring topics as diverse as mechanisms regulating organismal development to ecotoxicology. At the Senior level, students are expected to conduct independent research projects as part of courses and faculty-mentored research. The projects uses as a foundation an NSF-funded project carried out by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) group.\r\n\r\n",
