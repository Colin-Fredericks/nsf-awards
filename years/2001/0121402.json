 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Hungary workshop will bring together expert scientists and engineers as well as postdoctoral associates and students to examine the environmental issues associated with metal contamination of the Hungarian Tisza River throughout its floodplain and wetlands.  The organizers are Prof. Domy Adriano of the University of Georgia and Prof. Nemeth Tamas, of the Hungarian Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry.  Their objective is to determine the key scientific issues and to help define research priorities that are longer-term and cross-disciplinary.  To accomplish this, workshop discussions will feature pollutant cycling and the effects on local aquatic and terrestrial environments.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the U.S. and Hungarian organizers intend to use this forum to: 1) formulate hypotheses regarding the rates and mechanisms of natural attenuation, from the landscape to molecular levels; 2) determine bio-availability and the natural attenuation of metals in the Tisza's chronically contaminated landscape; 3) relate the kinetics of metal attenuation to biological responses and chemical indices; and 4) develop novel monitoring protocols and enhanced predictive models for managing ecological habitats, in the context of land use and water management policies.  Overall the participants are motivated by the goal of defining suitable environmental management and mitigation strategies.  If successful, this workshop should lead to the delineation of collaborative and linked US-Hungarian subprojects on ecological and engineering topics that will yield results applicable to the metal pollution problems found in big rivers around the world. \r\n\r\nThis workshop in environmental engineering fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
