 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMost micro-sized relays (switches) currently on the market or reported in the literature\r\nare solid-state devices made using semiconductor technology, with silicon the predominant\r\nmaterial. Such devices are not best suited for applications that require large power\r\ncapability because they typically have low current capacity, low off-resistance, high\r\non-resistance, high power consumption, and low dielectric strength. In recent years, the\r\nfast-evolving technology of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has opened up new\r\nopportunities for microfabricating microelectromechanical switches. However, most of the\r\nMEMS relays are based on silicon fabrication and can not be used for power applications.\r\n\r\nWe propose to design, analyze (model and simulate), microfabricate, and test a new type\r\nof micro-relays using electromagnetic actuation. These relays should have the following\r\ncharacteristics: fast switching speed, high power capacity, high off-resistance\r\n(completely disconnected), lower on-resistance, and low power consumption and heat\r\ngeneration. Some preliminary study has been conducted and promising results have been\r\nobtained on the proposed research work.\r\n\r\nThe proposed micro-relays will be fabricated with UV-LIGA (based on UV lithography)\r\nmicrofabrication technologies. UV-LIGA is based on thick resist (SU-8) and optical\r\nlithography, provides slightly lower quality, much shorter time span for development and\r\nfabrication, and therefore much lower cost. The LIGA processes provide great potential for\r\nbuilding microstructures from a broad selection of materials. Any metals or alloys that\r\ncan be electroplated could be used as a potential candidate material for three-dimensional\r\nMEMS structural components. The combination of a broad material selection and the\r\ncapability of making high aspect ratio microstructures make the technology best suited for\r\nfabricating microelectromechanical relays that can be used in, but not limited to, the\r\napplications of high power capacity. For example, good spring materials like\r\nberyllium-copper, and good electrically conducting materials including copper and gold can\r\nall be electroplated. With improved switching time, the relays may also be used for series\r\nsampling with low feedthroughs. Compared with the commonly used electrostatic actuation,\r\nthe proposed electromagnetic actuation has several advantages: stronger actuation force\r\nand potentially higher power capacity, lower possibility of electrostatic sparks\r\n",
