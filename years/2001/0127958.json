Jones \r\nInstitution:\tUniversity of Nebraska - Lincoln\r\nNSF/USDOT: Towards a Systems Integration Urban Network Performance Measure - Scalability and Data Issues of the Two-Fluid Model\r\n\r\nTo advance the integration of information technologies in surface transportation systems, this research will experiment with the utilization of real-time video-based traffic flow data collected from camera arrays along a street corridor for traffic control and city transportation system modeling. The research is expected to enable the transportation control system to interact with the traffic environment, to acquire and understand the traffic situations based on sensory inputs, and to make intelligent decisions about the circumstances where the traffic control tasks are to be performed.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will focus on the following objectives. (1) Video handoff and target vehicle tracking, (2) Traffic flow information extraction, and (3) Vehicle driving pattern modeling and identification (e.g., identifying individual vehicles that demonstrate dangerous behavior or potentially at risk). To achieve these objectives, the research activities of this project will be divided into three task phases: (1) the image acquisition and pre-processing phase, (2) vehicle tracking and hand-off processing phase, and (3) the traffic video understanding (vehicle driving pattern recognition) phase. \r\n",
