 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jonathan Wilker, Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program, Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, through a Career Award for his work on marine adhesives. Specifically, the work will investigate the protein adhesive precursor that contains high levels of 3,4-dihydroxyhenylalanine (DOPA), a known metal chelator produced by barnacles, mussels and reef-building worms. On the educational front, a new inorganic laboratory course will be designed to increase student enthusiasm and student learning outcomes; groups of students will conduct a laboratory and subsequently will teach the material that emphasizes synthesis and spectroscopic techniques to their classmates.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the role of metals in marine adhesives will aid in the design and development of new medical adhesive materials, antifoulants (of potential interest to the Navy), underwater adhesives, and rustproof coatings. Students involved in the self-teaching/teaching laboratory course will appreciate the art and science of teaching and perhaps generate an interest in pedagogy to potential science educators.",
