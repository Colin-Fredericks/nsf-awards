 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of an ongoing effort by a large number of \r\nresearchers to develop a quantum gravity theory, which fully \r\nincorporates quantum principles into general relativity and \r\ngravitation.  Many approaches have been proposed over the years; \r\ncurrently, the two that are widely regarded as the most promising \r\nones are superstring theory, which emphasizes the relation of other \r\nforces with gravitation, and quantum geometry, which emphasizes the \r\nneed to understand the fundamental structure of space and time. \r\nThese two approaches may be related to each other and lead to \r\ncomplementary views of the same theory, but at present they are being \r\nindependently pursued.  This project will contribute to the quantum \r\ngeometry approach, which uses the Ashtekar variables for general \r\nrelativity and \"weaves\" or networks of points to replace smooth \r\nspace.  The goal is to use statistical techniques and computer \r\nsimulations to study in detail (i) which combinations of such \r\nnetworks are the ones we ordinarily observe as smooth space, and (ii) \r\nhow large the uncertainties or fluctuations of space are as a result. \r\nWhile calculations by other researchers have given approximate, \r\npreliminary results on the first part, the techniques that will be \r\nused in this project are unique in enabling us to address the second \r\none.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of our basic understanding of nature, the \r\nquantum gravity program is often listed as one of the top outstanding \r\nproblems today.  Both quantum theory and general relativity are \r\nsupposedly applicable to all physical phenomena, and this can only be \r\ntrue if they are compatible with each other.  We have reason to \r\nbelieve that, once we understand their connection well, quantum \r\ngravity will have applications in many different areas, similarly to \r\nwhat happened with quantum theory almost 100 years ago.  The \r\nsuggestion has been made, for example, that quantum gravity sets the \r\nultimate limits for information storage and computation capabilities. \r\nFor the time being, however, we need to test the theory with simpler \r\npredictions that can be verified, such as the effect of these \r\nfluctuating \"weaves\" on particles and radiation that reach us from \r\ndistant galaxies across billions of light years.  Successfully \r\npredicting effects such as this one will lead to progress in quantum \r\ngravity, and will also give us a new tool for the analysis of \r\ninformation from the most distant parts of the universe.  This \r\nproject at the University of Mississippi will contribute by helping \r\ndevelop a reliable working model for the fluctuating weaves that make \r\nup space, as well as using the excellent computational facilities of \r\nthe University and helping train students in the use of computational \r\ntechniques.",
