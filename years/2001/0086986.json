 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n   The  New Mexico Analysis Seminar is\r\n   an  annual three-day meeting, now in its fourth year.\r\n   Its principal goal is to provide an opportunity for scientific exchange\r\n   among mathematics students and faculty in the Southwest\r\n   region and beyond. To encourage participation, analysis is defined broadly. \r\n   The centerpiece of the seminar is a series of one hour lectures\r\n   given by a first rate mathematician who is also a first rate lecturer, \r\n   capable of communicating very well with students and faculty. Time is \r\n   allocated for shorter talks and informal discussion as well. \r\n   The main speaker for\r\n   the Fourth New Mexico Analysis Seminar  will be Steve Hofmann, who\r\n   recently proved Kato's 40 year old conjecture known as\r\n   the Square Root Problem.\r\n\r\n   The New Mexico Analysis\r\n   Seminar is playing an important role in facilitating student exposure to\r\n   pioneering research and in providing role models for future and present\r\n   practitioners and communicators of mathematics in the classroom and in\r\n   industry. The need for this is particularly urgent in a region of relative  \r\n   geographical isolation and limited financial resources. The conference\r\n   site alternates between New Mexico State University and The University\r\n   of New Mexico, which have the only Ph.D. granting mathematics programs\r\n   in New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
