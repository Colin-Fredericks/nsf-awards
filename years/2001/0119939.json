 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nEnhancing Diversity through the Penn State Weather Camp\r\n\r\nMinorities are poorly represented in the geosciences in general and in the atmospheric sciences in particular.  Research experiences such as summer science camps are an effective means of introducing minority students to science.  The Penn State Weather camp provides an excellent opportunity to increase exposure to the atmospheric sciences of students from traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide travel and registration costs for students from traditionally underrepresented groups to attend the Penn State Weather Camp during the 2002-2004 period.  Two one-week sessions are expected during this time period.  This camp provides a hands-on opportunity for students entering grades 8 through 10 to learn about fundamental aspects of meteorology.  Highlights of this camp include forecast contests, balloon launches, weather analysis, role playing as policy makers for climate change and creating a short TV broadcast.  On-camera meteorologists from the Weather Channel Inc. and WeatherWorld will train students.  Students from traditionally underrepresented groups will be surveyed at the camp and tracked afterward to determine if the camp has directly led to these students entering the geosciences or sciences.\r\n",
