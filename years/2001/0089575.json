Musfeldt and her group at the State University of New York in Binghamton and Alexandre Revcolevschi and his group at the Universite Paris XI.  Their collaboration is aimed at investigations of growth and spectroscopic response of lightly doped CuGeO3 (copper-germanium-oxygen) crystals as a function of temperature and high magnetic field.  The US group brings to this collaboration expertise in far-infrared spectroscopy.  This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in crystal growth.  He will be responsible for growth of lightly substituted single crystals using the floating zone technique.  Experiments at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida will be carried out jointly.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators and graduate students.  The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of novel magnetic materials (CuGeO3) which have similarities to the superconducting copper oxides and other doped transition metal oxides.  The work will be of general interest to the solid state materials community.\r\n",
