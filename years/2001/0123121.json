 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project was developed as a result of a technology and science planning process that\r\nFond du Lac Tribal and Community College (FDLTCC) initiated in 2000 and is still\r\ncontinuing. This planning effort involved a large number of college and community\r\nstakeholder groups and provided both the underlying concepts for this proposal as well as the\r\noutline for specific curriculum programs and hardware/software infrastructure needs.\r\nThe project proposed has several interrelated elements. High performance computing assets,\r\nincluding Internet2 hookup, cluster installation, and visualization panels, are put into place to\r\nsupport both curriculum and research agendas. The research agenda is centered in ongoing\r\nresearch efforts at the college in environmental science, soil mapping, computational science,\r\nand information technology (IT). The research effort is designed to provide students with\r\nexperience in research, experience with the collaborative research environment, and\r\nexperimential activities related to what they are studying. The grant also proposes to build a\r\npartnership with the University of Minnesota's Laboratory for Computational Science and\r\nEngineering, both to provide help with constructing the high performance infrastructure, as\r\nwell as a research agenda that will involve students in computational science, physics, and\r\nother SMET-related curriculum areas.  Other collaborative efforts will be implemented with\r\ncurrent partners involved in FDLTCC research projects.\r\n\r\nAt the proposed project's heart are curriculum development and implementation activities\r\ndesigned to not only build on the enhanced research projects, but to also initiate new SMET\r\ndegrees.  Research with FDLTCC's target student population has indicated that these degrees\r\nand a one-year certificate program will increase the number of Native American students\r\nmajoring in SMET-related programs.  These degrees are all designed to launch a new\r\ncurriculum track design, which provides a core of Information Technology courses that\r\nstudents can use to build either baccalaureate or associate degrees in a number of different\r\ndisciplines.\r\n\r\nThe degrees and certificate initiated through the project will include: A GIS/GPS certificate\r\nwhich can be earned in conjunction with the environmental science, computer science, and\r\nlaw enforcement associate degrees; a baccalaureate in computer science with the IT core; an\r\nassociate degree in E-Crime and Computer Security that can be earned with the IT core, the\r\nGIS/GPS certificate, and the college's current Minnesota Transfer or Law Enforcement\r\nassociate degrees in order to complete the requirements for a baccalaureate.  The new IT core\r\nwill also be available to baccalaureate students in Elementary Education at FDLTCC.  By the\r\nend of the grant, enrollment in these curriculum areas will support continuation of each\r\nprogram based on the timetable described in the grant.\r\n\r\nThe last two elements of the grant include the plan to develop an associate degree online for\r\nstudents located at FDLTCC's Augsburg Offsite program that serves the Native American\r\ncommunity in St. Paul/Minneapolis. This effort will also use the high performance\r\ncomputing resources built through the project.  SMET related faculty and staff development\r\nactivities are also included designed to increase IT sophistication at FDLTCC as well as to\r\nincrease the number of MS and Ph.D.-qualified faculty in SMET-related areas.",
