 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the National Facilities and Instrumentation Program to the University of Wisconsin-Madison supports the continued operation of the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. SRC is one of the most productive, innovative, cost-effective, and user-friendly facilities in the U.S. SRC will continue to operate as a national users facility for uniquely difficult and time-consuming experiments that lead to new depths of understanding of key materials problems at the micro and nano levels. These activities match well with the characteristic spectrum of the Aladdin ring, which is concentrated at low photon energies. SRC provides output of high stability and spectral purity for experiments involving intricate sample preparation and characterization. Work on superconductors, low-dimensional solids, magnetic nanostructures, and the microanalysis of cells, together with cutting edge nanolithography and research in microcircuit device fabrication will continue to be supported.\r\n\r\nThe funds also support low-cost plan to improve the beam quality, which will result in beam size reduction by up to a factor of 3-4. These will provide world-class flux and resolution in the 5-50 eV range that is critical for exploring valence electrons, but difficult to reach for higher energy rings.  The impact of these efforts will be felt well beyond the five years award period.  \r\n\r\nSRC will continue to host the Center for NanoTechnology (CNTech), a major federally- and industry-funded facility at the SRC. As a DARPA Test Bed for Lithography, and a unique training facility in the U.S, CNTech is indispensable to the nation and the semiconductor industry in providing fundamental and applied research for microcircuit device fabrication. In addition, the Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility (CSRF) depends on SRC as its host; this collaboration will continue until the Canadian facility (CLS) is completed.  \r\n\r\nSRC continues to make important contribution to Graduate training with its reinvigorated program in accelerator physics. This educational effort is enhanced through a creative new NSF-funded initiative involving high school teachers and students.\r\n",
