 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a three year Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) program, entitled \"Curriculum in Genomic Engineering,\" at Columbia University under the direction of Dr. Edward F. Leonard.  The overall objective of this project is to develop and operate a course track in Genomic Engineering that is related to research activities in genomic engineering undertaken by the project faculty and their colleagues at Columbia University.  The proposed course track is designed to provide a broad understanding of the central ideas and goals of genomic science in an efficient manner.  The course track will encrouage the comprehensive focusing of current engineering knowledge on core problems in genomic science and engineering.  Broad exposure of engineering and computer science students to genomic science and engineering will encourage sustained commitment to the field and the development of well-founded and broad-reaching, rather than anecdotal or tactical, solutions to problems in genomics.",
