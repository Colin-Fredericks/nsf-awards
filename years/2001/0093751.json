This award provides funds for partial support of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and assistant professors to attend the Symposium. A major purpose of the meeting is for leading international scientists to discuss advances in the areas of biomaterials, drug delivery, and biocompatibility.  The choice of the symposium topic derives from recent demands placed upon biomaterials performance that have paralleled the growth in applications and driven the development of sophisticated formulations with improved biocompatibility as well as superior mechanical and interfacial properties.  \r\n\r\nThe symposium addresses both the fundamental science of biomaterials and the advances in their applications to drug delivery.  To bring new ideas to these topics, the meeting includes a strong multidisciplinary program through joint sessions with three other symposia, \"Orthopedic/Dental Biomaterials\", \"Cardiovascular Biomaterials\", and \"Neurologic Biomaterials\".  Biomaterials and biological interfaces are expected to play a key role in promising areas of biotechnology such as cardiovascular/neurological applications.   \r\n\r\nThe Symposium on \"Biomaterials for Drug Delivery\" covers the development of novel biomaterials, improved evaluation, and utilization of existing biomaterials for controlled and targeted delivery of  bioactive agents.  The symposium will address current challenges in biomaterials synthesis, characterization, and biocompatibility issues with respect to drug delivery devices. Ways to design intelligent controlled release systems and studies combining characterization of physical/chemical properties of biomaterials and their impact on drug delivery performance will be emphasized.\r\n \r\n",
