The objective is to provide a hands on research experience for under-represented minority students from institutions without graduate programs.\r\n\r\nThe aspects of the program are as follows.  Ten students will be recruited each year.  The target population will be under-represented minority groups.  Students will be recruited from institutions without graduate programs.  The REU program will be divided into three phases.  The first phase, an introduction to research methodology and content background, and the second phase, the actual research project, will occur during an eight week summer program at Oklahoma State University.  The third phase involving a paper and presentation will occur at the student's home university.\r\n\r\nInstitution support from Oklahoma State University for the program is strong.   The previously funded REU programs conducted by the computer science department have been a great success.  This proposed program w ill continue with and build upon the efforts of the department's past REU site programs. \r\n\r\nThe lasting impact of the program will be in its effect on the participating students. We want to use the concrete feedback available in the visual information processing field to improve the students awareness of their knowledge and capabilities, to increase their expectations of what they can do, and to motivate them to actively contribute to the computer science discipline throughout their career.  Throughout the program, we will provide information and encouragement to the students on continuing with a graduate education.\r\n",
