In particular she\r\nplans to investigate various approaches to Milnor's conjecture that\r\nthe fundamental group of an open manifold with nonnegative Ricci\r\ncurvature is finitely generated.  She also plans to study the higher\r\ndimensional homology of these spaces.  Techniques which will be\r\nemployed involve Gromov-Hausdorff limits, the almost rigidity theory\r\nof Cheeger-Colding, and Busemann functions.  In particular, the\r\nproperness of Busemann functions on these manifolds will be\r\ninvestigated.  It should be noted that there are direct applications\r\nof this project to the theory of topological censorship in general\r\nrelativity.  The condition of nonnegative Ricci curvature on\r\nspace-time is called the null energy condition and it arises in the\r\nEinstein equation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, Dr. Sormani proposes to study the existence and\r\nprevalence of holes in a space which has no boundary, extends to\r\ninfinity and has a condition imposed upon the way in which it can\r\nbend.  The universe we live in is such a space.  Simpler examples are\r\ncylinders (i.e. tubes) and paraboloids (i.e. bowls).  The cylinder has\r\na hole but the paraboloid does not.  The spaces studied in this\r\nproject are of arbitrary dimension and so the holes come in various\r\ndimensions as well.  The universe is one such higher dimensional space\r\nand its holes, which may or may not exist, are often called wormholes.\r\nBy furthering our understanding of this geometric problem, it is hoped\r\nthat we will further our understanding of the universe.\r\n",
