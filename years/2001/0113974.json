 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a framework for studying protein folding that is  based on techniques recently developed in the robotics motion planning  community. In particular, this work uses Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) motion  planning techniques which have proven to be very successful for problems  involving high-dimensional configuration spaces. The key advance that PRMs  offer protein science is the ability to efficiently explore large  conformational transitions of realistic models of proteins. The work  involves research in both protein science and information technology.  \r\n\r\nThe project has two main research goals related to protein science. First,  PRMs are expected to provide a computational method to predict the folding  kinetics of proteins, when the native structure is already known. This  makes PRMs ideal for investigating classical problems in protein folding  kinetics such as kinetic intermediates, kinetic traps, parallel vs. series  folding routes, and general folding mechanism questions related to  potential energy landscapes and zippers processes. Second, PRM, used in  conjunction with a new ENPOP parameter optimization strategy, has the  potential to improve energy models both high-resolution and low-resolution  models for predicting biomolecule conformations.  \r\n\r\nThe project has two main research goals related to information technology.  Both are motivated by the massive computational requirements of the  simulations needed to investigate the protein folding questions. First, new  strategies and optimization techniques for PRMs will be needed to support  the efficient extraction of high quality paths from the roadmaps for  problems with hundreds of dof.  Second, since PRMs are known to be amenable  to parallel implementation, they will utilize high-performance computing.  This will include the development and application of an adaptive parallel  version of the C++ STL (Standard Templates library) called STAPL. With  STAPL, the simulations can be optimized and run on various parallel and  distributed systems and yield a performance approaching that of code  manually optimized for each platform\r\n",
