 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop an explicit formal system for the learning of phonologies, capable of inferring\r\nlexical representations, deducing constituency and other nonovert structure from overt observables, and\r\nconstructing the mapping between lexical forms and the grammar's output.\r\n\r\nThe primary formal problem to be attacked is the mutual entanglement of constituent structure,\r\nphonological mappings and phonological lexical representations. A language learner has direct access to\r\nnone of these; they must be inferred from positive overt data. However, the three are tightly interrelated.\r\nThe correct phonological mapping depends upon the structural analysis assigned to overt forms by the\r\ntarget grammar as well as on the lexical representations taken to underlie the overt forms. Assigning the\r\ncorrect structural analysis to an ambiguous overt form requires some grasp of what the correct phonological\r\nmapping is like, as does the induction of underlying forms. In the face of these entanglements, a successful\r\nsolution to the full learning problem must work on all three simultaneously, using progress on one to\r\nachieve further progress on the others, ultimately arriving at the correct conclusion for each.\r\n\r\nThe research will build on existing work solving important subproblems within phonological learning\r\nunder Optimality Theory (OT). In prior work, learning algorithms have been developed for OT systems in\r\nwhich there are mutual entanglements between constituent structural analysis and phonological mapping,\r\nbut in which lexical representations need not be learned. The new research proposed here will extend and\r\ngeneralize these approaches so that they may apply to systems which require non-trivial learning of lexical\r\nrepresentations. This requires the addition of significant further structure to the learning and processing\r\nalgorithms: a lexicon must be constructed and maintained, the parsing algorithms which assign analyses to\r\novert data must be expanded to make use of the lexical representations, and the learner must have\r\nprocedures for hypothesizing and adjusting lexical representations. The basic algorithms for learning\r\nmappings will also be modified to ensure learning of phonotactic distributions as a preliminary to the\r\nanalysis of lexical relations.\r\n\r\nThe investigations will begin with metrical stress grammars, including those with rich morphophonemic\r\nrelations dependent on underlying contrasts in stress and quantity. An important part of the project will be\r\nthe construction, as targets for learning, of constraint systems that plausibly capture phenomena requiring\r\nthe nontrivial interaction between lexical representations and phonological mappings. Extensive survey\r\nand analysis of the targeted linguistic generalizations will be required to establish the empirical basis of the\r\nlearner's goals.\r\n\r\nThe proposed learning algorithms will be tested and evaluated via both formal analysis and computer\r\nsimulations. Given that the property of mutual entanglement of analysis and mapping is not particular to\r\nphonology, but is endemic to the problem of learning from observable data in all linguistic domains, the\r\nresults of this research are expected to provide insight into how language learning must proceed in general.",
