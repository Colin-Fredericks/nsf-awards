The\r\nMWP'01 is co-sponsored by the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) and the Lasers and Electro-Optics Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics\r\nEngineers (IEEE). It will be held in Long Beach, CA on October 7-10, 2001.\r\nEach year, the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society and IEEE Lasers\r\nand Electro-Optics Society promote student education in microwave and photonics\r\nengineering through a number of mechanisms. The Best Student Paper Program at the\r\nMWP is one of the student outreach programs to promote the interactions among\r\nstudents, faculty and industrial participants, and helps to develop the students' technical\r\nacumen as well as their communication skills. It also introduces them to the international\r\ntechnical community and helps to build a community of students who will lead the next\r\ngeneration of microwave photonics engineers.\r\nThe MWP provides financial support of various forms to student presenters but\r\ndoes not reimburse travel expenses. Travel support from NSF will ensure that the\r\nprogram is open to the widest range of interested applicants from U.S. universities.\r\n",
