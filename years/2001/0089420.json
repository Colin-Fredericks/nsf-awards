 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology - Cognitive (73) \r\nThe realm of the mind is mental process: thinking is not an object, but an intricate activity carried out by the brain. Traditional educational forums (classroom lectures, books) cannot readily depict the dynamic and reactive character of human thought; instead, they merely describe these processes. An alternative approach is to use computer-mediated educational materials that enable students to experience human thought processes. In previous work, sponsored by NSF, we created some educational units for an interactive website known as epsych. Epsych provides students with interactive demonstrations, experiments, and models designed to reveal our current understanding of the dynamics of thinking. Previous units include vision, hearing, decision-making, and learning. Now we are extending this site by adding units on language, problem-solving, brain and mind, consciousness, social processes, memory, and comparative psychology. These units incorporate a number of modules, each of which includes Java programs that allow students to conduct experiments, interact with psychological models, and experience demonstrations about psychological processes. From these experiences, students acquire a better understanding about how human thinking works, as well as a better appreciation for the role of experimentation in illuminating psychological processes.\r\n\r\nSeveral aspects of the site make it both user-friendly and learner-friendly. The site incorporates a number of indexes that allow for fast access to individual demonstrations, experiments, simulations, and units. A consistent look-and-feel across the site also facilitates user interaction. To sustain student motivation, the site challenges students with puzzles, allows them to manipulate and control interesting models of thought, and provides information on their own performance vis-a-vis other students. \r\n\r\nNational dissemination is currently being performed via the World Wide Web. Instructors nationwide have access to a mailing list that shares new developments, bug reports, comments, and invitations to participate in beta testing of new modules or provide comments about modules under developments. To provide long-term support, we are seeking contacts with publishers as a way to transition the site to commercial support. The site is compatible with CD-ROM publication or with a password-protected web site. \r\n",
