 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Urban Systemic Program for the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) aggressively targets the academic success of all students in K-12 mathematics and science through a comprehensive program of support for improved instruction. The San Diego Urban Systemic Program (SDUSP) engages the public and private sector community in building an infrastructure that will support quality mathematics and science education over the long term. \r\nThe goals of the SDUSP are:\r\n1. Substantial improvement in student achievement in the fields of science and mathematics.\r\n2. Substantial improvement of the quality of instruction in science and mathematics.\r\n3. System-wide implementation of high quality standards-based inquiry learning in science and mathematics using exemplary curriculum materials and technology tools.\r\n4. Ongoing collaboration to improve teacher education and the district's science and mathematics programs through well-defined partnerships among the school district, the universities, educational centers, and the private sector.\r\nThe San Diego Urban Systemic Program (SDUSP) builds leadership in every school by engaging principals and enhanced department chairs in understanding the content, pedagogy and curriculum of standards-based reform, and in supporting the classroom teacher and monitoring results. The teacher in every classroom receives exemplary curriculum materials, substantial professional development, and job-embedded coaching. \r\nThe students in each science and mathematics class receive instruction that is pedagogically sound and content rich, with clear course expectations, standards-based materials, and the integrated use of technology. The end result is that each student is equipped with the mathematical and scientific knowledge, skills, and dispositions to make their own choices regarding post-secondary pursuits. \r\n\r\n",
