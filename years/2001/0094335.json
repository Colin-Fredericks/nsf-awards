 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0094335\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Yun Wang will carry out a program of research and education that focuses on studies in cosmology.  Her research plan is centered on exploring the use of two independent cosmological data sets, the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the cosmic microwave background anisotropy (CMB) to provide model-independent constraints on fundamental physical parameters.   SNe Ia provide us with a unique probe into the unknown energy content of the universe, the dark energy.  Using innovative techniques, Dr. Wang will study the constraints they provide on the equation of state of the dark energy, as an arbitrary function of time, from current and future SN Ia surveys.  CMB data allow us to probe the physics in the very early universe.  Dr. Wang will improve and expand on her previous work on the determination of the spectrum of the primordial matter density fluctuations, parameterized as an arbitrary function of wavelength.  Using new analytical methods and numerical tools, she will analyze current and future CMB observations that will provide observational guidance for constructing the correct inflationary model to describe physics in the early universe. \r\n\r\nDr. Wang will take advantage of the unique opportunities at the University of Oklahoma in integrating her research into educational activities.  She will involve undergraduates in research by presenting a series on cosmology at the honors college, designed to attract outstanding students to the field at an early age, by engaging students from the honors college and other universities in research through the University's Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, and by including undergraduate students in her research team.  She will also develop a cosmology course for graduate and upper level undergraduate students, and will offer public lectures in cosmology to the local community.\r\n",
