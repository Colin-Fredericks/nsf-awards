DeSimone of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill have support from the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities to establish a Math and Physical Sciences-Internship in Public Science Education (MPS-IPSE) in the area of Carbon Dioxide in Nature and Technology.  The program is a joint effort of the Kenan Institute for Engineering, Technology and Science at NC State University, the NSF Science and Technology Center for Environmentally Responsible Solvents and Processes (CERSP) led by UNC Chapel Hill, and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.  Outstanding math and science K-12 teachers from the Research Triangle area in North Carolina will be recruited as MPS Fellows for a three-year program.  During this time period, the Fellows will have summer internships at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences and the NSF CERSP facilities at NC State University and the UNC Chapel Hill.  Scientists in the CERSP and staff in the museum will serve as mentors throughout the three-year program to help the teachers develop novel curriculum tools for K-12 education, and educational programs and displays for the museum public.  At the same time, the teachers will be able to obtain graduate credit for advanced degrees in education at local universities, and they will participate in professional and personal leadership training programs throughout the academic year.",
