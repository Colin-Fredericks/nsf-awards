His research focuses on understanding the phenomenon of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) by constructing a sample that is broadly representative and fully characterized.  He will obtain spectroscopy for source characterization and the determination of multi-epoch luminosity functions of a subsample of objects observed with the Chandra X-ray telescope.   The resulting sample will incorporate most known AGN types and include previously hidden populations.  Dr. Hooper's educational activities will include participation in a science teacher training program, known as UTeach, being developed at the University.  He plans to offer an upper-division course on research methods which is aimed at synthesizing the students' previous course work and developing independent problem solving skills.  \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
