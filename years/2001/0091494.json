Recently, the coastal zone has been directly or indirectly affected by a series of problems such as global warming, climate change, seal level raising, coastal erosion, environmental contamination, and overpopulation.  Coastal management and decision-making involve extremely comprehensive and critical operations across multiple governmental organizations, where the above problems and impacts have to be dealt with.  Geospatial information and analysis can be used to coordinate and support multi-agency operations include a) federal government: coastal erosion monitoring, coastal resource management, coastal forecasting, coastal development permission, and residential erosion awareness and watching system.  The goal of this research is to investigate and develop technologies that will greatly enhance operation capabilities of federal, state, and local government agencies for coastal  management and decision-making using multiple spaceborne, airborne, and in situ remotely-sensed measurements, spatio-temporal databases, and geospatial analysis tools.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research project are:\r\na) develop a strategy and technologies for utilizing geospatial information of all level of government agencies in coastal management and decision-making.\r\nb) develop and integrate technologies of space- and airborne and insitu spatial data acquisition, spatio-temporal data modeling and analysis, hydrological modeling and forecasting, and web-based information systems for digital government operations,\r\nc) develop and test an integrated coastal management and decision-making system that incorporates the spatial analysis and hydrological modeling technologies that will examine historical coastal environment and future changes  based on desired or proposed scenarios,\r\nd) test and implement the above strategy and the system to demonstrate the significantly improved interagency operations of coastal decision-making through a pilot  project in the primary site in Lake Erie area and another test site in the Tampa Bay area, and\r\ne) disseminate coastal geospatial data and coastal erosion information to end users including coastal residents in erosion areas and to assist them in making their decisions such as property protection measures, property purchasing/selling, and small community planning activities.\r\n\r\nIf successfully implemented, this project will significantly enhance our capability of handling spatio-temporal coastal databases, build a fundamental basis of coastal geospatial information for inter-governmental agency operations, and provide innovative tools for all levels of governmental agencies to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs.\r\n",
