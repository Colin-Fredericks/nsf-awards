 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand and improve upon the ways in which people manage information for re-access and re-use. The project focuses on information found on the Word Wide Web and consists of three phases. In Phase 1, the current situation is assessed to determine the nature and severity of problems in managing Web information for re-use and to determine the effectiveness of supporting tools. Participants are first observed in their workplaces as they use the Web to research a work-relevant topic. In a follow-on session, participants try to return to each in a collection of web sites they have previously visited and found useful. Special attention is given to the choice of tools, their success or failure and to the overall time required to reach a site. In Phase 2, practices of re-use and supporting tools, current and potential, are modeled using Phase 1 data. In Phase 3, a select number of tools and practices of re-use are prototyped and evaluated as guided by the modeling of Phase 2. Results of this project will be improved tools and practices to help manage Web information for personal use and re-use. The project will also provide a framework for the assessment of various tools and practices, current and potential. Possible applications extend beyond the Web to other information types including email, the files of a personal computer and even the printed documents in an individual's office. The results will be disseminated through scholarly publications and through the Internet.",
