 "awd_abstract_narration": "Air quality computer models are widely used investigation tools in environmental research;\r\nmany physical and chemical processes are modeled and their integrated impacts on atmospheric pollutant\r\nconcentrations studied. These models are also important tools for regulatory and policy communities, and\r\nare used to develop optimal emission control strategies for atmospheric pollutants, as required by\r\nthe National Ambient Air Quality Standards.\r\n\r\nThe level of confidence in modeling results depends critically on the accuracy of numerical methods\r\nemployed, as well as on the robustness of the underlying implementation. This research will\r\ndevelop state-of-the-art computational methods and software techniques for use in air quality modeling\r\nwork on time stepping methods. Special purpose algorithms will be developed for simultaneous treatment of box model processes, including aerosol dynamics, gas and liquid phase chemistry and interphase mass transfer. Higher accuracies and lower computational times are targeted.\r\n\r\nParticulate matter (aerosol) processes have recently became a priority focus area in environmental science. Incorporating aerosol processes in the models leads to an order of magnitude increase in the overall computational time. The research will extend into the area of solving the integro-differential equations that\r\ngovern particle evolution; specifically, the proposed work will improve the theoretical framework and will\r\nbuild fast and reliable numerical techniques for aerosol dynamics-chemistry simulations.\r\n\r\nTogether with the physical/chemical process understanding and numerical algorithm design, software tech-\r\nnology is an important component of these models. Another objective of the project is to explore software\r\ndesign techniques and tools that will make the modeling software easier to use, to maintain and to develop.\r\nThe resulting object-oriented version of a generic Eulerian model will illustrate the new approach to soft-\r\nware construction and will constitute an ideal environment for developing and testing specialized numerical\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nThe  educational goal is to enhance interdisciplinary education in computationally-oriented disciplines.\r\nSince much of the science and technology of the future and many of the new industries will cross the\r\nboundaries of traditional disciplines, interdisciplinary education becomes increasingly important. Some of\r\nthe newest high demand areas involve computing and information technology together with other fields:\r\nteaching and research will support the development of cutting-edge computationally-involved B.S. programs at Michigan Technological University, and continue to contribute to the Ph.D. program in Computational Science and Engineering.\r\n",
