 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns research and education on adaptive regression\r\nwhen the random errors are dependent. Many procedures have been \r\n(and will be) proposed for nonparametric regression based on\r\ndifferent assumptions. In applications, a difficulty a user often\r\nfaces is the choice of the best method for the data at\r\nhand. This is specially the case for high-dimensional function\r\nestimation, where to overcome the curse of dimensionality, various \r\nparsimonious models such as projection pursuit, CART, neural nets, \r\nadditive models, MARS, etc. are proposed according to different \r\ncharacterizations of the target function. A main interest in this \r\nresearch is to construct adaptive estimators by combining a\r\ncollection of candidate procedures. The goal for the combined\r\nprocedure is to perform automatically as well as (or nearly as well\r\nas) the best original procedure without knowing which one it is.  \r\nThe random errors will be assumed to be generally dependent,\r\nincluding both short- and long-range cases. The effects of\r\ndependence on adaptation capability will be studied. It is\r\nanticipated that theoretically proven and computationally feasible \r\nalgorithms will be proposed to combine regression procedures\r\ntargeted at various characteristics of the regression function and \r\ndifferent dependence structures for the random errors.\r\n\r\nFunction estimation is an important statistical tool that tries to\r\nunderstand accurately the functional relationships between variables based on \r\ndata and it has applications in many disciplines for successfully  \r\naddressing scientific questions. In reality, observations are always\r\nsubject to random noise (error) from different sources. When the\r\nrandom errors are dependent on each other, the dependence may\r\ndisguise the functional relationship of interest. Long-range\r\ndependence refers to a situation where the errors are still highly\r\ncorrelated even when they occur at times or locations that are far\r\naway from each other. It is known that such a long-range dependence makes\r\nthe estimation of the target function much harder. In applications,\r\nthe degree of dependence between the errors is usually unknown,\r\nwhich makes the function estimation problem even harder. In this\r\nproposal, we intend to develop methods that adaptively handle\r\ndifferent degrees of dependence among the errors so that the\r\nfunction of interest can be estimated optimally without knowing the\r\ndependence structure of the errors. The research results and related\r\nwork by others on long-range dependent data will be brought to\r\nstudents at various levels in several statistics\r\ncourses. Collaborations will be conducted with several professors at\r\nIowa State University and their students in atmospheric science, \r\nelectrical engineering, agronomy and possibly other fields to\r\nappropriately address long-range dependence phenomena, which have\r\nbeen encountered often and known to cause problems in data analysis \r\nwith the existing statistical methods. \r\n",
