 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to organize a workshop that will bring together an exciting, interdisciplinary group of researchers working on new issues in learning and development.  In addition to presentations by researchers using new methods and techniques in child learning and development, the workshop will also include presentations by scholars in the fields of psychology and neuroscience where results from animal research may profoundly impact our understanding of learning and development in humans.  The workshop will complement a series of in-house lectures by grant members who will be giving 'state-of-the-art' presentations on individual research areas.  The goal of the proposed Workshop is therefore to help forge a new interdisciplinary working framework for future collaborative research on child learning and development at Brown University.  \r\n\r\n",
