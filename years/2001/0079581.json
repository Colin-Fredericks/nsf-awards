They are to (1) identify individual-level and contextual determinants of internal migration in Guatemala and  (2) measure the economic and social impact of migration on women in rural communities.  The project seeks to help us better understand the impact of rural and urban development on the size, composition, and direction of internal migration streams.  Also, it will provide insight in the role migration plays in raising rural household incomes and in the diffusion of urban culture.\r\n\r\nTo address the first objective, the research will analyze the effects of individual \r\nand place characteristics on the probability of recent internal migration, and on the choice of destination in Guatemala.   Employment opportunities, amenities, and population pressure will be measured to assess the relative attractiveness of alternative locations.  Period trends in lifetime internal migration will be examined for evidence of the effects of political violence on population redistribution.  Ethnicity is an important stratifying variable in Guatemalan society: social, cultural and economic differences between indigenous Mayan and the nonindigenous populations are well documented and pervasive.  The study will investigate alternative explanations of ethnic differences in migration patterns that make reference to culturally based consumption preferences and economic marginalization.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the research will determine the impact of temporary migration and social ties to internal and U.S. migrants, on the size and composition of household consumption.  The investigators will also analyze the effects of individual-, household, and community-level measures of migration on experience on married women's levels of autonomy in decision making, an important dimension of modern, urban culture.\r\n\r\nData will be analyzed from the 1994 Guatemalan Census and the 1995 Guatemalan Survey of Family Health.  The 1994 census collected information for all household members on the number of years in current place of residence, place of prior residence, place of residence in 1990 and place of birth.  The Guatemalan Survey of Family Health interviewed 2,872 randomly selected women age 18 to 35 in 60 rural communities.  Nested-conditional logit and discrete-time logit models will be used to analyze recent and lifetime migration.\r\n\r\nThe study is unique in that it uses individual level census data to analyze internal migration in a developing country and in its incorporation of ethnicity as an explanatory factor in location decisions.  The project will fill a gap in the demographic literature on migration in Guatemala.  Also, it will advance our understanding of the role of migration in social and economic change in low-income countries.\r\n",
