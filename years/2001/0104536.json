 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for an after-school field ecology research program.  The plan involves 20 teachers/student center staff and 500 urban students from under-served communities over a three-year period in a unique research project that links teachers and students.  The students will be divided into two cohorts:  14-16 years old and 17-18 years old.  The younger group (14-16) will conduct research led by teachers in riparian field ecology along urban rivers.  The older students (17-18) will be involoved in more in-depth projects where they are paired with a mentor from the state environmental agency.  The proposed program is designed to complete a four-year \"pilot project\" that was initiated at Boston College in 1999.  It is a partnership effort involving the Boston Public Schools, the Mayor's Office, state environmental agencies and a consortium of corporations.  Students collect, analyze and post data at the Boston College web site.  In addition to engaging in original research that is substantive and meaningful, students learn to use scientific instruments.  The goals of the program are to increase urban students' interest in science and in careers in science.",
