 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), Dr. Feist is investigating a paradox in math and science in the US: our high school students are average and mediocre compared to international standards and yet our professional scientists are the best in the world.   He is also interested in the question of whether, during the journey from adolescent talent to adult achievement,  gifted women and minorities more likely than men and majorities to opt out of math and science careers?  If this is so, Dr. Feist is examining some of the psychological influences on these differential rates of attrition.  \r\n\r\nThis project explores these issues from the perspective of the psychology of science.  This is a pilot project that will explore and test the basic methodology and the primary survey questions.   Specifically, Dr. Feist intends to  examine issues related to scientific potential and the scientific achievement.  First, a sample of 160 (40 each from 1995, 1985, 1975, and 1965) past winners of the prestigious Westinghouse Science Fair are assessed on outcome measures, namely degrees obtained, career paths chosen (especially science v. non-science) and level of eminence obtained within their careers. Moreover, gender and ethnicity are examined in relation to such outcomes.  Second, 100 members of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) are  compared with 100 matched non-NAS scientists to determine what the early career markers of world-class scientific achievement are.  Outcome measures  consist of career eminence (titles, honors, awards) and predictor measures include gender, productivity (publication and citation rates over the entire lifespan) data as well as early indicators of scientific talent. Early indicators  include school performance, age of first publication, as well the age that they and others recognized their talent for science.  Regression analyses determine the relative importance of each \"predictor\" variable in influencing scientific achievement and eminence.  The  goal of such research is to provide answers to the question: Who develops interest in, and talent for, science during high school and who among those with the most talent are likely to go on to productive and eminent careers in science?  \r\n",
