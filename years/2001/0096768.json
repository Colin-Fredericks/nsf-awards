 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Iowa Paleontology Repository has been ranked among the top ten collections in North America in terms of size and significance, and supports the research activities of a paleontology graduate program recently ranked seventh in the nation.  The Repository contains some 25,000 type and referred specimens and over one million specimens in total.  It has long been the primary holding facility for paleontological and geological collections in the state, and is the focal point of the research and teaching activities of the paleontology faculty in the Department of Geoscience. The Repository has reached its effective operating capacity and is in urgent need of comprehensive reorganization.  \r\n\r\nThis project represents the first phase of a larger project, which will ultimately involve both curation and computerization.  This first phase (curation) focuses on: (1) a complete evaluation of the holdings, especially the Paleozoic and Mesozoic non-Iowan stratigraphic collections and Cenozoic molluscs; (2) completion of a range of curatorial projects facilitating reorganization, including curation of retiring faculty members' research collections and several special collections of potential interest to the community at large, especially the Strimple echinoderm and Belanski Devonian collections; and (3) physical reorganization, including purchase of new specimen cabinets.  Visiting specialists will be invited to evaluate those collections where in-house expertise is lacking.\r\n\r\nAlthough the collection already is heavily used, completion of the project will result in even greater use.  A long-term plan for the collection includes making collection data available on the WWW.\r\n",
