Thompson\r\n\r\nThe focus of the proposed research is the study of knots and\r\n3-dimensional spaces.  We will examine questions about surgery on\r\nknots, knotting of graphs in 3-space dimensional spaces, and\r\nHeegaard decompositions of 3-manifolds.  We describe three\r\nspecific goals and their connections to some of the basic\r\nquestions in the field.  The first goal is to develop the tools\r\nand techniques of multi-parameter thin position and sweep-outs so\r\nthat they can be used to tackle some of the long-standing\r\nproblems in knot theory and 3-manifold theory.  A second is to\r\nextend work of the proposer and M. Scharlemann on unknotted\r\nplanar graphs in the 3-sphere to a more general setting.\r\nFinally, we aim to obtain a clearer understanding of general\r\nquestions about 3-manifolds by obtaining a deeper understanding\r\nof 3-manifolds of Heegaard genus two.  We will examine specific\r\nquestions about tunnel number one knots, special cases of larger\r\nquestions about what genus two manifolds can be obtained by\r\nsurgery on a knot in the 3-sphere, which of these manifolds\r\ncontain immersed surfaces with injective fundamental groups, and\r\nhow information from the Heegaard diagrams of these manifolds\r\ntranslates into geometric and algebraic information about the\r\nmanifold itself.\r\n\r\nWe live in what is apparently a universe with three spatial\r\ndimensions.  Exploring the possible forms that our universe might\r\nhave is not only a deep problem for physicists but also for\r\nmathematicians.  Different mathematical possibilities lead to\r\nvery different expected physical properties.  As an example, we\r\ndo do not know if, were we able to program a very fast rocket to\r\ngo \"straight\" into space, it would eventually return to its\r\nstarting point, like a ship on the surface of the earth, or if it\r\nwould continue to travel away from us forever.  There are an\r\ninfinite number of possibilities for the shape of the universe.\r\nThis project proposes to explore some of them using the\r\ntechniques of low-dimensional topology and knot theory.\r\n",
