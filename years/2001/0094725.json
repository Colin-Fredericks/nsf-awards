 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of South Alabama is implementing a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Research (CSEM) Scholars Program. Goals of this program include improving the quality of educational programs and increasing the number of students in these disciplines that complete academic degrees or pursue further education or successfully gain employment with U. S. industry in demanding technical positions. The cornerstone of this program is the selection of up to 40 full time students to receive financial support. \r\nRecipients participate in a didactic career seminar series conducted by career training specialists and professionals from industry. Further, students spend a minimum of 6 hours/ week gaining practical experience in their major while conducting research supervised by a faculty mentor. Participating faculty have an organized research plan for aspiring scholars to review for potential research projects. Selected faculty are not only accomplished researchers but also have demonstrated the ability to effectively mentor undergraduate students towards accomplishment of career goals or the pursuit of higher education. Students participate in a monthly research seminar series and a Student Research Forum each semester. Annually, the research projects judged to be most promising are selected for presentation at an appropriate regional or national conference. CSEM Research Scholars also participate in a specialized series of career development forums. A CSEM Research Scholars Coordinating Committee administers selection of students, monitoring, reporting and assessment. Selection of faculty mentors, projects and conduct of forums is administered jointly with the existing University Council on Undergraduate Research (UCUR). CSEM Research Scholars are being particularly monitored for success rates relative to other campus - wide retention programs and for accomplishment of the CSEM program goals.",
