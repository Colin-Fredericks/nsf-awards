 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTERPHASE is a series of meetings, devoted mainly to numerical and computational aspects of free boundary problems, which have been held successfully once a year in Europe for the past 8 years.  The apparent misspelling of INTERPHASE is supposed to emphasize the chief purpose of this meeting: facilitate the communication and exchange of ideas and methods between communities (`phases') of scientists and engineers that otherwise may not interact and thus profit from each other.  In fact, interfaces arise in a variety of applications from materials science and fluid dynamics, to image processing and finance, which may not have any common roots and goals but however are described by similar partial differential equations and thereby present analogous difficulties, challenges, and methodology.\r\n\r\nThe 9th conference of the series will be held in College Park, MD, in September 2001 with the intention of encouraging more participation of US researchers and stimulating the exchange of ideas between American and European peers in the area of problems where there is an interface between regions of interest.  We plan to have about 30 senior speakers, 12 junior speakers, and a poster session.",
