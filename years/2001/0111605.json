 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and optimize the NZP (sodium zirconium phosphate type) ceramic-based thermal barrier coating (TBC) technology for use in advanced turbine and power generation systems. These advanced systems drive the need for higher operating temperatures to achieve better efficiencies without compromising durability. Such requirements heighten the threat of: (i) microstructural changes which reduce thermal barrier effectiveness; (ii) premature oxidative spalling;  and (iii) susceptibility to mechanical stresses in conventional yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based TBCs. Some NZP ceramics have very low thermal and oxygen conductivity, excellent thermal cycling resistance and high temperature stability but also have low thermal expansion.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of thermal spraying simple and functionally graded (to minimize thermal expansion mismatches) TBCs of NZP with YSZ that are better thermal barriers and also have very good thermal cycling resistance to 1200 degrees C. The primary goal for Phase II is to complete the scientific and engineering development in order to commercialize the NZP-based TBC technology.  A team of academic and industrial collaborators will work under the guidance of committed end-users to achieve this goal. \r\n\r\nPotential successful development of the NZP-based TBC concept will enable applications in high efficiency power generating systems and gas turbine engines; specifically, for turbine vanes and blades, and combustors and afterburners. Coatings based on NZP can also double up as environmental barrier coatings (EBCs), and find use in diesel engines and as abradable seals. The financial benefits of the NZP-based coatings could be over $100M arising from reduced component maintenance and fuel and operational costs. \r\n",
