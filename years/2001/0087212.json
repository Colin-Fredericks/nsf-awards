Rural areas across the nation include field stations and observatories for various scientific disciplines, as well\r\nas remote schools, including tribal colleges. This workshop will be the starting point to exchange state-of-the-art with state-of-practice information, and to discuss the projected network communication needs of the researchers, as well as to develop a consensus of probable paths to solving these needs.\r\n",
