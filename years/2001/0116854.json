The research is aimed at identifying and characterizing new cellulases with properties that are desirable for certain applications. They plan to construct cellulase mixtures that have high thermostability, broad pH optima, and high activity on crystalline cellulose.  They will enrich and isolate thermophilic cellulolytic microbes from various Egyptian soils.  The cellulase systems produced will be analyzed and those isolates producing enzyme systems with the desired properties will be further characterized and genes encoding enzymes with interesting properties will be cloned and expressed.\r\n\r\nScope: The project supports collaboration between two well-known scientists who have the expertise and resources for important research.  The research will add to our knowledge in environmental biology and will generate useful information for producing interesting new enzymes from a relatively untapped source in the Egyptian flora.  Interesting enzymes resulting from this work could be extremely valuable in biotechnological processes.  Dr. Wilson is an expert in cellulase cloning, expression and characterization.  Dr. El-Diwany is well published on the biotechnological aspects of this project, and has the facilities to carry out the work proposed.  This project has the potential to greatly benefit both sides by developing novel cellulase systems for efficient use of biomass, e.g., in ethanol fuel production. It will promote teaching, training, and learning of Egyptian and US graduate students.  The project combines the complementary strengths of the two PIs in molecular biology and biochemistry.  This project meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.\r\n",
