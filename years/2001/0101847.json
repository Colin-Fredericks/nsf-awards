 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award to Dr. Stephen Creager of Clemson University entitled \"Ultrasensitive Amperometric Detection of Redox Molecules:  Fundamentals and Bioanalytical Applications\" is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. The goal of the project is the development of an electrochemical amplification strategy which will have superior sensitivity to existing techniques. The amplification strategy is based on redox active molecules used as tags for detecting important biomolecules.   Additionally studies will be performed on a new class of monolayer-coated electrodes based on carbon.  These surfaces are predicted to have enhanced stability compared to electrodes currently in use.  The analytical developments will be complemented by computer modeling and simulation experiments.  The final stage of the research will be the application of the technique for specific DNA detection assays.\r\n\r\nThe research is interdisciplinary, challenging and original, and will have potential impact on the fields of physical chemistry, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, electrochemistry and sensor technology.  The research shows a  true integration of  University and Industry efforts.  Students will get an outstanding exposure to industrial R&D during the course of the project and a product with significant societal impact could well result. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
