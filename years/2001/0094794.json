 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased demands for skilled labor in the fields of computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) have heightened the need for community college participation in the recruitment and education of such majors. As a nation that is growing more and more dependent on technology degrees, the need to recruit and train nontraditional students such as minorities and women is critical. The primary objective of this project is to provide scholarships to help increase the number of academically talented but financially disadvantaged persons, particularly Hispanics and women, enrolling full- time in CSEM associate degree programs and completing their degrees as preparation for CSEM careers and further higher education. The project uses a combination of expanded scholarship opportunities, a rigorous recruitment plan, mentor- designed workshops on student success, student pairing- up (\"buddy system\"), industry involvement, and a student support structure delivering services such as advising and tutoring to create growth in the programs, help students complete their studies within two years, decrease the attrition point for students between the first and second years, and have the scholarship awardees either transfer to a four- year institution or enter the workplace. A distinctive feature of this \"bridging the gap\" program is the partnership between the NSF student awardees and community. \"Colonia\" development agencies are helping to develop a link between the colonias and the NSF students so that both colonia residents and the students (sometimes colonia residents themselves) benefit from tutoring and learning opportunities. Further, NSF students have direct contact with employers, allowing them to see how their learned skills work in the community.",
