Schatz of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.  He will be undertaking his research with Professor Toru Ishida in the Department of Social Informatics at Kyoto University in Japan.  Dr. Schatz will be researching trends in the information infrastructure.  He hopes to determine if there are Laws of the Net which predict the behavior of effective algorithms for future technologies of information retrieval.  He will be researching the evolution of information infrastructure placing the past, present and future technology in its proper historical context.  He will explore the 30-year period from syntactic to structure to semantics.  In addition, he will be studying the mass infrastructure for network information systems, such as the 300-year period from 19th century Networks to 20th century Spaces to 21st century Models.  He will further explore the philosophical foundations of new technologies for information retrieval in the Net.\r\n\r\nThe research should result in new paradigms for information technology, with broad impact on the field especially in the area of digital libraries.  The exposure of the awardee to a new research setting will be intellectually stimulating.  The collaboration should also facilitate further international cooperation in science and technology, and help to facilitate the number of excellent students from the Asian region to the \r\n",
