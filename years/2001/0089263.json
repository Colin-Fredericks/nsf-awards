 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nThis project is adapting and implementing the Contemporary College Algebra (CCA) program by incorporating problems dealing with Native American culture. CCA was originally developed by a consortium of 10 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) led by Texas Southern University. In this effort five tribal colleges (Dull Knife Memorial College, Stone Child College, Ft. Peck Community College, Little Big Horn College, and Salish Kootenai College) are joining together to adapt the CCA materials, conduct faculty development workshops and retreats, and disseminate the program to other colleges. \r\n\r\nThe college algebra course is the first mathematics course that carries college credit; however, large drop-out rates often characterize such courses. This project is designed to improve course retention and attitude in this course by assuring that students understand the relevance of the materials to the Native American culture. The first goal of the project is to adapt and design materials that prepare students to contribute in an information rich, technological society. The course incorporates small group projects; a strong technology component; communication skills such as reading, writing, and presenting; and actvities to develop students' mathematical self-esteem and confidence as problem solvers. The second goal is to change the culture of the college algebra course by incorporating native American culture in the examples, developing a sense of ownership by the teaching faculty in the college algebra program, energizing faculty to develop modes of instruction that engage students in their own learning, and developing a sense of involvement by faculty in other disciplines which require college algebra.",
