 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award will provide support to a senior professor for a collaboration with leading scientists in Ukraine to investigate the interplay between two \"hostile\" states, superconductivity and magnetism.  The rare-earth-nickel-borocarbide family of compounds which exhibit a wealth of related phenomena have been chosen for the study. Important length scales can be changed by introduction of point defects. This will be done by both chemical substitution and irradiation with high energy electrons in order to separate the effects related to physical disorder from those related to chemical \"pressure\".  The research will address the role of pair breaking mechanisms in the region of coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism, the nature of exotic electronic states in this region and the anomalies in normal state transport in these intermetallics.  The results are expected to be of general applicability to the understanding of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, valid well beyond the particular material chosen.  Students will receive training that will prepare them for careers in industry, academia or government.  The close contact and interaction with leading scientists from another country will provide new perspectives on science and culture for these students.\r\n\r\nThis individual investigator award will provide support to a joint effort by the principle investigator and leading scientists in Ukraine for an investigation into the intricate interplay between \"hostile\" physical states, namely magnetism and superconductivity.  A family of compounds, rare-earth-nickel-borocarbides, that shows an unusual variety of phenomena related to these two states has been chosen for these studies.  The effects of disorder, introduced both by chemical substitution and irradiation with high energy electrons, on the interplay will be studied.  The interplay between superconductivity and magnetism is a fundamental problem in solid state physics, and the results of this investigation are expected to lead to a much better understanding of this interplay that will be applicable beyond the chosen material.  Students will have the opportunity to collaborate with leading international scientists while learning state-of-the art technology and experimental skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
