 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disk systems have long been a source of performance and management\r\nproblems, and they grow in importance as the years pass.  Of particular\r\nconcern are the slow-to-improve mechanical positioning delays.  To\r\naddress these problems, storage devices and host systems have abundant\r\nresources and knowledge.  Independently, engineers of both device\r\nfirmware and operating system (OS) software aggressively utilize their\r\nlocal knowledge and resources to mitigate disk performance problems.\r\nThe overall goal of this research is to increase the cooperation\r\nbetween these two sets of engineers, which will increase the\r\nend-to-end performance and robustness of computer systems.\r\n\r\nThis research will develop a deep understanding of available device\r\nand workload information and how it can be collectively exploited.\r\nExploiting this understanding in real systems will require more\r\nexpressive interfaces and new cooperative algorithms.  Two concrete\r\nexamples to be explored are: (1) device-side specializations, such\r\nas freeblock scheduling, that have access to system-provided\r\ninformation about priority levels and forthcoming demands, and\r\n(2) OS-side specializations, such as track-aligned extents, that\r\nhave access to device-provided details about physical data layout\r\nand firmware cache algorithms.  In addition, the insights generated\r\nby this research will assist end-to-end education and thinking in\r\nstorage systems.",
