 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial travel support for US participants to Plasmodesma 2001, the fourth international workshop on plasmodesmatal biology, to be held in Cape Town, South Africa, August 19-24, 2001. The workshop will bring together junior and senior scientists from around the world to discuss many aspects of plasmodesmata science, basic and applied. These topics include: plasmodesmata structure and\r\ndevelopment, virus movement, solute transport, symplastic domains and regulation, macromolecular trafficking, and gene silencing.\r\nPlasmodesmata research is very active at present and is moving quickly on many fronts. The cross-fertilization of ideas that conferences are noted for is especially important in this multidisciplinary field, where the subject matter and techniques used by one group may be quite foreign to another. A total of\r\napproximately thirty speakers will be invited on the basis of submitted abstracts.\r\nOthers will be encouraged to present posters and short talks. The funds from this award will be used to support the travel and per diem expenses of US scientists, most of junior rank (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and assistant professors).",
