 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will develop low-cost, composites reinforced with carbon nanofibers. Methods demonstrated in Phase I will be further developed to generate alignment and promote adhesion of nanofibers polymer systems. These efforts help to capture the extraordinary intrinsic mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of carbon nanofibers in practical, affordable composites. One thrust of the program seeks to align nanofiber in extruded and spun flows, in materials that include polypropylene, polyester, and nylon. The composite filaments produced by these means will then be formed into net-shape composite components for a variety of applications. A second thrust focuses on fabrication of nanofiber papers for applications that include fuel cell electrodes. Potential end users of the technology and leaders in their respective markets, will evaluate materials and prototypes produced during Phase II. \r\n\r\nSpecific commercial applications targeted by the Phase II work include nanofiber reinforced polyester and nylon tire cord, thermally conductive plastics for electronics packaging, nanofiber paper for fuel cell components, and conductive, high service temperature plastics for electrostatic precipitators needed to clean exhaust streams from power and chemical production. Each of these applications has an associated Phase II partner participating in the program. \r\n",
