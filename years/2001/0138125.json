The reports were published on paper; electronic copies do not exist.\r\n\r\nA collaboration of the Naval Research Laboratory Library, the Naval History Office, and NSF's Office of Polar Programs assembled a full set of paper copies of the reports.  The Document Automation & Production Service, Defense Logistics Agency, will digitize them and make CD-ROM copies. NSF will distribute the CD-ROMs as needed, and the files will be available to the public.\r\n\r\n",
