 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on recruiting students to high technology disciplines, increasing retention through mentoring and support and facilitating career placement through industry partnerships. To meet these ends, the School of Natural and Applied Sciences (NAS) awards 29 NSF scholarships in each of four years in the areas of Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Computer Systems Engineering and Mathematics. A strong mentoring component grounds the project. In addition to joining an NSF Scholars Organization, students meet with faculty and peer mentors regularly to address academic, career and personal progress. Mentoring strategies tap institutional resources as well as established industry linkages to further career goals. A Steering Committee, composed of industry, community college and institutional representatives, ensures effective integration and communication of all project components and resources.",
