DELOS is a major forum for and organizer of digital libraries research and planning activities in Europe.  It is funded by Information Societies Technologies (IST) 5th Framework Programme of the European Commission.  This proposal seeks travel support for six participants from the American research community.\r\n\r\nThe workshop continues the planning and research agenda put forward by the multi-year NSF-EU working groups' process jointly sponsored by CISE/IIS, SBE/INT and the European Union.  In the groups' final report \"An International Research Agenda for Digital Libraries\", increased levels of collaboration and interaction was seen as critical to building multi-lingual, multi-national digital libraries.\r\n",
