 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complex geometry becomes increasingly common in applications\r\narising in diverse areas. Plastic surgeons use computer\r\nmodels to plan and perform operations. Mechanical engineers\r\nvirtually assemble and test cars and planes. Animators\r\ncreate complex characters and effects indistinguishable from\r\nreality. Geometric modeling has found its way into art\r\nconservation: it is now feasible to create computer models\r\nof sculptures capturing the most subtle of details.\r\nIncreasing complexity of geometric data calls for new\r\nefficient representations and algorithms. The goal of our\r\nlong-term research plan is to study representations of\r\ncomplex geometric data, surfaces in particular. We plan to\r\nlaunch a broad and fundamental program to explore three\r\ntypes of representations: piecewise-smooth surfaces,\r\nmultiscale surfaces and combined volume-surface\r\nrepresentations. Our approach to designing complex surface\r\nrepresentations is based on the concept of subdivision, a\r\npowerful technique for modeling smooth surfaces. Subdivision\r\nalgorithms, while being more flexible and general, retain a\r\nnumber of useful properties of splines. Most importantly,\r\nthe surfaces generated by these algorithms have a natural\r\nhierarchical structure and are computed using efficient\r\nlocal rules; subdivision algorithms can be easily extended\r\nto represent multiscale data. The general goal of our\r\nresearch is to design representations supporting efficient\r\nalgorithms for construction, rendering, manipulation,\r\nprocessing, transmission and storage of surface data. We\r\nwill explore in close coordination both theoretical\r\nproperties of these representations (regularity, convergence\r\nrates, fairness, stability) and their practical\r\napplications. The specific goal of the proposed project is\r\nto generalize to surfaces the signal processing tools that\r\nwere designed and are extensively used for images. The\r\nresearch program is integrated with the education plan,\r\nwhich has three main goals: (1) prepare graduate students\r\nfor research in computer graphics and related areas, (2)\r\nincorporate the latest advances in research into curriculum\r\nat all levels, including undergraduate, and engage motivated\r\nundergraduate students in research (3) transfer knowledge\r\nabout latest research advances to professionals in the\r\nindustry.",
