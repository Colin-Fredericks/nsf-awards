 "awd_abstract_narration": "We investigate four major unsolved problems in or bordering on harmonic\r\nanalysis. These are the Kakeya problem, the Lipschitz differentiation\r\nproblem, the restriction problem, and global solvability for the\r\nNavier Stokes equation. For the Kakeya problem, we continue our\r\nwork with Tao on improving exponents in the sums-differences approach.\r\nFor the problem of differentiation by Lipschitz vector fields, we try\r\nto apply our work on maximal functions in arbitrary directions to\r\nunderstand what are the limitations on a counterexample and hopefully\r\nthat none can exist. For the restriction problem, we try to apply\r\nthe new results on Kakeya and to better understand Bourgain's\r\nmachine for converting Kakeya results to ones about restriction.\r\nFor Navier Stokes, we first discretize everything in the\r\nform of a kind of generalized wavelet coefficients. In work with\r\nPavlovic, this has already produced a generalization of\r\nthe Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg theorem to the case of hyperdissipation.\r\nWe hope from this point of view to discover a sort of local dispersion\r\nproperty for the cascading effect from the nonlinear term. Then we\r\nhope to tie in the Clay problem with a dyadic model in which this\r\ndispersion is a given. As might be imagined, we are unlikely to solve\r\nall these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis concerns the proof of estimates on interesting systems by\r\nexaming the contributions of all their parts. One such system is\r\nthe Navier Stokes equation which governs the behaviour of incompressible\r\nviscous fluids. An important open problem is whether this equation\r\nstarting with smooth initial data can develop singularities without\r\na forcing term. This would akin to a cyclone beginning spontaneously\r\nin one's bathtub. It seems rather unlikely but the tools of analysis\r\nare not yet strong enough to rule it out. Our approach is to\r\ndiscretize the problem, that is to try to approximate the problem\r\nby one about a finite number of objects and investigate possible\r\ninteractions of those objects by means of combinatorics. Most\r\nphysically arising mathematics can be looked at this way because matter\r\nis not continuous but rather composed of particles. We will work\r\non the above problem and some other important problems which may be\r\napproached with the same point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
