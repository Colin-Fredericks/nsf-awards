 "awd_abstract_narration": "0087695\r\nZafiriou\r\n\r\nFreshwater dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly affects many important processes, particularly\r\nin organic-rich systems. Recent reports show that (1) the major term in the proton balance of the highly\r\ncolored Satilla River is \"organic alkalinity,\" and (2) that photoreactions in this water, catalyzed in part by\r\nFe, consume O2, bleach color, and form CO, CO2 (the major product), and Fe(II). We hypothesized that\r\nCO2 arises by Fe-catalyzed \"photodecarboxylation\":\r\nDOM-COO-H + O2 + hv_______ Fe\r\nDOM-H + CO2\r\na well-known reaction for simple molecules. The implied massive loss of the principal organic ionizable\r\ngroups should profoundly influence many important properties of photo-altered DOM (hv-DOM): e.g.\r\nmetal-binding capacity, acid-base properties, hydrophobic binding, adsorption/coagulation,\r\nbioavailability, optical properties, and perhaps behavior in water purification (e.g. chlorination).\r\nHowever, an initial study determining and modeling Satilla water's whole pH titration curves before vs.\r\nafter photolysis (solar simulator) falsified the hypothesis above: for every CO2 formed only ~ 0.1 acidic\r\ngroup was lost; pH decreased (stronger acids formed than were consumed). Furthermore, Fe was involved\r\nin the changes observed.\r\nObjectives: Hence we are proposing (1) better characterizing the relationships among CO2 evolution,\r\nproton binding sites (concentrations and affinities), and other variables: [Fe], pH, [O2], light dose, and\r\nwavelength; (2) assessing the generality and environmental variability of these effects by studying other\r\nriverwaters, sampled in different seasons; (3) examining the effect of these changes on an important\r\nphysico-chemical property of hv-DOM: its copper binding strength and capacity, and (4) formulating a\r\nbetter heuristic scheme than the hypothesis above to rationalize the results chemically. Clearly to some\r\nextent photo-generated CO2 does not originate simply from -COO\r\n-\r\ngroups. Acidic groups, if lost, seem to\r\nbe replaced by similar but not identical new acids from DOM photo-oxidation.\r\nWork Plan and Methods: This is a collaborative effort among a postdoctoral associate and two PIs with\r\nexperience in organic/inorganic alkalinity-pH-CO2 properties, and DOM photochemistry. We are using\r\noptimizations of methods demonstrated to apply to this problem, and well-known Cu-binding study\r\nmethods. The Altamaha, a more typical second river chosen for study, is also DOM-rich. Its DOM is\r\nthought to be derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources, in contrast to the Satilla's\r\nmainly allochthonous, highly colored DOM. Suwannee River water and well-known isolates of its humic\r\nand fulvic acids (SRFA, SRHA) are also being studied, since in organic-rich colored waters these\r\nfractions comprise a major portion of the DOM, organic alkalinity, and light-absorbing material.\r\nEducation: This project contributes to training in environmental science by involving an independent-working\r\npostdoctoral associate and graduate students at UGA and WHOI.\r\nSocietal Impacts: This study increases our understanding of processes potentially affecting water\r\ntransparency, potability and treatment (e.g. chlorination), aquatic biota, and also the binding, transport,\r\nand transformations of agrichemicals and pollutants (especially Cu).",
