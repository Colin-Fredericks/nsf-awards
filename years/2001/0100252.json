 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project has several related components: 1) We\r\nplan to continue our study of the Schelling segregation\r\nmodel as a dynamical system. This model, which first arose\r\nin economics, is related to a number of lattice models in\r\nstatistical physics like the lattice gas, but more difficult\r\ndue to the inherent non-local nature of site coupling; 2) We\r\nplan to study the \"rigidity\" of periodic point invariants\r\nfor symbolic and hyperbolic dynamical systems. These\r\ntopological invariants include, for a Holder continuous\r\nfunction f, the unmarked periodic orbit spectrum, the beta\r\nfunction P(-s f), and the zeta function. These invariants\r\nare fundamental objects of study in dynamics and statistical\r\nphysics, but the information about the function f they\r\ncapture is subtle and poorly understood; 3) We plan to\r\ncontinue our investigation into the distribution of values\r\nof fundamental quantities in ergodic theory (e.g. Lyapunov\r\nexponents, local entropy, and Birkhoff averages)  and the\r\nfine structure of the corresponding phase space\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project has several related components: 1) We\r\nplan to continue our study of the Schelling segregation\r\nmodel as a dynamical system. This model, which was first\r\nproposed by the eminent economist Thomas Schelling, is\r\nrelated to a number of lattice models in statistical physics\r\nlike the lattice gas, but more difficult due to the inherent\r\nnon-local nature of site coupling; 2) Pressure is a\r\nfundamental object of study in statistical physics, but even\r\nin highly idealized systems, the information about the\r\nsystem it captures is subtle and poorly understood. We plan\r\nto study whether certain systems are completely identified\r\nby their pressure. These problems have striking similarities\r\nto fascinating questions which Kac adroitly summarized with\r\nthe question \"Can you hear the shape of a drum?\"; (3) For\r\nergodic systems, the time average of a function along almost\r\nevery orbit equals the spatial average. Only very rarely can\r\nalmost every orbit be replaced by every orbit. We plan to\r\nstudy the fine structure and dimension of the exceptional\r\nset whose time average does not coincide with the spatial\r\naverage\r\n",
