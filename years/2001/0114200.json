 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will enable North Carolina State University to purchase a specialized wide-bore 12 Tesla superconducting magnet for a High Field Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (HF EPR) Laboratory. The instrument will be used primarily in ongoing research programs at North Carolina State University that are focused on exploiting paramagnetic properties of novel materials. The new Cryogenic 12 T EPR magnet will have specialized cryostat/accessories and will enable key experiments in: (1) spin-polarization experiments with novel magnetic materials; (2) measurements of zero-field splitting for effective integer spin-systems of coupled spins that are EPR-silent at lower magnetic fields; (3) quantum computing experiments with essentially pure quantum state for an ensemble of quantum dots; (4) high accuracy measurements of zero-field splitting from field dependence of EPR spectra to determine the nature of magnetic interactions; (5) studies of phase separation phenomena; (5) and cluster nanostructure in lanthanide-doped optically-active glasses. This state-of-art HF EPR facility will be available for education of students in modern magnetic resonance techniques, and will be accessible to users from the UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke as well as to researchers from the Research Triangle Park. Thus, this magnet acquisition will provide new measurement capabilities, improve the research infrastructure, and enhance student education, improve the research infrastructure, and enhance student education.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will enable North Carolina State University to purchase a specialized wide-bore 12 Tesla superconducting magnet for a High Field Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (HF EPR) Laboratory.
