 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hardings\r\n0091337\r\n\r\nRecently, Dr. Harding's laboratory discovered a family of cell surface proteins called AT4 receptors.  These receptors appear to be important regulators of the fine structure and thus, the function of tissues and organs.  One such organ where the activation or blockade of AT4 appears to dramatically impact function is the brain.  Here it was found that compounds (developed in the Harding laboratory) that bind AT4 receptors can markedly alter learning efficiency, memory consolidation, and recall.  These findings correlate with the high concentration of AT4 receptors in the brain areas associated with cognitive function.  The goal of this project is to understand the mechanism by which AT4 receptor modulation influences cognitive function.  Specifically, the investigators wish to identify critical cellular processes and molecules that participate in AT4 receptor-dependent effects.  \r\n\r\nThe long-term goals of this project are twofold.  First, to clarify the basic mechanisms responsible for learning and memory development and to clarify how the AT4 receptor system fits into the big picture.  Second, we wish to identify likely processes and molecules that can contribute to cognitive dysfunction in diseases like Alzheimer's disease.  A corollary to this second goal is to determine whether drugs directed at AT4 receptors might serve as useful therapeutics in individuals with cognitive disorders.  \r\n",
