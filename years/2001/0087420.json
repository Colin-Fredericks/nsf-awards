The researchers will be undertaking a study of the effect of intermolecular electron transfer on vibrational spectra.  The researchers will continue to develop an understanding of electron transfers that are so fast that they cannot be easily explained by existing theories of electron transfer.  They plan to design and synthesize new ligands and complexes that will be used to further test the physical description of dynamic effects on infrared spectra.  They will also be working together to optimize simulations of the IR spectra of exchanging systems to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic information.  \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. researchers have expertise in the area of electron transfer and spectroelectrochemistry and their Japanese collaborators are expert in the synthesis of ligand bridged hexaruthenium clusters.  The research should result in the development of new spectroscopic methods for the study of charge transfer the \"rational synthesis\" of conducting materials, and refinement of existing theories of electron transfer.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific meetings.\r\n",
