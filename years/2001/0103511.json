A common theme is that these problems all\r\ninvolve hyperbolic geometry, either as a tool to understand wider\r\nrange problems or as a topic of interest in itself. The first\r\nhalf of the proposal is a natural extension of the research\r\ndeveloped by the Principal Investigator in the past few years. On\r\nthe purely hyperbolic side, it proposes to study convex cores of\r\nhyperbolic structures on 3-dimensional manifolds, and to further\r\ndevelop an approach to hyperbolic structures on surfaces which is\r\nbased on the technique of geodesic currents. On the more\r\ntopological side, it proposes to take advantage of methods of\r\nhyperbolic geometry to analyze simple closed curves on\r\nsurfaces. In particular, one of the objectives of the proposal is\r\nto determine the fractal dimension of the space of simple closed\r\ncurves on a surface. The second part of the proposal is based on\r\nexciting new conjectures which would connect two aspects of the\r\ntheory of knotted curves in 3--dimensional space which so far\r\nhave had very little interaction, namely topological quantum\r\nfield theory and hyperbolic geometry on knot complements. The\r\nproject proposes to attack these conjectures and, if these are\r\nproved, to further develop the connections so established.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is focused on the interplay between\r\nhyperbolic geometry and topology. In low-dimensional topology,\r\none tries to analyze the possible shapes for spaces of dimensions\r\n2 and 3. In particular, it includes as a subfield knot theory,\r\nwhere the goal is to understand all possible ways in which a\r\nstring can be knotted in space; techniques of knot theory have\r\nsuccessfully been applied to analyze the recombination of DNA and\r\nthe knotting of complex molecular structures. Hyperbolic geometry\r\nis apparently very different. It is a non-euclidean geometry\r\nwhich was introduced in the early nineteenth century, in order to\r\ntest the internal consistency of the axioms of the classical\r\ngeometry developed by Euclid and other Greek mathematicians. An\r\nunexpected connection was established in the nineteen seventies,\r\nthrough ground breaking work of Bill Thurston who showed that\r\nhyperbolic geometry could be successfully used to solve problems\r\nin topology. For instance, there is a number associated to each\r\nknotted curve, called its \"hyperbolic volume\" and which can be\r\ncomputed fairly easily by current software. If two knotted curves\r\nhave different hyperbolic volumes, one is guaranteed that it is\r\nimpossible to deform one curve to the other. A new picture is now\r\nbeginning to emerge, where the hyperbolic volume of a knotted\r\ncurve unexpectedly occurs in techniques of mathematical physics\r\noriginally designed to predict the behavior of high energy\r\nparticles. The main part of the proposal is aimed at clarifying\r\nthis picture, with the expectation that the cross-fertilization\r\nbetween topology, hyperbolic geometry and mathematical physics\r\nwill lead to advances in each of these three fields.\r\n",
