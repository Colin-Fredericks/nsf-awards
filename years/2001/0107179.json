 "awd_abstract_narration": "The screening of data sets is essential to modern technology.  \r\nWhenever the objective is to find \"positive elements\" in a \r\ndata set, a test indicating whether at least one positive is \r\nan element of a specific part of the data set can greatly \r\nfacilitate their isolation.  Such tests are called binary \r\ngroup tests and the general mathematical method behind the \r\nidentification of the positives using such tests is known as \r\nclassical group testing.  In many applied settings, the use \r\nof classical group testing to isolate objects that are \r\nindividually positive has become standard experimental \r\nprocedure.  However, very little work has been done in \r\napplying group testing techniques to the identification of \r\nobjects that are collectively positive.  Let C be an unknown \r\ncollection of subsets or complexes in a population and let P \r\nbe a pool taken from the population.  A pool P is said to be \r\npositive if and only if a member of C is also a subset of P.  \r\nThe identification of C by the application of these binary \r\ntests is called group testing for complexes.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this proposal is the development of efficient \r\ngroup testing methods that lead to the identification of \r\npositive combinations of objects, namely the positive complexes.  \r\nThere are many scientific and technical areas where the \r\nidentification of positive combinations of objects is important. \r\nComputationally feasible methods of finding combinations of \r\nentities that produce some measurable outcome or are measurably \r\nlinked to some function or disfunction would have important \r\napplications to medical genetics, computer security, software \r\ntesting, data mining, communications, and marketing.\r\n\r\n",
