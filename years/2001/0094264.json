The educational objective will expose undergraduate students to a broader range of experiences thereby fostering personal growth by having students spend one or two semesters abroad through establishment of a departmental international exchange program with European universities.\r\n\r\nThe studies will provide insights into developing new catalysts of potential interest to the pharmaceutical industry, and will provide graduate students and post-doctoral associates with skills for better prospects in the job market. Undergraduate students who spend time abroad under the exchange program will benefit both socially and professionally from their experiences in a foreign institution.",
