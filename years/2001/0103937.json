The \r\nequations will be studied in their full nonlinear \r\ngenerality, using procedures deriving from the intrinsic \r\nstructure of the physical problems.  These procedures \r\nhave turned out to interact in a natural way with newly \r\ndeveloped methods of geometric measure theory, which were \r\ndeveloped initially for the special case of minimal \r\nsurfaces in other contexts.  In a number of cases of \r\ninterest, striking and unusual behavior of solutions was \r\nuncovered in this way.  Our investigations will continue \r\nin directions that have already led to discoveries of \r\ndiscontinuous dependence on boundary data, symmetry \r\nbreaking, failure of existence under physical conditions, \r\nfailure of uniqueness under conditions for which \r\nsolutions exist, and discontinuous reversal of comparison \r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nCapillary interfaces play an important role in many \r\npractical situations, notably in reduced gravity or in \r\nconfigurations for which physical length scales are very \r\nsmall.  Capillarity is an essential concept for \r\ndescribing situations in which substances are in contact \r\nat surface interfaces and do not mix.  A precise \r\nunderstanding of the mathematical properties of solutions \r\nof the capillarity equations will provide valuable \r\ninsight for resolving such matters as how to design fuel \r\ntanks on an orbiting spacecraft so that the fuel will be \r\naccessibly located, predicting where oil or water resides \r\nin underground pore spaces of rocks, or determining the \r\nmanner in which the faces of microelectronic components \r\nwill become partially covered when they are dipped in a \r\ncoating bath.  The work under consideration is of \r\nparticular relevance for predicting unexpected behavior \r\nof liquids in these and in other applications.\r\n",
