 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social Sciences - Other (89) \r\nA multi-disciplinary team of faculty is modifying existing foundation courses in the social sciences, by integrating modules that emphasize investigative, reasoning-based learning experiences that will be implemented in a computer lab. These courses collectively strengthen science and mathematics based learning experiences for Queensborough Community College (QCC) students, especially teacher education students, and are serving as a bridge to higher level courses. Courses are being modified so that the material is appropriately tailored for our students. They are being redesigned to be accessible, yet challenging, for the 2-year college student. The project is modifying foundation courses in psychology, economics, and sociology. The courses selected are part of our core requirements for most students including those in our teacher preparation program. In psychology, we are adapting and incorporating observational procedures developed in an NSF-funded psychology project at Macalester College. Also, basic concepts crucial to understanding simple statistical constructs that are central to research methods are being incorporated with modifications from an NSF-supported project carried out by CyberGnostics, Incorporated (award 9950671, \"Visualizing Statistics: An On-Line Introductory Course,\" a web-based introductory course marketed through Duxbury press). In sociology we are incorporating new materials being developed at San Francisco State University in the Urban Studies Department. The project directors are also developing an interdisciplinary, investigative course targeted for higher-achieving students in order to facilitate an heightened understanding of the relationship between the social, economic, and psychological worldviews and the methods of inquiry in these disciplines. The effectiveness of new materials is being evaluated in a multi-tiered approach, including an assessment of students' mastery of concepts, attitudinal and self-efficacy changes, and the breadth of implementation. The materials developed are also being disseminated through presentations at CUNY faculty development seminars, the CUNY-wide disciplinary councils and through the resources of the CUNY WEB-based community. Faculty are presenting findings and writing articles for publication in discipline-specific media. \r\n\r\n",
