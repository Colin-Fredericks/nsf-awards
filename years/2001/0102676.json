 "awd_abstract_narration": "A majority of entering students begin their college careers with inadequate\r\nmathematics background to pursue SMET careers. The purpose of the proposed\r\nplanning program is to design a comprehensive program to overcome these\r\nentering deficiencies to improve the participation and performance of minority\r\nstudents in SMET disciplines. The overall goals of the planning program will be\r\n(a) to assess the strengths, weaknesses and needs of mathematics instruction as\r\nwell as other gate-keeping courses in the SMET disciplines; and (b) to assess \r\nundergraduate student research needs and opportunities in SMET disciplines on \r\nand off campus.\r\n\r\nAssessment includes, student performances on many items such as the Sophomore \r\nProficiency Examination, Major Area Examinations, Graduate and Professional\r\nSchool Entrance Examinations, success in advanced programs, presentations of \r\nresearch papers at professional conferences, professional publications, and the \r\ntype of employment and advancement in ranks.\r\n\r\nAssessment of the quality of faculty members in the SMET disciplines will be done\r\nby a review of the credentials of faculty members as compared to the SMET faculty\r\nin other institutions and the standards set by accrediting bodies and performance \r\nportfolios. In assessing faculty development and recruitment needs, the ratio of \r\ninstructor/students in mathematics and other SMET disciplines will be compared \r\nwith other majors at Benedict, as well as with other similar institutions.\r\n\r\nVisitation to other institutions with SMET's curricula that have recently been \r\nreformed due to NSF effort, self-study or otherwise, will help Benedict to have\r\na better assessment of the College's current SMET's curricula. This is also the case\r\nwhen selected staff members of the Task Force visit sites that they have recently \r\nreformed their SMET's curricula.\r\n\r\nThe current and future technology needs for SMET courses, in general, and SMET\r\nmajors, in particular, will be assessed.\r\n\r\nConsultants with expertise in SMET curricula will be used in the overall process of\r\nassessing the current curricula and potentially improving and/or redesigning them. \r\nIt will be made certain that high-level decision-making administrators (President, \r\nhis cabinet, and deans) review the comprehensive proposal and approve its contents \r\nbefore submission to NSF .\r\n\r\nAn internal advisory committee, (Task Force), will help to guide the work and to \r\nassess the planing program. In particular, this committee will help assess and analyze\r\n data and plan/design the curriculum for the comprehensive program.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that the proposed project will result in the development of a \r\ncompetitive proposal for submission to the National Science Foundation for funding \r\nthrough the HBCU-UP Program. The proposal will be based on an accurate assessment of\r\ncurrent and future needs in the SMET programs at Benedict College. Results of these\r\nassessment activities will also provide information needed by the College to improve \r\nother areas that bear on the performance of students in the SMET disciplines.\r\n",
