Such model systems can\r\nsometime suggest shortcuts when the experimetal work is\r\ndifficult.  More often, the models provide novel tools to disect\r\ncomplex biological phenomena in addition to traditional\r\ntechniques.  The current challenge in the field is to make\r\nquantitative modeling, on the one hand, a part of the process of\r\nfundamental biological discovery, and, on the other hand,\r\napplicable in biomedical and biotechnological situations.  This\r\nrequires researchers with biological skills and mathematical\r\ninsight and facility.  At this time such individuals are rare.\r\nThe investigator and his colleagues organize an International\r\nConference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology at Hilo,\r\nHawaii on July 15--19, 2001.  The goals of the meeting are to\r\nhighlight current top-level research, to provide a perspective on\r\nfuture research areas, to provide opportunities for career\r\ndevelopment to junior researchers and underrepresented categories\r\nof researchers, to foster interactions between established\r\nresearchers and junior researchers and between theorists and\r\nexperimentalists.  The meeting highlights exciting traditional\r\nand new areas of rapid growth in mathematical biology, such as\r\ntheoretical ecology and evolution, quantitative cell biology,\r\nproteomics, mathematical modeling in medicine and mathematical\r\nphysiology and immunology.  Plenary speakers both give a broad\r\noverview of their field and focus on areas for future research.\r\nAdditional contributed and poster sessions are organized to give\r\njunior researchers the chance to be heard.\r\n     Mathematical and theoretical biology is a young\r\ninterdisciplinary field of science that provides quantitative\r\nmodels in biology.  These models provide novel tools to disect\r\ncomplex biological phenomena.  The current challenge in the field\r\nis to train researchers with biological skills and mathematical\r\ninsight and facility.  The conference helps to highlight current\r\ntop-level research and provides opportunities for career\r\ndevelopment to junior researchers and underrepresented categories\r\nof researchers.\r\n",
