 "awd_abstract_narration": "0116334\r\nHumphrey\r\n\r\nSupport from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) will be used to acquire a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a gas chromatograph, water equilibration device, automated carbonate extraction system, and an auto-sampler.  This modern modular system will replace a twenty-year-old mass spectrometer and ancillary vacuum lines as the primary research instrument for obtaining stable isotope data at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM).  The outdated equipment will be retained as teaching tools for graduate education.  A primary advantage of a new system will be its ability to routinely handle very small sample sizes, in some cases several orders of magnitude smaller than that possible with the existing facilities.  For example, carbonate samples in the 5-10 microgram range and water samples in the 200-300 microliter range can be analyzed with the new system, whereas the previous facilities could only accurately measure in the milligram and milliliter ranges, respectively.  Further, sample preparation and introduction into the mass spectrometer will be fully automated, allowing for greater sample through-put and efficient use of researchers' time and resources.  The new equipment will be used to study a variety of earth systems for which the isotopic analysis of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur is particularly critical.  Twelve faculty members at CSM currently have ongoing research programs utilizing stable isotope geochemistry.  The new instrumentation will service faculty from the Department of Geology and Geological Engineering, the Department of Chemistry and Geochemistry, and the Division of Environmental Science and Engineering.  Specific areas of faculty research that require stable isotope data encompass both applied and fundamental topics, including water/rock interaction and diagenesis of carbonate rocks, geomicrobiology, bioremediation, petroleum reservoir characterization, hydrothermal alteration, petroleum and natural gas characterization, geochemistry of metalliferous ore deposits, continental paleoclimatology, and environmental geochemistry.\r\n***\r\n",
