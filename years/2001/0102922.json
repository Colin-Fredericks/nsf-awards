Gompf\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on constructing symplectic, contact and\r\n4-dimensional manifolds.  The Principal Investigator has defined\r\na topological structure called a \"hyperpencil\" on an\r\neven-dimensional closed manifold, generalizing a linear system of\r\ncurves on a complex algebraic manifold.  He has shown that any\r\nhyperpencil canonically determines a symplectic structure on the\r\nmanifold.  In dimensions less than 8, this correspondence maps\r\nthe set of hyperpencils onto a dense subset of all symplectic\r\nforms on the manifold (up to isotopy and scale).  A similar\r\nstatement seems likely in higher dimensions, and would provide a\r\ncomplete topological characterization of those manifolds\r\nadmitting symplectic structures.  If the fibers of this\r\ncorrespondence can be topologically specified, the result will be\r\na purely topological description of a dense subset of all\r\nsymplectic structures on all closed manifolds.  In addition to\r\nthis investigation, Stein surfaces and their contact 3-manifold\r\nboundaries will be studied by methods such as Legendrian Kirby\r\ncalculus.  The topology of exotic R^4's and other smooth\r\n4-manifolds will also be investigated.\r\n\r\nAn n-manifold is a space that in small regions looks just like\r\nn-dimensional Euclidean space.  Points, curves and surfaces are\r\nmanifolds of dimensions 0,1 and 2, respectively.  The space in\r\nwhich we live is a 3-manifold, and the universe (space-time) is a\r\n4-manifold.  Surprisingly, 3- and 4-manifolds are much less well\r\nunderstood than their higher-dimensional counterparts, although\r\nmajor progress has been made in recent years.  Symplectic and\r\ncontact structures on manifolds were discovered through classical\r\nphysics (Hamiltonian mechanics and optics, respectively), but\r\nthey are now seen to be important in such diverse areas as\r\nquantum physics, complex analysis, differential geometry and\r\ntopology.  For example, a rigid pendulum swinging in\r\n3-dimensional space determines a symplectic manifold.  The bob\r\nmoves on a spherical surface, so its position is specified by 2\r\nvariables (latitude and longitude on this sphere).  To completely\r\nspecify the state of the system, one must also include the\r\nmomentum of the bob.  At any position, its momentum is tangent to\r\nthe sphere and thus specified by two more variables.  Hence, the\r\nset of states of the system is a 4-manifold (locally specified by\r\n4 variables).  This 4-manifold has a special symplectic structure\r\nwhose role is to link each position variable to the corresponding\r\nmomentum variable.  This linkage ultimately results in Hamilton's\r\nequations describing the motion of the pendulum under the\r\ninfluence of a specified force field.  There are many other\r\nsituations in which manifolds and their symplectic and contact\r\nstructures arise.  While our understanding of such structures has\r\nadvanced enormously in recent years, some of the most basic\r\nquestions remain to be answered.  Which manifolds have symplectic\r\nor contact structures, and how many such structures are there on\r\na given manifold?  How many 4-manifolds (if any) are there\r\nsatisfying a given description?  Questions such as these form the\r\nbasis of this project.\r\n",
