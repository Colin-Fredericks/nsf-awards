 "awd_abstract_narration": "The restructuring of the utility industry has created new opportunities for distributed generation.  The market for distributed generation is growing and is expected to reach between 25 to 50 GW by 2010.  Current trends in the United States favor distributed generation due to its increased efficiency and reduced emissions. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to develop a low cost, high efficiency interface system in residential buildings for connecting dc sources like fuel cells to the grid, and to provide backup power during utility outages.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed topology supplies output power as split single-phase (plus/minus 120 V, 240 V).  A novel system configuration is proposed which essentially eliminates all switching losses, thus enabling very high efficiency and high power density.\r\n\r\nA prototype utility interface rated for an output power of 1.5 kW operating from a dc input will be built.  The prototype will be thoroughly tested for its functionality and efficiency.  The protection features incorporated into the system will be tested against possible fault conditions.  The design will be scaled up to a 10 kW power rating.\r\n\r\nA low-cost, high efficiency utility interface (also able to act as a backup power source) will accelerate the use of distributed generation sources such as fuel cells and micro-turbines.  The design of the proposed interface can be modified for higher power in three-phase applications.\r\n",
