The intimate workshop format will  encourage student participants to begin building a rapport with established researchers.   Students will have sufficient time to present their research (25 minutes) and then receive feedback from a panel of established researchers in the field (15 minutes).   The workshop will provide students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research, and will also allow them to put their work into perspective based on feedback from the panel and from fellow participants.",
