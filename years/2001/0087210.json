 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \rRecent improvements in diffraction hardware, theory, and software, and in computers have made diffraction methods increasingly routine for scientists, engineers, and professionals in many disciplines. It has also made them increasingly accessible to novices such as undergraduates. Experience at a variety of institutions has shown that these methods can be effectively integrated into the undergraduate curriculum in a wide variety of disciplines, including: biochemistry, biology, chemistry, geology, physics, materials science, engineering, and science teacher education. One of the biggest impediments to integrating diffraction more widely into undergraduate coursework is the lack of hands on access to appropriate diffractometers. This project is adapting and implementing several existing collaborative models from regional Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and research instrumentation networks. A WEB-accessible diffraction facility that emphasizes single crystal methods but with some powder capabilities has been established at this instituion. It is dedicated to undergraduate instruction in both formal courses and undergraduate research. The facility is fully accessible over the WEB so that participating PUI faculty and their students are able to both observe and control the diffraction instruments remotely as well as access databases located at the institution. Structure solution software for use at each home site is provided as are faculty training and curriculum implementation help for the twenty two participating PUIs. Because of the operation over a distance model proposed for instrument access, this facility is particularly useful to faculty and students in geographically remote regions, to those from less well funded institutions, or to those whose disabilities make travel problematic. \r\n",
