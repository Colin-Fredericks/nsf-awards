 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terman\r\n0103822\r\n     The investigator and his colleague develop geometric,\r\ndynamical systems tools for analyzing biophysical,\r\nconductance-based models for a broad class of neuronal networks.\r\nThese systems arise in numerous applications including motor\r\nactivity, sensory processing and learning.  They also develop\r\ncomputational models for the generation of sleep rhythms,\r\nepilepsy and parkinsonian tremor.  The investigators also\r\nconstruct and refine a mathematical and computational model for\r\nelectrical activity in the subthalamic nucleus and external\r\nsegment of the globus pallidus.  These are two nuclei in the\r\nbasal ganglia, a part of the brain involved in motor activity.\r\nDysfunction of the basal ganglia is associated with movement\r\ndisorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.\r\nThe model is used to test hypotheses on the role of the basal\r\nganglia in both normal and pathological movement.  Numerous\r\nexperiments have demonstrated that neurons within the basal\r\nganglia display a rich variety of dynamic behavior; moreover,\r\npatterns of neuronal activity, both spatial and temporal, are\r\ndifferent between a normal and a pathological state.  The\r\ninvestigators characterize the possible patterns of neuronal\r\nactivity that arise in the model and determine how these patterns\r\nchange with respect to modulations of network parameters and\r\nstructure.  A long term goal is to develop a model realistic\r\nenough so that it can shed light upon the key parameters and\r\nmechanisms responsible for the generation and modulation of\r\nobserved activity patterns.\r\n     A mathematical theory for the analysis of neuronal dynamics\r\nhelps illuminate the role played by various components of a model\r\nin generating a particular population rhythm.  These components\r\nmay correspond to some intrinsic property of individual cells, or\r\nto some network property such as the strength and type of\r\nsynaptic coupling or the probability that two cells communicate\r\nwith each other.  Clarification of the mechanisms underlying\r\ndifferent activity patterns may lead to a classification of all\r\npossible rhythms that can emerge from a given network, and enable\r\nus to determine how complicated a model should be in order to\r\ndisplay some observed behavior.  It also helps predict\r\ntransitions of the network behavior as parameters in the model\r\nare varied.  The investigators develop models for neuronal\r\ndynamics, and in particular of electrical activity in the\r\nsubthalamic nucleus and external segment of the globus pallidus.\r\nThese are two nuclei in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain\r\ninvolved in motor activity.  Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is\r\nassociated with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease\r\nand Huntington's disease.  The model is used to test hypotheses\r\non the role of the basal ganglia in both normal and pathological\r\nmovement.  Such models may help illuminate both fundamental\r\nneuroscience questions and clinical issues about how the brain\r\nand central nervous system work.\r\n",
