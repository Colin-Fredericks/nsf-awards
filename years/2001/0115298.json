The investigators will conduct field research to map late quaternary glacial deposits and paleolake shorelines across Turkey in order to quantify equilibrium line altitude (ELA) depression during glacial advances and collect samples for cosmogenic dating.  A central motivation for this study is to explore the shorter time scale (Henrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger events) synchrony of climate variation between the North Atlantic and southwest Asian.  Because Turkey lies at an interesting climatic crossroads, it may provide valuable chronological data.  Little is known about the glacial history of Turkey and this research may lead to new findings on the climatic history of the Eurasian subtropics.  \r\n\r\nScope:  This collaboration involves two scientists with complementary expertise.  Zreda is a leader in the field of cosmogenic dating of glacial feature.  The Turkish researchers will organize fieldwork, provide access to scientific materials (including aerial photographs and maps that may not otherwise be accessible.), and provide the knowledge of the geology of Turkey.  The US investigators will design and conduct sample collections program and will provide the technical expertise in the future isotopic dating.  Together the two sides will conduct all field investigations and mapping.  The proposed activity has great potential to advance knowledge within the field and across disciplines and contribute to educational curriculum.  \r\n",
