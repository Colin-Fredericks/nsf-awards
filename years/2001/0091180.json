 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vincent Catalano of the University of Nevada at Reno is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program in  research on design,  synthesis  and characterization of a new class of metal-containing cage complexes. These complexes are called metallocryptates. Synthesis of a large number of phosphine-based ligands will be followed by study of the binding of various d10 metal species (such as Ag(I) and Au(I)), and of anions, with those ligands. Spectroscopic and photochemical studies will be carried out on the complexes thus produced, in order to clarify important new effects (including special features of  metal-metal bonding) made possible by this mode of complex formation.\r\n\r\nPrevious NSF-funded  work by this research group has demonstrated that molecular structures that have metal ions as components can serve to encapsulate yet other metallic species, and further that this mode of complex formation can generate phenomena that are not  otherwise observable. For example, when cations of gold (aurous ions) are incorporated as guests into metal-containing host molecules, intense luminescence due to gold-gold interactions develops. In this case, the encapsulating ligand protects the gold dimer from disruption. In the current phase of the work, promising leads will be followed up, and new phenomena sought.\r\n",
