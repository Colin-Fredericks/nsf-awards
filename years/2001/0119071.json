The Board considers questions of the relationship of engineering and technology to coastal and offshore resource development and operations; to navigation and the commerce of the seas, waterways and ports; to related human resources and onshore activities; and their relationship to the establishment and implementation of public policies.  The Board identifies opportunities and needs for new technologies and other developments and recommends appropriate actions.  It stimulates the exchange of information and cooperative activities and provides a forum for the national and international professional community.\r\nThe activities through which the Board accomplishes its programs are: (1) assessments of the technical capability to undertake and manage offshore and maritime developments and uses, including the adequacy of knowledge to support technology development; (2) evaluations of safety of personnel and of the environment; (3) assistance in the preparation and assessment of the government's programs directed to ocean and maritime developments and uses and (4) identification of future opportunities for the integration of advanced technology into marine and maritime systems and the influence of technical advances on the establishment and implementation of public policy. ***\r\n",
