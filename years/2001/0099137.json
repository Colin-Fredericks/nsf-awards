 "awd_abstract_narration": "Next generation high-speed networks are expected to support exciting new applications involv-\r\ning multi-media traffic, such as video-conferencing, tele-medicine, video-on-demand, and web\r\nTV, in addition to countless other yet-to-be-conceived network applications. The viability and\r\nthe continuing success of these networks will depend crucially upon their ability to offer high\r\nperformance with regard to latency, delay variation, and bandwidths they can provide to these\r\nmyriad of applications. Customers will demand high-quality multimedia services, and not be\r\nsatisfied with the kind of high-latency, variable delay that is characteristic of the current Inter-\r\nnet. The various performance requirements from the users and the sheer size of these networks\r\nmake it imperative that we properly understand at a fundamental level how to design, engi-\r\nneer, and control these networks, and develop appropriate methodologies. It is also essential\r\nthat these tools be evaluated in terms of complexity and accuracy using experimentation (i.e.,\r\ntestbed) and simulation.\r\n      To address the challenges described above, we propose to develop an innovative approach\r\nthat harnesses the power of combined measurement and analysis to create design and control\r\ntools for next generation networks. We plan to elaborate on the approach in the context of:\r\nperformance evaluation (i.e., QoS estimation), and QoS-sensitivity estimation.\r\n     These issues form the foundation required to solve key network design and control problems.\r\nBuilding upon our approach|combining analysis with measurements|we will then focus on\r\non a variety of problems that have to be addressed in order for networks to support QoS:\r\n  admission control,                                                                                                                                                     congestion control,\r\n  QoS-based routing, and\r\n  network design and dimensioning.\r\nOur proposed solutions to the above problems will be supported and refined by extensive\r\nempirical studies on our experimental platform. This platform is capable of supporting a\r\nvariety of network technologies and traffic characteristics.\r\n     Our research team has been at the forefront of the development of important results in traffic\r\nanalysis, network design, and control, and is committed to creating the necessary synergy for\r\naddressing the key problems outlined above. Our team already has a significantly productive\r\ntrack record in previous collaborative efforts.\r\n      We are planning to address a set of problems that are critically important for deploying\r\nnext generation networks with the capability of offering high bandwidth and stringent QoS to\r\nusers. Creating a future broadband network that is exible, efficient, robust, and controllable\r\nis essential to the viability of our economy and to the different communities within it. Hence, if\r\nour research is successful, it will have a significant impact on the delivery of services necessary\r\nto meet the diverse needs of education, business, and entertainment.",
