 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nBernard Shiffman will continue his research on the statistics of random\r\npolynomials in several complex variables and more generally of random\r\nsections of powers of positive line bundles on compact complex manifolds and\r\non almost complex symplectic manifolds.  He will investigate the \"scaling\r\nlimit\" statistics as the degree of the polynomial or the power of the line\r\nbundle goes to infinity when distances are rescaled so that densities are\r\nnormalized.  He will study spacing of zeros, hole probabilities, pair\r\ncorrelations for local maxima, and other topics. He will also study\r\ncorrelations of critical points of spherical harmonics.  In another\r\ndirection, he will study the compact singularities of equidimensional\r\nmeromorphic mappings into compact complex manifolds.  He will also look for\r\nnew examples of Kobayashi hyperbolic hypersurfaces in complex projective\r\n3-space.  Kobayashi hyperbolic spaces do not carry any entire holomorphic\r\ncurves; simple examples are the Cartesian squares of curves of genus greater\r\nthan 1 and symmetric squares of generic curves of genus greater than 2.  He\r\nwill look for low-degree hyperbolic birational images of these surfaces in\r\ncomplex projective 3-space.\r\n\r\nThis research project is motivated by a need to understand complex quantum\r\nmechanical systems.  Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory that\r\ndescribes the behavior of atoms and molecules and their component\r\nparticles--protons, neutrons, and electrons.  These particles are described\r\nby wave functions, which are solutions of Schrodinger's equation.  The zeros\r\nand local maxima of wave functions give important information on states of\r\natoms and molecules; the zeros are known in quantum chemistry and physics as\r\nnodal lines.  The behavior of random polynomials provide an elementary model\r\nsimilar to complex quantum systems.  Polynomials in several variables\r\ncorrespond to systems with several degrees of freedom, and those polynomials\r\nof high degree correspond to wave functions for highly excited states.  The\r\nproject includes statistics on symplectic manifolds, which serve as the\r\nmathematical models for the states of quantum systems.  Another component of\r\nthe research involves understanding the geometry of complex algebraic\r\nmanifolds, which play an important role in quantum field theory and provide\r\nmodels for diverse physical phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
