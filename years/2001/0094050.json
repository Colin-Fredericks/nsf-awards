The spectroscopic analysis will be developed and applied entirely at near-infrared wavelengths, from 1.5 to 2.5 microns.  This unprecedented view will allow astronomers to directly detect young stars while they are still entirely shrouded in their birth clouds.  The PI seeks to find critical signatures present in the spectrum and environment of the star which yield clues to the formation process of massive stars.  Quantitative spectroscopic analysis will yield information on the properties of these young stars, such as temperature, gravities, abundances, and rotation, nearly a million years before they would be observed optically.  The study also includes very deep, near-infrared images of the fields of these massive young stars, to investigate cluster properties.  The research program will emphasize the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThis award will also support Dr. Hanson's involvement in a community outreach program designed to bring science and science education to Cincinnati youth.  Middle and high school students will be given lessons on a series of hands-on physics projects, where they will have the opportunity to learn and work the projects themselves.  They will then present these projects as a lesson to younger children.  The youth science program represents a joint effort with the Division of Teacher Education in the College of Education and the Department of Physics at the University of Cincinnati.  Although every student involved will benefit from the program, the aim is to uncover young people who might go on to become high school teachers.  \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
