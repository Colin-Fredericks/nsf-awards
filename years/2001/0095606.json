 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description for \"The Evolution of Bargaining Conventions\" by\r\nHerbert Dawid and W. Bentley Macleod\r\n\r\n         Legal scholars and economic historians have long recognized the\r\nimportance of social conventions and norms for the efficient and smooth\r\noperation of the economy. For example, if an employee feels that his or\r\nher employer is fair, then conflict is reduced, and the individual will\r\ninvest more into the relationship. However, it is extremely difficult to\r\nprecisely define the notion of a fair convention.\r\n\r\n         One approach is to study the evolution of coventions in an\r\nexplicit bargaining problem where individuals have to decide how to divide\r\nthe gains from trade. The current literature has shown that the 50/50\r\nsplit is a stable convention in a variety of situations. That rule however\r\ndoes not reward individuals who may contribute more to a relationship, a\r\npoint that Grossman and Hart argue may explain why ownership is structured\r\nto make one party a residual claimant to the profits of a firm. What has\r\nnot been studied, and is the object of the current project, is the\r\nevolution of bargaining conventions in the presence of relationship\r\nspecific investments.\r\n\r\n        We show that that the addition of relation specific investments\r\ncan result in social conventions that are very different from the 50/50\r\nsplit. Moreover, this research addresses an important open question raised\r\nby Henry Hansmann and Reinier Kraakman, namely why is it efficient for\r\nownership to be concentrated in the hands of a single individual or group.\r\nWe show that depending upon the information structure, both ownership and\r\nthe bargaining conventions evolve to a \"fair rule\" that encourages\r\nefficient relationship specific investments, and low levels of conflict.\r\nIn particular, we demonstrate that it depends crucially on\r\ncomplementarities between the specific investments of the individuals\r\nwhether such fair and efficient conventions are developed.\r\n\r\n        This work is theoretical and uses an abstract framework that might\r\nnot be directly applicable in its current form. However, it does study the\r\nconditions that give rise to norms which encourage efficient behavior in a\r\ndecentralized, anonymous economy.  Understanding the structure of\r\nefficient social norms may also have implications for the efficient\r\nrunning of exchange mediated through the internet. Elucidating the type of\r\ninformation needed to ensure efficient exchange in these cases may help us\r\nbetter understand the rules that need to be used in \"New Economy\" to\r\nensure its continued success and growth.",
