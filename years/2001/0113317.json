Our pedagogical hypothesis is that students learn best when continually challenged in a diverse environment. Matching students with appropriate learning partners and curricular material can be done with today's Internet technology and peer to peer software. Existing technologies from  machine learning and game theory - specifically those related to mediocrity as an equilibrium phenomenon in self organizing systems - will be implemented as practical technologies that can adapt automatically as students learn. The technology is based on simple techniques to bring humans together to learn, rather than domain-intensive knowledge-based tutoring of a single human, and can work with the existing technology infrastructure of most public schools. Internet multi-player gaming environments have been proven to scale to millions of users, as well as having high intrinsic motivation. The research incorporates  fundamental research in Information Technology, sound experimental research on motivation in multi-player games, and a novel and scaleable distributed community for learning.\r\n",
