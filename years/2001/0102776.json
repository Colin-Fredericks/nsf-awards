My proposal focuses on the problem of \r\nconstructing manifolds of positive and nonnegative curvature. \r\nIn it, I outline my plans to \r\n(a) find counterexammples to the Uniform Pinching Conjecture \r\namong the 3-sphere bundles over the 4-sphere,\r\n(b) study two sided Cheeger perturbations of the metrics on \r\nbiquotients and homogeneous spaces\r\n(c) search for nonnegative and positive curvature on certain \r\nhomotopy 5 and 6 dimensional real projective spaces. \r\n(d) construct nonnegative curvature on ``double soul manifolds'',\r\n(e) study a rigid version of the ``double soul problem'', and\r\n(f) prove my conjecture---that the dimension of the image of a \r\nRiemannian submersion of a complete, positively curved manifold \r\nis strictly greater than half the dimension of the domain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese problems all address the general question of how does \r\nthe curvature of a space effect its geometry and topology? \r\nRoughly speaking, curvature is what determines the trigonometry \r\nof a space. For example one can prove that the surface of the \r\nearth is curved with out looking at it from outer space. To do \r\nthis have two people start at the north pole and travel in any \r\ntwo directions that are perpendicular to each other. If they \r\ntravel at the same speed, they will eventually meet again at the \r\nsouth pole.  On the other hand, if the same experiment were \r\nconducted on a flat world, the two people would never meet. They \r\nwould keep getting further apart, even if they never reached the \r\n\"edge\" of the world.  The main justification for studying this \r\ngeneral question is that it seems intrinsically beautiful, \r\nintriguing, and natural. It has a long history, that dates back to \r\nthe 1930's work of H. Hopf, Morse, Schoenberg, Meyers, and Synge. \r\n",
