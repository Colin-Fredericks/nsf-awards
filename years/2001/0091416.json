 "awd_abstract_narration": "What is the likely price of the Dow next year?  How long can the \r\npatient expect to live?  How many lives are likely to be lost in a \r\nlooming military campaign?  Questions such as these confront decision \r\nmakers every day.  The proposed research seeks to understand, and \r\nultimately improve, the precise psychological processes by which such \r\njudgments are made.  Often such judgments are made by adjusting from \r\nsome initial starting point.  The Dow is at 10,500 right now, so one \r\nmight estimate it will be at 11,000 next year.  The last patient with \r\nthe same symptoms lived for 6 months, so one might estimate a \r\nsurvival time of one year.  Psychologists, economists, and marketing \r\nscholars have investigated such \"anchoring and adjustment\" processes \r\nduring the past twenty-five years and have found that a person's \r\nultimate judgment tends to be too close to the initial value-i.e., \r\nthe initial value serves as an \"anchor\" that biases the ultimate \r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe present research seeks to build on existing knowledge of \r\nanchoring and adjustment processes by pointing out (with empirical \r\njustification) an important misunderstanding in the current \r\nliterature.  The proposed experiments are designed to show that the \r\npsychological processes invoked by real-world problems like those \r\nabove are quite different from those invoked in the standard \r\nparadigms used to investigate anchoring and adjustment.  Real-world \r\nproblems like those above involve explicit adjustment from the \r\ninitial value; the standard anchoring paradigm involves simple \r\npriming of anchor-consistent information.  By directing the field to \r\nthe true source of anchoring effects in real-world contexts, the \r\nproposed research promises to point the way to strategies that can be \r\nused to improve the accuracy of important real-world forecasts.\r\n",
