 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gross\r\n0110920\r\n     The investigators develop methods to carry out spatially\r\nexplicit control to link natural and anthropogenic forces that\r\ninfluence the demand for biological resources with the dynamics\r\nof those resources.  While there have been numerous alternative\r\napproaches taken to add spatial components to population models,\r\nfew of these have attempted to deal with spatial control.  The\r\ninvestigators evaluate extensions of optimal control methods for\r\ndynamical systems to spatial problems, with a focus on general\r\nmathematical and computational issues for spatial control linked\r\nwith abiotic forcing of populations.  The effort is motivated by\r\ntwo specific examples.  The first concerns black bears in the\r\nsouthern Appalachians, a population with explicit environmental\r\nforcing associated with acorn mast production, which varies\r\nconsiderably in time and space.  This interacts with hunting,\r\nwhich is spatially restricted.  The second example involves an\r\ninvasive exotic plant species, Lygodium microphyllum (Old World\r\nClimbing Fern), in the Everglades of South Florida.  This species\r\ncan completely cover the native tree islands of the region and\r\nspatial control of hydrology may be applied to limit its growth.\r\n     Many of the current problems in regional management involve\r\nissues of spatial control -- what to do, where to do it and for\r\nwhat time periods.  Examples include alternative plans for land\r\nuse, forest harvesting, location of dams, and water control.  A\r\nwide variety of the major environmental public policy issues in\r\nthe US require scientific assessments of the impacts of\r\nalternative management.  The investigators develop new\r\nmathematical and computational approaches that can aid managers\r\nand the public to compare alternative management plans of land\r\nand regional resources.  The objective also is to allow for\r\ncomparisons of alternative criteria, arising from different\r\nstakeholders, to judge the public utility of different spatial\r\nmanagement plans.  The project is supported by the Applied\r\nMathematics, Computational Mathematics, and Population Biology\r\nprograms and by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\n",
