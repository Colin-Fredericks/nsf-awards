 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Hendrickson of the University of California, San Diego is supported by the  Inorganic Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program in continued research on lattice dynamics and bistability of electronically labile complexes. The main focus of the research is on polynuclear Mn, Fe, V, and Ni complexes that function as single molecule magnets (SMMs). Valence tautomers of cobalt complexes will also be investigated. In SMMs, magnetism does not arise from interactions between molecules but from the circumstance that each individual molecule has a high-spin ground state with negative magnetoanisometry. The major goals of the research are: 1) to identify SMMs that operate at higher temperatures, 2) investigate the mechanism of resonant magnetism tunneling, 3) clarify the influence of the magnitude of  ground state spin, 4) elucidate the influence of isomerism of duodecamanganese complexes, 5) investigate the influence of magnetic counterions, 6) prepare half-integer ground state SMMs, 7) discover ways to orient SMMs on a surface. An additional goal is to determine whether  interconversion of semiquinone complexes of cobalt involve quantum mechanical tunneling. During the period of this grant, collaborations will be established in order to design and fabricate useful microelectronic devices. \r\n\r\nSingle molecule magnets (SMMs) are molecular nanomagnets. SMMs are widely recognized as having great potential in the development of devices useful in ultra-micro electronics.  This field is being actively investigated in Japan and Europe. Research produced by this group under prior NSF support has set a high standard of quality and productivity. This laboratory is ranked as the world's premier center of  research and education in magnetochemistry. The science has progressed to the point that development of specific useful devices seems feasible. \r\n",
