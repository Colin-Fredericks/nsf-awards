 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe research aspect of this CAREER proposal focuses on a novel and\r\nfundamental approach for fabricating and engineering tunable band gap and lattice\r\nconstant multi-component semiconductor substrates for optoelectronic, photonic, high\r\nspeed electronic, spintronic, micro-electro-mechanical systems and photovoltaic\r\napplications. The proposed substrate engineering technology is based upon several\r\nadvanced concepts recently developed in the areas of ternary and quaternary bulk crystal\r\ngrowth from melts, thermodynamic modeling of multi-component alloys, and interfacial\r\ndefect generation by the principal investigator. As a part of this career award, a new\r\nSubstrate Engineering Reactor will be designed and installed for compatible multi-component\r\nsubstrate growth and hetero-epitaxy. Multi-component engineered substrates\r\nof III-V compounds and related device structures will be fabricated by employing the\r\nnew fundamental approach.\r\nThe integration of the proposed research with undergraduate and graduate\r\neducation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will include: (a) development of new\r\nintroductory level interdisciplinary course for undergraduates in the area of compound\r\nsemiconductor materials and device structures with specific focus towards\r\nmicroelectronics, optoelectronics, and spintronics, (b) development of a graduate level\r\ncourse on emerging materials and high performance device technologies, (c) research\r\nopportunities for at least two doctoral students and several undergraduate and master's\r\nstudents in the areas of substrate engineering and device fabrication on multi-component\r\nalloys with specific focus towards new device architectures. The introduction of the\r\nabove topics into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum is in synergy with\r\nRensselaer's educational plans and will enable and enhance student's exposure to rapidly\r\ngrowing modern and future semiconductor technologies.",
