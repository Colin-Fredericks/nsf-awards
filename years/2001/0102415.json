 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award will fund research focused on studies of the in-plane and out-of-plane normal-state electrical conduction of high quality single crystals of selected copper-oxide superconductors and layered manganites.  The emphasis of the experimental project on the cuprates will be on the transformation of their normal-state conduction across the phase diagram which includes insulating, under-doped, and over-doped regimes.  The electrical transport and magnetization data obtained will be analyzed for information about conduction mechanisms.  Layered manganites have a rich phase diagram which includes several phase transitions.  These thermodynamic phase transitions have a strong effect on the charge transport.  The emphasis of the manganite research will be on the effect of thermodynamic phase transitions on the electrical conduction.  The  research is expected to significantly enhance our fundamental understanding of the electrical behaviors of cuprates and manganites.  More broadly, the results from this basic investigation may provide insight into appropriate doping schemes to facilitate applications of cuprates and manganites for electronic sensors and devices such as magnetic field sensors or even computer logic devices.  This highly interdisciplinary project will contribute to the education and training of doctoral and undergraduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers at the institutions which are part of the collaboration.  The diversity of expertise gained by the participants in this research program is a substantial advantage in today's knowledge based, technology driven economy, being beneficial to a future career in industry, government, or academia.\r\n%%%\r\nThis individual investigator award will fund an experimental research project to study the unusual electrical properties of high temperature superconductors and layered manganites.  The high temperature superconductors, even in the normal state, conduct electricity in ways that are very different from typical electrical conductors such as copper and silicon.  Also, the conduction of electricity in manganites is strongly affected by thermodynamic phase transitions.  The proposed research is expected to significantly enhance our fundamental understanding of the electrical behaviors of cuprates and manganites.  Clarifying these novel electrical behaviors may contribute to eventual applications of these materials for electronic sensors and devices such as magnetic field sensors or even computer logic devices.  This project offers excellent research and education opportunities for graduate students within an interdisciplinary program.  It involves minority-group graduate students who pursue thesis research and receive excellent training beneficial to a future career in industry, government, or academia.   \r\n***\r\n",
