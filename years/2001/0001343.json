The main thrust is the application of advanced mathematical tools in the area of power system component and load modeling.  The project spans five researchers at three universities; two universities are in Mexico and one in the United States.  The emphasis is on the condensation and processing of time series recorded electrical system measurements for power system load and component models. A goal of the work is the enhancement of model accuracy.  The use of these models in a deregulated environment is proposed to manage power system operating risk while maximizing operating revenues.  Of course, accurate models are also needed in the mainstream operation of power systems, regulated or deregulated, for such tasks as stability studies, reliability analysis, system loading, and control of power flow.  The main methods to be studied are: symbolic analysis, blended models, data mining, and risk management.  Because the level of mathematical models is complex, part of the project is to prepare these methods in a form suitable for visualization by power system operators.\r\n\r\nThe project contains an educational component which includes a research experience for undergraduates, development of a web site on electrical load and component modeling, and a workshop/meeting for researchers and students from both Mexico and the USA.  The intent of the website is to acquaint students and practicing engineers alike on the capabilities of advanced modeling techniques.  In the case of power engineering students, the goal is to attract highly qualified persons to the field.  In the case of practicing engineers, the PI would like to provide to them tools so that they can utilize the data at their disposal.\r\n",
