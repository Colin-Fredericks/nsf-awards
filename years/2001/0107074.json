 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chanka Archaeology Project under the direction of Dr. Brian Bauer is dedicated to documenting and interpreting the development of \r\ncomplex societies in the Andahuaylas region of the Peruvian Andes from AD 500 \r\nto AD 1532.  The Chanka who once lived in the region are of special interest \r\nto archaeologists and historians since they once rivaled and fought against \r\nthe Inca State for control of the central Andes.\r\n\r\nThe topic of early state development is a major theoretical issue of current \r\nanthropological research. The Chanka have been excluded from these discussions \r\nsince very little original archeological research has been conducted in their \r\ncore region. What theories have been presented concerning the development of \r\nthe Chanka are largely derived from readings of the Spanish chronicles.  Until \r\nthese models are tested against archaeological data they will remain \r\nhypothetical and untested and the study of the pre-Hispanic social \r\norganization of the Chanka can not advance.\r\n\r\nThe project, which will run for three field seasons, includes a systematic \r\narchaeological survey of the Chanka heartland and an extensive review of \r\narchival materials located in Peru and Spain.  The survey will cover an area \r\nof approximately 200 square kilometers and provide a comprehensive data base \r\non the location, size and age of archaeological sites in the Andahuaylas \r\nValley.  The results of the survey will be used to address a series of \r\nquestions concerning the development of complex societies in the region.  For \r\nexample: What effect did the conquest of the region by the Wari Empire (AD \r\n550-1000) have on the indigenous populations?, Is there evidence of early \r\nstate development in the valley during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000 - \r\n1400)? and, What was the social organization of the Andahuaylas area during \r\nthe period of Inca rule?\r\n\r\nThe archival research will take place in Cuzco, Andahuaylas, and Lima (Peru) \r\nas well as in Seville (Spain).  The historical research will support, \r\ncomplement, and extend the archaeological field work by providing concise data \r\non specific sites and by procuring additional information on the land \r\nholdings, populations, and social organization of Chanka kin groups.\r\n\r\nIn sum, the Chanka Archaeological Project will provide a regional context to \r\nstudy the development of the Chanka and it will enable scholars to address \r\nquestions concerning the development of Chanka society before and after Inca \r\nexpansionism.  The project will also enable researchers to make comparisons \r\nbetween the development of the Chanka and that of other important groups, both \r\nin the Andes and elsewhere in the ancient New World.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
