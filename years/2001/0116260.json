 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program to City University of New York-Staten Island is for the acquisition of an X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) system to carry out basic surface chemical analysis in support of innovative surface and interfacial research efforts. The research topics supported include: nanotribology; development of surface chemical sensors; surface bound photonic devices; studies of molecular interactions at interfaces, growth of II-VI wide bandgap materials and basic surface functionaliztion.  XPS is a highly sensitive surface analytical tool that allows for the details of surface chemical composition and local chemical environment (such as oxidation state and to some extent molecular connectivity) to be evaluated for a variety of materials. The sensitivity of this technique provides information on chemical concentrations at the surface for routinely of fraction of monolayers of a material adsorbed on a surface. This instrumentation will also support a large number of educational activities both at The College of Staten Island and within CUNY. This includes annual use in an Instrumental Methods in Chemistry Course (taught by the PI), undergraduate research activities in The College of Staten Island's NSF supported REU program on Polymers and Biopolymers, graduate education and training in our NSF supported IGERT program on Nanostructural Materials and Devices, and as part of a 1 semester laboratory rotation course in our newly formed Ph.D. program in Nanotechnology and Materials Chemistry. The instrumentation will have wide usage and improve the overall research and educational capabilities of the participating faculty as well as the institution.\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program to City University of New York-Staten Island is for the acquisition of an X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) system to carry out basic surface chemical analysis in support of innovative surface and interfacial research efforts.
