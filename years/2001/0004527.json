 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a planning grant to Timothy Ferris to develop a PBS documentary film about amateur astronomy and stargazing.  The film will bring viewers into direct contact with the night sky, introducing them to the constellations and showing how even a small telescope can open a window onto the cosmos.\r\n\r\nFerris has previously produced two highly regarded science documentaries, \"The Creation of the Universe\" and \"Life Beyond Earth.\"  The director for the \"Seeing In the Dark\" program will be Thomas Levenson who most recently served as producer/director/writer for the \"Dome\" program in Building Big.  Andrew Fraknoi, Chair of the Astronomy Department at Foothill College and Educational consultant for the Astronomical Society of the Pacific will be the Science and Outreach Consultant for the project. \r\n\r\nActivities during the planning stage include:\r\n\r\nDeveloping preliminary storyboarding, determining locations and people to appear in the film and working out special effects sequences\r\nAcquiring and digitizing images for use in the film\r\nPlanning educational and public outreach efforts\r\nIdentifying and consulting with potential creative contributors to the film\r\nShooting and editing a test night scene at a \"star party\" to establish which techniques can produce the best results in these conditions.\r\n\r\n",
