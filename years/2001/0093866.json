 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Vladimir Bulovic recently demonstrated a new general method for tuning the\r\nenergy level structure of organic materials by adjusting the strength of the local electric\r\nfield inside the organic films with intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. His group\r\nwill now apply this \"solid state solvation\" (SSS) effect to demonstrate practical, efficient\r\norganic optoelectonic devices such as organic LEDs, lasers, and solar cells, and develop a\r\ntheoretical understanding of this phenomenon. The SSS effect is present in every\r\nmolecular organic solid, but is most clearly observed in strongly polar materials and\r\ncomposites. It originates from dipole-dipole interactions between neighboring molecules\r\nthat generate strong local electric fields, stretching the intramolecular bond lengths and\r\ndeforming charge distributions on molecules. This physical change in the molecular\r\nstructure is manifested in the modified energy level structure for the molecule, which we\r\ncan utilize to optimize performance of organic optoelectronic devices.\r\n\r\nProf. Bulovic previously demonstrated that local electric fields generated in dipole-dipole\r\ninteractions between polar organic molecules in a solid thin film can result in a shift of\r\nmolecular energy levels by more than 0.25 eV, tuning the luminescence of the same\r\nmolecular species from yellow to orange to red. In this program his group will extend the\r\ninitial studies and utilize dipole-dipole interactions to tune the carrier injection properties\r\nat organic heterojunction interfaces, modify exciton energy transfer rates from the host to\r\nthe dopant in mixed organic layers, and access triplet energy levels in efficient\r\nphosphorescent organic materials. These effects will be optimized to improve\r\nluminescence efficiencies of organic LEDs, lower lasing thresholds of organic lasers, and\r\nincrease photogeneration efficiency of organic solar cells. The theoretical framework\r\nquantifying intermolecular interactions in molecular organic thin films is not presently\r\nknown and will be developed within this program.\r\n\r\nFindings discovered in the course of this program are fundamental in nature and will have\r\na strong impact on practical applications of molecular organic solids in optoelectronic\r\ndevices. They will enhance the understanding and the applicability of the vast field of\r\nmolecular organic materials, influencing treatment of organic thin films, heterojunctions,\r\nmultilayers, quantum wells, and nano-patterned organic materials. These findings will be\r\nincorporated in the graduate \"Seminar on Organic Optoelectronics\" that Prof. Vulovic is\r\npresently preparing for the MIT graduate curriculum.\r\n",
