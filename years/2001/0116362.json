 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program to Montana State University is for instrument development of a movable magnetic films-growth facility designed to be connected to an X-ray synchrotron beamline for advanced in-situ characterization of as grown magnetic multilayers. The growth facility will have both chemical vapor deposition capability that will grow superior performance magnetic semiconductors and half-metallic ferromagnets (HMF) and a thermal deposition capability for growth of single-element magnetic films. It will also be available for use by other researchers through research collaboration with the PI. This project will provide a powerful means for understanding, quantify and control interfacial behavior for the creation and study of established and new phenomena that potentially have tremendous impact on the explosive growth of spintronics. This instrument development project will help train graduate students and postdocs in instrument science and forefront research.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program to Montana State University is for instrument development of a movable magnetic films-growth facility designed to be connected to an X-ray synchrotron beamline for advanced in-situ characterization of as grown magnetic multilayers.
