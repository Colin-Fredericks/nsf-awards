 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary group of four physicists and four chemists have common research interests in molecular magnetism, new materials synthesis, and nanotechnology, and in several cases, formal interdisciplinary collaborations exist.  A variety of new magnetic systems and nanodevices are prepared, and they are presently characterized by magnetotransport, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), near-field microscopy (NFM), and other spectroscopies including infrared, ultraviolet/visible, and Raman techniques. This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will allow the University of Florida to enhance its characterization capability with the acquisition of a modern magnetometer, a Quantum Design MPMS 7 Tesla SQUID magnetometer.  The new instrument will have significant impact on a number of researchers at the University of Florida with activities related to magnetic phenomena.  In addition, this new instrument will serve as an important interdisciplinary educational and training tool for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who will operate the equipment.  Finally, the University of Florida has committed funding which represents 30% of the total cost of the instrument.\r\n\r\nAn interdisciplinary group of four physicists and four chemists have common research interests in molecular magnetism, new materials synthesis, and nanotechnology, and in several cases, formal interdisciplinary collaborations exist.
