It will improve the quality of research by providing access to a research instrument, which is currently unavailable. It will greatly expand the research capabilities in three research all from different departments. The instrument will be used to study domain dynamics in ferroelectric materials, which have applications to the electronics industry, including \"smart cards\" (physics), environmentally mediated oxidative stress in plants, which is important in evaluating ecological impact on plants (biology), and binuclear transition metal complexes, which has applications in computer memory (chemistry). The research projects would result in scientific publications, and presentations, but perhaps the most important result will be students that are motivated and capable of doing research. This project would help CSUSB add to its reputation of combining research with a strong commitment to undergraduate education, particularly for first generation and students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program California State University-San Bernandino Foundation will acquire an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer for scientific research in physics, chemistry and biology at a Hispanic serving, predominately, undergraduate institute.
