Hain\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to better understand the \r\nstructure of mapping class groups and then to apply this \r\nknowledge to the problem of understanding motives over \r\nthe spectrum of the integers. The Principal Investigator \r\nhopes to compute the stable highest weight decomposition \r\nof the graded quotients of the lower central series of \r\nthe Torelli groups (tensored with the reals) as modules \r\nover the real symplectic group of rank g. This should be \r\nof interest to those studying 3-manifold invariants. The \r\nPrincipal Investigator plans to use his knowledge of this\r\nstable decomposition to study the image of the Galois group \r\nof the rational numbers on appropriate completions of mapping \r\nclass groups. In particular, he (in joint work with Makoto \r\nMatsumoto) hopes to be able to characterize the Zariski \r\nclosure of the image of the Galois group in the group of \r\nouter automorphisms of the relative unipotent completion \r\nof mapping class groups of large genus. This should lead \r\nto improved understanding of the connections between Hodge \r\nTheory and Galois Theory; in particular, to improved \r\nunderstanding of the role of mixed zeta numbers in Galois theory.\r\nThe Principal Investigator also plans to study the \r\npseudoconvexity of the moduli spaces of curves. \r\nLooijenga has conjectured that there is a proper,\r\nnon-negative, (g-2)-pseudoconvex real-valued function \r\ndefined on the moduli space of genus g curves. Hain, in \r\njoint work with Looijenga, hopes to prove that the function \r\nthat he constructed with David Reed several years ago is \r\nsuch a function. This result would lead to new vanishing\r\nresults for coherent cohomology of moduli spaces of curves \r\nas well as unified proofs of several results of Diaz and \r\nHarer on the topology of these moduli spaces.\r\n\r\nTopology is the study of those geometrical properties \r\nof surfaces and their generalizations that remain unchanged \r\nunder stretching (short of tearing) and other continuous \r\ndeformations. Geometry is the study of those properties \r\nof surfaces and their generalizations that preserve geometric\r\nproperties such as distances and/or angles. There is a profound connection between the topological symmetries of a surface\r\n(called the mapping class group of the surface), the geometry \r\nof all of the different ways of measuring angles on such a \r\nsurface (the moduli space of conformal structures on the surface)  \r\nand the arithmetical properties of the surface when viewed as \r\nthe graph of a polynomial. Questions about mapping class\r\ngroups and moduli spaces of conformal structures on surfaces \r\narise in many areas of mathematics (such as the study of numbers, \r\nand algebraic geometry), and have applications to particle \r\nphysics through string theory and conformal field theory. There \r\nare also potential significant applications to cryptography. The \r\ngoal of this proposal is to further explore and understand the intricate and deep connections between these topological, \r\ngeometrical and arithmetical aspects of surface theory,\r\nespecially those aspects with connections to number theory.\r\n",
