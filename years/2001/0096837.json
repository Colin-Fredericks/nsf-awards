 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Mark Wightman of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for his research on microvoltammetric electrodes.  The project entails numerous applications of microvoltammetry utilizing electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL).  ECL of molecules used in organic LEDs will be studied to develop an understanding of the mechanisms of light production from recombinant processes, and to investigate the role of inorganic and organic dopants in these processes.  Stochastic approaches will be used to gain insight into ECL mechanisms in aqueous solution.  The ECL reaction between tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) and tripropylamine will be studied and then augmented with studies of reactions between the ruthenium species and amino acids.  ECL at microelectrodes will be used as a source for near-field optical microscopy imaging.  The PI will fabricate thin layer cells to produce very bright ECL light sources.  In addition, ECL will be used in detection schemes for chemical analysis. \r\n\r\nLight emitted when current is run through an electrode offers many possible applications in analytical chemistry.  The funded work will explore the mechanism of light production and many potential uses of this light in detection of species in solution and in biological tissue and other matrices.  Applications in biology and materials science are likely to result.\r\n\r\n",
