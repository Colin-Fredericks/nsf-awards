 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nPolitical ecology is an approach that looks at human-environmental interactions as they are influenced by and in turn affect local political processes. This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist from the University of Minnesota will study development and political ecology in two villages in Papua New Guinea.  One village is engaged in ecotourism and conservation while the other is involved with a commercial gold mining corporation.  Using ethnographic and archival research methods the student will determine the impact of difference resource strategies on land concentration and social stratification; will study the relation between community identity, values and competing economic processes; and the relation between specific resource regimes and community political activity.  Hypotheses will be tested relating levels of compensation and inequality, empowerment, and cultural control of resources. By comparing two culturally similar villages the research will assess the effects of these difference paths to development on the local social systems.  This will extend our understanding of how global systems of resource management are engaged locally, and how communities differentiate themselves.  The project will add to our knowledge of this important region of the world, and will help train a young social scientist. \r\n",
