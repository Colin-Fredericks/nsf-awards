 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing, implementing, and evaluating a model that uses a non-traditional approach to the recruitment of women and minorities into advanced technical careers, particularly in the information technology (IT) field. The model features not just recruitment, but academic advising, career exploration and support services. Over 800 students are being served by the program. \r\n\r\nProject objectives are:\r\n\r\n1: Introducing and exposing women and minorities in a five county area of Portland to education and employment opportunities in advanced technical fields in which they are underrepresented. Key outcomes include increased awareness by women and minorities about advanced technical careers and programs and identification of potential project participants.\r\n\r\n2. Facilitating enrollment and success of educationally and/or economically disadvantaged women and minorities in advanced technical education programs. Key outcomes include increased enrollment by women and minorities into advanced technical programs; increased retention and improved academic performance in technical programs such as Computer Information Systems, Welding Technology, Advanced Facilities Maintenance, Computer Sciences, Microelectronics, and Engineering Technology; and enhanced educational opportunities in specialized fields.\r\n\r\n3: Facilitating school-to-work transitions in Information Technology (IT) and other advanced technical fields. Key outcomes include women and minorities employed in higher paying jobs and a 20% increase in the number of women and minorities who are participating in cooperative education with an industry partner in targeted science and technology fields.\r\n\r\n4. Training instructors, tutors, career counselors, and academic advisors in gender and culturally equitable teaching, learning, assessment, and advising practices. Key outcomes include improved instruction, career counseling and academic advising delivered with more equity.\r\n\r\n5. Involving IT and other employers in recruitment, retention, and school-to-work transition activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
