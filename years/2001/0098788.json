 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is devoted to dynamical systems of physical origin, \r\nincluding Lorentz gases (both in equilibrium and under external \r\nforces), hard ball systems, billiards, ideal gases with a massive \r\ntest particle, and open Hamiltonian systems. Most of these are \r\nknown (or expected) to have chaotic behavior. Due to recent works \r\nof D. Dolgopyat, D. Ruelle, Ya. Sinai, L.-S. Young and others, \r\nmathematical tools in the theory of hyperbolic and chaotic \r\ndynamical systems appear to be developed far enough to attack many \r\nopen problems that have been so far only studied heuristically or \r\nnumerically by physicists, if at all. In particular, we plan to \r\ninvestigate the nature of nonequilibrium steady states by means of \r\nSinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures, time correlation functions that \r\nappear in transport laws and diffusion equations, open Hamiltonian \r\nsystems that admit conditionally invariant  measures, the motion \r\nof a massive particle in an ideal gas by using an appropriate \r\nspace-time limit, etc. In each case we aim at obtaining exact \r\nresults and providing solid rigorous proofs. \r\n\r\nThe general goal of the project is to conduct mathematical studies \r\nof facts and phenomena that have attracted attention in physical \r\ncommunity and have applications outside of mathematics. In \r\nparticular, the results would contribute to the mathematical \r\nfoundation of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics and could \r\nstrengthen the link between the theory of dynamical systems and \r\nphysics and other sciences. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
