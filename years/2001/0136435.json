It can also be used alone for applications such as those of a pathophysiological nature (functional and soft tissue imaging); a unique advantage since it is provided by a totally non-invasive, non-ionizing, and low-cost procedure. The concept of thermal imaging in medicine toady is being evolved with the use of the advanced infrared imaging technology.  It is now being merged with \"smart algorithms\" and image processing for the effective interpretation of medical images and the building of new bridges between computer science, engineering, and medicine.  To this end, an IEEE EMBS Infrared Imaging Workshop is being held. Experts in infrared sensors technology, infrared image analysis and image interpretation are giving presentation and discussing various uses of infrared imaging in medicine in a hope to further the state-of-the-art.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
