 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the preparation, properties and chemistry of dehydrobenzannulenes.  These molecules are related to such substances as buckminsterfullerenes in having an almost all-carbon composition.  Unlike fullerenes, dehydrobenzannulenes can vary in structure quite radically and rationally designed structures are accessible by total synthesis.  The aim of this research project is to prepare and study dehydrobenzannulenes with novel shapes in order to answer fundamental scientific questions as well as to explore the materials propertied of the resultant macromolecules.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support for the research and educational activities of Professor Michael M. Haley of the University of Oregon, Eugene.  Professor Haley's research explores the preparation and properties of macromolecular, carbon-rich dehydrobenzannulenes.  These novel macromolecules can be as large as several nanometers in diameter and offer the prospect of novel properties including, but not limted to nonlinear optical properties.  In addition to his work with doctoral and postdoctoral scientists, Professor Haley also includes undergraduate students of chemistry in his research programs.",
