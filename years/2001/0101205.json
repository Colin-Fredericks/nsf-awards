 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns several related problems in quantum information\r\ntheory, all arising from the study of noisy quantum channels. The first\r\nproblem is to prove additivity of minimal entropy and multiplicativity of\r\nthe maximal trace norms for a unital qubit channel. This result would imply\r\nadditivity of the Holevo capacity for such channels, thereby settling one\r\nparticular case of a longstanding conjecture. The second problem is to\r\ninvestigate a conjectured equality between the Shannon capacity of a noisy\r\nquantum channel and a new quantity which was introduced in earlier work of\r\nthe P.I.. The third problem involves a study of one special class of\r\nnon-product measurements for product channels, with the goal of providing\r\nan interesting laboratory for testing ideas about entangled measurements.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvances in nanotechnology have provided the opportunity for scientists to\r\nstudy and manipulate the quantum properties of microscopic systems,\r\nincluding single-atom systems and single-photon states. Recent theoretical\r\ndiscoveries indicate that such systems may have extraordinary properties. One example\r\nis the quantum computer, which is a theoretical device capable of\r\noutperforming any standard computer. Another example is a protocol for\r\nunconditionally secure encryption, which would be achieved by encoding\r\nmessages as quantum states. Mathematics played a key role in the\r\ndevelopment of both of these ideas. The current proposal concerns a similar\r\nmathematical investigation of quantum devices which would be used to\r\ntransmit and store information. A fundamental problem is to determine the\r\ninformation capacity of such a system, and thereby find the quantum analog\r\nof Shannon's famous expression for the capacity of a noisy channel. The\r\nP.I. describes a strategy for determining this capacity in an important\r\nspecial case, namely a memoryless channel where \"qubits\" are used to encode\r\nthe information. The method of solution would involve some new mathematical\r\nideas which may have applications to other areas of quantum information\r\ntheory.\r\n",
