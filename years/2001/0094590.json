 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this program is to facilitate graduation in computer science and mathematics for low- income persons, in particular, students from underrepresented groups and persons with disabilities. Recruitment targets students from two distinct populations, transfer students from community colleges who plan to attend the institution as juniors and currently enrolled students entering their junior or senior year at the college. A collaborate actively is planned with the community colleges in the state to recruit eligible computer science students to participate in the program. The program provides a challenging opportunity with high expectations where designated faculty members will work as faculty mentors monitoring academic progress and supervising research projects or internships. It also provides an enriched course environment in which students have an opportunity to deal with problems they encounter with the material and with the hands-on projects. Each student is assigned a peer mentor in his/ her own field. The program features an internship experience in which the student integrates material from the classroom with learning from the real world. In addition, this prepares students for transitioning to the workplace environment, and provides realistic expectations on work for the student. \r\n",
