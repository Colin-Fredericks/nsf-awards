 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001. The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"\"Functional aspects of Dbl homology proteins as molecular switches in cell signaling.\"  Communication within a cell is vital for the maintenance of normal cellular function.  Studies being conducted are aimed at deciphering the basic molecular aspects of function and regulation of a Dbl homology protein, a vital component in cellular signaling.  These studies are aimed at determining the general mechanism of function using structural, biochemical and cell-based approaches.  \r\n",
