 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed support for the Mouse Mutant Stocks Center (MMSC) at The Jackson Laboratory (TJL).  For many years, the laboratory mouse (Mus musculus) has been the principal model organism used for experimental genetic studies of vertebrate animals. The MMSC maintains and distributes mutant stocks of Mus musculus and several other species of Mus to the scientific community, and also discovers and characterizes new spontaneous mouse mutations of potential interest to the scientific community. The collection currently contains 109 stocks and inbred strains carrying 125 spontaneous mutations on defined genetic backgrounds, 18 inbred specialty strains derived from wild populations, and 13 inbred strains and F1 hybrids.  Mutant strains are bred in sufficient number to meet the demand for their use in research; in addition, all strains are preserved as frozen embryos and as genomic DNA.  As part of its discovery program, the MMSC identifies new spontaneous mutations arising in the large TJL breeding colonies; because of their size, these colonies provide a rich source of new mutations. Mutations are initially identified by their effect on appearance or behavior.  Further characterization includes assessment of the mutation's inheritance pattern and chromosomal location, as well as its potential value for basic research as judged by genotypic and phenotypic properties. \r\n The MMSC provides information about established and newly developed mutants through the Laboratory's catalog, special newsletters and Web site. Researchers who request one or more stocks of mutant mice from the MMSC are charged a modest fee based in part on the difficulty and expense of maintaining the particular lines requested.  \r\n",
