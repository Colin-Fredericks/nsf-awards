 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0104006\r\nJohn J. Millson\r\n\r\nMillson and his collaborators will explore the geometric \r\nproperties of configuration spaces of n-gon linkages in \r\nLie algebras, symmetric spaces, compact Lie groups and \r\nEuclidean buildings beginning with the question of deciding \r\nwhen these moduli spaces are nonempty (finding the generalized\r\ntriangle inequalities). In addition they will study the finer \r\nstructure of these moduli spaces. In particular, they will \r\nstudy commutative and noncommutative Hamiltonian systems of differential equations on these spaces and use the quantizations \r\nof these systems to obtain results about the representation \r\ntheory of compact Lie groups and of the Artin groups of Lie \r\ntype. Millson and B.Leeb have obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for the moduli spaces of n-gon linkages in Lie \r\nalgebras to be nonempty generalizing well-known results of \r\nKlyachko for sl(n,C). Millson, M.Kapovich and B.Leeb have \r\nfound necessary and sufficient conditions for the moduli \r\nspaces of n-gon linkages in Euclidean buildings and symmetric \r\nspaces to be nonempty. In some cases, Millson and \r\nH.Flaschka have constructed (commutative) integrable \r\nHamiltonian systems on these spaces but the flows are \r\nnot periodic. For applications to the representation \r\ntheory of compact Lie groups it is critical to find the \r\nassociated \"action variables,\" i.e. find Hamiltonians \r\nwith periodic flows which are functions of the original Poisson-commuting Hamiltonians. Millson and Toledano-Laredo \r\nhave constructed representations of Artin groups of Lie \r\ntype by quantizing certain noncommutative Hamiltonian systems. \r\nThey hope to construct the trigonometric analogues of their \r\nquantum systems. The results just mentioned may be found at http://www.math.umd.edu/~jjm.\r\n        \r\nMillson's work begins with one of the first theorems of \r\nhigh-school geometry - the theorem that if two triangles \r\nhave the same set of side lengths then they are congruent.  \r\nThe analogue for quadrilaterals is clearly false: one can \r\nchange a square into a rhombus without changing the side\r\nlengths. So one is led to try to parametrize the set of \r\nall planar n-gons with the same side lengths. From there \r\none is led to a favorite theme of nineteenth century \r\nmathematics, the study of planar linkages (systems of\r\nrods and hinges).  In the nineteenth century such a \r\nstudy was of immense practical significance - the problem \r\nwas to convert linear motion (of a piston rod) to circular \r\nmotion (turn a wheel) by a linkage. The problem was\r\nsolved by a French naval officer, Peaucellier.  It turns \r\nout that from the modern point of view the nineteenth \r\ncentury work is insufficiently precise.  Millson and \r\nKapovich have corrected the errors and written up a proof \r\nof a result (often attributed to Thurston) that, given \r\nany smooth manifold M, there is a planar linkage whose \r\nconfiguration space is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union \r\nof a number of copies of M.  This result will appear in\r\nthe journal \"Topology\".  The above work on planar linkages \r\nled to a study of n-gon linkages in space.  This theory is \r\nenormously richer, connecting with symplectic geometry, \r\nintegrable Hamiltonian systems and representation theory.\r\nThe analogous theory in spherical and hyperbolic three-space \r\nand their generalizations (compact Lie groups and the \r\nsymmetric spaces of their complexifications) appears to \r\nconnect up with some of the newest objects in geometry \r\nand algebra, for example Poisson Lie groups and \r\nquantum groups.\r\n\r\n",
