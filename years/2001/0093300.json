 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design and implementation of a national computing systems grid has become a\r\nreachable goal for both computer and computational scientists. In order to better use this\r\nsuite of resources, consisting of geographically disperse machines, instruments, and data\r\nstorage, better scheduling and resource management techniques are needed.\r\n\r\nThis project  concentrates on the issue of matching the requirements of an application\r\nto the capabilities of a resource or set of resources on the grid. This is often referred \r\nto as determining the affinity of an application for a resource. The research will formalize\r\nthe folklore currently used in order to increase the accessibility of the grid to those\r\napplication scientists that have less experience than current users. Work will\r\ncontinue in the development of  a language specification to describe both applications\r\nand resources as needed today, but with the extensibility needed for future applications as\r\nwell. This will then be used as an indexing structure into a case-based reasoning expert\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThis project also has an extended educational portion to it. As a part of the effort to\r\nexpand Northwestern's Computer Science education in the systems area and a cross-school\r\ninitiative, we plan to offer a course in experimental systems using ideas in parallel\r\ndistributed scheduling as the basis for a larger view into practical systems,\r\nexperimentation, and teamwork. This project-oriented class will be focused around\r\nteaching students about current parallel distributed scheduling efforts and applications.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a new seminar series will be started  featuring women researchers in\r\ncomputer science to help encourage female students to continue with careers in computer\r\nscience.",
