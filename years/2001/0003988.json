 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meat-sharing with close kin and unrelated adults is believed to be one of\r\nthe most significant dietary changes to occur in the course of human\r\nevolution. Despite its importance there is no consensus on when, why or how\r\nsharing emerged among ancestral hominids. The problem lies not only in our\r\ninability to confidently identify different sharing behaviors from the\r\narchaeological record, but the lack of a theoretical framework for\r\nunderstanding how and why sharing operates. With National Science Foundation\r\nsupport Dr. Karen Lupo and a team of researchers will conduct two seasons of\r\nethnoarchaeological research on meat-sharing among Bofi foragers. The Bofi\r\noccupy lush forested regions of the Ngotto Forest Reserve in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic and procure most of their food by hunting and gathering.\r\nThe research is guided by a larger theoretical context which views sharing\r\namong family and between unrelated adults as fulfilling very different\r\ngoals. Provisioning, or sharing among family members, enhances the\r\nsurvivability of close kin. But sharing with unrelated adults is aimed at\r\nenhancing a hunters social status. The theory predicts that hunters will\r\nvary their choice of prey depending upon their overall goal (provisioning or\r\nstatus enhancement). The research team will use direct observations,\r\ninformant interviews and animal bone collections from different hunters and\r\ntheir households to test salient aspects of this theory. These techniques\r\nwill allow the team to collect quantitative data on what hunters procure and\r\nhow much of it is shared and consumed by close family and unrelated adults.\r\nData collected with these techniques will be used to investigate the\r\nfollowing research questions: 1) Does meat-sharing vary predictably by prey type? If so, what\r\ncharacteristics predict which prey will be shared with family and unrelated\r\nadults? 2) Do hunters vary their pursuit effort of different types of prey depending\r\non their overall goal (provision family or enhance status)? 3) What is the material link between different sharing behaviors and the archaeological record?\r\n\r\nThe importance of this research is far-reaching. This project will be the\r\nfirst systematic and quantitative study of prey choice and meat-sharing ever\r\nconducted among contemporary foragers. This research will also examine and\r\nidentify the links between different sharing strategies, as reflected by\r\nanimal bones, and the material record. This latter point is particularly\r\nimportant for archaeological investigations. The project combines\r\nethnoarchaeological research with a theoretical framework that will help\r\nexplain how and why sharing operates in a contemporary setting. By\r\nextension, it will provide important new insights into the evolution of\r\nsharing among ancestral hominids. Finally, very little is known about the\r\nBofi foragers. Thus far, only one other study has ever been conducted in\r\nthis area. This research will expand current understanding of contemporary\r\nforager ecology.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
