Conventional interconnects rely on metal lines which produce increasingly unmanageable problems with speed and power dissipation.\r\nOptical interconnects provide a solution to these problems.  However, one key problem that needs to be solved is the lack of a suitable laser that is fully compatible with silicon microelectronic manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of achieving lasing in silicon will be investigated.  The conditions under which optical gain can be achieved in silicon nanocrystals will be established.  In particular, the nanocrystal size and surface passivation, especially with silicon-oxygen bonds, will be studied.  Then, an optically pumped laser will be designed and tested.  The demonstration of an optically pumped silicon laser is the main objective of this work.  Once the conditions required to achieve gain are established, the conditions under which electrical pumping will be examined.\r\n\r\nThe results of this work will be of interest to the scientific community, as a silicon laser is commonly thought to be impossible, and to technologists, as the explosion in information technology relies on continued progress in computing power.\r\n",
