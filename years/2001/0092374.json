 "awd_abstract_narration": "0092374  Margaret Werner-Washburne\r\nThis research project will examine gene expression as cells exit from stationary phase.  The dynamics of mRNA accumulation, including rates of mRNA turnover, will be determined using microarray analysis.  Data analysis will be carried out using the clustering and visualization program, VxInsight, to identify specific patterns of regulation. The relative abundance of selected transcripts will be confirmed by northern analysis.  To determine if genes induced during this process are essential for exit from stationary phase, strains carrying deletions of genes that are highly induced during stationary phase and reproliferation will be analyzed for growth-phase specific defects and other stress-related phenotypes.  This will be done by both microarray and more classical growth analyses of strains carrying deletions in genes whose mRNAs are most abundant during these processes.  This work will contribute to our understanding of microbial physiology at the genomic level and provide insights into the dynamics of quiescent cells.\r\n",
