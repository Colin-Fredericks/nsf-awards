In particular, the project's goal includes the design of a program of undergraduate study that embodies an interdisciplinary synthesis of the topics in computer science and biology required for graduates to successfully pursue careers in bioinformatics. The project also plans to implement, test, and refine the program of study so that it may be used as a prototype for similar curricula at universities nation-wide. Pedagogy foci are to design, integrate, and test approaches for teaching topics in bioinformatics while providing research experiences for all students in the program. The project is strengthened by the participation of a group of academic, government, and industry bioinformatics researchers and professionals who act as an advisory committee. The emerging science of bioinformatics seeks to develop computational algorithms and techniques for analyzing large biological databases in search of information that can be applied to specific problems in the life sciences. This project addresses the education of professionals with a background in this field and contributes to satisfying a nationally growing workforce need.\r\n",
