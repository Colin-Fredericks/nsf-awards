 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel and flexible, dry, physiological recording electrode that conforms to non-planar surfaces and does not require extensive surface preparation or conductive gels to achieve a low impedance interface with the body. This innovative electrode will be fabricated inexpensively using microfabrication techniques and priced competitively with existing commercial electrodes despite its enhanced performance and features. The proposed dry electrode will provide substantial improvement in all areas of biomedical research and medicine that involve use of electro- physiological potentials such as EEG, EMG, EOG, and ECG signals. This unique electrode is particularly well suited for long-term and multiple electrode physiological monitoring as compared to existing commercial electrodes,since multiple electrodes can be easily fabricated into a single array with a common connector, thereby simplifying application. Additionally, by providing a low impedance interface with the body, this electrode will eliminate the need for an electrolytic gel or the need to abrade the skin prior to applying the electrode. \r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project will follow directly from the development of the novel electrode (Orbital Research Dry Physiological Recording Electrode) that seeks to improve electro-physiological signal quality (for EEGs, EMGs, ECGs or EOGs), eliminates the harsh side effects and signal deterioration common with existing electrodes and is competitively priced. By enhancing quality of life at no additional cost, this biomedical innovation is expected to lead to new long-term monitoring applications.",
