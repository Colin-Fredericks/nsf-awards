 "awd_abstract_narration": "An effective way of providing error resilience for multimedia transmission in a\r\ncommunication system with a relatively small reduction in efficiency is multiple\r\ndescription coding (MDC), which assumes the existence of multiple independent\r\nchannels between the transmitter and receiver, each of which can be temporarily\r\ndown or can experience burst errors.  With MDC several coded streams, called\r\ndescriptions, are generated and transmitted over different channels.  At the\r\ndestination, if all of the streams are received error free, than the signal can\r\nbe reconstructed at its highest level of fidelity. However, if only one or a few\r\ndescriptions are received in a usable form, the receiver can still reconstruct\r\nan acceptable signal.  All multiple description coding methods to date assume an\r\non-off channel model between the transmitter and the receiver; each link is\r\neither broken, in which case the transmitted symbols, or packets, are lost\r\ncompletely, or it functions properly, in which case the packets are received\r\nfree of errors.  This model is appropriate for Internet transmission, but it is\r\nnot appropriate for wireless channels.\r\n\r\nThis study replaces the parallel independent on-off channel model with a\r\nwireless channel model, such as a Rayleigh fading model.  Communication is\r\nperformed using multiple transmit and receive antennas over the channel.  With\r\nthese models the signal at any of the receive antennas is the superposition of\r\nthe transmitted signals from each transmit antenna independently faded.\r\nTherefore, even if the descriptions at the receiver side are completely\r\nindependent, the received signal at each antenna will include some information\r\nfrom each description.  This research involves finding the best multiple\r\ndescription coding strategy for these channels, the theoretical limits of such a\r\nscheme, and the efficiency with which it can be implemented.",
