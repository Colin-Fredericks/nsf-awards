 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to study the synthesis and processing of colloidal inorganic nanocrystals. Inorganic nanocrystals are fragments of corresponding bulk crystals with at least one dimension in the range of one to tens of nanometers. A fully controllable synthetic scheme will be designed for all types of colloidal nanocrystals by focusing on a systematic and quantitative study of the growth process of semiconductor nanocrystals.  The ultimate goal is to develop safe, reliable, fully controllable (size, morphology and distribution), and quantitatively programmable synthetic chemistry for high quality colloidal nanocrystals. A fundamental study of growth mechanisms together with the development of a green chemistry approach to synthesizing high quality semiconductor nanocrystals will be emphasized. Even though this country will need a large number of nano-scientists and nano-engineers in the near future, the current curricula in most universities have not yet reflected this urgent demand. The aim of the teaching plan is to address this need. This philosophy will be incorporated into regular courses to be taught as well as the development of new courses such as materials chemistry with a strong emphasis on nanomaterials and nanofabrication.  \r\n%%%\r\nColloidal inorganic nanocrystals are of great interest for both fundamental research and industrial applications because of their phenomenal size dependent properties, excellent processibility, and high specific surface area. This well integrated research and education project addresses current needs for a large number of nano-scientists and nano-engineers to be trained in areas of high priority to industry.\r\n*** \r\n",
