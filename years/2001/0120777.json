The request is to support the HBCUs involved: Alabama A&M, Jackson State University, and South Carolina State University.\r\n\r\nThe conference responds to the NSF's Program Solicitation NSF 00-109 and is designed to \"contribute to the Foundations effort to enlarge the science personnel of the nation by including students and recent doctoral\r\nrecipients, women, minorities...\"  The goals of the conference are: To facilitate the transfer of mathematics students from the participating HBCUs to the participating majority institutions; to provide integrated student development and counseling oppportunities for the students participating in the program; and to institute linkages with industry and government which will provide intern and employment opportunities for the students involved.",
