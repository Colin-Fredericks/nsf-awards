 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for the research program of the experimental high-energy physics group of the University of Illinois Chicago.  This group has been a member of the D0 collaboration since 1990 and of the CMS collaboration since 1995.  On the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, the group will concentrate on Run II physics analysis, the Level-2 trigger system, and on possible detector upgrades needed to achieve an integrated luminosity of at least 20 inverse femtobarns before LHC turn-on.  On the CMS detector, currently under construction for the LHC collider at the CERN laboratory in Geneva Switzerland, this group intends to expand its involvement in the hadron calorimeter and start a new effort on the silicon tracker.  CMS is expected to become the group's main focus by the time the LHC turns on, currently expected in 2006.\r\n\tFor the D0 detector, this group is developing the calorimeter Level-2 trigger that will identify electrons and jets, and calculated missing transverse energy.  The group will remain responsible for operating, maintaining and improving the calorimeter Level-2 trigger system.  The group will participate in considering various detector upgrade scenarios concentrating on studies related to the silicon tracker and the trigger system.  The research focus of the group is to continue study of high pT physics at the highest energy possible.  Previous analysis experience and technical responsibilities put this group in a unique position to take a leading role in the search for the long-sought Higgs boson at the Tevatron.\r\n\tThis group has designed and fabricated part of the optical readout system for the CMS hadron calorimeter and has recently accepted responsibility for development of the Level-1 readout and control processors for the same system.  With the addition of Gerber to the faculty, involvement in the CMS detector will expand, as the group becomes one of five US universities responsible for the outer silicon tracker of CMS.  The UIC Department of Physics has a long history in education and research training of undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs, as well as outreach to the community.  These efforts will be continued and expanded.\r\n",
