 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rinzel\r\n0078420\r\n     The neural computation by the mammalian auditory system to\r\nlocalize low frequency sound sources relies on processing in the\r\nbrain stem.  Neurons and circuits there, in the medial superior\r\nolive (MSO), have specialized biophysical properties for\r\nprocessing and preserving precise timings.  These neurons have\r\ndistinctive firing properties.  When a steady stimulus is\r\npresented they fire only once, at stimulus onset; many other\r\ntypes of neurons would behave tonically, firing throughout the\r\nstimulus presentation.  This property of phasicness is believed\r\ncrucial for the MSO cell's role in precise temporal processing.\r\nIn contrast, tonic cells are assumed to be less capable of\r\ntracking rapidly changing signals.  The MSO cells have a special\r\npotassium current, IK-LT, that underlies their phasic behavior.\r\nThe investigator and his colleagues systematically study how the\r\ntemporal processing ability of a neuron changes as the neuron is\r\ntransformed from phasic to tonic mode, say by gradually adjusting\r\nthe strength of IK-LT (using pharmacological blockers and\r\nelectronic methods of re-introducing the blocked current).  When a\r\ncell is in phasic mode does it track a time-varying signal\r\nbetter, or does it perform better coincidence detection, than\r\nwhen it is in tonic mode? The research combines both experimental\r\nand theoretical approaches.  The experiments involve electrical\r\nrecording from individual MSO neurons while stimulating them with\r\nperiodic and other time-varying signals.  Various quantitative\r\ncriteria are applied to assess the quality of temporal\r\nprocessing.  From the theoretical side, biophysically-based\r\nmathematical models are developed that mimic the MSO neurons,\r\nincluding a term for IK-LT.  The model's performance for temporal\r\nprocessing is evaluated just like the real cells.  In addition,\r\nconcepts from nonlinear dynamical systems are applied in order to\r\nreveal and understand the underlying mathematical structure.\r\nThis mathematical understanding will shed light on the\r\nsignificance of phasicness in other neural systems where the\r\nmechanism might not involve IK-LT.  This project also explores the\r\ninfluence of randomness on the temporal processing abilities.\r\nSome randomness is intrinsic to the auditory nervous system, and\r\nit is believed to be functionally important.  Without sources of\r\nvariability, these nonlinear neuronal systems tend to phase-lock\r\ntoo well, impairing a system's ability to perform discrimination\r\ntasks.  The investigator therefore also assesses the effects of\r\nrandomness on the temporal processing power of phasic and tonic\r\ncells and on the theoretical models.  This work seeks to test\r\nwhether the commonly accepted notion, that phasicness enhances\r\ntemporal processing power, passes a set of quantitative criteria\r\nand, if so, to develop a theoretical foundation that supports the\r\nnotion and that extends to other neural and possibly some\r\nchemical and physical systems as well.  A related subproject is to\r\ndevelop computational models that help explain the dynamic\r\neffects seen experimentally as interaural phase (or amplitude or\r\nfrequency) is varied dynamically.  A deeper understanding of some\r\nsurprising effects, as seen in the auditory mid-brain, should\r\ncontribute to developing a theory for how motion of sound sources\r\nis analyzed in the brain.\r\n     It is believed that some neural computations involve\r\ncellular and circuit properties that enable encoding and decoding\r\nbased on precise timing of action potentials.  Sound localization\r\nin the auditory system offers a compelling example.  It serves as\r\nthe case study for this research, that seeks a more qualitative\r\ncharacterization of cellular properties that correlate with\r\nprecise temporal processing.  Many cells in the auditory brain\r\nstem contribute to the system's ability to detect coincidence of\r\ninteraural signals.  These neurons have distinctive firing\r\nproperties.  When a steady stimulus is presented they fire only\r\nonce, at stimulus onset, while neurons of many other types will\r\ncontinue to fire until the stimulus is turned off.  This property\r\nof phasicness is believed crucial for precise temporal\r\nprocessing.  In contrast, tonic cells are assumed to be less\r\ncapable of tracking rapidly changing signals.  The biophysical\r\nbasis, a special potassium current, IK-LT, appears to underlie\r\nphasicness in the brain stem neurons.  This project systematically\r\naddresses how the temporal processing ability of a neuron changes\r\nas the neuron is transformed from phasic to tonic mode, say by\r\ngradually adjusting the strength of IK-LT.  When a cell is in\r\nphasic mode does it track a time-varying signal better, or does\r\nit perform better coincidence detection, than when it is in tonic\r\nmode?  The research combines both experimental and theoretical\r\napproaches.  The experiments involve electrical recording from\r\nindividual neurons in vitro while stimulating them with periodic\r\nand other time-varying signals, including random components.  From\r\nthe theoretical side, biophysically-based mathematical models are\r\ndeveloped that mimic the neurons, including a term for IK-LT.\r\nVarious measures are applied to the computer and cellular models\r\nto assess reliability and precision of processing.  In addition,\r\nconcepts from nonlinear dynamical systems are applied in order to\r\nreveal and understand the underlying mathematical structure.  This\r\nunderstanding will enable us to generalize about the significance\r\nof phasicness to other neural systems where the mechanism might\r\nnot involve IK-LT.  A related subproject is to develop\r\ncomputational models that help explain the dynamic effects seen\r\nexperimentally as interaural phase (or amplitude or frequency) is\r\nvaried dynamically.  A deeper understanding of these surprising\r\neffects, as seen in the auditory mid-brain, should contribute to\r\ndeveloping a theory for how motion of sound sources is analyzed\r\nin the brain.
