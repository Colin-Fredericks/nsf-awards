 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Jackson Public School District (JPS) proposes to significantly advance the science, mathematics, and technology education (SMT) of all K-12 students through the Jackson Urban Systemic Program (JUSP).  The District plans to accomplish this task by building on the existing infrastructure developed primarily through the Comprehensive Partnership for Mathematics and Science Achievement, the Center for Research in Teaching and Learning funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the K-12 Higher Education Partnership funded by NSF in partnership with the National Institutes of Health.  This infrastructure is characterized by an exemplary leadership team, content standards for science and mathematics, policies in support of SMT education for all, the convergence of fiscal and intellectual resources, and a shared vision for improving the capacity of principals, teachers, and students.  \r\n\r\nTo accomplish the goals and objectives of the USP, the District intends to provide all of its students with the fundamentals of mathematics and science so that their understanding, ability, and academic achievement will enable them to perform at or above their peers from around the world.  The major goals are: (1) to increase student achievement in science and mathematics; (2) to increase competency in the science and mathematics instructional workforce; and (3) to strengthen the District's capacity to sustain SMT reform.  Hence, JPS will use the USP to improve its capacity to enhance student achievement via an articulated K-12 science and mathematics curriculum, a more diverse and highly qualified instructional workforce, and stronger and more focused partnerships.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
