Ewing at the University of Michigan and Georges Calas and Thierry Allard of the Universite de Paris VI and VII.  The project addresses long-term radiation effects in minerals and materials. They will study several research problems: the effects of radiation damage on chemical reactivity and surface reactivity of minerals; and radiation effects on the structure and chemical reactivity of sheet silicates, including clays that can be used as \"geologic dosimeters.\"  They will also continue radiation studies of zircon, an important mineral with potential use for disposing plutonium.   The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in studies of radiation damage in minerals, mostly through X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.  This is complemented by French capabilities in spectroscopic studies used to characterize radiation defects at the atomistic level. \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator.  The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance understanding of radiation effects in complex ceramics and materials.  The research has practical importance and may contribute to better methods for storage of nuclear and radioactive waste materials.\r\n",
