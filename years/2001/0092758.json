These data sets can be analyzed to non-invasively study anatomic structure and measure regional physiologic function.  There is a growing need for well-trained medical imaging engineers with a background in human anatomy and physiology, engineering, and biomedical computing, and who are familiar with the unique problems encountered when acquiring and processing large image data sets.\r\n\r\nThis proposal describes a long-term career development plan focused on strengthening the curriculum, educational environment, and research program in medical imaging in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Iowa.  The research aims of this proposal are to develop a comprehensive suite of software tools for pulmonary image analysis and use these tools to evaluate regional lung mechanical behavior and lung tissue material properties.  By detecting unusual mechanical behavior or abnormal tissue material properties, we hope to detect early disease and track the progression of disease over time.  These tools can be applied to disease processes such as lung cancer, emphysema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r\n\r\nThe educational objectives of this work are to actively involve undergraduate students in medical imaging research, and enhance the undergraduate and graduate medical imaging curriculum by introducing new courses focused on developing well-qualified medical imaging engineers and image processing software programmers.  Top-notch undergraduate biomedical engineers will work for an extended period on a pulmonary imaging research project.  This will be a unique opportunity for undergraduates to have a focused, \"hands-on\" experience in medical imaging research.  Proposed curricular changes include the development of a new, required undergraduate core course on biomedical imaging, and the introduction of a new graduate elective course covering advanced topics in medical image processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
