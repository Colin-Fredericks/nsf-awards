 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) \r\n\r\nThis project is implementing a system delivered through the World Wide Web for strengthening the algebraic and computational skills of students in a large reformed calculus and precalculus program, with an outreach component to help high schools evaluate whether students have the specific algebraic skills needed to succeed in college mathematics while there is time to repair students' individual weaknesses before college. This is being done by adapting high quality practices and materials developed elsewhere, in this case the web-based delivery and grading of mathematics exercises using the eGrade software package developed at the University of Nebraska. This software, originally called Webtests, was designed to handle homework and tests in introductory college mathematics courses. In this project this software is being adapted and used in conjunction with other methods of providing and collecting information through the Internet to deliver all of the following across the web: mathematics skill evaluation materials for use in high schools; algebra review and practice modules for use in college and high school; two complete mathematics courses; and a major gateway skill testing program. \r\n\r\nThe project has the following outcomes:\r\n(a) Gateway tests are being offered in a computerized testing center in electronic form, with automatic grading and reporting of scores to instructors and immediate feedback to students. \r\n(b) Web-based review materials containing eGrade practice problem sets are being written to accompany the gateway tests, so that students who encounter difficulties can review and practice the material between attempts.\r\n(c) Web-based readiness tests are being created that can be used under the guidance of high school mathematics teachers to diagnose weaknesses in the specific algebraic skills needed for introductory college mathematics courses. \r\n(d) Two web-based courses are being built around eGrade, an algebra and trigonometry skill course for students not quite ready to take precalculus and a brief precalculus course for students not quite ready to take calculus. \r\n(e) Extensions to multivariable calculus are being explored in a pilot activity to study ways to convert some existing Calculus III computer laboratory modules for delivery across the web.",
