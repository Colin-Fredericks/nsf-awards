 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research described here addresses information security issues for embedded processors and constrained environments.  Embedded processors are found in a vast array of existing and emerging technologies, including mobile phones, personal digital assistants, smart cards, and remote-controlled utility network devices and are distinguished from typical (but far less prevalent) PC-level microprocessors in their relatively low power consumption and inherent limitations on memory and speed.\r\n\r\nIt is predicted that the number of applications with embedded microprocessors which will be connected to our telephone and computer networks will increase dramatically over the next few years. For instance, it is anticipated that within the next few years, 50% of all Internet end-devices will have to operate in constrained environments.  At the same time, these networks are enabling remote access to, and manipulation of, sensitive resources of all sorts, including bank records, medical information, alarm system, and industrial machinery.\r\n\r\nThe need is clear for long-term planning and directed research in the area of cryptographic security for these devices.  The challenges represented here require the attention of experts from a variety of disciplines, from engineering to computer science to mathematics. Both fundamental and immediate problems face hardware designers, software engineers, and theoretical crypytographers alike.\r\n\r\nWe propose a three-pronged approach in an effort to contribute solutions to these problems.  The long-term ambition of such research is to bring cryptographic security solutions to the market which are low-cost, highly scalable, and suitable for constrained environments.  This project places particular focus on implementation of public-key algorithms in embedded devices and is divided into three modules as follow:\r\n\r\nDevelopment of power-efficient and scalable cryptographic hardware for pervasive computing.\r\n\r\nInvestigation of emerging public-key schemes which appear promising for implementation in constrained environments.\r\n\r\nEvaluation of combinatorial structures for public-key schemes in hardware and on embedded processors.\r\n\r\nThis three-pronged approach combines a long view, cutting across disciplines, as well as a variety of very promising short-term objectives which assure practical relevance and payoff.",
