 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project STEALTH involves thirteen graduate and twelve advanced undergraduate Fellows, twelve secondary science and mathematics teachers (from two high schools and two middle schools located in Oklahoma City and Del City), and seven OU faculty (from the School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science, School of Industrial Engineering, Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies, and the Oklahoma Networks for Excellence in Education), who will work in teams developing, designing, implementing, and assessing authentic learning, inquiry-based activities for secondary science and mathematics students. These activities will be incorporated into lessons, demonstrations, laboratory exercises, individual and group projects, and field experiences in order to: 1) emphasize authentic and community-based experiences; 2)encourage creative problem-solving skills; 3) develop interest in life-long learning; and 4) prepare secondary students for advanced education. Activity themes will focus on environmental science and engineering, new materials and their use, and civil infrastructures. Activities will be designed to fit the teachers and students' needs based on curriculum requirements, course content, students' abilities and interests, and available resources. Fellows will be prepared to create and implement these activities through a new course presenting: 1) educational theory, concepts, and assessment congruent with authentic learning; 2) the design, implementation, and assessment of hands-on, inquiry-based activities in secondary science and mathematics curricula; and 3)appropriate teaching practices and methods for secondary students, as well as local, state, and national curricula standards. The program's effectiveness on the Fellows' teaching skills, as well as its effect on secondary science and mathematics education will be quantitatively assessed and used to continually improve the program.\r\n\r\n",
