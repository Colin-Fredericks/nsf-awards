The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0082).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nNorth Carolina A&T State University; 3-TEX Inc.; General Electric Aircraft Engine Group (Cincinnati, OH); NASA Glenn Research Center Cleveland, OH)\r\n\r\nProposed Activities\r\nThe activities include commercial technology development and work-force advancement; commercial development; attract minority students to graduate programs; launching new start-up companies; licensing technology for transfer to existing businesses.\r\n\r\nProposed Innovation\r\nCarbon/carbon composites are being developed for ion thruster optics and other ion thrusters for deep space flight engines, bearing cages for large and small aircraft engines, valves for internal combustion engines, textile products, and sports equipment.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe current market for these materials is not known at this time, but the potential market for engines for commercial aircraft is very large. The combination of small business to manufacture the components, a large aircraft engine manufacturing company, and NASA produces a partnership that has the potential to sustain the economic enterprise for the short-term future.  Once manufacturing produces a product for a reasonable market price, additional applications may arise. \r\n\r\nPotential Societal Impact\r\nNorth Carolina A&T is a historically African-american institution.  The program would increase the number of African-american engineers with BS and post-graduate degrees in the US.  The economic activity has the potential to create new markets and new jobs.\r\n",
