The organizers are Dr. Magdy Iskander, Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, and Dr. Ayman El-Dessouki, President, Electronics Research Institute (ERI), Cairo, Egypt.  Dr. Fatma El-Hefnawi, ERI, will also help plan the meeting.  Discussions will focus on advances in telecommunication technologies and R&D needs for next-generation telecommunication systems.  Example of topics to be discussed include:  multidisciplinary research, MEMS technology, low-cost phased area antennas, innovative device designs based on photonic band gap structures, and advanced propagation models.\r\n\r\nScope:  This award encourages discussion among US and Egyptian scientists on an area of great importance to both countries.   Potential collaborative research areas will be identified.  Dr. Iskander has successfully managed an NSF program to promote wireless communications research in the United States.  Dr. El-Dessouki is the head of the largest research organization in this field in Egypt and will invite persons from academia, industry, and government labs to the workshop.  Several junior scientists will be among the US workshop participants.  This workshop is also funded the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out collaborative activities, by funds from the Division of International Programs and from the Division of Electrical and Communication Systems.\r\n",
