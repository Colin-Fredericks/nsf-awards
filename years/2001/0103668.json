Jose Lopez, Peter McCarthy, and Julie Olson at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI) to perform a taxonomic survey and inventory of deeper water marine microorganisms contained in HBOI's microbial culture collection.  The approximately 9000 microorganisms within the collection were isolated from deep-water marine invertebrates (primarily sponges). This project will survey about half of the collection using a combination of descriptive and molecular genetic techniques, provide access to this information via the Internet, creation of a Harbor Branch Marine Microbe Database (HBMMD) and professional scientific publications, and apply the knowledge gained to examinations of the genetic diversity within preserved specimens of the host invertebrates. It is thought that the microbial communities associated with marine invertebrates will differ with the species of host invertebrate, geographic location, and water depth.\r\n\r\nLittle is known about the biological and genetic diversity of marine microorganisms.  Due to the inherent difficulties associated with gaining access to deep-water environments, even less is known about deeper water marine microbes. There is an urgent need to study the diversity of marine ecosystems, which are under increasing threats caused by tourism, recreational use, nutrient overload, and general ocean warming.  Understanding the balance of biodiversity in marine ecosystems which are still relatively healthy will enhance our ability to manage and conserve them, suggest possible goals in the restoration of similar but less healthy marine systems, and help to foster a greater global appreciation of microbial ecosystems.            \r\n",
