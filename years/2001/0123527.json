 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international mobility of highly skilled workers, in particular human resources in science and technology (HRST) is an important and growing policy issue with a number of countries.  The project is a preliminary investigation of the statistical, methodological, economic and policy issues involved in the international mobility of skilled workers, especially IT specialists, research scientists and engineers or entrepreneurs.  Results from the statistical components of this work will feed into the revision of the \"Canberra manual\" which sets international guidelines for the measurement of human resources in science and technology.  Expected outcomes of the project are (1) new indicators reflecting international mobility for a range of countries to be published in 2001; (2) An international conference on the issue scheduled for 2001; (3) a compendium of country studies and international statistics will be published in 2001/2 containing revised and expanded versions of works presented at the conference.",
