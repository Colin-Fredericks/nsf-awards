 "awd_abstract_narration": "0089515.  William Murdoch\r\nA central objective of contemporary ecology is to understand the highly complex interactions between plants, plant-feeding insects, and their natural enemies.  These direct and indirect interactions have profound impacts on natural and managed populations and communities.  William Murdoch and his colleagues at the University of California-Santa Barbara are conducting long-term investigations to understand how parasitic wasps maintain populations of citrus-feeding California red scale insects at low population densities.  Understanding how this biological population control occurred so quickly, while remaining stabile, is the primary objective of the project.  Several hypotheses will be tested empirically, such as a corresponding increase in parasitism rates, and parasitoid interference, as scale densities rise.  This research is considered by many ecologists to be one of the best studies of insect population dynamics and biological control.  The project has strong theoretical and empirical components and blends modeling with hypothesis testing at multiple temporal and spatial scales.  Although this work is focused on a specific plant-insect-enemy model, the principles underlying the ecological interactions and population dynamics are broadly relevant for other natural and agricultural systems.  This basic ecological research has direct applications for agronomy, as well as the quality of human life.  Knowledge gained from this project can help reduce pesticide use and establish more environmentally friendly methods of controlling major crop and orchard pests. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
