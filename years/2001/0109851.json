 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused upon demonstrating the feasibility of developing a new class of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.  Continued advances in laser-based system components are essential for keeping the nation's technology infrastructure at the forefront. Diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser systems represent one of the most important technologies being developed for many of these applications-with particular emphasis being placed on generation of coherent light at heretofore unrealized combinations of power levels and wavelengths extending from the IR to the deep UV. A limiting factor in the development of DPSS laser technology is the lack of suitable laser and nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals having optimized physical properties.  The development of new, efficient, robust, versatile, and readily manufacturable fixed- or tunable-frequency laser and NLO crystals is essential for the continued advancement of DPSS technologies.  Demonstrating the potential to develop materials having these required NLO properties-coupled with unprecedented transparency into the DUV combined with superior thermal and mechanical properties-is the Phase I goal. \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion will lead to commercialization of a new class of materials that will enable production of a variety of state-of-the-art laser-related products. In the private sector, laser materials and systems have become critical components in the manufacture of essentially all microprocessor-based electronic devices and in a variety of medical therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. Other key government and commercial uses include sensors for remote sensing of pollution and atmospheric gases such as ozone and water vapor, satellite-to-satellite communications, optical computing, and advanced communications.  Clearly, the potential market for this type of next-generation technology is substantial and diverse.\r\n",
