 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to hold a two-day workshop in Tucson, Arizona during fall 2001 on emerging ultra-large\r\nnetworks, such as the Internet. Hosted by Arizona Center for Integrative Modeling and Simulation, the\r\nmeeting will bring together some of the world's leading researchers in the networking area to meet with\r\ncounterparts with expertise in modeling and simulation of networks and of systems more generally. The\r\nworkshop will provide these researchers with the task of coming up with the unknowns of ultra-large\r\nnetworks and with new directions of research in modeling and simulation that can address these unknowns.\r\n      The Internet is increasing in connectivity, toward 1 billion nodes in 2005 and node capability providing a\r\nhighly interconnected and computationally powerful medium. Such a globally and ubiquitously dispersed\r\nnetwork will provide a new frontier for new kinds of educational, commerce and entertainment activities.\r\nHowever, there are many issues that arise in the emergence of such a large, highly decentralized, collection\r\nof interaction parts. The increased connectivity and capability creates new complexity and dynamics that\r\nwe are only on the verge of appreciating. Difficulties in dealing with large-scale software systems are well\r\ndocumented in a recent report by the National Research Council. Techniques that work for small software\r\nsystems fail markedly when the scale is increased by one million fold. Computer-based modeling and\r\nsimulation (M&S) methodology is required to address these issues since the scale is well beyond what\r\nanalytical tools alone can handle and there is limited ability to do controlled experiments on the always\r\non Internet. Traditional M&S approaches have focussed on the micro-level components rather than the\r\nmacro level integration of these components. However, with the advent of ultra-large scale systems such as\r\nthe Internet of the future, it is necessary to develop M&S approaches for understanding the behaviors of\r\nvery large inter-connected networks with very few loci of control and many interacting and varied sources\r\nof input and services demand.\r\n      The results of this workshop are expected to be a set of specific finding of gaps in our knowledge of the\r\nbehavior of ultra-large networks and how to deal with their design, management, and control. Participants\r\nmay assess whether current approaches can be evolved to deal with the large increases in scale or whether\r\ndifferent, revolutionary paradigms are required. Participants will address the need for new techniques and\r\napproaches for building models of ultra-large networks and developing simulation environments for\r\nstudying their behaviors. Suggestions for borrowing points of view form other areas such as complex\r\nadaptive systems and from basic theory of modeling and simulation will be encouraged. The proceedings\r\nwill be compiled in a form that will provide a useable and significant guide for new NSF funding initiatives\r\nfor future network infrastructure research.",
