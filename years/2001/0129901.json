 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's Solutions in partnership with the Girl Scouts-Lone Star Council are using a planning grant to build a strong regional and national collaboration with Texas community colleges and five additional Girl Scout councils. The Council is building on a technology curriculum project pilot called \"The Edge.\" The original pilot program was developed for girls ages 6-17 and delivered primarily to elementary and middle school girls. The plan is to modify \"The Edge\" to address the needs of high school age girls, undergraduate women and women desiring an entry level technology job. The large project will focus on those in rural Texas counties, girls within the 200% of poverty level and girls that have English as a second language, to increase their technology skills and their interest in going to college. \r\n\r\nAustin Community College distance learning, St. Edward's University, University of Texas and the IC2 institute are eager to partner with Girl Scouts - Lone Star Council . The Council served 12,839 girls and 6,598 adults in fiscal year 99-00. \r\n",
