 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops efficient and reliable iterative\r\nmethods for reconstructing an image from recorded, noisy data.\r\nTo obtain better resolved images, he develops methods that can\r\neffectively handle complicated operators (e.g., spatially variant\r\nkernels) and methods that enforce a nonnegativity constraint.\r\n     The emergence of increasingly sophisticated imaging devices\r\nhas produced a new generation of very difficult computational\r\nproblems in which an image is to be reconstructed from recorded\r\ndata.  Such problems arise, for example, in breast cancer\r\ndetection, where there is a tradeoff between the needs to obtain\r\nhigh resolution images and to limit the radiation dose to the\r\npatient.  New devices have also been recently proposed for\r\n3-dimensional imaging, where high dimensionality and resolution\r\nrequirements result in nontrivial computational complexity.  Yet\r\nanother example occurs in new ground-based telescopes, which use\r\nadaptive optics techniques.  To extract detailed information and\r\ntake advantage of the increase in resolution that can be obtained\r\nfrom new imaging devices, it is important to develop methods that\r\ntake into account spatial changes of properties in the imaging\r\nmechanisms, which are not amenable to standard fast Fourier\r\ntransform based methods.  New fully 3-dimensional medical imaging\r\ndevices require a new generation of computational methods to\r\nefficiently reconstruct images from recorded data, and in order\r\nfor these new computational methods to find their way to clinical\r\nuse, it is important to provide software packages that allow for\r\neasy implementation and experimentation.  Methods that enforce\r\nnonnegativity in the computed solution, and that can efficiently\r\nhandle spatially variant kernels, are developed.  Many of the\r\ncomputational tools developed in this project should be\r\napplicable to a wide class of iterative image reconstruction\r\nmethods, including linear, nonlinear and statistical based\r\nmethods.",
