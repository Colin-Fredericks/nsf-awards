 "awd_abstract_narration": "MacGillivray Freeman Films is producing a large format film about the exploration and new scientific research aimed at understanding and responding to changes in coral reef ecosystems.  The film will examine the complex behavior and interactions among unique Pacific coral reef animals, illustrate the role of scientific research in addressing the declining health of reefs, and stimulate public interest in pursuing further learning and careers in coral reef and marine science.  In five coral reef sites the film will feature science researchers who are each a part of the global effort to understand and protect coral reef ecosystems as they document reef diversity and animal behavior, investigate symptoms of reef degradation, provide information on past environmental change through core sampling, and explore life in extreme ocean environments.  Outreach materials will include a Museum Resource Guide, Family Fun Sheet, Activities for Informal Education Groups, Teacher Guide and Poster, Web Site/Virtual Field Trip, and Scientist Speaker Series.  \r\n\r\nGreg MacGillivray will be the PI for the project and also will serve as Co-Producer/Co-Director/Co-Director of Photography.  Alec Lorimore is Co-Producer and Howard Hall is Co-Director of Photography/Sequence Director/and Cameraman.  Science Advisors include:  Gerald Allen, Conservation International; Richard Aronson, Dauphin Island Sea Lab and University of South Alabama; Gisele Muller-Parker, Shannon Point Marine Center and Western Washington University; Joseph Levine, WGBH and Discovery Magazine; and Richard Pyle, University of Hawaii and Bishop Museum.\r\n\r\n",
