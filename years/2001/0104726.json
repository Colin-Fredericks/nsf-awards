 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Texas, 57% of incarcerated youths have prior offenses.  Multiple organizations (Bell County, Central Texas College, Central Texas Workforce Board, ESRI, Inc., Killeen Independent School District, Texas A&M University System, and Texas Youth Commission) will demonstrate different and innovative learning methods to close this revolving door on the juvenile justice system.  \"Engagement in Learning\" will stimulate learning through technology and engage the student in life-long learning through hands-on deliverables.  Student engagement will be achieved by circumventing poor reading skills through hands-on applications of modern technologies.  This three-year program is comprised of teacher and student training, classroom research and exploration projects, and the integration of students into the workplace.  Killeen ISD will train teachers in basic computer skills and in project-based learning that integrates modern technology into the classroom through appropriate curriculum.  Other trained teachers from the region will serve as mentors to the teachers that directly serve the incarcerated population.   Several follow-up sessions will be incorporated to strengthen 'teachers supporting teachers.'  Approximately 250 students will be selected and trained for 100 and 150 hands-on learning hours in aligned science education curriculum (e.g. Life Management Skills, Geographic Information Systems, Health and Safety, Horticulture and Food Sciences).  Working in teams, students will utilize scientific processes to simulate real-world experiences that utilize science curriculum.  Each project will be developed collaboratively through the student team and teacher facilitation and will utilize project-based management methods and hands-on learning to build and reinforce student learning and self-esteem.  The evaluation process will examine the effectiveness of intensive project-based learning on the at-risk population of incarcerated juveniles and will study the power of technology in changing life direction.",
