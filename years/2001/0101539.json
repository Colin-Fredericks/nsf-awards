This award primarily\r\nsupports the participation of graduate students, junior\r\nresearchers, and speakers.  Plenary lectures are planned to cover\r\na wide-ranging agenda in geometric function theory, hyperbolic\r\ngeometry, dynamics, and other topics and workshop days early in\r\nthe meeting are planned to showcase junior researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium is one of a series of conferences on\r\ngeometric function theory, Riemann surfaces and related topics\r\nthat have been held every three or four years since 1965.  The\r\nmeetings' name honors Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers, two giants in\r\ncomplex analysis who shaped the meeting's subjects over the\r\ntwentieth century.  The current core of geometric function theory\r\nconsists mainly of Riemann surfaces (two-dimensional spaces\r\ndefined over the complex numbers, such as the collection of all\r\ncomplex solutions to a typical single polynomial equation in two\r\nvariables), Teichmueller theory (an approach to studying the\r\nvariations of structure possible for a particular Riemann\r\nsurface), Kleinian groups (the most important discrete groups of\r\nisometries of hyperbolic three-space), iteration of rational\r\nfunctions (which combines dynamical systems ideas with function\r\ntheory), and hyperbolic manifolds.  This core reaches back 150\r\nyears and meets or includes some of the most active specialties\r\nin current mathematical research.\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0101539\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  William Abikoff\r\n\r\nThe Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium is to be held in October 2001 at the\r\nUniversity of Connecticut campus at Storrs.
