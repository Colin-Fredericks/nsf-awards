 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \r\nThis project is building a learning community in a 700-person general chemistry course by melding key features of the NSF Chemistry Systemic Initiatives with existing computer-based laboratory facilities and with the unique UNH Preparing Future Faculty programs. The course is intended to help students grow intellectually and personally. We are hoping to demonstrate intellectual growth along three dimensions - conceptual understanding of chemistry, metacognitive ability, and motivation to learn. We are attempting to create an environment in which students feel \"known,\" despite the large population, and in which helping each other learn is valued. This may lead to enhanced retention of students in the course, in science disciplines, and in college.\r\n\r\nStudent learning focuses on constructing, visualizing, and articulating an understanding of chemistry by means of inquiry-based activities that occur throughout the scope of student work (lecture, lab, study group, homework). Along with inquiry-based activities of our own design, we are integrating and adapting a number of ChemConnections modules (Berkeley/Beloit groups), e.g. \"What's in a Star\", \"Design of Automobile Air Bag\", and \"Ozone Hole\", as motivating contexts for learning chemistry. Our stance is one of constructing knowledge on an as-needed basis. At the same time, we are enhancing one of our traditional course goals - understanding the particulate nature of matter - by means of supportive text and media materials, e.g. Silberberg's text and new animations, and Joel Russell's split-screen multiple representations CD. Lastly, having students articulate and evaluate their understanding is a central pedagogic feature. This occurs through 8-person peer-led discussion groups (CUNY City College Peer-Led Team Teaching model), computer-mediated peer-reviewed writing (UCLA Calibrated Peer Review system), and the discussion associated with the Chem Connections modules.\r\n\r\nComputers are being used for homework (4 years experience with Spain's ChemSkill Builder), laboratory data acquisition (Labworks computer stations for student pairs), and molecular animations, as well as for routine course information and communication (UNH implementation of Blackboard.com). \r\n\r\nWe also are creating a Pedagogic Field Laboratory - a clinical setting whereby science Ph.D. students involved in the UNH Preparing Future Faculty degree programs and preservice secondary science teachers can observe, participate, and discuss the implementation process, and assess student and faculty responses. Activities in the PFL extend beyond this chemistry project, since there are a number of NSF-funded curriculum projects underway at UNH. The PFF programs are available to students and faculty off campus, especially at partner institutions (Howard Univ., St. Anselm College, Keene State College, UNH-Manchester). \r\n\r\n",
