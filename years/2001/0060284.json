 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop a new class of UV-transmitting, electrically conductive coatings by using filtered cathodic arc plasma deposition (FCAPD).\r\nCathodic arc plasmas are characterized by relatively high ion energy (20-150 eV) that lead to denser films.\r\nMacroparticles which typically contaminate such plasmas can be filtered using curved magnetic filters that\r\nhave been developed by Berkeley's Plasma Application Group.  Filtered cathodic arc coatings are not only\r\ndense but may be grown in a vacuum or reactive environments.  The window of partial pressure for\r\nstochiometric compound films is wider than for evaporation or sputtering methods. Moreover, sputtered\r\ncoatings (and more so beam-evaporated films) are characterized by porosity, which increases the thickness\r\nfor the required electrical conductivity, with reduced optical transmission. The primary objective of Phase I\r\nis to demonstrate that a thin coating can be produced which is highly conductive and transmits between 80-\r\n90% of the incident UV radiation.  Once the feasibility of using FCAPD for producing high density coatings\r\nthat show high electrical conductivity and high light transparency have been answered, Phase II will\r\noptimize the process for larger areas. Engineering development, marketing and sales of coating units is the\r\nprovince of Phase III.\r\n\r\nCommercial applications for FCAPD films include: electrochromic automotive and aircraft windows; heat\r\nmirrors; optoelectronic devices such as UV triggered diamond high voltage switches; solar cell surfaces for\r\nspace applications Cathodic arc deposition of TiN coatings is a well established technology which supports\r\ntens of millions of dollars of business annually worldwide in coating equipment sales and hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars annually for the coatings generated by that equipment.",
