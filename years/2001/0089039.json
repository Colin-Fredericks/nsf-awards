 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Systems Science (40) \r\nIndustrial development, urbanization, and population growth continue to put increased strain on environmental and natural resource systems. Engineers and scientists trained in environmental science disciplines such as hydrology, watershed management, and soil and water quality are needed to address critical environmental issues that involve\r\ninterconnections between the Earth's water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles, as well as the interrelationship between these cycles and human activities. The purpose of this proof-of-concept project is to create, develop, evaluate, and disseminate student-centered and inquiry-based online learning modules that involve students in meaningful explorations in earth and environmental science disciplines, with a focus on watersheds. The project addresses the national call for inquiry-based instructional/learning materials in environmental science and engineering at the undergraduate level that are adaptable to a variety of instructional approaches and learning modalities. Within the learning modules, there are interactive learner-centered materials (e.g., lecture notes), Java-based simulation and three-dimensional visualization tools, a digital data library for five major U.S. watersheds, problem-solving exercises, and case studies related to watersheds and environmental management. These components are being created and adapted from advanced scientific modeling and visualization capabilities that utilize rapidly evolving desktop computing capabilities and the Internet and World Wide Web. The learning modules are housed within an active learning environment, a server-side software infrastructure, to support local and distance educational opportunities and to promote collaborative learning among students. The online learning environment and learning modules emphasize active/group learning, inquiry-based constructivist learning on issues related to watersheds and the environment, and the interdisciplinary nature of watershed management. In accordance with the proof-of-concept status of this project, seven learning modules are being developed to provide state-of-the-science treatment of important topics in watershed science, watershed engineering, and watershed management. Each learning module (1) is Web-based, easily accessible, and cross traditional discipline boundaries; (2) is appropriate for introductory earth and environmental science courses; (3) reinforces scientific methodology; (4) is interactive, intuitive, and inquiry-based; (5) is self-contained and vertically scalable for easy implementation by faculty; (6) aims to increase students' spatiotemporal and quantitative reasoning skills within the framework of already established environmental science and engineering content standards; and (7) aims to increase student awareness and understanding of watershed science and issues related to the environment. The expected immediate audience is approximately 500 students per year in several geoscience, biological, ecological, and environmental science courses at Iowa State University (ISU), plus an additional estimated 700 students in classes at other institutions that will be involved in the implementation plan. The long-term audience is students in environmental and earth science courses that include watershed science topics and adult learners at resource management agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture. The expected outcome will include a learning environment and set of learning modules that address national demands for watershed education and training. The evaluation utilizes standard tools for formative and summative evaluation in conjunction with educational rubrics for assessing students' learning outcomes. In addition to implementing and evaluating a prototype environment and learning modules to a diverse population of ISU students, the project is developing the framework for implementation and evaluation at four national and international institutions. Dissemination of the products of the project will be accomplished by involvement of faculty from other local and national institutions on an advisory board; presentation of papers at workshops and national conferences; creation of an Internet repository for the electronic discussions of interested faculty; and publication in educational journals, newsletters, and CD (or DVD)-ROM media.",
