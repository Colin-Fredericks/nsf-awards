 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of \"Exploring Earth\" is to weave into a tightly integrated package the revised textbook, in depth student investigations of core topics in Earth sciences, and a web site of Earth science images, animations and other visualizations.  The project is a collaboration between the publisher (McDougall Littel) of the most widely used high school Earth science textbook and TERC.  The investigations serve as challenging and stimulating entry points into or extensions from major topics, providing opportunity for student-guided applications to real-world scenarios.  They include investigations at local study sites, design of experiments, working with visualizations, and real-time data and experimenting with models and simulations.  The website features images from space, real-time data, and information about theories, data and recent events to extend and deepen student learning.  Students develop an understanding of Earth and space science and of Earth as system by experiencing Earth and space science as a process of inquiry, exploration and discovery; by observing, exploring and monitoring the environment around them; and by learning to use the tools of modern technologies.  The project builds upon previous work of both parties to provide all teachers a pathway for easier change to the increased use of inquiry and electronic technologies.  The materials contain a guide for professional development of teachers and workshops are held to support learning Earth science in urban environments.  The evaluation includes pilot and field testing the materials and evidence of student learning.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
