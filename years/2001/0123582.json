 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the development and implementation of a workshop for prospective and\r\ncurrent female professors in science and engineering fields as part of the NSF\r\nADVANCE Leadership Awards Program by a group of researchers from the George\r\nWashington University and Gallaudet University who have collaborated for the past five\r\nyears on projects to increase the numbers of women and other underrepresented\r\nminorities in advanced Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) careers. \r\n\r\nUsing experience from earlier efforts to bring together students from different institutions, large and small, local and far away, specialized communities (e.g. women's colleges, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and comprehensive, to consider and be prepared for graduate\r\nschool in science, engineering and math (SEM), the PIs propose to develop and run a similar\r\nworkshop for potential and current female faculty members in SEM. The proposed activity will benefit from the pipeline created by the FORWARD program: participants from this program started in 1997 will be reaching graduation and the stage of securing a faculty position within the\r\nproposed timeline of the award. Participation will be solicited from across the country\r\nand will feature speakers from successful programs and careers in SEM.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. \r\n",
