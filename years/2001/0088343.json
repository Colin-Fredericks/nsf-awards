In geophysics, this has led to increased emphasis on field courses, especially in the area of environmental geophysics, where employment opportunities are the greatest for new graduates. In this project we are adapting and implementing proven field methods for a new environmental geophysics field course for undergraduate earth systems science majors at The City College of New York. This course is being modeled after published descriptions of those already taught at Smith College, Boston College, and Arizona State University. In addition to geophysical concepts and the use of geophysical equipment, the new course stresses teamwork and engages students in surveys at realistic urban sites. The new equipment purchased for this project, a ground conductivity meter and an Overhauser Magnetometer (and related software), are also being used by undergraduates enrolled in City College's new Environmental Project course. This course is required for all earth systems science majors and involves a semester-long research project.\r\n",
