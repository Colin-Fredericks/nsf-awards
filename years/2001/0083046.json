 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, investigating the development of magnetoelastic sensing based on magnetic thin films that display large values of magnetostriction at low fields, aims to improve the interface behavior that controls the mechanisms of giant magnetoresistance (GMR). The project will focus on imperfect interfacing and its consequences, performing integrated experimental and modeling research dealing with both the transport and magnetic aspects involved in the design of nonvolatile magnetic random access memory (MRAM) or GMR sensor. Low values of magnetic anisotropy are crucial to the investigation, where several possibilities for obtaining desirable film properties will be considered. Magnetic films and multilayer systems are central to several forefront technological areas. The use of GMR-based components has become the dominant market element in the computer disc business, which in 1998 constituted a $38 billion enterprise. The use of GMR materials is at the heart of spintorics (spin electronics), which includes the development of MRAM, and the improvement of read heads and hard disc media. Single film and multilayer magnetoelastic sensors exhibit great potential due to their ability to provide inexpensively remote query sensing of chemical or environmental parameters to monitor ongoing industrial processes, even the quality of material in sealed containers (e.g., milk). Morever, magnetoelastic sensors can also provide miniature pressure and acceleration sensors for Navy or Air Force use. \r\n\r\nThe project will initiate an interdisciplinary effort integrating experimental, theoretical, and computational modeling research to establish an ongoing Center for the Sciences and Technology of Magnetic Films. To provide a state-of-the-art central facility, the SQUID magnetometer will be upgraded first. Targets involve the submission of an NSF MRSEC preproposal by September 2001, and the pursuit of ONR and AFOSR funding sources. Industrial collaboration with IBM Almaden and Seagate will provide additional experimental facilities as well as the opportunity for students to spend residential time in an industrial environment. The effort involves collaboration among WV, LA, and KY: Tulane University and University of Kentucky.\r\n",
