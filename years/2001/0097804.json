 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an undergraduate research experience for eight students over seven weeks.  Students will work in a research group of four students with one faculty mentor. Mentors are selected on a rotating\r\nbasis from three research areas: hyperbolic geometry, number theory and inverse problems. \r\n\r\nThough the research areas are different the students will all collaborate in teams to conduct computer experiments, calculations, and simulations motivated by the problems. On the basis of the calculations\r\nstudents to make discoveries and formulate conjectures, then moving on to proving theorems, establishing classifications, or developing algorithms. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this technical program, students will be engaged in a companion program to develop their oral and written mathematical communication skills, collaborative, and other professional skills. This will be accomplished  through required oral presentations and technical reports on their work and a close, positive working environment among the students and the P.I. in the Theorodrome, the computer laboratory/workplace devoted to the REU.",
