 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington College of Engineering proposes to mount a major new initiative to integrate biology into the engineering curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students. They will develop this initiative in phases. In the first phase, key elements will be developed under Action Agenda support. In later phases  A three-tiered system is proposed that will affect all undergraduate engineering students at the University of Washington.\r\n\r\nFirst Tier: The first level will include all engineering undergraduates, and will involve the integration of intriguing biological examples of engineering concepts (\"mini-modules\") into the existing core engineering curriculum at the Freshman and Sophomore levels. In addition, they will create ENGR/BIO Freshman Interest Groups to create a forum for students with early interest in the engineering/biology interface to interact.\r\n\r\nSecond Tier: The second level will involve development of a new Junior-level course entitled,\r\n\"Biological Frameworks for Engineers.\" This will be a hands-on project based course in fundamental engineering-based biological concepts that will develop in engineers the common language and concepts of biology. \r\n\r\nThird Tier: The third level is a more in-depth learning experience in the interface between biology and engineering. These experiences take many forms: 1) a large number of existing and planned courses in more specialized subjects, 2) undergraduate research opportunities, and 3) industrial internships at the engineering/biology interface. Once students have taken the new junior-level course, they will be better prepared to take advantage of each of these opportunities. \r\n\r\n",
