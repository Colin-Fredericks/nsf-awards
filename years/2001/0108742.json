 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nUnder the direction of Dr. Ben Nelson, Mr. Christian Wells will collect data \r\nfor his doctoral dissertation. He will continue ongoing archaeological research \r\nat the prehispanic site of El Coyote, located in the Cacaulapa Valley of \r\nnorthwestern Honduras. This research will investigate the relationship between \r\ncommunity feasting and the political organization of the polity that formed and \r\ncollapsed between the seventh and tenth centuries AD. Archaeologists wish to \r\nunderstand the processes that integrate and differentiate individuals in \r\nancient communities, with the greater goal of reconstructing past systems of \r\ngovernment and their effects on the growth and change of societies. Mr. Wells' \r\nprevious excavations in the main civic-ceremonial plaza at the site have \r\nrevealed abundant evidence for food production and consumption on a large \r\nscale, suggesting that communal feasts were a central practice in the rulership \r\nof El Coyote. Such events would have served as a mechanism for polity \r\nintegration, as well as a context in which exotic items were publicly displayed \r\nto enhance the social prestige and political authority of local leaders. With \r\nNSF support, Mr. Wells' doctoral dissertation research will examine the \r\norganization of feasting in the plaza, including what material culture was \r\nemployed, where food consumption took place in relation to the temples that \r\ndelimit the plaza, and which social segments of the polity participated. His \r\nresearch will incorporate archaeological excavation of the plaza and adjacent \r\nbuildings, as well as trash middens that accumulated on the margins of the \r\nplaza. In addition, he will chemically characterize soil samples from the plaza \r\nto study the distribution of phosphorous and heavy metals, which will indicate \r\nthe locations of activity areas. His research will also examine the composition \r\nof ceramic vessel remains from the trash areas in order to illuminate the \r\ndifferent social groups that participated in plaza-oriented activities. \r\nArchaeologists are interested in the practice of feasting and the social \r\nrelations that are reproduced during feasts. The examination of material \r\nculture and soil chemistry at El Coyote is a direct method for the study of \r\nthis phenomenon, and will yield new information on the organization of feasting \r\nin ancient complex societies and the degree to which this practice was involved \r\nin the political and economic administration of El Coyote. In addition, the \r\nresearch will enhance our knowledge of the material signatures of feasting in \r\nthe archaeological record and will assist in training a promising young \r\nscientist.\r\n\r\n",
