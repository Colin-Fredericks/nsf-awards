 "awd_abstract_narration": "In IC fabrication chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is used to planarize surfaces of\r\nconductors like aluminum, tungsten, tantalum and copper and dielectrics like silicon dioxide,\r\nsilicon nitride, and low-k polymers. The CMP process is the only technique available now to\r\nprovide surfaces across the die and wafer with planarity sufficient to meet the stringent depth of\r\nfocus requirements of shorter wavelength lithographic techniques. The CMP of low-k polymeric\r\nmaterials and architectures overlaid on these polymers is challenging. This is because the low-k\r\npolymeric materials are mechanically softer and even porous, can flow under heat, and have\r\nhydrophobic surfaces. There exists a critical need for developing low pressure, selective, and\r\neffective CMP process of the new, low-k polymers and architectures overlaid on these polymers.\r\nThe primary objective of this program is to develop a novel approach using magnetically\r\nresponsive slurries (MRS) to conduct CMP of low-k polymers and associated structures. The\r\nproject is a joint collaborative, interdisciplinary, synergistic effort between investigators from\r\nClarkson University and University of Pittsburgh, with collaboration with industry. A\r\nfundamental and systematic investigation of the feasibility such a magnetically assisted CMP\r\nprocess will be conducted. The outcome of this program has the potential for a significantly high\r\neconomic payoff. This project will have significant combined impact on the: basic science that\r\nforms the underpinning of the CMP technology, research infrastructure, and development of\r\nhuman resources.",
