 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how brain systems coordinate the sequential order of natural patterns of behavior (i.e., action syntax).  Coordination of normal sequential patterns is crucial both to human action skills and to the instinctive behavior patterns of animals.   Similar brain systems appear to be involved in sequential coordination for humans and other mammals.  In particular, the brain's neostriatum and its dopamine inputs play a crucial role.   The contribution of this brain system will be studied by this project using a neuroethological approach, which uses natural behavioral patterns to reveal normal brain functions, combined with neural manipulations.\r\n\r\nOne goal of this project is to better understand which subtypes of neostriatal dopamine systems control grooming syntax (i.e., which neuroanatomical subregions and which neurochemical receptor types).  The ability of microinjections of selective dopamine agonists to enhance specific patterns of action will be compared across neuroanatomical sites within the neostriatum and a related brain structure.\r\n\r\nAn additional goal is to understand the actual nature of the contribution that the neostriatum makes to behavioral sequencing - that is, how it helps or what function it contributes.  Experiments will quantify rapid changes in sensorimotor modulation in response to sensory stimuli during sequences, to examine how hierarchical sensorimotor modulation by the neostriatum contributes to sequence implementation.  The results of these experiments will improve our knowledge of how natural coordinated sequences of behavior are produced by the brain in humans and in other animals.  \r\n",
