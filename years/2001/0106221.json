 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Terry Hunt, Ms. Julie Field will collect data for\r\nher doctoral dissertation. She will initiate new archaeological research in\r\nthe Sigatoka Valley, located in the southwestern corner of the island of\r\nViti Levu, Fiji. This research will investigate the evolution of competitive\r\nsettlement strategies between related and non-related social groups in\r\nFijian prehistory.  Ms. Field's previous analyses of aerial photographs from\r\nthe Sigatoka Valley have documented the location and character of over 700\r\narchaeological features, including fortifications, agricultural features,\r\nand unfortified settlements. Despite the quantity and richness of the\r\narchaeological record, no chronology exists for the establishment of the\r\nfortifications, or the arrival of the various patrilineal descent groups\r\ndocumented at the contact period.  Ms. Field's doctoral dissertation\r\nresearch will examine the development of fortifications in the valley, and\r\nalso trace the relationship between the environment and the frequency of\r\nconflict, as evinced by the occurrence of fortifications on lands\r\ntraditionally held by patrilineal descent groups, known as mataqali and\r\nyavusa.  Her research will incorporate an archaeological excavation and\r\ncollection strategy, focusing on a sample of 15 sites from a variety of\r\nenvironmental zones.  The acquisition of datable materials from such\r\nfeatures as walls, ditches, and remote mountain outposts will allow for the\r\nfirst chronology of fortifications in this part of Fiji.  Ms. Field will\r\nalso couple the information gleaned from archaeological research to an\r\nenvironmental model generated within the framework of a geographic\r\ninformation system (GIS).  Comparison of these data, as well as the\r\ndistribution of land-holdings and hierarchical social relations that are\r\nknown to exist between the patrilineal descent groups of the valley, will\r\nhave the potential to indicate group fission, movement, and the various\r\ncompetitive stances that existed in prehistory.  Archaeologists are\r\ninterested in the development of conflict and warfare, and the examination\r\nof fortifications is a very direct method for the study of this phenomenon\r\nduring the prehistoric period.  NSF support will allow Ms. Field to conduct\r\nexcavations in Fiji, and also provide for the dating of archaeological\r\nmaterials.  This research is important because it will yield data of\r\ninterest to both regional and international scholars, and it explores a\r\ntopic that is of great interest to the discipline of anthropology.  It will\r\nalso support and assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
