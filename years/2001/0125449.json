The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0179).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners for the effort are the University of Southern California (Lead Institution), California State University Fresno, Caltech, Claremont Graduate University, University of Arkansas, University of Nevada-Reno, University of Pittsburgh, NASA Ames, California Technology Trade and Commerce, LA Economic Development Corporation, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, Niagara Broadband, and National Collegiate Innovators and Inventors Alliance.\r\n\r\nProposed Activities\r\nThe partners propose to create and implement a national Technology Transfer and Commercialization Network to coordinate and provide a variety of resources and knowledge so that network users can collaborate and innovate.  The activity will provide private sector partners that supply needed technology, financial, and legal expertise, national labs and state and local governments that assist in firming and evaluating the program, academic partners that supply vital content and structure.  The partnership will allow the partners and their clients to be successful innovators, sustaining the partnership in the future.  \r\n\r\nProposed Innovation\r\nThe proposed network of academic institutions will provide a variety of resources and knowledge to partners, especially under-served schools, that they could not generate on their own.  The infrastructure will allow academic institutions to move their intellectual property into commercialization through partnerships with venture capital, private companies, start-ups etc.  The combined engineering expertise of the partners will provide resources to small companies that they could not afford otherwise.  The business school expertise of the major academic institutions will be available for small universities and businesses alike.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe partnership will stimulate and support innovation growth by linking sources of knowledge and expertise with those needing such sources to make their enterprises prosper, particularly those in under-served areas.  The resulting economic growth and development will generate additional resources to sustain the partnership.\r\n\r\nPotential Societal Impact\r\nCreation of economic wellbeing and jobs for people in under-served areas will have a beneficial effect on the people of those areas.\r\n",
