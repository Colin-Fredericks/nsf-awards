 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nEinstein's gravitational field theory (general relativity), besides\r\nproviding the most accurate current model for the study of gravitational\r\nphysics on the astrophysical and cosmological scales, is also the source of\r\na rich collection of mathematically interesting questions. This award will\r\nsupport a program of research which focusses on some of these, including\r\nthe following:\r\n1) Study of the behavior of the gravitational field very close to the big\r\nbang in cosmological solutions of Einstein's equations. Remarkably, it\r\nseems that even for solutions which appear to be very different some time\r\nafter the big bang, the behavior close to the big bang is very similar: It\r\noscillates in a characteristic way. We can show this, numerically or\r\nanalytically, for simple families of solutions, and we hope to show it more\r\ngenerally.\r\n2) Construction of new sets of initial conditions for the gravitational\r\nfield which juxtapose two known sets. This is not easy because the initial\r\nconditions must satisfy certain nonlinear  partial differential\r\nequations--the Einstein \"constraints\". We are developing techniques for\r\nsmoothly joining ( or \"gluing\") two solutions of the constraints into a\r\nsingle solution.\r\n\r\nThe first of these projects, although it ignores any quantum gravitational\r\neffects, could be very useful in our drive to understand the nature of the\r\nvery early universe. The second is of interest both mathematically and\r\nphysically. The mathematical interest stems from the fact that the Einstein\r\nconstraint system is among the most complicated to which gluing studies\r\nhave been applied. The physical interest comes from the possiblility of\r\nusing the developed techniques to set up initial data for black hole\r\ncollisions and other astrophysical problems which are being intensely\r\nstudied numerically in anticipation of future data from LIGO.\r\n\r\n",
