The workshop will be held on April 5-6, 2001, at the GeoForschungsZentrum in Potsdam, Germany.  The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from a variety of disciplines to examine what is known, as well as what is not understood, about seismic discontinuities in the mantle and their implications for the state of the Earth's deep interior.  The scientific program will include presentations in the areas of seismology, mineral physics, geodynamics, and geochemistry, each of which provides an opportunity to present and debate new results with colleagues in related but distinct disciplines, and to summarize the state or our understanding in several areas related to the Earth's mantle. A high degree of cross-fertilization between disciplines is one of goals of the workshop.  Funds will be allocated primarily to offset expenses associated with the travel and participation of U.S. graduate students in the workshop.\r\n",
