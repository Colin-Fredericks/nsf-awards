 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates a new method of assessing predicted performance\r\ncharacteristics of Object-Oriented software architectures. As scenarios\r\nrepresent the anticipated runtime behavior of a system, they can be used at\r\na very early stage in the design to quantitatively predict aspects of that\r\nbehavior. The proposed approach can be applied earlier than other existing\r\nmethods such as simulations and executable designs, and does not require\r\nspecial analytical skills.  Early assessment is an important risk mitigation\r\ntechnique, that can contribute significantly to the task of building a\r\ndistributed system with a greater degree of confidence in its ability to\r\nperform as required.\r\n\r\nThe research involves formally defining a set of scenario-based metrics and\r\na corresponding system-wide dynamic metrics model.  A strongly typed\r\ntraceability scheme is defined to support the definition and automated\r\nquerying of relationships between performance requirements, scenarios, and\r\narchitectural components.  Scenario invocation rates are specified within\r\nthe context of typical usage patterns, and the relationship between\r\nscenarios is investigated to determine when performance requirements should\r\nbe propagated from one scenario to another.  A supporting tool is developed\r\nand used to capture metrics and validate them against runtime and simulation\r\nmeasurements taken from a variety of distributed systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
