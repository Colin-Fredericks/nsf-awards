Recent work by Li-Ping Ma has called attention to the ideas of depth and connectivity of mathematical knowledge. The PI hopes to develop a blend of qualitative and quantitative methods that can be used to analyze the depth and connectivity of a student's mathematical knowledge. With the current affordability of powerful computers, there has been a new push to use computer analysis to gain insight into qualitative data. Existing software like Sacks Conversation Map and Krackplot of social network theorists will be evaluated for use in the math education setting, and new software will be developed as necessary.\r\n\r\nThird, the research results will be disseminated not only using the traditional avenues of conferences and published papers, but also over the Internet in a web-searchable database. The PI has considerable experience in such projects and already runs two such servers: one is a database of educational resources for the national community of Treisman workshop leaders and another one holds for math and statistics education papers for the Special Interest Group on Undergraduate Math Education of the MAA. Among the indexed and posted contents will be classroom instruments along with examples of student work.\r\n\r\nAs a final benefit, student research assistants will play important roles in the research, either graduate students or motivated advanced undergraduates. The experience will be designed to cultivate an interest in math education in the math majors chosen to work on the project, with an eye towards encouraging them to pursue careers in math teaching or math education research.\r\n",
