There has been increasing interest in the potential applications of algebraic topology in recent years.  Topology has now become a \r\nvaluable tool in computational geometry, as well as a method for studying various problems in algorithms and combinatorics. This conference will cover several different themes, including topology \r\nin computational geometry, topology and algorithms, topology in combinatorics, and topology as an aid to visualization.  The speakers include many of the leaders in this area, including both mathematicians with an interesting in computational questions as well as computer scientists who are applying algebraic topology in various ways. We expect substantial participation from researchers in Silicon Valley \r\nwho ae working in this area. Further information, including invited speakers, schedule of talks, and housing information, is available at http:// math.stanford.edu \r\nand \r\nhttp://www.math.uwo.ca/~jardine/at-cs.html\r\n",
