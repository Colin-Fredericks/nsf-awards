This pilot program will offer engaging science activities\r\nand real-world applications to teachhands-on science and technology to approximately\r\n450 girls over a three-year period. Each semester, between forty-five and ninety girls\r\n will join the GO Team! at locations in their own neighborhoods. Of the girls who excel \r\nin this after-school program, six will be selected every semester to return and team \r\nteach with Academy staff to a new group of participating girls. As the girls grow in \r\ncompetency and skills, they can attend a more advanced GO Team! the following\r\n semester. The participating girls will attend weekly lab sessions taught by \r\neducators and scientists from the Academy, have fun with their families at a \r\nKick -Off celebration and a Graduation Ceremony, learn about science and technology \r\ncareers during a job shadow day with museum staff and outside professionals, and\r\nlearn how science and technology impact their everyday lives. Successful women \r\nmentors will function as teachers and role models to help build the girls' science \r\nknowledge, career choices, and self-esteem.\r\n",
