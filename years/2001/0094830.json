 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scholarships to talented but financially disadvantaged students to assist them in attaining higher education degrees in computer science, engineering technology and mathematics. Appropriate consideration is given to underrepresented minorities, transfer students, women and students with disabilities. Scholarships are provided to students across the four- year curricula in the targeted disciplines. Freshman and sophomores receive scholarships to help increase retention, which is a documented area of concern for the targeted areas. Scholarship awards are incremented to provide a weighted allocation to juniors and seniors. The project resources are incorporated within a web of complementary university programs. The project encompasses several activities and services to support the development of its scholars, which includes: recruitment, faculty and peer mentors, dedicated tutorial services, internships and research opportunities, preparatory summer workshops to support continued academic growth and grooming for career development and exploration.",
