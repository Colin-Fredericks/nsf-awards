 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the conference, to be held in Banff, Canada, September 30 through October 5, 2001, is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for emerging technologies related to microgravity research.  The effort will be directed towards bringing together scientists from the fluid, thermal, biological and materials sciences and exchange technical information on research related to transport processes in these disciplines.  In particular, the focus will be on complementing the technical expertise across these various areas, and exploring the avenues for interdisciplinary work. The growing interdisciplinary aspects of research in these different disciplines necessitates the sharing of expertise, and the proposed conference will provide the forum for focusing on new areas where experts will be able to blend their scientific ideas to deal with various unsolved scientific problems. The funds will help support travel for U.S. participants consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and non-tenured faculty with limited research funding.",
