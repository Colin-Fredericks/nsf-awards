 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for exploring the development of a novel fiber optic acoustic system for high-frequency bandwidth measurements. The novelty of the sensor system will be derived from the inclusion of extrinsic sensing capabilities based on a Fabry-Perot cavity, an integrated optical circuit based phase modulator, a high-speed photo detector, and a digital demodulation scheme based on a new multi-step phase stepping algorithm. The Fabry-Perot cavity will be located between the fiber tip and the diaphragm structure of the sensor, and the Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the phase modulator will be path matched with the Fabry-Perot arrangement to act as a read-out interferometer. Both experimental efforts and analytical efforts will be pursued for developing the sensor and understanding the sensor mechanics.\r\n \r\nA potential risk involved in the development of this sensor system is that it may not be amenable to multiplexing as the other fiber-optic sensors.  If successful, the development of this sensor system will have a tremendous impact on integrated active control systems for sound and vibration transmission problems where currently multiplexable sensors for high-frequency bandwidth applications are not readily available.  Furthermore, if the sensor system is adapted, it can be used for high-frequency bandwidth pressure measurements in underwater flows.  The sensor system may also have applications in the automotive industry such as ignition chambers\r\n",
