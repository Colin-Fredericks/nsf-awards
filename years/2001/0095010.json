 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an historical study focused on the introduction from Europe of two major innovations into the concrete construction industry of the United States: thin shell concrete structures and prestressed concrete. These two European innovations came to the United States during the first half of the 20th century and subsequently had major impacts on American engineering. Each has a different history on this continent and those differences are important for this project as their similarities. Both cases reveal central aspects of twentieth century American construction and shed light on how American technological culture differs from that in Europe. The background for this scholarly work includes the experience of the principal investigator first in the history of technology, second in connecting scholarship to teaching, and third in both of the innovations to be studied. Since 1974 the principal investigator has focused a central part of his scholarship on historical studies. During the 1950s the principal investigator worked for the leading figures in each case and has since collected archival documents relating to both thin shells and prestressing. \r\n\r\nThe study  examine the thin shell concrete roof structures and long-span roofs and bridges in prestressed concrete from the period 1900to 1960.  The main focus falls on the influence of two European-trained engineers who introduced these new ideas into American engineering practice: Anton Tedesko (1903-1994) for thin shells and Gustave Magnel (1889-1955) for prestressing.  The results of this study are to be three lengthy essays each of which will be submitted to a scholarly journal. A short essay on these two men, given as a lecture (in November 1999) upon receipt of the Sarton Medal from the University of Ghent, presents a preliminary sketch of the final works in this program and will be published by Ghent University in 2000. The PI also plans a series of shorter articles in such journals as the American Scientist, Scientific American, The Journal of the Structural Division of ASCE, and Structural Engineering International.  Also sets of teaching materials will be prepared for use at Princeton and in other schools. \r\n",
