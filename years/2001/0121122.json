 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-power ultrafast lasers offer significant advantages for next-generation laser materials processing, particularly at small length scales, which makes them well suited for micromachining and MEMS structures.  The extremely high laser intensities associated with ultrafast lasers result in unique, nonlinear laser-material interactions that provide innovative new possibilities for laser-material processing.  This proposal presents a unified series of research tasks that address both fundamental scientific issues while presenting practical techniques and solutions for real-world applications. The proposed tasks include 1) novel beam delivery techniques for delivering a high-quality, minimal distortion ultrafast laser beam to a workpiece for processing without the need for a vacuum chamber, 2) sub-surface machining of transparent materials in which features can be fabricated underneath the surface of transparent materials for true three-dimensional micromachining, 3) modeling breakdown and material removal to predict a given material's response and removal rates from specific ultrafast laser parameters, and 4) precision processing of novel materials such as SU-8 for MEMS applications, which presents unique capabilities over traditional manufacturing.  A central focus of the research tasks is to provide both fundamental understanding while at the same time providing practical knowledge for industrial and other real-world users.  As an educational tool for both graduate and undergraduate students, the project will provide excellent training in optics, lasers, and engineering on the microscale (both time and space).  These topics are often only minimally covered, if at all, in traditional mechanical engineering programs, and this project will provide much needed training in these areas.",
