 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \r\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an indispensable tool for the determination of the structures of molecules, the analysis of chemical mixtures, and the determination of reaction kinetics. Efforts to provide students with hands-on experience using NMR in the laboratory are greatly aided by converting an outdated Varian EM360 continuous-wave NMR spectrometer into a modern multinuclear Fourier-transform instrument (FTNMR). This cost-effective, user-friendly solution allows rapid data acquisition, making student collection of spectra a routine procedure. Adaptation of experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education and incorporation of FTNMR into current experiments allow students at all stages of their chemical education to have access to the instrument. FTNMR is used across the curriculum to demonstrate the power of the technique in Introductory Chemistry, to determine molecular structure in General Chemistry, and to perform multinuclear and two- dimensional experiments in Organic Chemistry. Early and continued exposure to FTNMR reinforces important chemical concepts, engages students, helps develop their problem-solving skills, and exposes them to the uses of technology in chemistry.",
