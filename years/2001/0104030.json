Cannon\r\n\r\nWe attempt to resolve the hyperbolic case of Thurston's\r\nGeometrization Conjecture for 3-dimensional manifolds.  Among the\r\nmany possible approaches, we choose to study the asymptotic\r\nrecursive properties of the fundamental group of the manifold. We\r\nconcentrate on the asymptotic shingling patterns at infinity\r\ndefined by the group and seek methods for proving that such\r\npatterns do or do not satisfy the necessary and sufficient\r\nconformality axiom which we introduced in our earlier studies. We\r\nstudy this problem in three contexts: (1) We study closed\r\n3-manifolds with Gromov-hyperbolic group, with emphasis on the\r\nexamination of concrete examples constructed by our new method of\r\ntwisted-face-pairings; (2) We study general subdivision or\r\nlocal-replacement rules in the plane, where we have more freedom\r\nin constructing examples with special properties; and (3) We\r\nstudy branched coverings of the 2-sphere by the 2-sphere, where\r\nthe corresponding problem is to some extent already solved by\r\nmeans of Thurston's combinatorial characterization of rational\r\nmaps.  It is in the third context that the connection with\r\nclassical Teich- mueller theory becomes apparent; we are seeking\r\nan appropriate version of Teichmueller theory for our setting. In\r\nall of these contexts, we use the circle-packing programs of Ken\r\nStephenson, the automatic group programs of Epstein, Holt, and\r\nRees, and the program SnapPea of Jeff Weeks in conjunction with\r\nprograms of the proposer and his coworkers to construct,\r\ngeometrically optimize, and explore the patterns being studied.\r\n\r\nWilliam P. Thurston has supplied us with a powerful conjectural\r\npicture of the spaces of 3-dimensional mathematics, the\r\n3-dimensional manifolds. Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture is\r\nthe most important unresolved problem in low dimensional\r\ntopology, even if one sets aside the case of spherical geometry\r\nwhere the conjecture implies the famous \"million dollar\" Poincare\r\nConjecture. Thurston suggests that every 3-manifold can be\r\ndivided in an intrinsic manner into pieces, each of which is\r\nmodelled on one of eight natural geometries. Within each piece,\r\none can apply well-understood algebraic and geometric techniques\r\nto derive properties of the manifold. This project seeks to\r\nresolve the generic case of the Thurston Conjecture, namely the\r\ncase of hyperbolic geometry. The technique employed is to\r\nmaximally unwind the manifold, that is, take its universal cover,\r\nand study the asymptotic properties of this cover. The cover can\r\nbe studied combinatorially almost as a growing cellular organism\r\nas a plant or animal might be studied by a cell biologist. The\r\ncover can be studied computationally as a cellular automaton\r\nmight be studied by a computer scientist. The cover can be\r\nstudied analytically by methods of discrete dynamical systems or\r\ndifferential equations or conformal mapping.\r\n",
