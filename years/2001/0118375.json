Because of the expected growth in many information related areas and what is perceived as a critical demand for focused research attention on future directions and applications of large scale simulation optimization, a workshop will be organized at Harvard University on June 23 and 24, 2001.  This workshop will bring together leading government, industrial, and academic researchers and practitioners of systems simulation modeling and optimization for the purpose of identifying research issues, targets of opportunity, application areas and other unforeseen points relevant to this promising research area.",
