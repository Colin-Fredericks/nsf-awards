The workshops are of two types: Five-day twenty person on-site workshops directed by experienced leaders with a history of effective innovative teaching and distance-learning workshops which are designed for faculty who are unable to attend the on-site workshops. The six summer 2001 workshops are being held across the US. Sites include Seattle, Boone in North Carolina, Ithaca (New York), Lancaster (Pennsylvania), Durham (New Hampshire) and Indiana (Pennsylvania). Workshop topics include geometry, mathematics and art, physics, calculus, statistics, and elementary education. Eight on-site workshops are planned for the summer of 2002 and seven for the summer of 2003.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to address the rapid and significant changes in undergraduate education. The project also addresses the specific needs of faculty at various stages of their professional careers. Thus, the project is designed to meet the needs of faculty with respect to changes in their environment and in their careers. For more information contact Tom Rishel at trishel@maa.org.\r\n\r\n",
