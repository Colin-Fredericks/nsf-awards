 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research, the photo-physical properties of novel organic dendrimers and metal dendritic nano-composite systems will be investigated.  Measurements that probe the dynamics of fundamental excitation decay processes in organic dendrimers will be carried out with ultra-fast time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy.  These measurements will compare the dynamics of the excitation decay in homgenous (where core groups are the same as the dendrons) and inhomogeneous (where core groups are different from the dendrons) dendrimer systems.  The ultra-fast anisotropic decay of these systems will also be investigated to probe possible energy transfer mechanisms.  Time-resolved measurements will be carried out with novel silver(Ag) and gold(Au) dendrimer nano-composites.  The decays of the metal clusters and the dendrimer host can be separated and the associated mechanisms of relaxation can be ascribed.  The dependence of the metal particle configuration on the emission dynamics of the dendrimer nanocomposite system will be investigated.  Dynamics measurements as a function of dendrimer generation number will also be carried out.  These studies will probe the fundamental mechanism of emission decay in synthetic dendrimers and give new insights into the interaction of synthetic dendrimers and metal nano-particles when fabricated in a nano-composite structure.  \r\n%%%\r\nOrganic macromolecules with important structural properties will play a critical role in future development of optical and electronic devices.  Organic dendrimers and metal dendrimer nano-composites are examples of such promising macromolecular architectures.  They have potential applications as light emitters, optical limiters, and drug release and delivery systems.\r\n",
