 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to carry out a detailed multi-disciplinary study of single-electron\r\nlatching switches and of possible use of 2D arrays of such switches for hardware\r\nimplementation of self-organizing (plastic) neuromorphic networks. Preliminary estimates\r\nshow that such networks may provide unparalleled possibilities for complex information\r\nprocessing. By these estimates, the networks may also have remarkable scaling properties:\r\nif implemented using a 10-nm technology, they may have density about 10 8 neurons per\r\ncm 2 at manageable power dissipation below 100 W/cm 2 , and feature full learning cycle time\r\nof the order of a few seconds. This scaling gives every hope that the networks will be able,\r\nafter initial (largely unsupervised) learning, not only provide complex information processing\r\nincluding complex image recognition, but possibly reproduce biological evolution of the\r\ncerebral cortex at a time scale some 6 orders of magnitude shorter.\r\nThe objective of the proposed project is to carry out a preliminary study of this\r\nremarkable opportunity, addressing all its basic aspects at several structural levels. In\r\nparticular, research will include the following components:\r\nA. Single-electron switch node design (D. Averin, K. Likharev, J. Wells).\r\nDetailed theoretical analysis and modeling (on two basic levels of single-electron transport\r\ntheory) of statics, dynamics, and statistics of the proposed single-electron latching switches.\r\nB. Low temperature prototyping (J. Lukens). Fabrication and experimental\r\nstudy of Al/AlOx/Al prototypes of single-electron latching switches, with the goal to scale\r\nsingle-electron islands down to 100 nm and tunnel junctions to 10 nm, respectively, which\r\nwould bring the reliable operation temperature up to about 10 K.\r\nC. Molecular single-electron device development (B. Brunschwig, J. Lukens,\r\nA. Mayr). Exploration of the opportunity to implement the basic component of the switches,\r\nthe single-electron transistor, by chemical self-assembly of molecular components. The\r\nmolecular components will be deposited in solution on the prefabricated metallic wire\r\nstructures, and then characterized using a set of electrical, electrochemical, and time-resolved\r\nlaser-spectrometry methods.\r\nD. Top level modeling and analysis (J. Barhen, M. Bender, K. Likharev).\r\nLarge-scale computer simulation and a partial analytical study of the growth, dynamics, and\r\nself-adaptation of neuromorphic networks based on these switches.\r\nHopefully, the project will achieve enough progress to justify a large-scale R&D effort\r\nin this exciting direction. In particular, a reliable evidence of self-organization of adaptive\r\nneuromorphic networks during largely unsupervised learning would certainly be followed by\r\nthe first hardware implementations of sizable networks (possibly, after an initial stage of\r\npurely-CMOS-based prototyping using commercially available FPGA technology).\r\nThe project will have a substantial educational component. Specifically (besides\r\nparticipating in general educational Stony Brook initiatives), at least 4 FTE graduate\r\nstudents will be involved in the project each year, and some 20 undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students will take part in the project during its full 4-year period. At least one\r\nstudent will work in BNL and one in ORNL most of the time. Working in a multi-disciplinary\r\nteam will allow these students to overcome inter-departmental barriers in their education.\r\nAs another specific educational initiative, we plan to organize a Web-based undergraduate\r\ncourse on massively parallel supercomputing and neural networks, using the IBM SP3\r\ncomputer at Oak Ridge.\r\nWork on the inter-related aspects of this multi-disciplinary project will be constantly\r\ncoordinated by its P.I. (K. Likharev). In particular, regular meetings of all Stony Brook and\r\nBrookhaven participants of the team working on the project (including postdoctoral\r\nassociates and students), and annual meetings with Oak Ridge collaborators, are planned.",
