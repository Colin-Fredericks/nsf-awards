The discovery of the T1R3 gene at the chromosomal locus associated with saccharin sensitivity in mice suggests that the T1R3 protein may be (a receptor) involved in the detection of sugars and sweeteners.  To gain insight into the potential role of T1R3 in taste, the co-localization in taste bud cells of the T1R3 protein with other proteins believed to be involved in taste will be examined.  In individual taste cells, the co-localization of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding T1R3 and other candidate taste tranduction proteins will also be studied.  It is anticipated that this knowledge gained from this research will lead to a better understanding of how taste signal transduction occurs.  In addition, this research may provide important information towards the development of improved non-caloric sweeteners and effective therapies for taste disorders.\r\n",
