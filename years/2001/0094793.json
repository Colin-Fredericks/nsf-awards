 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Kentucky (UK) and Lexington Community College (LCC) are providing undergraduate scholarships for low- income, academically talented students in computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM). Through the partnership between the UK College of Engineering, UK Mathematics Department, and the UK Lexington Community College Computer Information Systems and Engineering Technology programs, this project supports the pipeline of students from the associate's and bachelor's degree levels to the graduate degree level and into science and technology employment opportunities. Forty students will be selected into the program each year, and will be expected to complete a degree within two years of being awarded a scholarship. Objectives of the program include: reducing the time students need to spend on non- academic employment in order to meet their financial obligations; enhance academic success by making an integrated range of services and activities available to the scholars; and increasing the number of students who transfer from the associate's degree level to the bachelor's degree level. These objectives are being achieved by: providing scholarships to reduce the burden of academic expenses; coordinating student support services, providing research experiences, and developing focused enrichment activities to promote academic success and foster interest, expertise, and enthusiasm for the CSEM fields; and provide bridging activities for LCC students who wish to transfer to UK.",
