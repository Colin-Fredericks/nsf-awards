 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2001 meeting of the \"Eukaryotic DNA Replication\" biennial conference  will be held September 5 - 9, 2001, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  The meeting will be devoted to fundamental research topics related to chromosome duplication and structure and function, and will include important topics of biological research in the areas of cell cycle and growth control, DNA replication, replication-associated gene regulation, and genome amplification. The need for this meeting is evidenced by the rapid advances made in this field over recent years. The meeting will ensure that recent results will be communicated and discussed in an atmosphere conducive to the open, lively, and productive exchange of ideas. The participation of younger investigators and women scientists will be encouraged.  The areas to be covered by the 2001 meeting will include studies on the following: \r\n\r\n(1)  The replication of virus chromosomes, including SV40, polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, papillomaviruses, and  Epstein-Barr virus\r\n(2)  Chromosomal replication and gene amplification in organisms as diverse as yeast, Drosophila, Xenopus and mammalian cells\r\n(3)  Control of DNA replication in the cell cycle \r\n(4)  Structure and function of chromosomal elements such as origins of replication and telomeres\r\n(5)  Control of cell cycle progression and S phase specific gene expression \r\n(6)  DNA replication checkpoints and DNA repair. \r\n\r\nDNA replication is an essential process in all organisms.  This meeting will help disseminate current research findings on this vital topic and will stimulate and facilitate further advances. The financial support provided by the National Science Foundation will enable students, postdoctoral fellows, and young investigators to attend this important meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
