There is adaptation of materials from several texts including Mathematics in Action, Functioning in a Real World, and Interactive Differential Equations. Educational technology is being incorporated into every course.\r\n\r\nThe project stages include: \r\n* The development of appropriate materials to implement a detailed and comprehensive plan that has already been developed and agreed to by all the faculty for full integration of CAS technology into all appropriate courses in mathematics and related courses in the sciences and technology. The direct use of CAS is being incorporated into all courses at the calculus and higher levels. All courses below calculus (including developmental mathematics, algebra and precalculus, as well as all related courses in the sciences and technology) are being completely redesigned to reflect the existence of CAS and its use in the higher courses. \r\n* A faculty development and training program, especially for part-time faculty, to prepare for the mplementation. \r\n* The actual implementation, evaluation, and several stages of revision of the new curriculum. \r\n* Full scale evaluation of the project. \r\n* Development of a project web site. \r\n* A variety of regional and national dissemination activities to acquaint the various professional communities with the results of such an extensive rethinking of the entire curriculum. \r\n\r\n",
