 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide partial support for the sixth consecutive FASEB Summer Research Conference on \"Chromatin and Transcription,\" to be held on July 7-12, 2001, at the Conference Center in Snowmass Village, Colorado.  The goal of this highly successful series of meetings is to foster interactions between researchers who study DNA-templated processes with individuals who study chromatin structure and organization.  These disciplines are moving together at a rapid pace and are providing much new information for the basic biological sciences. The meeting's central topic is the relationship between chromatin and transcription. The regulation of chromatin impacts other critical biological areas; for instance, there are important links between chromatin and nuclear structure, chromosome organization, and the cell cycle, particularly relating to recent discoveries about histone modification.  Moreover, questions of genomic stability and instability, which are relevant to genetic disease, will be addressed in a session on developmental/epigenetic regulation. The timing and location of the 2001 conference are ideal for productive and interactive discussions about data in these rapidly evolving areas.  NSF support will be used to help new and young investigators to attend the meeting and present their results in an oral format.\r\n",
