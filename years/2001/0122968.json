The college will achieve this goal through the \r\nsuccessful completion of three specific project objectives. During the one-year planning \r\nperiod, project personnel will: (1)perform a thorough self-assessment of the current math curriculum in place at FBC; (2)conduct an in-depth review of alternative instructional methods, curricula and delivery systems that have proven successful with minority students (and, specifically, American Indians) across the country; and (3)develop a comprehensive planning document for designing and implementing a math program that addresses specific local and institutional needs, while incorporating best practices from model programs. The results of these planning efforts will provide the basis for developing an implementation/design proposal to be submitted under NSF's 2003 TCUP solicitation. Ms. Mary John Taylor, Dean of Academic Affairs, and Ms. Billie Jo Foote, Math/Science Instructor, will serve as co-principal investigators for the project. Fort Belknap College is requesting $50,000 to carry out this project over a 12-month period. \r\nPROPOSAL NO.: 0122968\r\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Taylor, Mary\r\nINSTITUTION NAME: Fort Belknap College\r\nTITLE: Planning Grant for Restructuring Math Delivery Systems at Fort Belknap College\r\nNSF RECEIVED DATE: 04/30/2001\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
