 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Puerto Rico Resource Center for Science and Engineering (RCSE) and partners are instituting a distance learning program for K-12 science and math teachers.  The content strands are the \"areas of special emphasis\" that emerged from the Puerto Rico Statewide Systemic Initiative (PRSSI).  The workshops and courses are delivered by the University and designed to meet the needs of local teachers in district efforts to implement standards-based mathematics and science instruction.  Thirty lead teachers provide local technical and content support for districts that participate in the project.  Over five years, 1000 K-12 teachers will participate in and take courses through the project.  Much of this is done through telecommunications technologies, which are used for delivery, collaboration, access, reflection, inquiry, online discussions and mentoring.  \r\n\r\nThe project builds on the SSI which has impacted nearly 50% of the island's schools.  It clearly notes the work completed under the SSI and delineates what is left to be done.  It is this remaining work that constitutes the core of the project.  These efforts are supported by networking being installed throughout the island (T1), a number of earlier grants, and links to New York City (Lehman College).  In addition, the project uses a supporting technology called mindtools.  These are defined as \"computer-based tools and learning environments that have been adapted or developed to function as intellectual partners with the learner in order to engage and facilitate critical thinking and higher order learning.\" In addition to content and methods, the project provides teachers with badly needed training in the use of computer-based technologies.  The project also carries out research on the necessary conditions to scale such technologies.\r\n",
