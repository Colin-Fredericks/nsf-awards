 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on Hamiltonian ODEs and PDEs under strong constraining\r\nforces. For an given Hamiltonian composed of the kinetic energy and a\r\npotential energy, consider particles restricted to a submanifold\r\n(independent of time) in the configuration space, i.e. a holonomic\r\nconstraint. The idealization of the constrained particles' motion is\r\ngoverned by a Hamiltonian system defined on the tangent bundle of this\r\nsubmanifold involving geometric notions. In physics, an alternative way to\r\nrealize the constraint is to consider the system in the original space\r\nwith an extra strong potential which penalizes the distance to the\r\nconstraining submanifold. This idea applies to both Hamiltonian ODEs and\r\nPDEs. While the convergence of the motions under strong constraining\r\npotentials to the limit geometric Hamiltonian motions on finite time\r\nintervals has been studied for ODEs, the problem in PDEs is basically\r\nuntouched. The project focuses on two questions. The first is the\r\nconvergence of the strongly penalized motions, both on finite and infinite\r\ntime intervals. The second question is the relation between the dynamics of\r\nthe strongly penalized motions and their limits, i.e. the structural\r\nstability under strong constraining forces. The subjects are stability,\r\nperiodic motions, homoclinic motions, resonances, etc. The problem can also\r\nbe viewed as homogenization or elliptic type singular perturbations.\r\n\r\nThe problem of motions of particles restricted to submanifolds in the\r\nconfiguration space appears naturally in both classical mechanics and\r\nPDEs. For example, in classical mechanics, whenever a rigid rod is\r\nconsidered as elastic with a large elastic coefficient, the problem falls\r\nin this category. Also, it is found, in material science, that some\r\nanti-ferromagnetic systems converges to geometric wave equations\r\ntargeted on the unit 2-dimensional sphere formally. Therefore, it is\r\nimportant to study how the constrained motions converge. Moreover, as the\r\npenalized motions have high frequency oscillations, it is even more\r\nimportant to investigate the relation between the asymptotic qualitative\r\nbehaviors.\r\n",
