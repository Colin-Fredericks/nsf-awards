 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks modest support for two senior researchers in the field of photosynthesis, who wish to collaborate with others several others in the preparation of plans for a special issue of the journal \"Photosynthesis Research\"devoted to the history of this field of biology.  One of the PIs (Govindjee)  has for 13 years edited a feature of the same journal entitled \"Personal Perspectives,\"  which are prepared by investigators describing their careers and activities.  Twenty-six of these perspectives have appeared.  The proposed volume will build upon this record with other recollections and additional information in seeking to provide a historical overview of research in photosynthesis.\r\n\r\nOne PI (Govindjee) is especially well prepared for this project by his previous forays into history;  the other (Gest) is also well-recognized.  Their careers give them personal experience and knowledge of many of the key events and people that they intend to examine.   The PIs have been invited to spend time at Scripps Institution of Oceanography where they will work with two other senior scholars and researchers in this field (Andrew Benson and George Feher) to fine tune their plans for the special historical issue on photosynthesis research.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
