 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Exploring phylogenetic trends of gene sequence, protein form and function to comprehend processes of molecular evolution.\"  The photosynthetic gene rbcL and a large phylogeny are being used to link molecular selection linking gene sequence to protein form and function.  Evolutionary trends are being used to reveal patterns of molecular selection that are otherwise invisible and are helping to generate viable theories about gene-protein relationships. The research is focused on developing generally applicable models of gene and protein evolution and providing informatic tools to question processes of molecular selection in other genes and systems.\r\n",
