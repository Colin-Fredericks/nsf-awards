The CE applications are being adapted and implemented from the research and educational literature, targeting these applications toward a different audience, our women students. Since the concepts underlying separation techniques are fundamental to research in many areas of science and since capillary electrophoresis is rapidly becoming the separation tool of choice in many modern laboratories, it is important for students to become knowledgeable with this technology. We are incorporating CE separation of caffeine in beverages into our General Chemistry courses and some of these students are using CE separations for their end-of-the-year project. In Analytical Chemistry, students are gaining an understanding of separation parameters through the application of CE technology in the investigation of \"real world\" problems such as water pollution. In Biological Chemistry, CE is being used to investigate amino acid charge/pH relationships, to sequence a dipeptide, to separate DNA restriction fragments, and to investigate parameters important in protein separations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
