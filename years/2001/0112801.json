 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop new methods for the efficient dissemination of the data collected by wireless\r\nsensor networks. With recent and projected advances in small, low cost microelectronic and micro-electromechanical sensors, it is easy to envision that a large array of sensors, distributed over an\r\nappropriate region, will be able to measure the spatial and temporal variations of important attribute\r\nfield such as temperature, moisture, sound, light, gas concentrations, etc.. However, to realize the\r\nbenefits of such arrays, wireless communication networks must be devised that with low power encode\r\nand disseminate the large amounts of data they generate. With this as the goal, the project will\r\ndevelop new methods of distributed data compression and data dissemination for dense sensor arrays,\r\nthat is, for arrays whose sensors are so close that their measurements are highly correlated. One thesis\r\nof this project is that the correlations in such arrays can be exploited in order to make the network\r\noperate essentially as efficiently as a sparse sensor network, while having the additional advantages of\r\nbeing resilient to sensor failures and permitting the attribute field to be measured adaptively or with\r\nhigher spatial resolution. Another thesis is that the data compression and dissemination issues for\r\nsuch networks are deeply intertwined. Accordingly, the project focuses on the joint design of such.\r\nFor example, it seeks methodology for tailoring distributed data compression methods to partcular\r\ndissemination strategies, and vice versa. In the process, it proposed to learn how the performance of\r\nsensor networks depends on a variety of issues such as the number and placement of sensors.",
