 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will synthesize novel diquaternary amines with a high selectivity towards platinum group metals (PGMs) from acidic chloride media. State-of-the-art molecular modeling techniques will be utilized to predict structures likely to have a high affinity for the anions of interest.  The diquaternary amines are predicted to have a much greater selectivity than comparable monoquaternary amines due to increased steric interactions between the two nitrogens and the polyvalent ion of interest. These compounds will facilitate the separation and purification of high value metals, such as platinum, palladium and rhodium, from base metals using solvent extraction techniques.  The diquaternary amines will be synthesized, characterized and then evaluated in comparison with an existing monoquaternary amine (Aliquat 336) that has already been used in PGMs separation.  \r\n\r\nImproved separation of PGMs will lead to a reduction in metal costs, facilitate recycling (e.g. auto exhaust catalysts) and thus minimize the dependence of the United States on imported PGM supplies.  These novel diquaternary amines will primarily have applications in precious metal refining.  Additionally, they could also be used in the separation and purification of actinides, such as plutonium, and in the preconcentration of trace levels of certain anions (e.g. chromate, arsenate) to aid in environmental analysis\r\n",
