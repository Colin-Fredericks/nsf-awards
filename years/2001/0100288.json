 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will continue his research on analytic number \r\ntheory, algebraic combinatorics, and the theory and application of\r\nmultiple basic hypergeometric series.  The investigator recently\r\nderived many infinite families of explicit exact formulas involving\r\neither squares or triangular numbers, two of which generalize\r\nJacobi's (1829) 4 and 8 squares identities to 4n^2 or 4n(n+1)\r\nsquares, respectively, without using cusp forms. He similarly\r\ngeneralized to infinite families all of Jacobi's explicitly stated \r\ndegree 2, 4, 6, 8 Lambert series expansions of classical theta\r\nfunctions. These results, depending on new expansions for powers of\r\nvarious products of classical theta functions, arise in the setting of\r\nJacobi elliptic functions, continued fractions, Hankel or Turanian\r\ndeterminants, Lie algebras, and Schur functions.  The investigator\r\nfirst plans to finish his derivation of the infinite families of explicit\r\nexact sums of squares identities (excluding those above)  for n^2 or\r\nn(n+1) squares, respectively, that he has already shown to exist. \r\nThese will include  explicit identities for an odd number of squares.\r\nNext, he plans to prove additional Kac--Wakimoto conjectures for\r\ntriangular numbers.  In the area of algebraic combinatorics, the \r\ninvestigator will develop the combinatorial and number theoretic\r\nimplications of his new formulas for Ramanujan's tau function that\r\nare directly related to the Leech lattice.\r\n\r\nThe above project utilizes explicit combinatorial and analytic \r\nmethods to study the problem of representing an integer as a sum of\r\nsquares of integers. This problem is one of the oldest and most\r\nsignificant in mathematics. It goes back at least  2000 years to\r\nDiophantus, and continues more recently with the works of Fermat,\r\nEuler, Lagrange, Jacobi, Glaisher, Ramanujan, Hardy, Mordell,\r\nAndrews, and others.  Jacobi's  elliptic function approach dates from\r\nhis epic ``Fundamenta Nova'' of 1829.  He found elegant simple\r\nformulas for counting the number of ways that any fixed positive\r\ninteger n can be written as a sum of  2, 4, 6, or 8 squares. \r\nApplications of modular forms to sums of squares really started in\r\n1917 with Mordell.  This approach provides abstract formulas for\r\nany given number of squares as  the Fourier coefficients of modular\r\nforms.  In 1965 Rankin proved that any one of these formulas, for\r\nmore than 8 squares, would be highly non-trivial to compute\r\nexplicitly.  Since 1829, explicit exact non-trivial formulas have\r\nonly been found for up to 32 squares, with an even number of\r\nsquares much easier than an odd number.  The investigator used his\r\ncombinatorial/elliptic function methods to derive infinite families of\r\nexpansions of powers of classical theta functions, and the\r\ncorresponding non-trivial explicit sums of squares formulas.  (See\r\nhttp://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.NT/0008068). This is the first time\r\nthat infinite families of  non-trivial exact explicit formulas for\r\nsums of squares have been found.  All of this work gives a new elegant\r\nextension of the classical formulas of Jacobi.",
