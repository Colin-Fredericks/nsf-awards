 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) \r\nThis proposal describes the development of instructional materials for an innovative course, entitled The Molecules of Life, which is aimed at undergraduate non-science majors. The project addresses an urgent need to improve science education for students who do not specialize in science but must be scientifically literate in order to make informed decisions as citizens in their personal lives and future careers. The target audience for the course includes undergraduates in the liberal arts, business majors, and students training to be teachers. The Molecules of Life uses modern topics such as protein structure, drug design, and the immune response to convey our understanding of biomolecular function and how this knowledge is applied in combating human disease. Existing resources for biochemistry instruction are not suitable for this course since they are designed for science majors or students studying for health professions. Therefore, we are developing three types of educational materials for The Molecules of Life: written instructional modules; an interactive web site incorporating molecular graphics exercises; and multi-week, inquiry-based laboratory projects on enzyme structure and function. The instructional modules are being written in collaboration with NYU research faculty, thereby enhancing faculty development and connecting research and teaching activities. Utilizing sophisticated graphics software in a course for non-science majors is a creative application of a \r\ntechnology that is currently underutilized in this context. Laboratory projects are being designed with the assistance of graduate students who then teach the laboratory sections, a combined experience that enhances their training as teachers. Instructional materials are evaluated by faculty both within and outside NYU, and the effectiveness of the course is assessed from student evaluations. The materials and course results are disseminated via commercial publication, workshops, and articles in science education journals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
