 "awd_abstract_narration": "0104935\r\nMiksis\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, it is planned to investigate both the problem of the \r\nspreading of a liquid along a solid substrate and the spreading of a liquid \r\nalong a liquid interface. The Navier-Stokes equations will govern the \r\nmotion of the fluids.  The investigation of the spreading of a liquid along a \r\nsolid substrate is interesting and difficult because of the singularities that \r\ncan occur at the contact line. Spreading along a liquid interface is a \r\nchallenging problem where multiple free boundaries can exist.  Here, in \r\naddition to the liquid/liquid and liquid/gas boundaries, a triple junction can \r\nexist at the liquid/liquid/gas line of intersection.  Predicting the dynamics \r\nof these three phase lines is one of the aims of this proposal.   We will be \r\ninterested in situations where the interfaces are clean and situations where \r\nsurfactants are present. Mathematically we are faced with problems having \r\ncoupled moving interfaces along which singularities can exits.  Both \r\nasymptotic and numerical methods will be used to study these complex \r\nfree boundary problems.  For example, we will consider the thin film limit \r\nwhere the complete three-dimensional system of equations can be reduced \r\nto a coupled system of nonlinear evolution equations.  We will also apply \r\nthe level-set numerical method to solve the complete nonlinear system of \r\nequations.\r\n\r\nWhen a liquid drop is resting on a solid surface, the free boundary of the \r\ndrop is characterized by the gas/liquid interface, and the line of contact \r\nbetween the liquid/gas/solid phases.  This three-phase line is usually \r\nreferred to as the contact line.  It occurs whenever three phases come into \r\ncontact.  It is a familiar phenomena of everyday life, and can be observed \r\nwhen one pours oil into a frying pan or in a partially filled wine glass. It \r\nalso occurs in many areas of practical interest.  Examples are industrial \r\ncoating processes, the transport of gas/liquid mixtures in pipes, the \r\nspreading of droplets of medication in the lungs and the spreading of \r\nliquid wastes (e.g. oil or chemicals) on the sea.  The latter problem is an \r\nexample of a situation where the contact line (refereed to as the triple \r\njunction in this case) occurs at the intersection of a liquid/liquid/gas \r\ninterface.  Even though the contact line occurs in these many areas, our \r\nunderstanding of it is very limited. Models are still being developed and \r\nbecause of the mathematical singularities associated with the behavior of \r\nthe solutions in the neighborhood of the contact line, solution techniques, \r\nboth analytical and numerical, need to be identified.\r\n",
