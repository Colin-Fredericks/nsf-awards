 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multidisciplinary (99) Although the National Science Education Standards recommend that science instruction should be universally accessible, individuals with disabilities are seriously underrepresented in science and have poor scientific literacy due to inadequate preparation/accommodations at all educational levels. This project aims to address the needs of persons with disabilities for adequate education in the sciences through faculty development, better preparation of pre-service teachers, and adaptive technology. The current effort is an expansion of a project previously funded by NSF that pilot-tested the concept and focused on biology. This project, Creating Laboratory Access for Science Students (the \"CLASS\" Project), which was titled \"Making biology laboratories effective learning environments for students with disabilities: a national model for undergraduate instructors and grades 7-12 school teachers,\" is a collaboration at Wright State University (WSU) between the Department of Biological Sciences (College of Science) and the Teacher Education Department (College of Education) and the Office of Disability Services (ODS, Student Services). WSU was constructed in 1967 to be architecturally barrier free and has gained a national reputation for curricular programming for students with disabilities. The CLASS project has developed five disseminable products: (i) a Sourcebook (printed and electronic) to assist science teachers in designing and implementing universally accessible lab and field exercises, (ii) an accessible and interactive website (http://biology.wright.edu/labgrant/index.html) where workshop applications can be completed on line and where prior workshop participants can discuss issues or access the PowerPoint presentation, (iii) human resource development for educators via a two week residential workshop at WSU where they acquire necessary skills, (iv) human resource development for high school students with severe disabilities via a one week residential science camp where they work one-on-one with educator participants in experiential science activities, and (v) published scholarly articles and presentations at professional meetings.\r\n\r\nThe CLASS project is now extending these proven educational materials and strategies across all natural and physical sciences, helping to systemically reform the science education of students with disabilities. Objectives of the project are:\r\n1. To develop a broader external audience. This is being accomplished through production of media as follows: (a) a Leadership Series of 5-minute discussion-generating videos that will be used at national and regional professional meetings of educators (college/university science faculty and educators in science and math) to train cadres of educators (300 per year) in dealing with disability issues in their laboratories through problem based learning (b) a Tutorial Series of short videoclips in analog and electronic (QuickTime) format that will be available on the web for use in pre-service teacher training (regular classroom and distance learning) as well as by individuals working at their computers (potentially impacting over 1000 educators per year) and (c) a promotional video for the CLASS summer residential workshop for recruitment purposes. Expanded website capabilities support these initiatives, including a bulletin board with topical forums.\r\n2. To develop more comprehensive programs on site. The scope of the residential CLASS summer workshop at WSU is being broadened to include other natural and physical sciences and mathematics. \r\n3. To become a model for excellence in accessible science education. This is being accomplished through integration of CLASS goals and disseminable products into the science education curriculum at WSU (pre-service teachers; pedagogy and content courses). \r\n\r\nThrough interdisciplinary approaches (broadly encompassing lab/field issues common to basic physical, natural and mathematical sciences) aimed at targeting multiple levels in the educational pipeline (college and university faculty, training of pre-service teachers) the CLASS project aims to significantly increase access to laboratory science education of students with disabilities. \r\n\r\n",
