 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant  establishes  at Central Michigan University a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site.  During Summer 2002, eight students recruited nationwide will be actively engaged in mathematical research during the eight-week program.  The primary objective is to stimulate talented undergraduate students to pursue graduate work in science and mathematics by providing accessible and challenging research problems in mathematics.  Typical problem areas include a 'sign game' on projective planes, Laplacian spectrum of graphs, Schur stability of matrices, and divisible difference sets.  \r\n\r\nThree faculty members will coordinate the effort.  Students will work in groups of two with one faculty mentor.  Students will make presentations of their progress during weekly seminars.  Each student will submit a written report at the end of the program.  Students will be encouraged to publish their work and make presentations at professional meetings.  Every effort will be made during recruitment process to attract applications from students in under-represented groups.  \r\n\r\nTo complement the research experience, a number of enrichment activities have been planned.  An ethics workshop, led by members of the Philosophy and Religion Department, will enable student participants to begin considering ethical issues related to research in the sciences, particularly in mathematics.  A day trip to Dow Chemical or Ford Motor will provide some exposure to mathematics in the workplace.  A weekend trip to Mackinac Island will provide a broader historical perspective on the state of Michigan.  \r\n\r\nPoint of Contact:\r\nDr. Sivaram Narayan\r\n989-774-5595\r\nsivaram.narayan@cmich.edu\r\n",
