Their physical analogs are macroscopic properties of \r\nperiodic media  (such as a crystal substance), and the problem is to \r\nunderstand how such properties can be recovered from microscopic \r\ncharacteristics and vice versa. A large part of the project belongs to \r\na borderline between geometry and dynamics, and in particular new \r\napplications of geometric methods. For instance, problems of stability \r\nin sequential dynamics model situations where the laws of evolution of \r\nan object (for instance, a physical  or an ecological system) are subject \r\nto small perturbations; it is desirable to understand the result of such \r\nperturbations in the large time scale. There are also  applications of \r\nmodern geometry of singular spaces to problems originated from statistical \r\nphysics (such as estimates on the number of collisions of particles in \r\ngas models, a problem that goes back to Boltzmann), and to computational \r\nproblems (such as: how to numerically find a shortest path between\r\naround several obstacles). The last part of the project deals with \r\nstability of geometric objects described  by curvature-type \r\ncharacteristics. Indeed, whenever we study a geometric object \r\n(for instance, a surface), we deal with imprecise information. Thus it is \r\nimportant to understand whether small deviations in this information \r\ncan result in crucial changes for the geometric object (or even a \r\nnon-existence of a model object).\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n",
