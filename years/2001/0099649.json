 "awd_abstract_narration": "0099649\r\nSawyer\r\nThis SGER award will support a feasibility study of the effect of nanoparticle strenghthening of polymers for tribological applications.  There are strong indications that polymers filled with hard nanoparticles\r\nwill exhibit significant improvements in tribological performance as\r\ncompared to traditional filled polymers.  Polymers are widely used in\r\nbearing applications because they provide quiet continuous operation, have a\r\nlow coefficient of friction, absorb vibrations, are compliant and\r\nnon-abrasive to the counterface, can be easily manufactured, are\r\ninexpensive, non-corrosive, and are generally biocompatible.  The challenge\r\nin designing bearings with homogeneous polymeric materials is their low wear\r\nresistance (high wear rates).  Hard filler particles are frequently added to\r\nimprove the wear resistance, however these hard filler particles increase\r\nthe abrasive wear to the counterface and increase the sliding coefficient of\r\nfriction.  Lubricious fillers are also added to polymers and under certain\r\noperating conditions can reduce the wear rate and the coefficient of\r\nfriction, however a constant supply of lubricous filler must be available at\r\nthe wear surface and these materials are frequently sensitive to the\r\nenvironment.  The ideal filler for polymers would be inert, reinforcing,\r\nnon-abrasive, and reduce the coefficient of friction.  There is good\r\nevidence that nanoparticle filled polymers may be this 'ideal' composite.\r\nFor example, recent studies have shown that the wear resistance can increase\r\nin polymer composites filled with hard nanoparticles, while at the same time\r\nthe wear of the counterbody decreases and the sliding coefficient of\r\nfriction decreases.  This type of tribological behavior will have an impact\r\nin polymeric bearings covering the spectrum from industrial applications\r\nneeding dry sliding bearings, to orthopaedic implant materials, to\r\nself-lubricating bearings for space environments.\r\n\r\nIn order to design composites with the optimum properties and predict\r\nperformance, however, some severe limitations must be overcome.  First, our\r\nunderstanding of the mechanisms contributing to wear performance in filled\r\npolymers is poor.  For example, the role of the filler / matrix interface\r\nand the effect of particle size has not been well studied nor are there\r\nappropriate models that consider the interface or size of the filler.\r\nSecondly, it is unclear for non-lubricious nanoparticles what the mechanism\r\nis that lowers the coefficient of friction.  Finally, nanoparticle filled\r\npolymers have not comprehensively explored for wear applications despite the\r\nstrong evidence suggesting large improvements in performance.\r\n\r\nThe overall scientific goal of the project is to gain a fundamental\r\nunderstanding of the wear mechanisms in filled polymers by a) experimentally\r\nisolating the effects of particle size (10 nm to 10 micrometers), particle\r\naspect ratio (1 to 1000), dispersion, filler / matrix interface, and matrix\r\nproperties on performance, and 2) obtaining a parametric understanding of\r\nthe correlation between wear behavior and other mechanical properties, 3)\r\nmodeling of the wear properties.\r\n***\r\n",
