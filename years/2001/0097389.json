 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins are one of the major constituents of biological systems, and are involved in all aspects of cell life, from structure to function and reproduction.  The goal of this REU site is to expose ten undergraduate students to basic research by having them involved in projects exploring different areas of protein structure and function.  At least six of these students will be selected from four-year institutions, mostly within the state of Alabama.  A special effort will be made to recruit students from groups under-represented in science, including female and minorities.  The Principal Investigator will be visiting different campuses during the fall semester to promote the program and interview potential candidates.  Some of these campuses are four-year traditionally minority institutions, including Alabama State University in Montgomery, Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Talladega College and Tuskegee University. The studies will be carried out in different academic units on campus, including Biology, Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry and Pharmacology.  Although each student will be working on an individual project, they will be meeting regularly to follow up on the progress of all other projects.  The students working in this REU will also participate and discuss their progress during three regularly scheduled discussions with other undergraduates participating in the Summer Undergraduate Research Programs organized every year by the host institution.  In addition, all students in the REU site will attend weekly presentations by each of the investigators with projects in this site, to expose the participants to every project and to the different ways in which investigators from different disciplines approach the area of protein biochemistry.  The participants will write reports and also will present their results in poster format either on campus (during the Undergraduate Research Week held in the Fall) or at their own campuses.  The overall quality of this experience will be assessed by having students complete questionnaires prior and after the summer research and to make improvements for future cycles.  Faculty advisors also will be asked to complete a questionnaire at the end of the summer to improve the program in subsequent years.  Information and dissemination of the program will be done through the Committee for Undergraduate Research's web page, at http://www.southalabama.edu/biomedical/ucur/.  \r\n\r\n",
