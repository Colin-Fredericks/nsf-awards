 "awd_abstract_narration": "In December 1999, the U.S. Department of Education redefined career education by structuring occupational programs into 16 new career clusters. One of these clusters is Information Technology (IT), but the remaining 15 all have IT aspects. The basic premise of this project is that there should be commonality of approach to IT curriculum over the remaining 15 clusters. The project assumes that all technician workers need IT content as part of their preparation, and that content should include a core of knowledge necessary for IT literacy. This project is developing a guiding curriculum framework and associated materials for instructors in schools and two-year colleges to use in addressing the IT aspects in 6 of the clusters. \r\n\r\nThe major objectives are to:\r\na. Develop a common language defining \"IT applications\" and to develop a common curricular framework that apply across the clusters; \r\nb. Work with community and technical college faculty to develop, pilot and validate a set of resource guidebooks in 6 of the 15 clusters (Manufacturing; Transportation; Distribution and Logistic Services; Health Services; Human Services, Scientific Research, Engineering and Technical Services; and Education and Training Services.) Each guidebook is designed to give practical information for teaching IT applications in a particular cluster, providing instructional models on how to develop scenario-based lessons structured around tasks and problems found in authentic workplace situations, assessment rubrics, and student record-keeping tools.\r\nc. Enhance the educational outcomes of the career cluster initiatives by ensuring that the IT applications are integrated into the curriculum developed by each of these clusters.\r\nd. Disseminate Resource Guides through each career cluster's own dissemination mechanism and through the national leadership organizations.\r\n\r\nPartners in this project include Lorain County Community College, Middlesex Community College, MPR Associates, and The National Association of State Directors of Vocational and Technical Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
