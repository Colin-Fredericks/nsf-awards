 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) \r\n\r\nThe Geology Department at Hamilton is adapting the concept of the \"studio classroom\", which has been used successfully at other institutions to teach physics, mathematics, and engineering, to create a networked studio classroom for polarized light microscopy. The project combines the systematic use of technology within an environment that enables cooperative learning. The \"studio\" features clusters of four petrographic work stations configured to promote student group work. Each petrographic microscope has an integrated live video feed networked to a computer at the cluster. The instructor has a central work station with incoming video feeds, one from each cluster, and two outgoing feeds, one to each of two data projectors. The instructor's work station serves as a selection and switching device so that a real- time video image from any of the microscopes can be delivered to either of the data projectors for display on a large screen for student discussion. The classroom allows us to revolutionize teaching of the microscopic study of geologic materials in virtually all courses in the Department and to introduce inquiry- based activities, cooperative learning, and group learning that are difficult in a traditional microscopy lab, where each student works in isolation. \r\n",
