 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research and education Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project seeks to:  (1) advance understanding of how e-commerce and electronic exchanges impact supply chains and to develop decision technologies that will aid companies in effectively utilizing new opportunities provided by e-commence;  and (2) better prepare undergraduate and graduate students for today's digital economy and to disseminate new technologies developed through research.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will develop and investigate techniques to match buyers and sellers in exchanges, analyze dynamic pricing mechanisms that are currently used in or being developed for business-to-business e-commerce, and investigate the impacts of spot markets made possible by e-exchanges on supply chain coordination and performance.  It is also planned to implement techniques developed in industrial settings.  A closely integrated education effort will develop new undergraduate and graduate courses on e-commerce technologies, and prepare case studies based on real industrial practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
