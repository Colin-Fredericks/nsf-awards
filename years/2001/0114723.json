 "awd_abstract_narration": "This demonstration project, a collaborative network of faculty, public school teachers\r\nand counselors, and professionals in both private sector/non-profit organizations will\r\ndeliver and evaluate activities designed to bolster and reinforce the interest of \r\nmiddle-school girls in SMET disciplines and careers. These activities are based on \r\nresearch showing that access to role models, career information, and hands-on\r\nactivities have beneficial effects. A hands-on summer workshop, industrial site \r\ntours, classroom activities, visits with women scientists and engineers, activities\r\ndeveloped in conjunction with commercial and service organizations, and a web site\r\ncharacterize the intervention for the 6th and 7th grade girls who participate. \r\nFurthermore, in response to research showing that professional development for\r\nteachers, interactions between teachers and scientists, and implementation of \r\nmethods to address diversity and gender equity issues are of paramount importance\r\nin creating more gender equitable classrooms, middle-school and high-school teacher\r\nin science and mathematics will be invited to partner with University faculty in \r\ndeveloping the summer workshop activities. In addition, they will be invited to \r\nparticipate in a graduate-level course on gender equity in science and mathematics \r\neducation and conduct action research projects that can be shared within the \r\ncollaborative network. Finally, packets with information on both various SMET \r\ncareers and on women who are currently employed in these fields, will be \r\ndistributed to school counselors, the parents of girls in Girl Scout troops, and \r\nthe parents of those girls who participate in the project activities. Summative \r\nevaluation will focus on the comparison of SMET course-taking patterns and course\r\ngrades of participants in the project activities compared to a matched sample of \r\ngirls who did not participate.",
