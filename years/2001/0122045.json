 "awd_abstract_narration": "EXTRUDED FIBER-REINFORCED CEMENT COMPOSITES FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL ABSTRACT\r\nConcrete can be stronger, more durable, more fire-resistant, and perform more consistently than wood, making it a good material for residential construction.  However, plain concrete is relatively brittle and heavy.  Those drawbacks can be overcome with special processing techniques and fiber reinforcement.  Recently extrusion technology has been adapted for the production of high-performance, fiber-reinforced composites at Northwestern University's ACBM Center.  In this process, a highly viscous mixture of cement paste and micro-fibers is forced through a die of desired cross-section.  Extruded compositions are stronger, more ductile and more impervious to water than conventional concrete.\r\n\tThe objective of this proposed research is to develop extruded, high-performance composites suitable for residential construction, particularly advanced panel systems.  The composites will be designed to accomplish the PATH goals of improved durability, reduced maintenance costs, and reduced risk of life, injury, and property destruction from natural hazards.  Different cross-sections, with a focus on cellular construction, will be developed for the production of lightweight elements and advanced panel systems.  Collaboration with the Chicago Board of Housing and suppliers to the construction industry will provide avenues to introduce these products to builders and contractors.  \r\n",
