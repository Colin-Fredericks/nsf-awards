Sparse networks of GPS receivers provide accurate ground motions over a limited number of points while the space-based InSAR technique provides higher spatial resolution (~100 m) and global access but poor temporal resolution.  Suitable civilian SAR satellites have been flown by the European Space Agency (ERS-1 and ERS-2) as well as by the Japanese Space agency (JERS-1 and ALOS - 2003 launch date).  These data are largely unexplored and are of enormous value for assessing the earthquake risk in Southern California.  The investigators will use these data to monitor co-seismic, post-seismic, and inter-seismic crustal deformation.  Published models of the earthquake cycle predict that much of the diagnostic crustal strain occurs within 10 km of the fault zone and thus it will not be observed by the relatively coarse distribution of GPS monuments (> 10 km spacing).  The proposed tasks include:  \r\ndevelopment of high-resolution topographic models for accurate removal of topographic phase from change interferograms; \r\nestimation of the depth distribution of slip on the 1999 Hector Mine rupture; \r\nexamination of post-seismic slip at the Landers and Hector Mine ruptures in relation to the earthquake cycle models; \r\nmonitoring creep rate and creep depth along major faults in Southern California; \r\ndevelopment of a boundary-element model of the Southern California fault system; \r\nand preparation for L-band SAR data to be collected by the Japanese ALOS mission. \r\n\r\n",
