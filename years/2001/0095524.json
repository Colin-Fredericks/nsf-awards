 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award Abstract\r\nSellers often have or may acquire proprietary information about the value of the object to\r\nbe sold. A conventional wisdom from auction theory is that a seller at auction will increase\r\nrevenues on average by adopting a policy of always revealing all her available information\r\nabout the object's value.\r\nOur project demonstrates that a seller will often do better by revealing no information.\r\nMore generally, a policy of partial information revelation is better than both no revelation\r\nand full revelation.\r\nFull revelation policies unambiguously enhance revenue only under special circumstances.\r\nDespite this limitation, full revelation has been routinely advocated and adopted by sellers.\r\nFor instance, a full revelation policy was adopted by the FCC in its design of spectrum\r\nauctions. Similar policies were subsequently implemented by other nations selling spectrum\r\nrights. We demonstrate that quite generally the seller can increase her expected revenue by\r\ncarefully crafting a policy that conceals part of her information. We describe a procedure\r\nfor crafting such a policy.\r\n",
