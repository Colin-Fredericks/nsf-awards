 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funds for an international conference called \"Climate and Biota of the Early Paleogene,\" which will bring together scientists from multiple disciplines.  including climate and ocean modeling, paleoceanography, a variety of subdisciplines in paleontology, stable isotope and trace element geochemistry, paleosols, stratigraphy,\r\nsedimentology and tectonics. During the 2  days of talk and poster sessions participants will lay out the most recent results of their research, and discuss avenues for research in the next decade. During the 1  days of field trips, participants will be guided through the classic continental sequences of Paleocene-Eocene rocks in the Bighorn Basin by the researchers who have done the primary work in this area. Participation by international scientists from a variety of disciplines is key to integrating records of climatic and biotic change from different parts of the world, and to broadening the perspectives of all participants. Three published products will result from this meeting: 1) an abstract volume to be published privately and distributed at the meeting to all participants;  2) a series of papers on the paleontology and geology of the Paleocene-Eocene sequence in the Bighorn Basin, along with a field guide and road log for the field trips to be published as a University of Michigan Paper on Paleontology; 3) GSA Special Papers may also publish a proceedings volume from this meeting. \r\n\r\n",
