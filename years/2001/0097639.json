 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding to support the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Center for Great Lakes Studies (CGLS). The program will host ten nationally recruited undergraduate students in a cohesive, multi-disciplinary science research training program. The program lasts for ten weeks in the summer, during which the students will conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty mentor or as part of a research team. Workshops on instrumentation, graduate school, career opportunities, writing and public presentation of results will be offered. Students will also participate in a variety of fieldwork aboard the R/V LAURENTIAN. At the close of the program, students will present a poster and a 15- minute oral presentation of their research results. They also will write a short journal article that can be submitted for possible publication. The program is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a profession and for training young researchers. This program is well designed to encourage highly motivated students to continue the their pursuit of research careers in oceanography and limnology. It encourages interdisciplinary research and offers the students opportunities for field research experience. The program will encourage a diverse set of students to continue their education in the field of oceanography. In the past the program has had more than 50% female participants, has drawn students from across the nation, and has attracted an ethnically diverse group of students.",
