 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) To fully understand how organisms work, biologists in the post- genomic era must find new ways to incorporate our abundant molecular data into the larger context of cellular and organismal physiology. Towards this end, we are strengthening the physiology curriculum at Harvey Mudd College by adding a new Comparative Physiology Laboratory. This course accompanies a sophomore- level lecture course, Structure and Function, which covers cellular, animal, and plant physiological mechanisms. The laboratory course uses the novel approach of presenting physiology as a set of unique solutions to common problems. Animal, plant and fungal models are being used as systems in which to examine energetics, ionic regulation and signaling. The course is structured to allow both breadth and depth. During the first nine weeks, students perform a wide range of exercises, many of which are adapted from other successful laboratory courses developed at other institutions (e.g., Grinnell College, Swarthmore College, Pomona College, University of New Hampshire). In a second meeting each week, students complete each exercise by developing a testable hypothesis about the system. These hypotheses provide the starting point for self- initiated research projects designed, carried out and presented by students in the final five weeks of the course.",
