 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of the FASEB summer research conference entitled \"Transport ATPases: From Genomics to Mechanism\" is to bring together about 150 scientists throughout the world working on transport ATPases in order to share new information and ideas about this increasingly important area. Specifically, this conference, via about 50 talks, 100 posters, and both informal and organized discussions, will disseminate new information about transport ATPases ranging from genomics to mechanism as implied by the title. The conference includes 7 session with topics as follows: l) Genomics of transport ATPases; 2) P-type ATPases I (Calcium ATPases); 3) P-type ATPases II (proton, proton/potassium, and sodium /potassium ATPases); 4) F-type ATPases; 5) V-type ATPases; 6) ABC transporters; and 7) new, or relatively unique, ATPase-dependent transporters or channels. This is the only established conference in the world focused entirely on transport ATPases. The new information that will be discussed at this meeting is directly relevant to how a wide variety of ions, metabolites, and drugs move across biological membranes of animals, plants, and bacteria, and how the energy of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to this movement. This conference will capitalize on a number of recent achievements including the completion of the sequencing of the human genome, the resolution of several transport ATPase structures at atomic resolution, and the discovery of several new transport ATPases of considerable significance.",
