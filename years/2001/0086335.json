 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project allows for the continuing collaboration of Southwest Missouri State University (SMSU) with Springfield Public Schools (SPS) in a nationally recognized manner. The plan includes the involvement of twelve GK-12 Fellows (four graduate students and eight senior undergraduate students) for year one of the project and 16 GK-12 Fellows (eight graduate students and eight senior students) for years two and three of the project. Initial training of the GK-12 Fellows will include a two-week session prior to the beginning of the academic year. Training will continue through the academic year with weekly follow-up meetings led by two SMSU faculty members. Goals and objectives of this program have been developed in collaboration with SPS. Four SPS Middle Schools will be targeted in this project based on a recent study conducted by a School Board appointed task force on the dropout problem in Springfield. These four middle schools feed into high schools with the largest dropout rates. GK-12 Fellows will work with SMSU faculty and middle school teachers to make a significant positive impact on student-teacher contact and student learning in selected middle schools within the SPS system.\r\n\r\n",
