 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports research to develop a new theory of the tunneling density of states in strongly correlated electron systems.  One thrust of the research aims at reconciling theory and data from experiments on tunneling into quantum Hall edges.  The PI will also work on the related problem of tunneling into fractional quantum Hall effect systems with smooth edges.  The educational component of the research involves creating a work-study program to effectively expose undergraduate physics majors to theoretical materials research.  Well-conceived projects that are integrated into the PI's research provide vehicles for one-on-one and peer interaction.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award supports theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics. The PI will use advanced theoretical methods to study tunneling into exotic non-Fermi liquid states that occur in quantum Hall systems.  The research may contribute to the theoretical foundation underlying future nanoelectronic devices.  The educational component of the research involves creating a work-study program to effectively expose undergraduate physics majors to theoretical materials research.  Well conceived projects that are integrated into the PI's research provide a vehicle for one-on-one and peer interaction.\r\n",
