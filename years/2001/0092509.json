 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nAn important issue that bears on all practical economic analysis is the extent to which\r\nwe can expect to understand economic phenomena by the process of developing a theory,\r\ntaking observations and fitting a model. An especially relevant question in practice is\r\nwhether there are limits on how well we can predict future observations using empirical\r\nmodels that are obtained by such processes. Finding quantitative expression for these\r\nlimits is the main subject of the project.\r\nA primary limitation on empirical knowledge is that the true model for any given data\r\nis unknown and, in all practical cases, unknowable. This is because even if the formulated\r\nmodel were correct it would still depend on parameters that need to be estimated from\r\ndata. Often, the data is scarce relative to the number of parameters that need to be\r\nestimated, and this is especially so in models that have some functional representation\r\nthat necessitates the use of nonparametric or semiparametric methods. In such situations\r\none might expect that the empirical limitations on modeling are greater than in finite\r\nparameter models. Using reasoning that was pioneered by Jorma Rissanen in 1987, the\r\nauthor has shown in collaborative work with Werner Ploberger in 1999 that there is a\r\nquantitative bound on how close an empirical model can get (in terms of its log likelihood\r\nratio) to the true model. This bound depends on the data itself as well as the model that\r\nis being used. A discovery that seems important in applications to economic data is that\r\nthe magnitude of the bound depends on the presence and nature of trends in the data.\r\nIn particular, the achievable distance is greater for trending data than when the data are\r\nstationary. This result gives quantitative expresssion to the intuitively appealing notion\r\nthat trending data is harder to predict than data that does not trend. The project develops\r\nand extends limitation results of this type to models where there are local and gross\r\nerrors of specification, to nonparametric situations where the dimension of the parameter\r\nspace is infinite or where it may grow with the sample size, that is, in situations where\r\nmodeling becomes more ambitious as more data becomes available. The project also seeks\r\nto develop explicit representations of the forecast error divergence so that the limits on\r\nempirical forecasting capability are quantifed. The intent of this project is to develop\r\nthe theory to a stage where the limits will be useful to empirical researchers, especially in\r\nterms of the implementation of model determination criteria that are designed to achieve\r\nthe empirical bounds.\r\nIn subsidiary wings of research that relate to this main theme, the project studies\r\nmore explicit issues of trend regression, where the order of magnitude of the trend is\r\nnot specifed but has to be estimated, where there is long memory in the data which is\r\npossibly nonstationary and the memory parameter must be estimated semiparametrically,\r\nand where there is nonstationary explanatory data but a limited dependent variable.\r\nThe latter study is relevant to market intervention policy by the Federal Reserve and\r\nTreasury. Thus, monetary policy intervention is a binary decision (intervene or not), yet\r\nthe explanatory variables that determine it involve a host of economic data, much of which\r\nhas nonstationary features, like the growth characteristics of industrial production and the\r\nrandom wandering behavior of stock prices. We seek to learn how various characteristics in\r\nthe explanatory data translate into the probability law for the binary variable and, hence,\r\nmarket intervention. Can these probability laws explain, for instance, the tendency of\r\nmarket intervention to lapse into long periods of little intervention broken by periods of\r\nregular intervention?",
