 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nSignal transduction networks are essential in eukaryotes, allowing cells to perceive and\r\nrespond to continuous changes in extracellular conditions. Multiple signaling pathways\r\nco-exist in individual cells controlling essential responses, including hormone signaling,\r\nmitogenesis and apoptosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which signaling\r\npathways cross talk with one another or by which specificity is conferred within a complex\r\nsignaling network is an area of present intensive research in eukaryotic biology. It has\r\nlong been recognized that most aspects of plant growth and development are regulated by\r\nnetworks of signaling mechanisms rather than linear signal transduction pathways.\r\nFurthermore, most plant cells express receptors for the six major classes of plant\r\nhormones and additional light and pathogen responsive receptors and need to process each\r\npathway, while also making use of cross talk among these pathways. Recent\r\ninterdisciplinary studies using new genetic, biochemical and genomic approaches have led\r\nto rapid and accelerating progress in understanding mechanisms that mediate cross talk and\r\nspecificity in plant signal transduction.\r\n\r\nHormones, light, pathogens and stress stimuli trigger signal transduction cascades that\r\nare essential for growth, development and survival of plants. The Keystone Symposium on\r\nSpecificity and Cross Talk in Plant Signal Transduction will be focused on presentations\r\non newly recognized reception and transduction mechanisms in these responses. The\r\norganizers have set up important avenues that will ensure diversity among presenters at\r\nthe conference and are requesting funds, that will enable travel support for graduate\r\nstudents, post doctoral associates and selected speakers, towards achieving the goal of\r\ndiversity and multidisciplinarity. The goal of the meeting will be to highlight major\r\nadvances in this rapidly moving field and to synthesize an integrated understanding of\r\nwhich mechanisms mediate cross talk among pathways and which mechanisms allow specific\r\nmodulation of plant growth and developmental responses. Understanding of these mechanisms\r\nis essential for manipulation of plant growth and development and for developing new\r\nbiotechnological applications, that will ultimately benefit human health.",
