Hauk\r\nUniversity of Washington\r\n\r\nCISE Research Infrastructure:  An Infrastructure for Integrated Systems Education and Innovation \r\n\r\nThe research contained in this proposal represents a wide-ranging investigation into the future of single-chip systems.  We will seek to develop a design methodology that can provide the benefits of multiple different resource types for numerous design domains.  To support the design of such cutting-edge silicon systems, we will develop innovative techniques to handle numerous design issues.  These will include investigations into the following critical issues in chip design:  Development of techniques for integrating RF and Analog components into future 1V SoC designs.  Creation of high-performance, power efficient digital logic families for supporting the stringent requirements of these systems.  Investigation into reconfigurable subsystems for SoC designs, providing post-fabrication customization for support of multi-protocol and multi-algorithm systems.  Integrated testing methodologies for complex, heterogeneous systems that can provide complete system test.  Complete simulation and design methodologies that can handle complete system integration, architectural exploration, and validation.  In addition to the development of new approaches to future chip design, we will also develop innovative techniques for educating future chip designers.  By providing an integrated curriculum in VLSI/CAD,  embedded systems, and complex system design, we will help create system architects capable of  harnessing these radically new design techniques and opportunities.  We will also seek to  increase the opportunities in chip design for new constituents, especially under-represented  groups to help increase the pipeline of new designers\r\n",
