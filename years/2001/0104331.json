The aim is to develop\r\neffective methods for computing Gromov-Witten invariants of \r\nsymplectic manifolds and enumerative invariants of algebraic \r\nmanifolds. This work builds on the P.I.'s recent work with E. Ionel \r\non the `sympletic sum formula' for GW invariants. The first project   \r\ninvolves extending the sum formula to the `modified  GW invariants' \r\nrecently defined by the P.I.'s student Junho Lee. This would make the \r\nformula applicable to  K\\\"ahler surfaces with $p_g>0$ where there are\r\nimportant  conjectures that are not currently approachable by GW\r\nmethods. The second project is a symplectic approach to understanding \r\nphysicists' predictions about the generating functions which count \r\ncurves in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The goal is to prove the predicted \r\nformulas by adapting some analytic methods C. Taubes  developed to relate \r\nthe Seiberg-Witten and Gromov invariants. The last two projects also relate \r\nto the sympletic sum formula.  One seeks  formulas  expressing the \r\nrelative Gromov-Witten invariants of a pair $(X,V)$ in terms of the\r\nusual GW invariants and the descendant classes of $X$ and $V$.  The \r\nother proposes  extending the sum formula to a more general type of \r\nsymplectic sum which occurs in algebraic geometry when one considers \r\nprojective linear systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most basic problems in mathematics is to determine the \r\nsolutions of a system of polynomial equations, and an important first \r\nstep toward that goal is to determine the NUMBER of solutions.  There \r\nis an explicit formula for the number of simultaneous solutions of a \r\nset of n  polynomials in n variables.  One can then ask for the \r\nnumber of  solutions for n  polynomials in n-1 variables.  In this \r\ncase there is a free parameter, so the locus of solutions will be a \r\nunion of curves.  How many?  This question has been systematically \r\nstudied for 100 years, but only a few  special cases\r\nwere solved.   Then, around 1990, it was realized that these problems \r\ncan be translated into symplectic geometry, and then tackeled using \r\nthe powerful machinery of mathematical gauge theory. (Gauge theory, \r\noriginally part of physics, has been the focus of many very fruitful \r\ninteractions between mathematicians and physicists  over the past \r\ntwenty years; it includes Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten theory, and \r\nString theory).  This  `Gromov-Witten invariant' approach led quickly \r\nto formulas answering some of the original enumerative problems, and \r\nthere are clear indications that there are more to be discovered. \r\nThis project is  aimed toward further developing the symplectic gauge \r\ntheory in order to produce\r\nadditional general formulas and to meld these formulas into a coherent theory.\r\n",
