 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the central impediment to the wide-spread exploration of the potential of  Local Composition Control (LCC) - the information pathway required for the representation and design of composition within a component and its realization by Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF).  It is hoped that the development of an information pathway to support Local Composition Control will provide designers with the access they need to fully explore this intriguing capability.   One of the great potential benefits of SFF technology is the ability to control the internal composition of components, a capability not shared by conventional mechanical manufacturing processes.  While several compelling applications such as Drug Delivery Devices and Lenses which function by local control of the index of refraction, are under development, it is likely that the potential is largely untapped. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work envisions a suite of Composition Design Features which the designer can use singly or in combination, to specify the composition of complex components.  Each composition design feature will relate directly to the geometry of the design, often relying on user interaction to specify critical aspects of the geometry.  For example, features can specify the composition of sub-volumes or the transition of composition between sub-volumes.  The representations underlying the composition design features will be analytic and therefore concise.  Wherever possible, the work on this project will be kept generically applicable to SFF technologies.  Where a specific process must be chosen to focus the work, Three Dimensional Printing will be used as the prototypical SFF technology.  3D Printing is well suited to local composition control as multiple materials may be printed through multiple inkjet nozzles, thereby achieving true 3-D composition control.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
