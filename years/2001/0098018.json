 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximation algorithms are efficient algorithms for combinatorial\r\noptimization problems that deliver solutions which are guaranteed to\r\nbe within a certain factor of the optimum. This area of theoretical\r\ncomputer science has seen a tremendous growth in the last decade for\r\nvarious reasons. First, several important techniques for designing\r\nsuch approximation algorithms have been discovered, including the use\r\nof convex optimization techniques and more specifically semidefinite\r\nprogramming. Also, major advances in complexity theory have lead to\r\nstrong non-approximability results, sometimes even showing that for\r\ncertain problems trivial approximation algorithms give the best\r\nguarantee one could hope for (unless P=NP).\r\n\r\nIn this project, which is a continuation of the PI prior CAREER award,\r\nthe emphasis is both on the design of general techniques for deriving\r\napproximation algorithms and also on obtaining improved approximation\r\nalgorithms for several classical hard optimization problems. The\r\nproblems to be considered include routing problems, the traveling\r\nsalesman problem, the Steiner tree problem, the sparsest cut problem,\r\nand scheduling problems.",
