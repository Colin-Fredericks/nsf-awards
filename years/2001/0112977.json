 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future generation mobile wireless communication systems (third generation\r\nand beyond) are expected to provide high data rates, accomodate highly\r\nmobile users, and support a wide variety of services including data, voice,\r\nvideo and interactive multimedia. Power (battery) limitations and\r\nthe scarcity of radio spectrum (relative to the ambitions of such services)\r\nwill dictate the need for cellular networks in which these resources\r\nmust be used highly efficiently so as to support the continued growth\r\nin demand for wireless services into the future. The\r\nessential infrastructure required at the physical\r\nlayer to fulfill this demand is a power and bandwidth efficient,\r\nmulti-antenna, multi-user wireless communications technology.\r\n\r\nThe investigators of this project will develop several key aspects of a\r\ntheory of  multi-user, multi-transmit antenna communication through a study\r\nof high-performance, interference resistant receivers, signature sequence\r\ndesigns and multi-user signal constellation optimization. Their goal is to\r\nrealize, through simple system design, the power and spectral efficiency\r\ntrade-offs that are achievable for multi-antenna wireless communications\r\nover fading channels. While emphasizing fundamental limits, the\r\ninvestigators will also focus on complexity constrained systems as well.\r\nThey will develop results in the theory of multi-user detection and\r\nsignature sequence optimization for multiple receive antennas for overloaded\r\nCDMA systems. Generalization of these results will be pursued to coded\r\nmodulation and multiple transmit (and receive) antenna systems in order to\r\nfurther improve the performance and/or achievable spectral efficiencies\r\nthrough more sophisticated signaling strategies combined with sub-optimal,\r\ncomplexity-constrained, high-performance multi-user decoding methods.\r\n\r\n",
