 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this project is to organize UNIF 2001,\r\nthe 15th International Workshop on Unification.\r\n\r\nUnification is concerned with the problem of identifying given \r\nterms, either syntactically or modulo a given logical theory. \r\nSyntactic unification is the basic operation of most automated \r\nreasoning systems, and unification modulo theories can be used,\r\nfor instance, to build in special equational theories into \r\ntheorem provers. \r\n\r\nUNIF 2001 will be the latest in a series of annual international\r\nworkshops on unification, the previous ones having been mostly in \r\nEurope (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) and twice in the US.\r\n\r\nThe aim of UNIF 2001, as that of the previous meetings, is to \r\nbring together people interested in unification, present recent \r\n(even unfinished) work, and discuss new ideas and trends in \r\nunification and related fields.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it is intended to offer a good opportunity for \r\nyoung researchers and researchers working in related areas to get \r\nan overview of the current state of the art in unification theory\r\nand get in contact with the experts in the field.\r\n\r\nIn addition to researchers from automated reasoning and term \r\nrewriting, the traditional participants to UNIF, this year's \r\nworkshop will try to attract also researchers from theoretical \r\ncomputer science working on unification algorithms for special \r\ntheories (such as associativity) where astonishing progress has \r\nbeen achieved in the last two years.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will also try to facilitate, with travel awards and \r\nregistration fee waivers, the participation of young researchers \r\nfrom the United States. The intent of this is to stimulate research\r\non unification in this country, as well as alert US researchers \r\nworking in automated reasoning and verification to recent results \r\nin this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
