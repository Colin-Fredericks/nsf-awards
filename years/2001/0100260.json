 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator would like to continue his work on partial\r\ndifferential equations and variational problems. The first theme of\r\nthis project, and also of the research of the PI over the past several\r\nyears, is to study special sets associated to solutions to differential\r\nequations and variational problems. The problems that the PI would\r\ncontinue to work on include the geometric structure of level sets, in\r\nparticular the nodal sets and the singular sets. The study is partly\r\nmotivated by the desire to understand to what extent the solutions can\r\nbe described quantitatively by polynomials or by homogeneous solutions.\r\nThese problems have a close connection with other fields in mathematics,\r\nincluding several complex variables and algebraic geometry. A new\r\nresearch trend is the study of the relation between the growth of nodal\r\nsets and the growth of solutions themselves. It is expected that they\r\nare closely related to each other. The second theme of this project is\r\nto study the isometric embedding of two-dimensional metrics in the three\r\ndimensional Euclidean space, both locally and globally. In general, the\r\nisometric embedding is based on the complicated Nash-Moser iteration,\r\nwhich requires detailed discussions of the linearized equations. Moreover,\r\nthe global isometric embedding is expected to meet some topological\r\nobstacles. Difficulties arise when the Gaussian curvature changes its\r\nsign. Singular sets may appear even if the embedding exists.\r\n\r\nThe problems of the singular sets originate from the material science\r\nand the control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those\r\nsets where singularities occur. Precise definitions vary according to\r\nproblems where they arise. In reality it is impossible to eliminate\r\nsingular sets, the so-called \"bad sets\". An example is provided by\r\ncracks in the building material. Hence one of the central tasks is to\r\ninvestigate the conditions under which the singular sets can be\r\ncontrolled and hence can be made small. Another application involves\r\nthe high-performance computing, in particular the image processing. One\r\nproblem is to recover the image from a distorted copy and the difference\r\nis measured exactly by some singular sets. It is highly expected that\r\nsuch sets should be small enough to be neglected. The problems stated\r\nin the project are simplified mathematical models. It is the hope by\r\nthe investigator that the discussion of these mathematical problems\r\nwould improve the methods to control the singular sets in various\r\napplications.\r\n",
