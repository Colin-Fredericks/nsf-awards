Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES).  This effort will result in a report that articulates a dynamic, stakeholder-inclusive process for determining research needs, identifies the principal issues in earthquake engineering amenable to an integrated research approach that incorporates analysis, computational modeling, simulation, and physical testing; and assesses and comments on the possible roles of information and communication technologies for collaborative on-site and remote research.  It will produce a long-term research plan based on short-, intermediate-, and long-term needs, general program to address them, and the estimated costs and benefits of the research program",
