The results thus far indicate that the relative rates of carbon fixation and carbon removal via sinking  particles vary widely as a function of local food web dynamics. Given the large number  of studies that now use the uranium-238 series radioisotope 234Th as a proxy for POC export, these investigators intend to compile global maps of particulate organic carbon export from the upper ocean. They will look directly at the full range of  234Th export data to assess trends  between seasonal, episodic, or regional flux variability and a suite of physical and biological parameters.  Because a significant portion of export may occur during short pulses or events, the goal is to help  explain export variability in order to better model long-term mean export over larger time or space scales.\r\n\r\nIf common mechanisms can be found for the variations of production and export, these could then be  incorporated into more reliable models of the global carbon cycle. While much of the ocean is characterized by low relative POC export, sites of high export are most often characterized by food webs  dominated by large phytoplankton, in particular diatoms. If this result holds, models that attempt to  predict new and export production from surface chlorophyll or production alone will not resolve the local  carbon balance or allow one to model export controls. A mechanistic understanding of the underlying  export processes is crucial to being able to incorporate this understanding into models, particularly if we  desire to predict fluxes in future climate states.\r\n \r\n",
