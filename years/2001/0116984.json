 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimal design, optimal control, and parameter estimation of systems governed by partial differen-tial\r\nequations give rise to a class of problems known as PDE-constrained optimization. The size and\r\ncomplexity of the discretized PDE constraints often pose significant challenges for contemporary\r\noptimization methods. Recent advances in algorithms, software, and high performance computing\r\nsystems have resulted in PDE simulations that can often scale to millions of variables, thousands\r\nof processors, and multiple physics interactions. As PDE solvers mature, there is increasing in-dustrial\r\nand scientific interest in solving optimization problems governed by such large-scale PDE\r\nsimulations.\r\nTo address the challenges of these problems the investigators have organized a workshop on PDE-constrained\r\noptimization on April 4-6,2001, in Santa Fe, NM. The goals of the workshop are to identify the needs\r\nand opportunities for PDE-constrained optimization in industry and the national labs, to assess the state of the art in PDE-constrained optimization, to identify barriers to PDE-constrained optimization presented by\r\nmodern simulation codes, and to discuss promising algorithmic and software approaches for overcoming these barriers.\r\nSandia National Laboratories will sponsor the workshop itself. to expose a new generation of researchers to this rapidly growing area of research, the investigators will use this grant to support students attending\r\nand participating in the workshop.\r\n",
