 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the great success of the NSF supported First International Conference on ``Semigroups of Operators: Theory and Applications (SOTA 1),'' December 14-18, 1998, in Newport Beach, CA, the international community of researchers on  SOTA wishes to have SOTA 2 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, September 10-14, 2001.\r\n\r\nThe central goal of SOTA 2 is, as before, to bring together experts as well as young researchers in the Theory and Applications of Semigroups of Operators. The Conference will concentrate on recent advances in the theory and latest results in various applications. There is always a ``firewall'' between the abstract theory and the applications, hence one of our key goals is to unite both in the hope that it will be of value to both communities.\r\n\r\nSOTA 2 will concentrate on the abstract theory of Semigroups of Operators as well as Applications which include relevant areas of Science and Engineering. The key topics of the Conference include: Evolution Equations; Nonlinear Semigroups; Control Engineering (Structures, Aeroelasticity), Wavelets and Signal Processing; Probability and Stochastic Processes; Mathematical Physics; Electrical Propagation; Acoustics; and Optics.\r\n\r\nThe Conference Program will consist of plenary lectures, invited papers as well as contributed papers. The Conference will be announced in the AMS Bulletin and on the Web: http://www.ctc.puc-rio.br/SOTA2, as well as by mailing of Call-For Papers. A Conference Proceedings will be published.\r\n\r\nThe Conference Chairman and Chairman of The International Program Committee is Professor A.V. Balakrishnan (USA). The International Program  Committee consists of Mathematicians and Engineers from 4 continents.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests travel support for 10 US participants.  Minority, women, and young researchers are the first, and hopefully, the only choices of the 10 participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
