 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project describes proposed work of the newly reconfigured Center for Educaton of the National Research Council.  In September, 2000, the Center was expanded to include the Board on Testing and Assessment (BOTA), the Committee on Educatonal Excellence and Testing Equity (CEETE), and the Board on International Comparative Studies in Education (BISE).  Other boards, e.g., the Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB), the Committee on Science Education K-12 (COSE K-12), and the Committee on Undergarduate Science Education (CUSE) will continue.  The Center will expand its work at the nexus of education policy, practice and research and will enable synergy among the various boards and committees around key issues.  Among the issues identified for study in the first two years of this grant are:\r\n\r\no  Relationships of classroom assessments and high stakes tests;\r\no  Effects of NSF-supported mathematics curricula;\r\no  Next steps in mathematics teacher development;\r\no  Taking stock of the National Science Education Standards;\r\no  Framing science teacher education as a continuum;\r\no  Criteria and Benchmarks for evaluating undergraduate SMETE program effectiveness;\r\no  Transitions from graduate learning to undergraduate teaching in SMETE;\r\no  Promoting inquiry-based science education for undergraduates;\r\no  Technical skills for work.\r\n\r\nWork over the subsequent three years will be developed to take advantage of the most promising work of years  one and two, and to address current strategic issues in mathematics and science education strategically.",
