 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nExplorations in Science is an activity-based physics course for non-science majors. Developed during my\r\ntenure as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education\t(PFSMETE), Explorations in Science uses the study of common, natural phenomena and student-directed\r\ngroup projects to stimulate interest in a population traditionally quite apathetic towards physics. Activities\r\nuse sophisticated computer tools to take, display, and interpret data. I would like to bring this curriculum to\r\nmy new, permanent, institution, the Rochester Institute of Technology. While RIT is an institution of\r\ntechnology, it has a significant population of students who will benefit from Explorations in Science\r\nincluding students of imaging science, business, and the social sciences. Faculty from the College of\r\nImaging Arts & Sciences have already expressed interest in Explorations in Science, particularly the\r\nprojects dealing with human body motions as these are relevant to students studying computer animation.\r\nTo successfully offer Explorations in Science at RIT, computer sensors (e.g. force sensors, temperature\r\nprobes, and light sensors) must be purchased. Roughly half of this proposal is for equipment that are not\r\ncurrently available in our existing labs.\r\nA necessary condition for the successful implementation of new materials is faculty support. To facilitate\r\nthe implementation of a research-based curricula, I would like to begin a new project on faculty objectives\r\nfor introductory physics courses. RIT has a national reputation of excellence in engineering and the\r\nimaging arts. Therefore, an overwhelming majority of students taking introductory physics at RIT are not\r\nphysics majors. It is important to understand why other departments require these students to take physics\r\nand what they want their students to take from the class. The traditional answers, including \"how to think\"\r\nand \"problem-solving ability,\" are too vague to be useful. Recent work in physics education has attempted\r\nto uncover exactly what is meant by \"how to think,\" i.e. what we the physics community see as the\r\nfundamental diamond in the physics rough. By using the ideas and vocabulary from this research, 1 hope to\r\nbe able to better characterize how other departments see physics. This will allow physics departments to\r\nbetter suit the needs of the majority of their students and make it easier to introduce new curricula such as\r\nExplorations in Physics.\r\n\r\n",
