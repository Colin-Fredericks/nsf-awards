 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0124344\r\nNoel Brady\r\n\r\nIn recent years ideas from geometry have driven some of the \r\nmost exciting developments in combinatorics such as Gromov \r\nhyperbolic groups and CAT(0) spaces, combinatorial Morse theory, combinatorial Ricci curvature, combinatorial differential \r\nmanifolds and matroid bundles. The central unifying notion \r\nin geometry is that of curvature. Now, through these diverse\r\ngeometric and combinatorial theories, curvature is emerging \r\nas a powerful tool and fundamental unifying concept in \r\ncombinatorics as well.  This Focused Research Group will \r\nexplore some of the specific notions of combinatorial\r\ncurvature driving current combinatorial work, and also the \r\nrole of curvature as the basis for a coherent geometric \r\nvision of combinatorics itself.\r\n\r\nThe notion of curvature has been one of the grand unifying \r\nconcepts in geometry and physics for well over a century.  \r\nFor example, Gauss, the originator of our modern understanding \r\nof curvature, showed that Euclidean geometry was distinguished \r\nfrom other geometries as being the geometry of a space with \r\nzero curvature. As an application he showed that it is\r\nprecisely the curvature of the surface of the Earth which makes \r\nit impossible to draw a map of the Earth's surface (on a flat \r\npiece of paper) that accurately portrays all lengths and angles.\r\nRiemann generalized Gauss's work to smooth spaces of higher \r\ndimensions, and Einstein observed that Riemannian geometry\r\nwas precisely the right setting in which to describe his \r\ntheory of general relativity (in which the curvature of the \r\nuniverse is the result of gravitational forces). Partly as a \r\nresult of Einstein's work, the last century saw an intensive investigation into the curvature of smooth spaces.\r\nCombinatorics, roughly defined, is the study of objects which \r\ncan be described by a finite amount of information.  This is \r\nprecisely the mathematics that computers can do.  This type of mathematics seems far removed from the geometric investigations \r\nof Gauss, Riemann and countless others.  However, there is a \r\ngrowing collection of  combinatorial phenomena which can best \r\nbe viewed as being finite analogues of facts about the curvature \r\nof smooth spaces.  The goal of this proposal is to come to a\r\ncoherent understanding of curvature as a combinatorial notion. \r\nIn addition, bringing together researchers from a variety of mathematical disciplines, we wish to bridge the chasms between geometry, combinatorics, algebra and topology, using curvature \r\nas the unifying theme. \r\n  \r\n\r\n",
