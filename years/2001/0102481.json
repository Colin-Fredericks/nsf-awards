 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical reactions that convert a solid oxide into new fluid and solid\r\nproducts with compositions that differ from the initial oxide are\r\nconsidered to be \"incongruent\" (e.g., incongruent melting, incongruent\r\ndissolution).  While some types of incongruent reactions are well\r\nunderstood, the basic kinetic mechanisms by which oxides undergo\r\n\"incongruent reduction\" with molten metals are not.  The objective of this\r\nresearch is to develop a fundamental understanding of the kinetic\r\nmechanisms (rate-limiting steps, microstructural evolution) by which a\r\nsolid oxide undergoes incongruent reduction with a reactive metallic\r\nliquid.  In this work, the incongruent reduction of aluminum oxide in\r\ncontact with Mg-Al liquids (which involves the formation of solid magnesium\r\naluminate spinel) will be examined.  Novel experiments with in-situ x-ray\r\ndiffraction will be used to track, in real time, the formation of spinel on\r\nalumina surfaces immersed under molten Mg-Al layers.  The kinetics of\r\nalumina weight change upon immersion in Mg-Al melts will also be studied\r\nunder steady-state conditions.  These kinetic measurements (phase change,\r\nmass change) will be used along with microchemical and microstructural\r\nanalyses of the alumina/melt interface to identify the rate-limiting\r\nstep(s) of incongruent alumina reduction.\r\n%%%\r\nThe rate of reaction between ceramics and liquid metals is of vital\r\nimportance for a number of advanced technologies, such as: 1) novel,\r\nlow-cost, reactive infiltration processing of ceramic/metal composites for\r\nautomotive applications (e.g., cylinder liners, brake components, bearing\r\nsleeves), and 2) investment casting of advanced titanium alloys for\r\nlightweight and strong structural components in aircraft.  The purpose of\r\nthis research project is to develop a better fundamental understanding of\r\nthe mechanisms of reactions between solid ceramics and liquid metals, so\r\nthat the rate of such reactions can be better predicted and controlled.\r\nThis research will involve the use of state-of-the-art analytical equipment\r\nto track the progress of such reactions in real time at interfaces between\r\nsolid ceramics and liquid metals.\r\n\r\n",
