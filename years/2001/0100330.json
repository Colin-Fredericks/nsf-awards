 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the basic geometric and analytic problems in several complex \r\nvariables is to determine when two real submanifolds in \r\nmultidimensional complex space are locally biholomorphically \r\nequivalent. That is, when is it possible to find a local invertible \r\nholomorphic transformation sending one submanifold onto the other? \r\nThis problem has attracted the attention of many mathematicians since \r\nthe beginning of the twentieth century, starting with the work of \r\nPoincare and continuing with the major contributions of E. Cartan, \r\nTanaka, Chern, Moser and others. The principal investigators will \r\ncontinue their research on several aspects of this problem. In \r\nparticular, they will focus on determining when it is possible to \r\nreduce the biholomorphic equivalence problem to solving systems of \r\npolynomial equations with complex coefficients. They also plan to \r\ndetermine when a formal mapping sending a real submanifold into \r\nanother is necessarily convergent. In addition, they will attempt to \r\ncategorize those submanifolds for which such mappings are determined \r\nby finitely many derivatives at a given point. They expect that this \r\nstudy will lead to the discovery of new geometric, analytic, as well \r\nas algebraic invariants of these submanifolds.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigators will continue their study of fundamental \r\nproperties of analytic and geometric objects, such as surfaces and \r\ncurves, in multidimensional complex spaces. A complete classification \r\nof these mathematical objects can have important implications for a \r\nnumber of other questions in mathematical science.  In fact, this \r\nstudy is motivated by the rich interplay between several areas of \r\nmathematics and physics, including control theory, string theory, and \r\nother areas of mathematical physics. Progress on the problems \r\nproposed by the Principal Investigators will likely have impact on \r\nthe above-mentioned areas as well.\r\n\r\n",
