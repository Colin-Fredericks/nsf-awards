Mishalani, Rabi, Ohio State University\r\n\r\nTransportation infrastructure systems are long-lived and large-scale in nature.  Deteriorating infrastructure can thus have serious, widespread, and prolonged negative impacts on social, industrial, and economic activities of society.  The overall objectives of the proposed research plan are to contribute to the knowledge base of the behavior of infrastructure systems to use to guide the development of methods for improving their management.\r\n\r\nThe research aims to provide an integrated view of the entire infrastucture provision process, including: 1) multivariate condition assessment and deterioration modeling; 2) spatial sampling strategy selection; 3) modeling the effect of initial design and construction decisions on deterioration; 4) optimal design-build-operate-maintain strategy selection; 5) modeling agency behavior.  The elements will be addressed on a data-driven basis, i.e., as information is gleaned.  Statistical and operations research methodologies will be employed.\r\n\r\nThe education plan involves advocates a systems approach to civil infrastructure and disseminating the results to graduate and undergraduate courses and research, professional development offerings for engineers and researchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiriam Heller\r\nProgram Director, Information Technology and Civil Infrastructure Systems",
