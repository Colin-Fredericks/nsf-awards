 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twin Cities Public Television, in association with Red Hill Studios, is producing and disseminating an Exploring Time television special and associated outreach material.  The project will augment and leverage the Exploring Time traveling exhibit now being developed by the Science Museum of Minnesota (NSF grant #99-01919).  The goal of both the exhibit and the television special is to increase the public's understanding of our world by revealing the unseen world of natural change -- the multitude of changes that are occurring in the present but at rates too slow or too fast to be seen.  The television special will provide visual explorations of changes that take place over a vast range of timescales -- from billionths of seconds to billions of years.\r\n\r\nThe television series and exhibit will be supplemented by a range of materials.  Both low- and high-bandwidth, web-based material will be available and a teacher's guide will be developed for middle school classrooms.  A \"Time Explorers Toolkit\" will be available to both formal and informal learners.  This CD-ROM includes detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to create time-lapse movies.  The project also will coordinate outreach with the Community Technology Centers Network, the organization that supports technology centers that serve individuals from underrepresented and low-income groups.\r\n",
