 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term consequences of acid rain on nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems are not clearly understood, despite the widespread occurrence of acid rain in Europe and the eastern United States. This study provides a unique opportunity to document the effects of acidic deposits on northern forest ecosystems by comparing archived samples of forest soil with modern samples collected at the same locations ~100 and ~50 years after the original sampling. The historical samples, thought to be the oldest archived soil samples in the world, were collected in Eastern Europe and Russia before the onset of strong acidic deposition. The researchers will evaluate changes in soil-vegetation systems in northwestern Russia through analysis of base cations, different forms of aluminum, and other elements in soils and trees. In addition to advancing knowledge of the effects of acid rain, this research is important for understanding forest health under future global climate changes, increased concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and continuing anthropogenic pollution of the atmosphere with sulfur and nitrogen oxides.",
