 "awd_abstract_narration": "How does a single cell divide to become two cells? This is a fundamentally important and\r\nyet unsolved biological question. In prokaryotes, this essential cellular process is\r\ninitiated and directed by the tubulin-like FtsZ protein, which forms a polymeric ring,\r\ncalled the Z-ring, at the division site during the initial stages of cytokinesis. The\r\nZ-ring then contracts, persisting at the leading edge of the invaginating cytoplasmic\r\nmembrane throughout the division process.\r\nFtsZ is present in the three major biological kingdoms-bacteria, archaea, and\r\norganelles.in eukaryotes. Because very little is known about cell division or cellular\r\norganization in the archaea, the goal of this research program is to gain insight into the\r\nmechanism of archaeal cell division and how FtsZ coordinates this process. Halobacterium\r\nsalinarum is the system of choice to study FtsZ-based cell division in the archaea for\r\nseveral reasons. First, relatively sophisticated genetic and cytological tools, such as a\r\nsalt-resistant green fluorescent protein (GFP), have been recently developed for this\r\norganism. Second, H. salinarum grows at convenient temperatures in air, and thus can be\r\ncultivated without any special equipment. Third, its complete genome sequence has\r\nrecently been completed, making H. salinarum the best archaeon in which to apply\r\nfunctional genomics. Fourth, H. salinarum harbors five copies of ftsZ: ftsZ1 and ftsZ2\r\nare highly similar to ftsZ orthologs from other species, whereas the other three are more\r\ndivergent but are nevertheless clearly ftsZ homologs. This unprecedented complexity\r\npromises to reveal interesting and novel aspects of FtsZ function. Fifth, despite the\r\npotential complexity of FtsZ interactions, there are no other homologs of bacterial cell\r\ndivision proteins in this organism (which is also true for other archaea). This, along\r\nwith the presence of a relatively simple S-layer instead of a peptidoglycan cell wall,\r\nsuggests that cell division in H. salinarum may be more streamlined than that of the\r\nbacterial model systems and therefore potentially easier to solve. Finally, the rod shape\r\nand relatively large size of H. salinarum cells greatly facilitates cytological analysis.\r\nThe objectives of this project are to (i) define the roles of the five FtsZ\r\nhomologs, in particular the two most conserved copies, in H. salinarum cell division; (ii)\r\nunderstand what regulates assembly and placement of the Z-ring in H. salinarum, with\r\npotential candidates including the two MinD homologs present in the proteome; and (iii)\r\nidentify other factors involved in cell division and in a potentially novel cytoskeleton\r\nin this organism. These objectives will be addressed by construction of gene knockouts,\r\nprotein overexpression and purification, assays for GTP binding and hydrolysis,\r\nself-assembly measurements, and in vivo protein localization and quantitation using GFP\r\nfusions and immunodetection. These studies should make a major contribution to\r\nour understanding of cell division mechanisms, protein targeting and dynamics, and\r\ncellular organization of archaea, and should complement studies of cell division in\r\nbacterial and organellar model systems. Moreover,  genome sequence of H. salinarum,\r\ncoupled with its accessibility, affords a timely opportunity for students to develop an\r\nin-depth research project on the cell biology of an archaeon.\r\n",
