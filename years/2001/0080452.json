 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the need for providing advanced engineering education in a shorter time period than is generally possible by traditional curricula, the PIs propose to create an accelerated educational track to attract the brightest students into bioengineering.   They propose to get them involved in a research project at an early stage, and provide them with an intensive four-year educational program built around a cohort environment. Upon completion of the program, the students will receive dual BS and MS degrees in bioengineering.\r\n\r\nA key element of this program is to have students begin work on an individual Masters thesis project early in their careers (i.e., starting in the equivalent of their sophomore year). This project provides a framework upon which to motivate the students in their classroom activities (a concept of just-in-time learning) and to guide them in their selection of elective courses. To equip the students with the skills needed to pursue a Masters-level project, the seminar/discussion course sequence will involve engineering, clinical, industrial and scientific input to aid the student in the selection, design and conduct of a Masters research project. A portion of the seminar course is also devoted to oral and written presentations of each student's research progress.  Another essential feature of this accelerated plan is the integrated and concentrated nature of the coursework.\r\n",
