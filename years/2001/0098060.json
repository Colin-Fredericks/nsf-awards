 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging web applications are increasingly likely to use dynamic web\r\ndata. Traditionally, requests for dynamic data---both time-varying and\r\ndynamically-generated---have been handled directly by servers and\r\nintermediate proxies haven't been allowed to process requests for such\r\nobjects (web proxies have been primarily employed to disseminate data\r\nthat is mostly static).  A pure server-based approach for managing\r\ndynamic data is likely to limit the scalability of emerging web\r\napplications and increase their vulnerability to server failures. To\r\novercome this drawback, novel proxy-based techniques will be developed\r\nto manage and disseminate dynamic web data. The proposed\r\nresearch will address two key issues: (i) data dissemination, which\r\naddresses the issue of disseminating time-varying web data using\r\nproxy-based push and pull techniques, and (ii) computation\r\ndissemination, which addresses the issue of moving computations from\r\nservers to proxies so as to dynamically generate web objects at a\r\nproxy. Both techniques have the potential of radically changing the\r\nway web proxies are designed and used. These techniques will need to\r\nsatisfy three key requirements: user-cognizance (i.e., awareness\r\nof user and application requirements), intelligence (i.e., the ability\r\nto dynamically choose the most efficient set of mechanisms to service\r\neach application), and adaptivity (i.e., the ability to react to\r\nchanging load characteristics).  The proposed techniques will be\r\nevaluated using an eclectic mix of simulation, analysis and prototype\r\nimplementation.\r\n",
