 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on asymmetric biaryl oxidative coupling reactions.   Combinatorial type screening of ligands with transition metal oxidants will be undertaken to identify new, useful catalysts.  A variety of substrates and issues of chemo- and regioselectivity will be examined.  The educational component of this plan introduces graphics and internet examples into the undergraduate organic chemistry course as well as computional chemistry using CSC Chem3D Ultra.  Graduate and undergraduate students in the principal investigator's research group also receive training in computional chemistry.\r\n\r\nWith the CAREER award, the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Professor Marisa Kozlowski of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania.  Professor Kozlowski's research applies concepts from computional and organic chemistry to design and synthesize new molecules which are useful as ligands for new catalysts or as building blocks for certain natural products.  The educational portion of the plan is directed towards using computional chemistry methods as a teaching tool at both the undergraduate and graduate level.",
