 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in support of the Tenth International Conference on Phonon Scattering in Condensed Matter.  The scientific objective of this conference is to serve as the main international forum on the physics and interactions of phonons. This is the first conference held in the USA since 1992.  Topics included in the conference agenda are disordered systems and glasses, lattice dynamics, Raman scattering, neutron scattering, quantum fluids, electron-phonon interactions, and phonon spectroscopy.  Also included are the cross-disciplinary and emerging areas of particle detectors, photon detectors, coherent phonons, and new techniques to generate and detect monochromatic phonons.  The conference will also have sessions devoted to phonon properties of micro- and nanostructures.  Examples include carrier-phonon interactions in quantum wires and dots, the fundamental quantum of thermal conductance and its connection to information flow, ultrasensitive calorimetry, the thermal properties of carbon nanotubes, and the mechanisms of energy dissipation in high frequency micro-mechanical resonators.  This award serves to support the attendance and participation of young scientists, post-doctoral fellows and senior graduate students.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award is in support of support of Phonons 2001, the Tenth International Conference of Phonon Scattering in Condensed Matter. It is the fourth such meeting held in the United States, the last one having been held at Cornell University in 1992. The objective of the conference is to serve as the main international forum on the physics associated with the vibrational motion of the atomic and molecular constituents of materials. Understanding, modeling, and possibly engineering the vibrational motion are important because the vibrational properties impact the development of new electronic and optical devices. The topics covered by the conference include the properties of materials, such as glasses and crystals, as well as recent advances in the areas of nanostructured materials.  The conference will also cover techniques to detect high-energy particles and photons by sensing vibrational energy changes in materials. This grant award also serves to support the development of the next generation of young scientists and engineers. Young faculty, post-doctoral fellows and senior graduate students are helped and encouraged to attend the conference so that they can participate in the scientific discussions with recognized leaders of the field.\r\n***\r\n",
