The workshops will be held concomitantly with the International Conference on Engineering Education to be held in Oslo, Norway, August 6-10, 2001. The workshop topics are internet-based course development, exchange programs for students and faculty, multidisciplinary design programs, and industry collaborations and alliances.  The selection process for which participants will be supported will be open, and a special effort will be made to include junior faculty members.  Special attention will be given to strengthening ties between delegates from the U.S. and those from the various other countries.  A primary goal of the workshops is to catalyze the development of action plans for long-term international collaborations and partnerships, and to promote sharing of educational innovations between the schools of different countries. \r\n",
