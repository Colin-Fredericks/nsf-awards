 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is investigating several aspects of large cardinal theory in the\r\nregion of Woodin cardinals, including (1) Long Games; (2) Iterability; and\r\n(3) connections with Descriptive Set Theory. 1 - Results obtained by the\r\nPI through previous NSF support demonstrate the tight connection between\r\nWoodin cardinals and games of variable countable length. The existence of\r\niterable models for specific large cardinals can be used to yield the\r\ndeterminacy of games of specific lengths, with increasing length\r\ncorresponding to increasing large cardinal strength. These games in turn\r\ncan be used to decide statements over minimal inner models for large\r\ncardinals. The PI is attempting to extend this correspondence, the first\r\nmain test case being open games of length omega one. 2 - The study of\r\nWoodin cardinals leads naturally to a transfinite game known as the\r\niteration game. Winning strategies (\"iteration strategies\") for the good\r\nplayer in this game are essential to the comparison process that lies at\r\nthe heart of inner model theory. Proving that iteration strategies exist\r\nis the single most important problem in the field. The PI has been working\r\non this problem, contributing to the existing pool of partial results.\r\nSeveral problems, related to the general problem of iterability but\r\nspecialized and more concrete, are investigated as part of this project.\r\nThis investigation should provide increased understanding of the main\r\nproblem, and hopefully lead to additional partial results. 3 - The PI is\r\nworking to solidify the connections between large cardinals and definable\r\nsets of real numbers. Extensive work, much of it done during the '70s and\r\n'80s, provides a detailed analysis of definable sets of reals assuming\r\ndeterminacy. Later work obtained determinacy from large cardinals. The PI\r\nis working to emulate the existing analysis of definable sets of reals,\r\nworking directly from large cardinals. The point here is to try to convert\r\nmethods used in the study of definable sets of reals, into methods which\r\ncan be used in inner model theory and the study of large cardinals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet Theory is a branch of Mathematics which attempts to understand the\r\nuniverse of Mathematics, that is the collection of all objects studied by\r\nMathematicians, or more precisely the collection of all _sets_. (Numbers,\r\ngroups, functions, etc., can all be represented as sets.)  Set Theorists\r\nview this universe as a structure in its own right, a structure which can\r\nitself be analyzed using mathematical reasoning. For example, a Set\r\nTheorist may ask \"is there an embedding of the universe into a similar,\r\nyet not identical, structure?\" Set Theorists work with such embeddings\r\n(\"elementary embeddings\") in much the same way that one would work with\r\nfunctions on numbers, asking \"how similar is the target structure to the\r\noriginal structure?\" and \"what's the smallest size of a set actually moved\r\nby the embedding?\" Such questions about embeddings of the universe form a\r\nsubfield of Set Theory known as the study of large cardinals. The\r\nterminology here hints at the answer to the last question mentioned.\r\nIndeed, the sets actually moved by elementary embeddings are substantially\r\nlarger than any object studied in other branches of Mathematics\r\n(substantially larger than the set of real numbers for example). Yet it\r\nturns out that the existence of elementary embeddings has concrete effects\r\non lower level objects, including concrete effects on real numbers. This\r\nproject is part of the on-going effort to better understand large\r\ncardinals, and better understand their effects on the line of real\r\nnumbers. The PI, like other researchers in the field, is motivated by the\r\nconnection between the abstract and the concrete.\r\n",
