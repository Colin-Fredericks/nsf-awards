 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to integrate exciting adventure-based scenarios, solutions to which require inquiry learning and an engineering design approach, into the middle grade (5-9) science and mathematics classrooms. Middle grade students win be posed with adventurous scenarios, e.g., Engineering the Congo, Mission to Mars, filled with carefully crafted obstacles, e.g., water purification, power generation, route optimization. The level appropriate science and/or mathematics principles are woven into the obstacles. Student groups then develop solutions to the posed obstacles through inquiry learning and the engineering design approach, running the gamut from experimentation to conceptualization to prototype construction and testing. This curriculum that weaves m the required science and/or math content is designed to replace the existing middle grade content.\r\nA team (AE Team) will develop the Adventure Engineering curriculum of engineering graduate and undergraduate Fellows, middle grade science and mathematics teachers from urban, suburban and rural schools, and faculty from Science Education, Mathematics Education, and Engineering at the University of Oklahoma. The engineering fellows will be extensively prepared in the pertinent standards, existing curriculum, and inquiry learning method through observation and participation in the middle grade classrooms, participation in College of Education methods courses, and workshops with middle grade teachers. During the three-year project, the AE Team will develop inquiry and design based science and math curriculum, with diligent assessment, under the adventure-based engineering premise. To accomodate the middle grade teachers, the AE Team will meet outside the classroom monthly on Saturday mornings during the academic year and for daylong workshops in the summer. Between AE Team meetings, the Fellows will work to develop and implement curriculum with the designated teachers in the middle grade classrooms. Each year, the engineering Fellows will increase outreach activity by seeking different teachers and assisting them with Adventure engineering curriculum implementation. The curriculum will be developed and prepared for web-dissemination to be self-sustaining beyond the three-year project period.\r\nThe Adventure Engineering program is designed to motivate those students in the critical middle grades that otherwise would not pursue technical careers, particularly women and minorities. To this end, the Adventure Engineering curriculum will be developed for and implemented in approximately 72 classrooms, half of which will be predominantly minority classrooms in Oklahoma City. The AE team Fellows will be recruited from and with the dedicated assistance of the outstanding Multicultural Engineering Program at the University of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\n",
