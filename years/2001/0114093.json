 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program  and the Major Research Instrumentation  program to Colorado state University will fund the purchase of an integrated field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) system for the central Electron Microscopy Center at Colorado State University.  The equipment requested will allow imaging specimens at high resolution, providing resolution of structures as small as 1.5 nanometers.  An energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system will allow chemical identification, with the capability of precisely mapping multiple elements over a wide area.  A third component of the instrumentation will enable investigators to produce nanoscale devices using electron beam lithography.  This technique, in conjunction with the high resolution FE-SEM will allow generation of structures as small as 10 nm for applications in optoelectronic materials, superconductors, and sensors.  The instrumentation will support the research efforts of seven primary investigators from five departments across campus.  In addition, it will be  useed by research groups in 8 other departments at CSU as well as several other investigators (both academic and industrial) from along the Colorado Front Range.  Finally, the FE-SEM will be used to support and extend the teaching mission of the EM center and the University through hands-on instruction and telepresence microscopy.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Material Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program  to Colorado State University will fund the purchase of an integrated system of imaging and analytical tools that will greatly expand the capabilities of the Electron Microscopy (EM) Center at Colorado State University.  The state-of-the-art scanning electron microscope (SEM) will allow imaging of both biological and materials specimens at the highest magnifications currently possible.  In addition, an x-ray analyzer attached to the microscope will provide identification of most elements in the periodic table and will map their locations with high precision on specimen surfaces.  The electron beam lithography system, coupled with the SEM will allow production of micro- and nanoscopic structures that will be used in a variety of optical and electrical devices, such as light emitting diodes, semiconductor lasers, and highly efficient sensors and detectors.  The educational mission of science and engineering departments across the CSU campus will also be enhanced by the acquisition of this instrumentation through hands-on instruction and remote access via telepresence microscopy. \r\n",
