 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this International symposium is to provide a forum for the discussion of developments in nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. Nonlinear systems are at the center of many engineering disciplines.  Their analysis and design have made tremendous progress over the last decade with the development of new tools in nonlinear and stochastic dynamics.  In turn, problems in nonlinear mechanics have stimulated important research in mathematical systems theory.  Practical applications of fundamental results in these areas are beginning to appear across the entire spectrum of science. Research in this area is characterized by international and interdisciplinary cooperation.  The symposium will review both fundamental theory and its applications in structural and mechanical systems, fluid-structure interactions, and other areas of mechanics, science and technology.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop is being organized and hosted for the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) by researchers at University Illinois at Urbana-Champagne, August 25-31, 2002.  Fifty speakers will be invited to present talks at this five-day symposium. These include speakers from the US, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, Russia, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic, Norway, India, China, Australia, South Africa, and Vietnam.  The Proceedings of the Symposium will be published under the title \"IUTAM Symposium on NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC DYNAMICS\" by Kluwer Academic Publishers; the official designated publisher of International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics(IUTAM) Proceedings. \r\n\r\n",
