The conference is held under the auspices of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology ( FASEB).  There will be 9 major oral sessions, each including, on average, three 30 minute talks and two 15 minutes talks per session. There will be two poster sessions, each lasting two days.\r\n\r\nThe topics for discussion are: Central and Peripheral Tolerance, Autoantigen Responses in Autoimmunity, Role of Infection in Autoimmunity, B cell Activation and Autoimmunity, Mechanisms of Peripheral Counter-Regulation, Antigen Presenting Cells in Shaping Pathogenic T cell Repertoire, Role of the Innate Immune system in Autoimmunity, Cytokines and Autoimmunity and Immunotherapy.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the meeting is to bring together biochemists, biophysicists and geneticists to share information. The field is progressing rapidly and providing important new information on structure and mechanisms at the molecular level.\r\n\r\nThis is the sixth conference on the subject.  They are held every year, the first in 1991, and all are very well attended.\r\n",
