 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SCRSI is an outshoot of the UCAN-RSI. Unsuccessfully attempted as an implementation award last year, it has been redesigned and reconsidered as a developmental. Anchored at Adams State College in rural Southern Colorado, the SCRSI plans to improve science, mathematics and technology education through a partnership of 18 school districts, two Boards of Cooperative Educational Service Centers (BOCES), two Regional Assistance Centers (RAC) 2 junior colleges and 2 four-year colleges. \r\n\r\nThe school districts encompass 47 K-12 schools in an economically disadvantaged area with approximately 12,000 students. Over 75% of the students in the schools are Hispanic. The 47 schools are members of three coalitions, the San Luis Valley, the Arkansas Valley and the South Central Coalitions.\r\n\r\nThere are four major components to the SCRSI:\r\n\r\n1. Creation of an infrastructure for managing the project and completing the scope-of-work throughout the established consortium. \r\nAction: Establish site-based leadership teams, Coalition leadership teams and project leadership teams.\r\n\r\n2. Completion of a site analysis of individual schools to identify strengths and weaknesses in order to direct future implementation strategies.\r\nAction: Complete matrices on full implementation and assessment at each school, conduct teacher surveys and school walk-throughs, compile and analyze student data.\r\n\r\n3. Establishment of strong collaboration across schools, partnerships and networks across all levels of the region.\r\nAction: Conduct team meetings and three strategic planning meetings.\r\n\r\n4. Development of the implementation plan supported by all partners including specific partnership commitments.\r\nAction: Submit a report and propose an implementation plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
