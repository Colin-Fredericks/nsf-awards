 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the dynamics of biotic response to past environmental change is an\r\nessential element for predicting the effect on the earth's biosphere of future\r\nenvironmental change. Although time-series data in the geologic record represents the\r\nmajor source of information describing the dynamics of this past biotic response,\r\nmethodological and administrative gulfs between biological scientists and earth\r\nscientists, and among real-time, recent-past, and deep-time approaches, have hindered\r\nbasic research and its application to policy issues. This study will describe mechanisms\r\nfor promoting the interdisciplinary science at the interface of biology and geology that\r\ndepends on the collection, analysis, and understanding of biogeologic time-series data.\r\nThe study will provide the basis for informed decision-making in government, industry, and academia, by (1) assessing the current state of biogeologic analysis relevant to biosphere dynamics; (2) identifying the most promising directions for collaborative research and the sharing of methodologies; and (3) describing the programmatic themes and research and data infrastructures required to accomplish these interdisciplinary objectives\r\n",
