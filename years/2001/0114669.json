 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Miami Museum of Science proposes to design and implement an innovative model \r\nprogram to increase the confidence, interest and preparedness of girls to pursue \r\nacademic and employment opportunities related to high end careers in the field of \r\ninformation technology (IT). Titled GREAT! (Girls Redesigning and Excelling in \r\nAdvanced Technology), the project will build on the body of research related to girls\r\nand IT to develop and model effective methodologies for engaging girls as designers -\r\n- as opposed to simply users -- of IT applications. The overall goal of GREAT! is to \r\nraise interest and skills in advanced technology applications among middle school \r\ngirls, particularly girls of color, resulting in increased representation of females in\r\nacademic programs and employment opportunities leading to high end IT careers. \r\nSpecific objectives of GREAT! are to build girls' confidence and expertise with \r\nadvanced technology applications; to engage them in the use of advanced technology to \r\nsolve real world problems; to strengthen girls' communication and presentation skills; \r\nto contribute to and inform the field through a comprehensive evaluation of project\r\noutcomes, and to disseminate project methodologies and findings among informal \r\nscience education institutions and other interested parties. \r\n\r\nThe Museum will collaborate with Miami Dade County Public School's Urban Systemic\r\nProgram to recruit 40 middle school girls each year, for a total of 120 girls over the\r\nduration of the project. Over the course of a two year period, participants will assume \r\nthe roles of IT designers, acquiring progressively complex technology skills \r\nculminating in the creation of a fully interactive 3 D virtual Museum exhibit experience.\r\nGirls will begin by participating in a 12 week Saturday Technology Workshop which will \r\ntake place over the course of the academic year. Following completion of the Technology \r\nWorkshop series, girls will take part in a 4 week intensive summer Design Studio in \r\nwhich they will use state of the art virtual reality (VR) technology to create a VR\r\nproduction showcasing an invention of their own design. Girls will work in teams of four, \r\nwith each team assigned a mentor (a female college student majoring in computer\r\ntechnology or a related field) who will provide technical guidance and serve as a role\r\nmodel. Upon completing their productions, girls will strengthen their presentation skills\r\nand increase self esteem and self confidence through Family Night presentations and by \r\nexhibiting and interpreting their work to visitors in the Museum galleries for a one month \r\nperiod during the subsequent academic year. \r\n\r\nThe Museum will contract with VR Visions and the Center for Children and Technology\r\nto provide design support. Kathleen Tyner of Media Analysis & Practice will serve \r\nas the project's external evaluator, responsible for formative and summative evaluation \r\nof project activities.",
