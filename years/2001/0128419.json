 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-day conference will bring together the international community of cerebellar researchers to discuss the current status of the field. Progress in cerebellar physiology has proceeded at a rapid pace and a meeting to exchange new results and concepts seems timely. This meeting will serve to cross-fertilize efforts between various factions in the field in the understanding of cerebellar function. Seven sequential panel sessions, each with an organized and moderated discussion period, two plenary lectures the history of landmark discoveries, and a poster session will be presented over a three-day period to consider the following topics that are important for understanding cerebellar function.  1) The cerebellum as a device for coordination of movement; 2) Relative roles of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei; 3) Parallel fiber beams.  What do they do? 4) Climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellum. What is signaled? 5) Cognitive processing by the cerebellum; 6) LTD, LTP and molecular mechanisms of learning and memory; 7) Models of cerebellar function. It is expected that attendees of the meeting will be informed of the very latest progress and research in the cerebellar field. Because cerebellar research is presently extremely active, and because many of the speakers use state of the art technology such as optical recording and multiple electrode recording techniques, attendees will also be informed of the state of the art of methodology related to the neurosciences.  The open format of the poster session will provide the opportunity for active, intimate discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
