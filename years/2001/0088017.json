 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nSubsurface archaeo-geophysical survey techniques are being used increasingly in archaeological fieldwork to map ancient remains without excavation. The growth in use is facilitated by the availability of commercial data collectors tailored to archaeological needs. This project is adapting these techniques to create an integrated interdisciplinary curriculum to provide undergraduates with (1) a competent theoretical understanding of basic geophysical processes underlying the survey techniques, (2) some knowledge of the implications of subsurface archaeo-geophysical technologies for research design and methodology, and (3) a working knowledge of appropriate mapping and imaging theory and technology. The project is developing a new interdisciplinary course, upgrading an existing Archaeology Laboratory for subsurface archaeo-geophysical survey, and modifying existing courses offered by the departments of Geology, Archaeology, and Geography to accomplish these objectives. This project is also supporting faculty and student research projects and invigorating a community-based research program at the University of Akron. \r\nThe project is adapting a design of Web-based instructional modules derived from Geographer Kenneth Foote's \"Virtual Geography Department,\" an NSF-supported workshop. It is also adapting field techniques taught at a \"Field Institutes for Reforming Science Teaching\" (FIRST) workshop conducted by Biologists Diane Ebert-May and Janet Hodder -- also NSF supported. Both of these adaptations are being used for their skill in supporting active learning by students. The content of the new course and course modifications is being adapted from courses using geophysical methods for subsurface mapping developed and offered to undergraduates at three other institutions. These were a course in Archaeological Field Methods, including subsurface surveying at Vassar College, developed by Lucy Johnson; the archaeological field school at Notre Dame University, which offers courses in geophysical remote sensing techniques; and a series of three courses at Boston University related to archaeological geophysical surveying. \r\n",
