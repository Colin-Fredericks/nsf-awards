 "awd_abstract_narration": "0103944\r\nOlver\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on the applications of the proposer's new \r\nequivariant theory of moving frames for general Lie group actions. \r\nParticular emphasis will be in three key applied directions: analysis and \r\napplications of invariant variational problems and invariant partial \r\ndifferential equations in geometry and physics, the design of symmetry-\r\npreserving numerical algorithms for approximating differential invariants \r\nand integrating invariant differential equations, and object recognition and \r\nsymmetry detection in computer vision based on differential invariant and \r\nnoise-resistant joint invariant signatures. The project will include further \r\ndevelopment of the underlying moving frame theory, particularly in the \r\ncase of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-groups, and the formulation of a \r\nproper geometrical foundation for multivariate numerical approximation \r\nand interpolation.\r\n\r\nThe recognition and exploitation symmetry is an essential tool in modern \r\nmathematics and its applications.  This project will continue to develop a \r\nnew, powerful geometric approach, known as moving frames, to systems \r\nthat have continuous symmetry.  The modern moving frame theory \r\ndeveloped by the PI has already witnessed a remarkable range of new \r\napplications, including computer vision, for object recognition and \r\nsymmetry detection, a geometric approach to classical algebra and \r\ninvariant theory, as well as the design of numerical integration schemes \r\nthat preserve the underlying symmetry of the problem to be solved.  The \r\ncombination of analytical, geometrical, and numerical advances, coupled \r\nwith practical applications has proved to be a particularly potent blend of \r\ntheory and practical tools. This research project will continue the rapid \r\ndevelopment and application of the moving frame method, concentrating \r\non theoretical developments tied to applications in computer vision, in \r\ngeometry and physics, and in symmetry-based numerical integration \r\nmethods\r\n",
