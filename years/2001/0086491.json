These crosslinked polymers can also be employed as thermal sensor materials.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of thermally reversible reactions, namely the thermally reversible Diels-Alder cycloaddition of a diene and the thermally reversible Menschutkin reaction, will be employed to generate TRC links.  Salts of dicyclopentadiene dicarboxylic acid (SDCPDCA) will be used as TRC crosslinkers of halide-containing polymers.  CL-containing polymers possessing benzyl chlorine, primary Cl, secondary Cl, tertialy Cl or allyl Cl moieties, will be subjected to esterification crosslinking with SDCPDCA.  The latter compounds are prepared by reacting dicyclopentadience dicarboxylic acid (DCPDCA) with ethoxide or hydroxide.  The crosslinked polymers will exhibit TRC crosslinking due to the thermally reversible dedimerization/dimerization of -DCPD- bridges.  The above CL-containing polymers will also be crosslinked with ditertiary amines vial the formation of ionene networks based on the Menschutkin reaction.  The generated ionene networks are expected to exhibit TRC crosslinking due to the dequarternization on heating and requarternization on cooling of the ionene bridges.  \r\n",
