 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal No:  0113515\r\nITR/SY: A Flexible Framework for Secure Information Sharing Among Collaborating Organizations\r\nPI: Jajodia Sushil\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to develop a exible framework for secure information \r\nsharing among collaborating organizations. The approach will be to extend the Flexible \r\nAuthorization Framework (FAF) designed by the PI and his colleagues. FAF is based on an \r\nauthorization specication language that has rule based syntax and sound, non-monotonic logic based \r\nsemantics. The rst goal of this proposal is to enhance FAF to include information ow \r\ncontrols, provisional authorizations, delegation of authority, and a rather broad sense of \r\nrevocation capabilities of granted permissions. The second undertaking is to investigate ecient \r\nimplementation of the resulting framework that is based on the best practices of the security \r\ncommunity. The third goal of this proposal is to investigate the properties of basic constructs \r\nthat are used to compose security policies.\r\nThe main deliverables of this proposal are a reference architecture, \r\nmathematics and algorithms for security specications of information access and ow, their ecient \r\nimplementation techniques, and an an algebra for policy compositions.",
