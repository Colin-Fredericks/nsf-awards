Funds are being used to cover: a portion of the expenses for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, assistant professors who will run the program as speakers and session chairs; a foreign keynote speaker; two invited speakers and up to four senior scientists in financial need. The 2001 Workshop is being held at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, CA with the title \"A Signal Event\" and the theme of signal transduction. The Keynote Address will be given by Dr Nicole Tandeau de Marsac, the Head of the Unite de Physiologie Microbienne, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. The address will focus on aspects of protein phosphorylation and its role in signaling processes. The importance of signal transduction pathways -as becoming realized through the complete genome analysis of more than five different cyanobacteria -will be highlighted throughout the sessions. A session on genomics will discuss data derived from recent completion of the genomes of Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 -the largest microbial genome sequenced to date -and Anabaena sp.PCC 7120. Further sessions will emphasize recent  developments in nitrogen fixation, differentiation, photosynthesis and cyanobacterial physiology and molecular ecology.",
