 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides 40 scholarships to low- income, academically- talented college students majoring in computer science, mathematics or engineering. The project provides each recipient with a faculty mentor, and academic and career support. The scholarship program is composed of three phases: Recruitment, Selection, and Evaluation. The Recruitment phase includes making individuals aware of the program (visiting departments on campus, visiting student clubs, paper and electronic advertisements, and visiting local junior colleges) and identifying potential scholarship recipients. Phase two, Selection, begins with screening applications to verify basic eligibility. Phase three, Evaluation, consists of multiple assessments to determine how well the program's objectives are being met. Tutoring is available through the Academic Resources Center and the Math and Science Support Services. Specialized support services are available through the federal TRIO programs, the Office of Academic Support, and the Minority Affairs Office. The Career Services Office provides information about jobs, career search strategies, and graduate school. These existing forms of support are supplemented for scholarship recipients under this program. A scholarship recipient is required to attend weekly instructional sessions for each mathematics, computer science, or engineering course in which he or she is enrolled. Further, a scholarship recipient is required to submit periodic progress reports for these classes and to meet with his or her academic advisor and faculty mentor on a regular basis.",
