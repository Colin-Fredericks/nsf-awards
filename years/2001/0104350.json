 "awd_abstract_narration": "0104350\r\nSiegel\r\n\r\nThis proposal is concerned with the analysis and numerical computation of \r\nmoving boundaries in problems from fluid dynamics and materials \r\nscience. The proposed problems are motivated by different applications \r\nbut are remarkably similar from a mathematical point of view. One class \r\nof problems concerns the deformation and breakup via tip streaming of \r\ndrops and bubbles in extensional flows.  Tip streaming refers to the \r\nphenomenon where a bubble develops a deformed shape featuring \r\ncusplike ends, from which fine filaments or small bubbles are emitted into \r\nthe exterior fluid. Experiments suggest that interfacial tension gradients \r\nsuch as those produced by surfactants are important for the onset of this \r\ninstability. The PI shall continue his development of an analytical theory \r\nfor the deformation and evolution of slender bubbles with surfactant, \r\nfocusing on the effects of soluble surfactant and its influence in tip \r\nstreaming. Mathematical difficulties in the analysis are associated with a \r\njump in boundary conditions at \"stagnant caps\" of surfactant on the free \r\nsurface.  Techniques employed to address these difficulties include \r\nsingular perturbation theory, theory of singular integral equations and \r\nRiemann-Hilbert problems, and complex variable theory in moving \r\nboundary problems. The theory will be complemented by accurate \r\nnumerical computations. The PI also proposes to investigate tip streaming \r\nand air entrainment in simple models of fiber coating, as well as cusp \r\nformation and a possible analogue of tip streaming which may occur \r\nduring the diffusion controlled evolution of voids in a stressed solid. The \r\nmathematical statements of these free boundary problems are similar, and \r\nthe PI expects that there will be a certain synergism between them.\r\n\r\nMoving boundary problems, such as the evolution of waves on water, the \r\npropagation of flame fronts, or the growth of crystals, continue to \r\nchallenge applied scientists and engineers. The PI proposes to study a \r\nclass of fundamental moving boundary problems that are important in \r\ntechnological applications.  A common feature among the proposed \r\nproblems is that the moving interface develops very small-scale features, \r\nsuch as cusps or very fine filaments, which can then greatly influence the \r\nproperties of the material or fluid. One application of the proposed work is \r\nin the coating of materials (such as optical fibers) by pulling at high speed \r\nthrough a liquid bath. Air filaments produced during the coating process \r\ncan snap off, leaving voids or other blemishes that adulterate the coating. \r\nA second application is in the failure of materials.  Small pores present in \r\nmaterials evolve (via atomic diffusion) when the material is stressed. Cusp \r\ndevelopment in the pores can initiate cracks or dislocations (misalignment \r\nof atoms); this has been implicated as a prominent cause of failure in \r\nmicroelectronic circuits. Other applications include emulsion formation \r\nand mixing in multi-component fluid systems.\r\n",
