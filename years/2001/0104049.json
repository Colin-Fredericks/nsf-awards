A current aim is to\r\nconstruct examples of minimal submanifolds with singular sets which\r\ninclude ``gaps'' and other phenomena, the possibility of which is left\r\nopen by his previous general work on the structure of the singular\r\nset.  He is also proposing to complete work on the singular set of\r\nmod-2 currents to show that, in all dimensions, the top-dimensional\r\npart of the singular set locally lies in a finite union of\r\ncontinuously differentiable submanifolds.  Simon also proposes to\r\npursue several questions related to asymptotics on approach to\r\nsingularities.  Brian White plans to study how regularity properties\r\nand singular structure for minimizing chains with coefficients in a\r\nmetric group depend on the group and its metric. This includes study\r\nof immiscible fluid interfaces as a special case.  He also plans to\r\ninvestigate singularities in the mean-curvature flow.  He will\r\ncontinue his investigations of 2-dimensional minimal surfaces, in\r\nparticular concerning branch points and concerning total boundary\r\ncurvature.\r\n\r\nAn understanding of singularities, and how singularities are formed,\r\nis a fundamental element in our overall understanding of many physical\r\nand geometric phenomena.  For example, in cosmology singularities of\r\nspace-time (e.g. ``black holes'') play a fundamental role.  Likewise\r\nin the study of the ``canonical'' objects which arise naturally in\r\ntopology and geometry, singularities arise in a very natural and\r\nunavoidable manner, and the understanding of these singularities is an\r\nabsolutely fundamental problem.  As with most non-linear phenomena,\r\nthere is not a single general theory which applies in a wide range of\r\ndifferent contexts. Rather, each different context has its own\r\ncollection of effective techniques, and it is the development and\r\napplication of such techniques in the context of the geometric\r\ncalculus of variations which is the focus of the present research\r\nproposal. Specifically, Simon and White propose to continue their\r\nefforts toward a complete understanding of singularities, and how they\r\nare formed, in the context of area minimizing submanifolds and energy\r\nminimizing maps.  Such techniques are likely to be applicable to the\r\nstudy of other objects of geometric and physical significance---for\r\nexample to the study of immiscible fluid interfaces, soap-films, and\r\nthe equilibrium free surfaces of fluids.\r\n\r\n",
