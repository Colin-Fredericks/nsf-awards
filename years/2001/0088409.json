These instruments are traditionally used in upper-level courses such as Organic Chemistry and Instrumental Methods of Analysis. However, this award is allowing their use across the entire undergraduate curriculum, including Survey Chemistry, General Chemistry, and Biochemistry as well as the traditional courses. The experiments in each course are being adapted from the research and educational literature and after appropriate modification, implemented into our courses. The experiments utilizing these instruments are capturing the interest of the students, integrating 'cutting-edge' technology into their laboratory experience, and impacting student learning for all students, major and non-major alike.\r\n",
