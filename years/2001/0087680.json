 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) \r\n \r\nThe objective of the proposal is to enhance the learning process for students in Introductory Statistics and Calculus Based Statistics by adapting and implementing several types of pedagogical methods including ActivStats developed by P. Velleman and applets on the internet developed at the University of South Carolina. To implement the project a 32-student classroom was created which included an overhead projection unit and a smart board. The classroom enables multiple types of learning experiences and provides the technology for access to and analysis of real data. The smart board allows the instructor to edit any output coming from the projector as well as provide notes that are stored. The board also allows the instructor to retrieve notes as needed. Also, students work collaboratively and use real application. Hence, they become properly equipped for experiences beyond the classroom. Another important aspect of the project is the ability of the students to communicate their ideas. This is addressed by assigning and emphasizing writing assignments. \r\n\r\nUsing more active learning approaches with real data from many disciplines enables statistics students to better understand concepts and be able to apply them to their fields of study and personal lives. Also, from the writing assignments students gain technical writing experiences and skills.\r\n\r\nThe proposal directly addresses the themes of enhanced student learning, faculty development and integration of technology into education.\r\n\r\n",
