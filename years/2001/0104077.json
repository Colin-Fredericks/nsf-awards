 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0104077\r\nStephan Stolz\r\n  \r\nThe principal investigator proposes to study the question\r\nwhich manifolds admit  Riemannian metrics of positive scalar\r\nand Ricci curvature, respectively. Concerning the\r\nfirst question, previous work of the principal\r\ninvestigator shows that these questions boil down to\r\ncomputing abelian groups which depend only on the\r\ndimension, the fundamental group and the first two\r\nStiefel-Whitney classes of the manifold these metrics\r\nlive on.  The role these groups play in the \r\nexistence/classification problem for positive scalar\r\ncurvature metrics is analogous of the role of Wall's\r\nsurgery obstruction groups in the existence/classification\r\nproblem for smooth structures.  The principal investigator \r\nhopes to  gain an algebraic/functorial  understanding of \r\nthese groups by studying various maps that relate these \r\ngroups with homology/K-theory/connective K-theory of \r\nclassifying spaces of groups, and with the K-theory of the\r\nassociated group C*-algebras. Concerning positive Ricci \r\ncurvature, the investigator is pursuing a proof of his \r\nconjecture that the existence of a positive Ricci \r\ncurvature metric on a spin manifold with vanishing \r\nfirst Pontryagin class implies the vanishing of its\r\nWitten genus. This invariant arose from considerations \r\nin string theory. Heuristically it is the index of a yet \r\nto be rigorously defined \"Dirac operator\" on the free \r\nloop space of this manifold. Mike Hopkins has described a \r\nhomotopy theoretic way to define the Witten genus of a \r\nfamily of such manifolds which  lives in the elliptic \r\ncohomology of the parameter space. It is a very interesting \r\nchallenge to express the elliptic cohomology and the\r\nfamily Witten genus in terms of the objects that string \r\ntheorists are analysing and thus to give a geometric \r\ninterpretation of Hopkins construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese projects fit in the general framework of trying \r\nto relate the topology of a manifold (qualitative \r\ninformation about its global shape) and its geometry \r\n(quantitative information about its local shape). For\r\n2-dimensional manifolds (like the surface of a ball or \r\na tire), a nice classification has been known for a long \r\ntime: Two such surfaces have the same topology (that is, \r\nthey can be deformed into each other if we think of\r\nthem as being made of thin rubber) if and only if they \r\nhave the same number of `holes' (the surface of a ball \r\nno holes, the surface of a tire or a cup has one hole, \r\nand a pretzel has two holes).  Moreover, if a surface has\r\n`positive curvature' in the sense that the angle sum in \r\neach triangle whose edges are geodesics (shortest curves) \r\nis larger than 180 degrees, then this surface has the \r\nsame topology as the surface of a ball. It is a major \r\ngoal of modern day mathematics to generalize these \r\nresults to higher dimensional manifolds.  For example, \r\nour universe is a manifold of dimension 3, Einstein's \r\nspace-time has dimension 4, and manifolds of dimension 10, respectively, 26 play a crucial role in the theoretical \r\nphysics of the attempted unification of the four \r\nfundamental forces.\r\n",
