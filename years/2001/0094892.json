The Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) program allows eligible students to advance their knowledge of engineering and science, earn an Associate degree or Bachelor degree in Engineering Technology, enhance their career marketability, and prepare to enter the region's engineering technology workforce. The mission of the college is to deliver through traditional and innovative programs an education that prepares students to prosper in their chosen professions and thrive in a society characterized by diversity and change. The CSEMS program provides an educational opportunity to students who would otherwise not consider higher education or need a higher degree to maintain job security.",
