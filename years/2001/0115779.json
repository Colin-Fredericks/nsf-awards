The investigators will study traffic modeling and analysis and traffic engineering as applied to telecommunication networks.  Queuing systems are the fundamental systems in telecommunication networks, of which traffic is the major constituent.  Solution of queuing systems in most cases reduce to the solution of a certain set of structured Markov chains if the traffic and server process are modeled as Markovian processes.  The two scientists have introduced a new paradigm \"Generalized Invariant Subspace Approach,\" which was used to numerically solve a set of structured Markov chains, the so-called M/G/1-type Markov chains.  They plan to extend the applicability of the approach to a wider set of Markov chains, used in numerical solution of queues ranging from fluid queues to random servers, and from finite capacity queues to continuous-time queues.  They also plan to introduce an interdisciplinary technique using \"optimal control\" to set the foundation for a theory to synthesize path-splitting mechanisms that are used in engineering of current Internet infrastructures.\r\n\r\nScope:  This project enables two qualified scientists with complementary expertise to address a problem that is important in the management of Internet and wireless data transmission.   The two scientists collaborated in the 1994-1996 period and produced significant results.  This project will allow them to combine expertise in this multidisciplinary research field to produce a very generic engine that solves most Markovian systems that arise in the field of performance evaluation of communication networks.  One or more graduate students from Bilkent University are expected to join the research at UMKC. \r\n",
