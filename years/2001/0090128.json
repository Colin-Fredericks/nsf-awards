The research funded by this award will study ways to increase the signal strength of dark-line resonances in three-level atomic systems, which are significant for both magnetometry and atomic clock research.  Problems associated with the measurement of the small absorption limits the stability of clock reference frequencies and magnetometer sensitivities.  The results of this research will be of benefit to the magnetometry work at Bonn and to the atomic clock research at the University of Colorado and at NIST, since both fields rely on the physics of exciting and measuring hyperfine transitional in alkali atoms.  Not only will this collaboration lead to a better understanding of the underlying physics, but will also lead to a practical exchange of technological methods now used in each field individually. The opportunity this joint, collaborative research effort presents junior researchers is substantial, and the work done on this proposal will help institutionalize the relationship between the German and U.S. research groups.\r\n",
