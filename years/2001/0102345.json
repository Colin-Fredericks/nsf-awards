 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019.   A novel approach for  the fabrication of atomistic electronic devices  is proposed which, if realized, will have important industrial  applications. The theoretical methods involve simulations using   quantum tight-binding molecular dynamics scheme that can be used to   accurately treat interactions in carbon systems at the nanoscale  level. Large scale simulations will be performed using novel  parallel computer algorithms using a synergistic interdisciplinary  collaboration. Simulation results can be used as a guide in the  experimental investigations.\r\n\r\nAlthough the present electronic technology is dominated by silicon,  it is becoming clear that Si based electronic devices cannot be  relied on to sustain the current pace of miniaturization. It is\r\nbecoming clear that a new class of molecularly perfect materials are needed to make these new devices.  Single-wall carbon nanotubes are  one such material that are expected to execute a ``quantum'' leap i  the area of nanoscale electronics, computers, and materials.   A  focussed effort to lay the foundation for fullerene and nanotube based molecular electronics which  will revolutionize the electronics and computer industries is proposed. The  emphasis is on the modeling and simulations which will be used to guide experimental efforts to realize these devices.  The theoretical method for the treatment of these systems contains many state-of-the-art features, making it ideally suited for studying  these systems.\r\n",
