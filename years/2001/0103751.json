 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 43rd Annual Maize Genetics Conference is being held March 15-18, 2001 in Lake Geneva, WI.  The meeting offers members of the Maize Genetics community the opportunity to present and discuss their most recent research results.  A wide range of topics are covered, ranging from classical to molecular genetics.  The 43rd Annual meeting features 45 minute talks by four invited speakers, 15 minute talks given by individual participants, two poster sessions, and two workshops.  The invited speakers are: Alice Barkan, University of Oregon; Kelly Dawe, University of Georgia; June Nasrallah, Cornell University; and Laurie Smith, University of California-San Diego. The workshops focus on two timely topics: Comparative Genomics of Maize and Rice and Bioinformatics.  This award provides partial support toward student participation in the conference.  The Maize Genetics meeting provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers.",
