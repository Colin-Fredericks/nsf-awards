The main objectives of the project are to apply the\r\ntheories of statistical mechanics and stochastic differential\r\nequations to develop constitutive relations for continuum rod\r\nmodels of DNA that are provably consistent with detailed,\r\nsequence-dependent structural information at the base-pair level;\r\nto apply the new concept of global curvature to develop a\r\ngeometrically exact and computationally tractable formulation of\r\nthe self-contact constraint that plays a central role in the\r\nsupercoiling and packaging of DNA and other biological filaments;\r\nand to develop efficient and provably accurate computational\r\nmethods for continuum rod models that faithfully respect global\r\ngeometric constraints as well as qualitative features of the\r\nunderlying system.\r\n     Biologists and chemists now believe that the linear sequence\r\nof base-pairs along a DNA molecule contains not only a genetic\r\ncode, but also a structural code that governs the global\r\norganization of the molecule and its susceptibility to\r\ninteractions with other molecules.  An understanding of this\r\nstructural code requires realistic mechanical models of DNA over\r\na wide range of length scales.  The research project pursued by\r\nthe investigator is aimed at the further refinement of medium- to\r\nlong-scale continuum models.  In particular, methods are\r\ndeveloped for estimating local, sequence-dependent material\r\nparameters and for describing global, finite-thickness effects.\r\nResults from this research will be useful in developing a greater\r\nunderstanding of the physical and mechanical properties of DNA,\r\nin modeling how DNA may twist, bend and supercoil upon itself,\r\nand in studying how DNA and other material filaments may be\r\noptimally packed in confined geometries.\r\n\r\n",
