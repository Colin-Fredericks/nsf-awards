 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an entirely new form of machine vision technology for process control during the manufacture of precision metal components.  The technology will be based on a two-dimensional array of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor elements capable of providing high resolution three-dimensional images of metallic components in real-time. Previous research with individual GMR sensor elements with dimensions of 10 microns has demonstrated detection capabilities with sensitivities up to 60 dB better than conventional eddy-current sensors at a lower per unit cost A densely packed, two-dimensional GMR sensor array, combined with a variable frequency, uniform magnetic field generator, will produce high resolution, three-dimensional spatial information for complex metallic parts as they are produced using a rugged, non-contacting sensor system.  The data from these images will provide on-line feedback information for process control, quality assurance, and safety protocols during the manufacturing process.  The data will also be valuable for the design of more effective manufacturing processes. The successful development of GMR material fabrication techniques and sensors will provide the unique capabilities required to develop a magnetic field sensor array for machine vision and automated manufacturing.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed technology will find markets in manufacturing, quality assurance (QA), and process development.  It will be used for rapid imaging and on-line analysis of parts used in aerospace, automotive, transportation, construction, and other industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
