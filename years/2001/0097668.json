 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Kentucky, where a previous REU site was funded for 1997-1999.  David Atwood is the site's Program Director. Eleven faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will participate in a eleven-week program.  The research area will be nano-scale chemistry, which will include all of the major divisions of chemistry.  This research is multidisciplinary and is being conducted with a combination of collaborations involving the Engineering, Biological, and Geology departments.  Available to the undergraduates will be the research programs of other faculty outside of the nano-scale projects.  During the summer there will be a short-course on nanochemistry.  This program will target women and Appalachian students from Kentucky and neighboring states.  Academic year follow-up activities are planned.\r\n",
