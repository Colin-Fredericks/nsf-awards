The goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for students to be exposed to\r\nthe most recent developments in operation, construction, and research in the power\r\nengineering field. This is a particularly critical time for power engineering as the\r\nindustry undergoes significant change due to the restructuring of the traditional utility\r\nstructure. The career opportunities for students interested in power engineering are many\r\nand varied; the program offers students several opportunities to interact with faculty and\r\nstudents from other universities in the power area.",
