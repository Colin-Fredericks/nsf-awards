 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bringing Up Girls in Science (BUGS) is a demonstration project in the Department of Technology \r\nand Cognition at the University of North Texas (UNT). The goal of this project is to provide \r\neducational experiences in an outdoor learning lab for girls in grades four and five that will\r\nincrease girls' interest, participation, self-concept, knowledge, and achievement in the \r\nenvironmental sciences. During Year One, thirty 4 th and 5 th grade girls (BUGS participants) \r\nwill participate in an after school outdoor science lab at Sam Houston Elementary in the \r\nDenton Independent School District in Denton, TX. Participants for the project will be \r\nrecruited from across the district. BUGS participants will be mentored by female \r\nhigh students enrolled in the Texas Academy for Mathematics and Science (TAMS). \r\nBUGS participants and mentors will be joined the second and third year of the project\r\nby girls in special populations at distance sites through the use \r\nof two-way audio-visual desktop conferencing tools, a project WEB site, chat rooms, and \r\ncomputer ``pen-pals''. For the second and third year special populations joining the project \r\nwill include: (1) students with emotional and behavioral problems attending Rose Street \r\nDay Program and Therapeutic School in Wichita Falls, TX; (2) a school district which serves \r\nlarge numbers of Hispanic and Native American students in Bernalillo, New Mexico; and\r\n(3) students from a rural school district in Decatur, Texas. BUGS participants at distance \r\nsites will be able to use ``electronic field trips'' developed from activities that were \r\nvideotaped during Year One to increase their opportunities to participate in the ``outdoor\r\nscience lab experience.'' Family involvement will be ongoing throughout the project.\r\nCareer awareness and educational opportunities materials will be housed by a local\r\npublic library for the parents of BUGS participants. Three parent \r\nmeetings per year will be provided to ``showcase'' student work and provide educational \r\nand career information.\r\n\r\n",
