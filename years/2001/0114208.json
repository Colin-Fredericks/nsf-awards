The local heating and local measurements of thermal properties are two critical features for the research of bulk metallic glass (BMG)-based films produced by combinatorial synthesis.  In addition, local processing and manipulation of nanostructures can also be accomplished.  Spatial patterning of magnetic properties could arise from locally induced nanocrystallization of magnetic BMG and patterning of carbon nanotubes can be accomplished by nano-welding on BMG substrate.  In addition to graduate and undergraduate research, the mTA system will be used for outreach activities with local school systems providing a unique platform for hands-on experiences in nanoscale thermal properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will provide support to the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill for the acquisition of a micro-thermal analysis (mTA) system which is an atomic force microscope with the capabilities of thermal and thermal mechanical analysis.
