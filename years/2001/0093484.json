 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging infrastratureless wireless networking technologies such as MANET [1], sensor networks [31],\r\nand bluetooth [2] will seek to support advanced applications such as smart environment, \"zero conf\"\r\nteleconferencing setups, collaborative learning, wireless access to Web services, and emergency rescure\r\noperations. This class of applications is mission critical, and the network has to address a number of critical\r\nissues in order to cope with the anticipated design requirements of such applications. In an\r\ninfrastructureless wireless network, no underlying infrastructure, such as cellular layout and central control units e.g. base stations, is available for networking support. A large number of networking devices are allowed to communicate with one another over the shared wireless medium in an ad hoc manner. Some\r\nunique design challenges posed by such networks include fully distributed and localized design, sustained\r\nquality of service (QoS), efficient network resource utilization, unconstrained scalability and robust system\r\nperformance. State-of-the-art solutions are inadequate to address these issues and meet the applications'\r\nrequirements. A fundamental problem is that an infrastructureless wireless network is a large-scale\r\ndistributed system that may consist of a very large number of wireless networking components (e.g.\r\nthousands, even millions in a sensor network), which have limited power and computing resources and are\r\nprone to channel errors and failures. Therefore, any feasible system solution must be fully distributed and\r\nlocalized, scalable, and robust. In some sense, the microscopic behavior of each individual node may not be\r\nvery critical, but network nodes must collectively achieve the desired global macroscopic property.\r\n     In this project, we propose a novel self-organizing protocol and algorithm design approach for such\r\nnetworks, in order to meet the challenges posed by applications as well as the network itself. In a self-organizing design approach, local decision makers self-organize themselves and coordinate among one\r\nanother, in order to collectively achieve the desired global property. We apply our proposed design\r\nmethodology in two largely unaddressed problem domains: fair packet scheduling in multihop wireless\r\nnetworks, and robust report forwarding in sensor networks. Toward this end, we present four self-organizing packet-scheduling algorithms and a novel report forwarding protocol that we have developed\r\nrecently [22, 24, 35, 36, 46, 47]. The key innovations of this work are:\r\n      A model-referenced self-organizing algorithm and protocol design approach.\r\n      A suite of self-organizing packet scheduling algorithms for infrastructureless wireless networks that\r\nprovide QoS performance bounds in terms of fairness, throughput and delay, maximize channel spatial\r\nreuse, and arbitrate the conflict between achieving fairness and maximizing channel utilization.\r\n      A novel self-organizing data forwarding protocol that allows for unconstrained scalability, supports\r\nrobust message delivery along the optimal forwarding band, and ensures efficient power consumption\r\nin the context of sensor networks.\r\n     The expected research results from this project include a formal investigation of self-organizing design\r\napproach, and a detailed design, analysis, and evaluation of the self-organizing algorithms and protocols for\r\npacket scheduling and report forwarding. The resulting software will be freely available to the research\r\ncommunity. The education plan in this proposal includes offering a new graduate course, reinventing an\r\nundergraduate networking course, recruiting more students into undergraduate research programs, and\r\nsetting up an undergraduate networking laboratory.",
