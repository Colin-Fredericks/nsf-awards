This system will supply the following advanced materials characterization capabilities: powder diffraction, particle sizing, strain analysis, texture, phase identification, quantitative phase composition, lattice parameter determination, amorphous component characterization, and thin layer analysis. These capabilities will be used to support research in the following areas: environmental science and engineering, polymers, nano-structured materials, structured thin films, high technology alloys, superconducting and magnetic materials, and geological and paleontological materials. The research will involve 19 senior personnel and numerous graduate and undergraduate students from Lamar University, Prairie View A&M University, Texas A&M University, and the Technological Institute of Saltillo, Mexico, as well as the steel and mining industries. The project will promote regional and international research collaboration and will give numerous research and educational projects access to high quality x-ray diffraction.\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Lamar University will acquire a high quality x-ray diffraction system to support interdisciplinary materials research and educational activities at Lamar University and research collaboration activities with other universities and industry. The system will provide advanced capabilities to characterize physical and chemical structural phenomena in a wide range of research and educational projects involving environmental samples, nanoscience and engineering, thin films, high technology alloys, advanced electronic and magnetic samples and geological materials. It involves several universities (Lamar, Prairie View A&M University, Texas A&M and the Technological Institute of Saltillo, Mexico). Nineteen senior personnel and numerous graduate and undergraduate students will be given access to a high quality research system that will promote regional and international collaboration.\r\n\r\n",
