Walker\r\nAssociation for Computational Linguistics\r\n$7,000 - 6 mos\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKSHOP: ACL'2001 Student Research Workshop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is funding to subsidize expenses of student participants in the Student Research Workshop organized in conjunction with the Association for Computational Linguistics Conference (ACL'2001), which will be held July 6-11, 2001, in Toulouse, France.  The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international organization in the field of natural language processing and language engineering, with two regional chapters, Europe (EACL) and North America (NAACL), of approximately equal size.   The Association's annual conference, which is the major international meeting in the field, has traditionally rotated between North America and Europe but was held last year for the first time in a Pacific Rim location (Hong Kong).  The ACL Student Workshop is an inexpensive yet highly effective means of encouraging young and upcoming computational linguists.   The intimate workshop format, in addition to affording student participants sufficient time to present their research (20 minutes) and receive feedback from a panel of established researchers in the field (15 minutes), encourages them to begin building a rapport with established researchers.   Through feedback from the panel and other student participants,  this nurturing effort will pay dividends by providing the students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives and guidance on their work at a critical time in their research in this rapidly changing research field.\r\n",
