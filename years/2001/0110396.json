 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the mechanisms of stabilization of protein structure represents one of the major\r\naspects of the protein folding problem. The contributions of various short-range interactions,\r\nsuch as hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic effect, and configurational entropy, to protein\r\nstability have been well documented. However, it is becoming more and more evident that the\r\nlong-range electrostatic interactions between charged protein groups are also important\r\ncontributors to protein structure and stability. The proposed work has an overall goal to explore\r\nthe relation between the charge-charge interactions on the protein surface and the protein\r\nstability by engineering  a thermostable protein by redesigning the charge-charge interactions on the\r\nprotein surface, and analyzing  the optimized charge-charge interactions.  \r\n\r\nThe theoretical part of the work is based on the calculation of the charge-charge\r\ninteractions in proteins using Tanford-Kirkwood approach with Bashford-Karplus approximation\r\n(TK-BK procedure). The experimental measurement of the stabilities of the protein variants\r\ndesigned using TK-BK predictions will be done using differential scanning calorimetry, or using\r\nchemical (urea) induced denaturation monitored by the changes in the circular dichroism or\r\nfluorescence intensity properties. The fundamental importance of this research is that\r\nusing a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements the relationship\r\nbetween charge-charge interactions and the protein stability will be explored. From the practical\r\npoint this research will provide the foundation for the design of proteins stable at extreme\r\ntemperatures. This will benefit the industrial use of proteins where thermostability of enzymes is\r\nin many cases the largest obstacle.",
