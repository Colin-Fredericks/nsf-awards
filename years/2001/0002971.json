The new center is motivated by the fact that photopolymerizations offer tremendous advantages over traditional thermal processing methods, including low energy requirements, spatial and temporal control of initiation, and high polymerization rates.  These advantages have led to tremendous growth in applications of photopolymerizations in areas such a solvent-free processing, biomedical materials, and high-technology devices; however, much of this growth is occurring without a fundamental understanding of the underlying photochemical processes.  Hence, there is a critical need to establish an active dialogue between academic and industrial researchers.  The objective of the center are 1) to advance the fundamental understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of photopolymerizations; 2) to establish a venue for active discussions and collaborations among industrial and academic researchers; 3) to explore high-risk, cutting-edge research on photopolymerization processes that could lead to technological innovations; and 4) to promote and/or develop novel applications that exploit the unique set of advantages offered by photopolymerizations.\r\n",
