 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reptiles and amphibians in the northern portions of their ranges in North America may spend as much as half of their lives hibernating.  Some overwinter on land, but many hibernate under water.  Aquatic species avoid freezing by hibernating underwater, but they then must switch from aerial to aquatic respiration, with its attendant physiological challenges.  However, there have been few detailed physiological/ecological studies of naturally hibernating aquatic reptiles and amphibians.  The PIs propose to study hibernation and overwintering in northern reptiles and amphibians, starting by expanding their previous laboratory studies on turtles to include additional turtle species, frogs, and wintertime field studies.\r\n\r\nThe field physiology and behavior of naturally hibernating painted turtles, map turtles, snapping turtles, softshelled turtles, and bullfrogs from known northern populations in New England and Wisconsin will be studied by radiotelemetric tracking.  Concurrently, laboratory studies of physiological responses to simulated hibernation will be conducted with all species.  Data should allow generalizations about physiological/ecological strategies employed during this major portion of the life cycle of freshwater reptiles and amphibians, lay the groundwork for future studies, and supply information crucial to conservation efforts.\r\n",
