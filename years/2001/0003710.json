The research funded by this award will further our understanding of the integer quantum Hall effect by combining the expertise of the U.S. group in analytical techniques with that of the German group in numerical simulation.  Using a novel technique, called the renormalization group approach, the combined German and U.S. groups will be able to carry the understanding of the quantum Hall effect to a new level.  In addition, the collaboration will investigate the sensitivity of neutral objects to magnetic flux according to the Aharanov-Bohm theory.  The German group has access to excellent super-computing facilities and is world renowned for numerical studies of the physics of disordered systems.  The opportunity this joint, collaborative research effort presents junior researchers is substantial, and the work done on this proposal will help institutionalize the relationship between the German and U.S. research groups.\r\n",
