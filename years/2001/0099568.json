 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research is being carried out in two areas related to\r\ngravitational waves and their detection.  The first area is the\r\ninvention of new techniques and technology for advanced\r\nlaser-interferometer gravitational-wave detectors.  These advanced\r\ndetectors will entail measuring the motions of 40 kilogram\r\nsapphire-crystal mirrors with an accuracy so high that the mirrors are\r\ngoverned by the laws of quantum mechanics and not the laws of classical\r\nphysics. The new techniques and technology entail, among other things,\r\nnew configurations of mirrors and laser beams designed to deal with\r\nquantum effects that are absent in current gravitational-wave\r\ndetectors, changes in how the laser light is manipulated after it\r\nleaves the interferometer, and a reshaping of the cross sections of the\r\ninterferometer's light beams. The second area of research is the\r\ntheoretical modeling of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves\r\nwith the goal of predicting the sources' dynamical behaviors and the\r\ndetails of the waves they emit.  Among the sources being modeled are\r\noscillations of rapidly spinning, newborn neutron stars, the spins of\r\nneutron stars that are accreting gas from companion stars (``Low-Mass\r\nX-Ray Binaries''), the late, highly relativistic phase of inspiral of\r\nblack-hole/black-hole and black-hole/neutron-star binaries, collisions\r\nof black holes, and the tearing apart of a neutron star by a black\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nThe research on new techniques and technology for gravitational-wave\r\ndetectors is a key underpinning for the advanced detectors that are\r\nbeing proposed for construction in LIGO (the Laser Interferometer\r\nGravitational Wave Observatory) beginning in 2006, and for even more\r\nadvanced detectors in the subsequent decade.  This research makes use\r\nof, and contributes to, human knowledge in the area of quantum\r\ninformation theory --- a new, 21st century discipline that also\r\nincludes quantum computation.  This research is likely to have much\r\nimpact on areas of technology that---in the coming two or three\r\ndecades---will confront quantum limits on the accuracy of measurement\r\nand will try to evade them via ``quantum nondemolition'' (QND)\r\ntechniques. These areas of technology include quantum optics and\r\nnanotechnology.  The research on sources of gravitational waves will\r\nprovide key underpinnings for analyses of the gravitational-wave data\r\nto be produced by LIGO:  It will improve the ability to find\r\ngravitational-wave signals in the noisy LIGO data, and it will provide\r\ntools for extracting astrophysical information from the discovered\r\nsignals.  Thus, this research will play a key role in future\r\ngravitational-wave-based studies of black holes, neutron stars, and\r\ntheir oscillations and collisions.",
