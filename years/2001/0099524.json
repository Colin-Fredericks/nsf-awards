 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for the research program of the high energy physics group at the University of California, San Diego to continue experimental investigations of heavy quark physics as part of the CLEO collaboration at the electron-positron colliding beam facility, CESR, located at Cornell University.  One effort will focus on rare semi-leptonic B-meson decays involving the CKM matrix element Vub, a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model.   Another UCSD effort involves mixing and CP violation in the D0 D0-bar system.  \r\n\tIn response to the recommendations of reviewers, the UCSD group will move its research program from CLEO at CESR to BaBar at PEP-II at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.  The group is interested in rare semi-leptonic charged and neutral B-meson decays into non-charm mesons such as B  p l nl .   This process is sensitive to the CKM matrix element Vub.  A small but gradually increasing effort will be directed toward the CMS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  UCSD is a part of the CMS collaboration and has taken responsibility for part of the Level-2 trigger and data acquisition.  This work would be integrated with that of other physicists at UCSD.\r\n",
