The research funded by this award will improve laser-spectroscopic methods for the non-intrusive measurement of fuel and temperature distributions in direct-injection gasoline engines.  The collaboration brings together the unique expertise of the two groups.  The Heidelberg group has strong expertise in laser spectroscopy and quantitative diagnostic tools, and the Michigan group has fundamental knowledge and research experience in engine technology.  The PI also has strong contacts in the automotive industry, which is interested in the results of the research.  Much of the research will be performed by a graduate student from the PI's group working in Heidelberg.  Exchange of junior researchers is emphasized to add an international dimension to their training and to allow them to establish international connections early in their careers.\r\n",
