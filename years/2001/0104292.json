 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences: Symmetry and Mechanics: Geometric \r\nIntegration\r\nTechniques and Bifurcations of Relative Critical Points\r\n\r\nDMS-0104292\r\nLewis\r\n\r\nThe project consists of three main components: geometric \r\nintegration using Lie group methods, numerical \r\nintegration of conservative systems, and bifurcation \r\ntheory of relative critical points.  The first component \r\ninvolves the design of efficient, stable geometric \r\nintegration schemes on Lie groups and homogeneous \r\nmanifolds.  The primary goals are minimization of \r\ncomputational costs with accurate capture of key features \r\nand facilitation of the adaptation of existing numerical \r\ncodes to geometric schemes.  The second component \r\naddresses the role of approximate or exact preservation \r\nof conserved quantities or structures in the numerical \r\nintegration of conservative systems.  Comparisons of the \r\nsymplectic, energy, and momentum errors to overall \r\nalgorithm performance, including accuracy of capture of \r\nsuch key features of the underlying system as (relative) \r\nequilibria and separatrices, will be carried out for a \r\nvariety of algorithms, including variational algorithms.  \r\nThe third component addresses the variational \r\ncharacterization of relative equilibria, that is, steady \r\nmotions, as critical points of appropriate functionals.  \r\nThe notion of a relative critical point unifies and \r\ngeneralizes the two most widely used characterizations; \r\nthis generalization will facilitate the extension of \r\nexisting bifurcation and stability results to a wide \r\nrange of finite and infinite dimensional systems and will \r\nprovide insights into the geometric structure of sets of \r\nrelative equilibria.\r\n\r\nSpecific applications of geometric integration methods \r\ninclude the Landau--Lifschitz--Ginzburg (LLG) equations \r\nfor a micromagnetic field and various mathematical models \r\nof muscular hydrostats.  The LLG equations model systems \r\nsuch as read/write heads on disk drives, nanocrystralline \r\nmagnets, and magnetohydrodynamic materials; efficient, \r\naccurate numerical algorithms are needed to carry out \r\nsimulations on the spatial and temporal scales relevant \r\nto industrial applications.  Muscular hydrostats are \r\nstructural components of many biological systems, \r\nincluding many kinds of worms, reptile and amphibian \r\ntongues, and sea anemones; plausible mathematical models \r\nof these systems are needed to test theories of the \r\nevolution of such systems.  Conservative systems arise \r\nthroughout physics and mechanics, playing a crucial role \r\nin both industrial and theoretical research. Numerical \r\nsimulations that respect the conservation laws of such \r\nsystems have been shown to be crucial in several fields, \r\nincluding astrophysics. The bifurcation analyses will be \r\napplied to problems in fluid mechanics, elasticity, and \r\nstellar dynamics.\r\n",
