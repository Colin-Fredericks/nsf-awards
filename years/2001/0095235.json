 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the role of patient information concerning multiple\r\naspects of quality in the health sector of Tanzania, and how this information\r\nchanges and is updated when quality changes. \r\nIn Tanzania, as in most African countries, patients, even the poor, have a\r\nnumber of choices when they seek care. Although it may involve significant\r\nadditional expense, patients frequently bypass one facility to seek care at a\r\nmore distant facility. Differences in quality can explain this phenomenon.\r\nHowever, it is widely held that patients cannot directly evaluate many aspects\r\nof quality in health care. Patients know that one facility is cleaner or has a\r\nmore polite staff, but they do not know the quality of their consultation or\r\nprescription. They seek the services of a professional because they do not know\r\nwhat professionals know, and this leaves them unable to fully evaluate the\r\nservices they receive.\r\nThis project collects a unique data set in which patient choices are matched\r\nwith objective measures of a variety of aspects of quality as evaluated by\r\nother physicians. Though patients cannot directly evaluate all aspects of\r\nquality, another doctor can. The data depicts patients' willingness to incur\r\nadditional travel cost for different objective aspects of quality. \r\nPreliminary analysis of an earlier round of data collection has shown that\r\npatients know about unobservable aspects of quality. The additional round of\r\ndata quantitatively characterizes the method by which patients learn about\r\nsomething that they cannot directly observe. The data depicts quality that\r\nvaries between facilities, between the various organizations that provide\r\nhealth services in Tanzania, within these organizations and over time. Using\r\nthis data, the project reveals whether patients assign reputations to\r\norganizations, management practices within organizations, individual\r\nfacilities, or even individual doctors. It addition, it depicts the speed with\r\nwhich patients update their information about quality.\r\n        The manner and speed with which patients learn and update information\r\nabout quality has important implications for the future of decentralization,\r\nprivatization and regulation of health services in Tanzania and Africa in\r\ngeneral. \r\n\r\n",
