Is peer reviewed science performed by mission oriented agencies (e.g. EPA, USDA & USGS) of interest only to employees of the agency or their disciplinary mission? Is the scientific curiosity of university faculty of interest to anyone other than the curious faculty member?  Questions, such as the above, have been and continue to be asked by the public and their elected representatives as society faces increasingly complex water management decisions and science seems incapable of providing relevant input.\r\n\r\nUCOWR is proposing to organize a day-long series of sessions at its 2001 annual meeting in Utah to examine past and current management method enployed to plan, review, and conduct water research as well as evaluate the relevance of water research findings to society's need for new knowledge to support increasingly complex water management decision-making.  A Water Resources Update issue will be produced from the day-long sessions as well as a summary dialogue paper for the dialogue section of the journal of the American Water Resources Association and /or EOS.\r\n",
