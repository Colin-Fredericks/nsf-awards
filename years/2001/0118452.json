The organizers are Joseph P. Stoltman and James E. Davis of Western Michigan University and Ashley Kent of the London Institute of Education and Andrew Convey of the University of Sheffield. The objective of the project is to engage \"newly established\" US and European scientist/researchers in international research collaboration on instruction in and learning of geography and science in the middle and secondary school years (grades 7 - 12).  Participants will discuss specific research foci in pre- and post-conference workshop devoted to development of a research agenda and writing of proposals. Established scholars and researchers will serve as mentors and reviewers of the research proposals and designs.  In addition each US participant will receive funds to initiate an international collaborative project.\r\n\r\nAmong the topics proposed for collaborative research in geography/science education are: differential performance between boys and girls; relationship between collaboration among teachers within schools and student performance; action agendas to promote instructional opportunities; comparison of integrated science approaches in teaching with other curricular and instruction approaches; and effects of parental participation in learning. The workshop will enhance understanding of European instruction in geography at comparable grade levels and take advantage of European advances and achievements in this area. \r\n",
