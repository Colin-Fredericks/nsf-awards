 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development and optimization of a continuous, easily scalable and economical synthesis of reactive nanoparticles (RNPs); characterization and control of physical and chemical properties of these materials; development of flexible synthesis approaches for production of complex nanoparticle metal oxides;  and identification and establishment of quality control procedures. This effort is critically needed in order to develop commercially viable nanomaterials for applications in both civilian and military markets.  As demonstrated during the Phase I research, nanomaterials, produced using the proprietary continuous process, possess the same chemical and physical properties as those prepared in a batchwise mode.  \r\n\r\nThe research is broad and spans a number of significant markets including decontamination technologies for military and civilian applications, improved catalysts and catalytic supports, industrial gas scrubbing, and active ingredients for high efficiency air and water purification systems.  Each of these market applications represents an initial subset of the market opportunities for these highly reactive nanomaterials. \r\n",
