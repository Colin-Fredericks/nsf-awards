To produce such interdisciplinary engineers, an educational program that provides a comprehensive interdisciplinary engineering background combined with a broad-based education in biomedical engineering (BME)is necessary. This is being implemented via a distinctive undergraduate BME concentration within the framework of the established engineering program at LeTourneau University. In addition, every engineering student in the University gains exposure to BME principles and experience in a BME laboratory. The BME concentration features: (1) 27 semester hours of specialized BME coursework, (2) 2,000 square-feet of BME laboratory space with modern experimental equipment, (3) 20 semester hours life science coursework, and (4) optional scheduling of additional science coursework needed for entrance to medical school; all built upon an ABET-accredited engineering degree. Additional enhancements include collaborations with colleagues at academic and medical affiliates, who provide student summer internships and BME workshops.\r\n",
