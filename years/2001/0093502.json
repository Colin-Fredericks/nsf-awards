 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) made with semiconducting (conjugated) polymers\r\nnow have quantum efficiencies as high as 4 % and operating lifetimes of 50,000 hours.\r\nSeveral companies are developing flat panel displays with these LEDs. One of the\r\nlimitations of polymer LEDs is that triplet excitons are non-emissive. Initial steps\r\ntowards solving this problem by transferring energy to phosphorescent molecules and\r\nrare earth complexes have recently been taken. One of the goals of this project is to\r\noptimize energy transfer and charge transport in \"doped\" polymer films so that high\r\nquantum efficiencies, low operating voltages and high device stability can be obtained.\r\nAnother limitation of current polymer LEDs is that most of the emitted photons are\r\ntrapped in the device by total internal reflection and that the photons which do escape\r\ncannot conveniently be collimated into a beam or coupled into a waveguide. The second\r\nmajor goal of the project is use photonic crystals, e.g. one-dimensional dielectric stacks\r\nand two-dimensional gratings, to control the directionality of emission. Previous\r\nattempts to do this have not been fully successful because it was not possible to make\r\nphotonic crystals with a photonic band gap wide enough to completely control the\r\nemission of conjugated polymers, which have an emission spectrum with a width of more\r\nthan 100 nm. By using rare earth-doped polymers, which have emission bandwidths of\r\nless than 4 nm, it will be possible to use photonic crystals to control the directionality of\r\nemission. This project will not only increase the efficiency and functionality of polymer-based\r\nLEDs, but will also provide a convenient light source for developing the science\r\nand technology of photonic crystals.\r\nThe project provides many excellent research opportunities for students. They\r\nwill work with a team of chemists to design new rare earth complexes and learn the\r\nquantum mechanics that regulate energy transfer, charge transfer and light emission.\r\nThey will interact with members of industry to learn how to optimize polymer LEDs.\r\nThey will use computer modeling to design one-, two-, and three-dimensional photonic\r\ncrystals to control the emission of light. They will also get to interact with a team of\r\nresearchers at 3M and have the opportunity to push polymer-photonic crystal science and\r\ntechnology into new directions. Most of the research will be done by two graduate\r\nstudents, but there will be many opportunities for undergraduates and M.S. students to\r\ntake on short-term projects.\r\nNew courses on nanotechnology and organic optoelectronics will be developed to\r\nprepare students for research. The course on nanotechnology is designed to make\r\nstudents in several departments aware of the opportunities in this exciting area and to\r\nfoster multidisciplinary research. The course on organic optoelectronics will have several\r\nlab sessions in the PI's labs so that students can reinforce what they learn in class. High\r\nschool teachers will visit the labs during the summer and be trained to use a kit of optical\r\nequipment so that they can demonstrate photonics experiments to their students.\r\n",
