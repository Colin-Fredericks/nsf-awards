 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT.   Professor Bourdon and his collaborator Joel Shapiro of\r\nMichigan State University will investigate problems arising from the\r\ninteraction between the modern theory of linear operators and the\r\nclassical theory of analytic functions. The problems to be studied involve\r\nnorms, decomposability, and numerical ranges of composition operators as\r\nwell as the chaotic behavior of both composition operators and operators\r\ncommuting with backward shifts. Insights and tools developed during the\r\ncourse of the project will be applied to other classes of linear operators\r\non Hilbert and Banach spaces.\r\n\r\n   Many of the differential and integral equations that physicists and\r\nengineers use to model physical processes may be viewed as linear\r\noperators on spaces of functions. This viewpoint, pioneered by David\r\nHilbert, led to the development of function-theoretic operator theory,\r\nwhich is the branch of mathematics inspiring the problems that are the\r\nfocus of Bourdon and Shapiro's project. A number of these problems concern\r\nthe notion of numerical range of a linear operator, an object that has\r\nrelevance to quantum physics and that has proven useful to engineers in\r\ndetermining the stability of certain control systems. Other problems\r\nrelate to the chaotic behavior of linear operators. That linear operators\r\ncan give rise to chaotic systems is a relatively recent discovery which \r\nhas led to unexpected connections between operator theory and dynamical\r\nsystems. The idea of decomposability--the study of how to break a\r\ncomplicated linear system up into simpler ones--has been shown to have\r\nsurprising connections with such chaotic behavior. The final group of\r\nproblems involves norm calculations for composition operators. The norm\r\nof an operator measures how much the operator can stretch the unit ball of\r\nthe space on which it acts. Computer experimentation should yield\r\ninsights and intuition concerning both composition-operator norms and\r\nnumerical ranges. Through such experimentation, undergraduate students at\r\nWashington and Lee University will be given an opportunity to participate\r\nin the project. The training and research experience provided to these\r\nstudents by the project contribute to its human-resources impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
