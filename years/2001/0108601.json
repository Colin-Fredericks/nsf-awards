 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)  Physics (13)  The project is developing software to make it easy for scientists, engineers, and their students to create computer models of physical systems that include real-time, 3D, interactive graphics. The value of 3D computer visualization in science and engineering education and research is widely recognized.  3D modeling of molecules in chemistry and biology is perhaps the most widely used 3D tool, whose high utility has justified the expensive development of appropriate software. Many math packages generate 3D representations of functions. However, more general use of 3D visualization, coupled to the flexibility of a general-purpose programming language, has been blocked by great technical difficulties which require high computer skills to overcome. This is particularly limiting for educational applications.   Even in chemistry and biology where 3D tools exist, it is difficult or impossible for scientists to modify or extend these packages. These applications do not have the open-ended flexibility of a programming language. \r\n\r\nA new tool, VPython, makes it possible for many scientists and engineers, and students of science and engineering, to create 3D visualizations quickly and easily, coupled to the flexibility and power of a programming language. Moreover, these visualizations can be interactive in real time, transcending the limitations of a canned movie.  The project is bringing VPython to a mature level of open source development, so that thereafter it can be easily maintained and extended, as a contribution to the infrastructure of science and engineering research and education.\r\n",
