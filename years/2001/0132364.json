Although many of these processes have been practiced, for example for over 30 years in the fabric industries, there are significant process variations. The process development and formulation optimization are established mostly through empirical approaches without the understanding of the fundamentals of these processes. This creates a lack of general guidelines for modifying different new fibers/fabrics/membranes as they are introduced into the industries. The objective of this exploratory project is to develop a basic understanding of the finishing processes used and to elucidate the role of the parameters responsible for its surface characteristics and performance properties. This will involve measurement of the reagent adsorption/adhesion, molecular conformation and orientation of the adsorbents, interactions among reagents such as polymers and surfactants, nano-structures of the surface aggregates formed by these reagents and\r\ncorrelation of the results to the fabric surface properties such as surface charge, hydrophobicity and fluid penetration. As the proposed research has the objective of controlling the surface properties using a new class of surface modifiers based on silicones, the outcome should make a significant contribution to the advancement of fabric/membrane products. Testing of these compounds is admittedly a high risk attempt but if perfected should lead to safer and eco-friendly products with enhanced performance. Towards this purpose, the next step will involve study of interactions of designed nanoparticles with fabrics and their crosslinking for superior finish, fire resistance, durability and chemical and biological agent resistance.\r\n",
