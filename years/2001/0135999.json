The team of students are completing 7 weeks of foundational research at WPI, then  will work on-site at NSF in the Division of Undergraduate Education for another 7 weeks to complete their project.  The project is ascertaining how the critical laboratory components of science and engineering courses and how advanced web-mediated learning technologies are being used to complement, supplement, or otherwise \"convey\" laboratory experiences in the undergraduate science and engineering curriculum.  The WPI students are receiving academic credit in fulfillment of a requisite for the Bachelor of Science degree.  Regular WPI faculty, who are resident in Washington with the students, are guiding their work with consultation with NSF program directors.   The students will deliver a final report to the NSF that will contain, in addition to their revised literature review and methodology, presentation of their data and analysis, along with conclusions and recommendations.",
