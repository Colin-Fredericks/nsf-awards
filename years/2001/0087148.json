 "awd_abstract_narration": "Providing reliable multimedia communications in mobile multihop wireless networks is a formidable\r\nchallenge. Communication networks in which all users are potentially mobile and untethered to any fixed\r\nwireline infrastructure arise in a variety of contexts. The mobile users of the system desire reliable\r\ncommunications, including real-time voice and video, notwithstanding the lack of a fixed infrastructure. That\r\nis, the disconnection probability should be low and certain quality of service (QoS) guarantees should be\r\nprovided: for many applications, the information exchanged should have low delay, low jitter and a low loss\r\nrate.\r\n     In a fully distributed wireless network, there is no fixed (wired) backbone that can be exploited to\r\ncentralize some of the network management and routing functions. In order to provide the desired functionality, the mobile terminals must be organized into a network that has some hierarchical organization or reliable structure that is maintained (at least to some degree) under varying network connectivities. This structure should, if possible, be maintained in a distributed fashion, without reliance on a centralized controller.\r\n     Our approach to solving the ad hoc network problem is to use an embedded hierarchical structure, with\r\nphysically different networks at the various levels. Recently, we have proposed the employment of a mobile\r\nbackbone to support guaranteed QoS (as well as best effort) applications for mobile networks. Certain mobile\r\nterminals are assigned to effectively serve as mobile base stations, and these selected users (\"backbone nodes\") together with their interconnecting communication links constitute the mobile backbone. The backbone network consists of a mesh topology with point-to-point links used to interconnect neighboring backbone nodes. The mobile backbone, which has a functionality analogous to a fixed backbone in a cellular network, is then exploited to make the routing, access control, scheduling and congestion control problems tractable. Such mobile backbone networks can also be exploited to supplement an employed ad hoc mobile network that lacks a transport backbone, and is thus not able to readily provide QoS guarantees to multimedia applications.\r\n     This research proposes a new approach to synthesizing communication backbones for mobile wireless\r\nnetworks. The backbone will satisfy user-specified accessibility and connectivity requirements and will support guaranteed QoS objectives. The mobile backbone construction algorithm will incorporate terminal positional information and a distance metric in order to discern geographical sections of the network with high concentrations of users. Pattern recognition based techniques will be developed and employed for the first time in the context of telecommunications networks in order to discern compact sections of the network, and to choose representative backbone nodes for these compact sections. This approach provides a new means of decomposing a global network into smaller simpler subnetworks, on each of which a backbone construction\r\nalgorithm can then be run.\r\n     Once the network has been divided into subnetworks (termed itclustersln), a backbone is then constructed\r\nfor each separate cluster. These separate intra-cluster backbones are then linked together to form a composite global backbone network with the desired functionality.\r\n     New graph-theoretic algorithms will be developed to synthesize the separate intra-cluster backbones.\r\nThese methodologies will incorporate deterministic and probabilistic relaxations of the backbones accessibility features. Investigations will also include preprocessing of the input graph that models the communications network and subgraph removal techniques to determine optimal topologies that can be exploited for backbone synthesis. Robust algorithms will be developed that ihlook aheadlp to possible future graph scenarios (based on terminal movement) and choose the best backbone for the ensemble.\r\n     The global backbone construction algorithms will be simplified by decoupling the inter-cluster backbone\r\nconnectivity requirements from the intra-cluster connectivity requirements. A mobile backbone will be\r\ndesigned with a single user-specified inter-cluster connectivity requirement, but may have different user-\r\nspecified intra-cluster connectivity requirements for each cluster. The inter-cluster backbone will be\r\nconstructed using graph-theoretic techniques wherein each cluster is treated as a single node a supernode.\r\nThe mobile backbone construction algorithms will be analyzed and evaluated to optimize methods of\r\nbackbone reconstitution under failures caused by nodal movement, environmental variations and loading\r\nfluctuations. Extensive analyses and simulations will be performed to evaluate the performance of the\r\nproposed backbone construction protocol under several scenarios that correspond to, e.g., different mobility\r\npatterns, different network loads, and a multitude of multimedia applications.\r\n     The mobile backbone networks to be investigated here are of significant importance in many application\r\nscenarios. They have been targeted for the implementation of next generation wireless networks for military\r\nunit operations, as well as for a multitude of commercial networks, which require rapid and reliable deployment in an area that lacks an existing fixed-backbone infrastructure. Included are civilian and government networks used for disaster relief purposes.",
