 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will produce a network application programmer's interface (API) specification and related implementation, referred to as the Autonomous Undersea Systems Network (AUSNET), for the distributed control of robotic and/or sensor systems in a low bandwidth, dynamic network environment.  AUSNET will allow expanded networking services specifically tailored to the unique acoustic environment.  The proposed effort builds upon emerging ad-hoc (self-forming, self-maintaining) network protocols.  Specifically, platform applications will gain access to network generated and propagated data, as well as enhanced control of the actual networking protocols. This will provide significant improvement both locally and network wide in the use of the acoustic band. It will also enable great adaptability to the harsh underwater environment.  The AUSNET effort will examine and demonstrate the potential to greatly enhance application level functionality by exploiting network capability and infrastructure in previously unexplored ways.  Phase I will result in a feasibility demonstration.  The Phase I development environment will be a simulation testbed, with a transition to a live operational environment planned for Phase II.\r\n\r\nThe market for tools that maximize the potential of flexible next-generation computer networks is significant and extends beyond the immediate oceanographic application into other domains. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
