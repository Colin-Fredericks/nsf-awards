 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nRecent advances in software engineering, such as graphical user interfaces\r\nand object-oriented programming, have caused applications to become more\r\nmemory intensive. These applications tend to allocate dynamic memory\r\nprolifically. Moreover, automatic dynamic memory reclamation (garbage\r\ncollection, GC) has become a popular feature in modern programming\r\nlanguages such as Java. As a result, the time consumed by dynamic storage\r\nmanagement can be up to one-third of the program execution time. The\r\nDynamic Memory Management Unit (DMMU), a special-purpose hardware\r\nmechanism based on bitmaps and combinational logic can greatly diminish\r\nthis overhead. The preliminary results show that the hit ratio for 2\r\nKbits and 8 Kbits buffer range from 84-99% and 95-99%, respectively. The\r\nhardware complexity of the proposed scheme is O(n), where n is the size of\r\nthe bit-vector. For a design with 20K gates and 97% miss rate, the overall\r\nspeedup can be as high as 1.41. This proposal calls for the integration of\r\nthis hardware unit into SMP systems, which would allow concurrent garbage\r\ncollection in multithreaded-multiprocessors environments. This can speed\r\nup the performance of server applications written in Object-oriented\r\nlanguages such as C++ and Java. Additionally, this proposal also calls\r\nfor the study of garbage collection triggering points. The preliminary\r\nstudy indicates that time-based triggering point may yield higher garbage\r\ncollection efficiency than the traditional space-based approach.\r\n",
