 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of imparting intrinsic oxidation resistance to a carbon-carbon composite when the matrix is derived from a carbonaceous precursor via pyrolysis.  The overall goal of the project is to assess the feasibility of using blends of pitch and pre-ceramic polymers as matrix precursors for carbon-carbon produced with a commercial processing cycle. The research objectives are two-fold:  (1) Determine the relationship between blend formulation and the resultant microstructure following processing, and (2) Compare the oxidation kinetics and room temperature mechanical behavior of composite samples produced in this manner.  Matrix precursors will be formulated by solution-blending pitches with silicon-containing compounds and then subjecting the blends to a conventional carbon-carbon processing cycle.  The resultant chars are expected to exhibit unique two-phase microstructures with intriguing micro- and nano-scale features, and to impart oxidation resistance without deleterious impact on mechanical properties. \r\n\r\nThe first commercial application of this method is expected to be used in lieu of baked coatings in carbon-carbon aircraft brakes. If successful, the technique may become an enabling technology for the use of carbon-carbon composites in a broad range of high temperature structural applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
