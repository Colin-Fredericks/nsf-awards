Recently, I am working on three major \r\ndirections: (1) Classification of compact hyperkahler manifolds, (2) \r\nStability and extremal metrics, (3) Classification of Complex homogeneous\r\nspaces. Our research was highly concentrated on these directions for the last \r\n4 to 5 years. We expect to work on extremal metrics and hyperkahler manifolds\r\nfor some other years since many breakthroughs are happenning in these \r\ndirections. The picture for extremal metrics is becoming clear after many \r\nyears of research. It can be described by the geodesic stability principles. \r\nThe uniqueness comes from the convex property of the modified Mabuchi \r\nfunctional on Mabuchi moduli space of Kahler metrics and the existence of \r\ngeodesics between Kahler metrics [GM4]. The existence should be the same as \r\nthe geodesic stability [GM7]. I already test these principles by both the \r\nexamples in my dissertation and those in [GM7]. For the toric manifolds, we \r\nalready proved the uniqueness and that existence implies the geodesic \r\nstability. We are trying to solve the final part of the geodesic stability \r\nprinciples that geodesic stable implies existence for toric manifolds. We also \r\ntest the geodesic stability for many toric manifolds, e. g., the manifold \r\nobtained by blowing up two points in a 2 dimensional complex projective space.\r\nThis will eventually solve the historical problem of existing Kahler-Einstein\r\nmetrics and extremal metrics. The best condidates of Hodge diamonds for the \r\ncomplex 4 dimensional compact hyperkahler manifolds are described by the \r\npossible pairs of the second and third Betti numbers (5,36),(7,8),(8,0),(23,0)\r\n([GHS4]). Now it is the time to work on classification with many tools as \r\nLagrangian fibration, Rozansky-Witten invariants, geometric elliptic genera. A\r\nsandwich inequality of Rozansky-Witten invariants suggests further results for \r\nhigher dimensional case. The classification of compact complex homogeneous \r\nspaces is reduced to the better understood manifolds as parallelizable \r\nmanifolds, reductive spaces and primary spaces in [GH7]. We will try to \r\nunderstand more about the higher step primary spaces in the future. \r\n\r\nThe research of Kahler-Einstein metric has been pioneered by many well-known \r\nmathematicians including several Fields Medal receivers. It turns out that\r\nthere are many similarity between this field and the Hitchin-Kobayashi\r\ncorrespondence in the holomorphic vector bundles on compact Kahler manifolds.\r\nBoth fields are closed related to Physics Science, e.g., Einstein equation,\r\ngeneral relativity, Yang-Mills, Mirror Symmetry, Calabi-Yau, etc. We will \r\nwrite up a textbook in Kahler geometry describe a clear picture on both of \r\nthese fields. Hyperkahler manifolds and homogeneous manifolds are some \r\nimportant manifolds which have some physics origin as that of Calabi-Yau \r\nmanifolds and are unsolved classical topics in complex geometry. The pictures \r\nfor these fields become clearer recently.  \r\n",
