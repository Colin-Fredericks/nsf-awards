 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biota of Thailand is one of the richest, most endemic (unique), and most endangered in the world. Concerns about deforestation and the loss of biodiversity has prompted conservation organizations to identify Thailand and surrounding areas as a biodiversity hotspot, underscoring the richness, endemism, and immediate threat to the biota. The mountains of northern Thailand represent the southeastern edge of a montane corridor that extends northward to Nepal, and interdigitate with an extension of the tropical rain forest farther from the equator than anywhere else in the world. Consequently, northern Thailand is a nexus where typically northern and southern taxa have invaded biogeographically extreme latitudes. Concern about deforestation, pollution, watershed degradation, and attendant loss of aquatic species has led to an acute interest in Thailand's aquatic insects and in their potential use as indicators of water quality. Many lotic (stream-inhabiting) insects are thought to be especially sensitive to environmental perturbations; however, the general use of lotic taxa as bioindicators requires baseline data on their diversity, distribution, relative abundance, and life history.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to survey stream-inhabiting insects of northern Thailand. Specimens will be gathered by diverse methods, including Malaise-trap, black-light, and aerial collection of adults, rearing of larvae and pupae, drift-netting, and qualitative and quantitative sampling of numerous habitats (e.g., riffles, depositional areas, rootmats). Material will be collected from throughout the region, but several sites have been selected for more frequent and intensive inventory. A team of taxonomic experts, including specialists from the United States, Thailand, and Europe, will participate in two field expeditions and will use resultant collections to conduct taxonomic, ecological, phylogenetic, and biogeographic studies. The primary objectives of this inventory are to: (1) discover and describe new species of lotic insects; (2) document the distribution, relative abundance, and natural history of lotic species; (3) associate and construct user-friendly keys to all life stages of lotic taxa; (4) develop a database and web site for faunal, distributional, and ecological information. Another important objective is to help build a foundation for a strong aquatic entomology program in Thailand. This will be accomplished through educating Thai and American students in the methods of systematics, including biotic inventories, curation, and taxonomic techniques, and through the provision of museums and educational institutions with research collections, reference material, and a database for Thailand's aquatic insects.\r\n\r\nThis study will provide a comprehensive inventory of stream-inhabiting insects from northern Thailand. This inventory will greatly enhance our knowledge of the regional insect fauna and our understanding of Southeast Asian biodiversity. It also will provide an authoritative reference collection for educators and researchers in aquatic entomology and systematics, and for future revisionary, phylogenetic, and biogeographic studies. The educational value of this collection and the training of personnel will be among the lasting products. Data on the diversity, distribution, relative abundance, and natural history of aquatic insects will provide insights into potential bioindicators of water quality. All of these will strengthen aquatic entomology and insect systematics programs in Thailand. Another product of this survey will be a database and web site that will be useful to insect systematists, aquatic- and fisheries biologists, biogeographers, conservationists, and resource managers. The data generated in this study will permit identification of areas of local endemism and sites of phylogenetic and biogeographic significance, which will have important implications in the conservation and management of Thailand's streams. Thai colleagues also have expressed great interest in organizing future taxonomic workshops, which will provide additional opportunities to educate students, researchers, resource managers, and the public about the identification, value, and use of insects in stream ecosystems.\r\n",
