 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe goal of this project is the development of a local area imaging network for polar regions that is remotely accessible via satellite high-speed data link. The primary purpose of this imaging network will be the performance of close-range three-dimensional photogrammetry for the remote determination of accurate spatial dimensions. By incorporating 3D-photogrammetry into the imaging system, the PIwill transform remote, close-range imaging from a simple observational tool to into a sophisticated quantitative tool for the accurate assessment of biological and physical systems in extreme environments.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for this system is a critical knowledge deficit of vital life-history\r\ndata on polar pinnipeds and seabirds. In northern regions, significant marine life management decisions are being made in the absence of adequate data. In the Bering Sea ecosystem in particular, apex predators such as Steller sea lions have declined to about ten percent of peak population levels. Despite years of intense research, hypothesized competition between marine apex predators and fisheries industry remains untested, predominantly for lack of viable research approaches for obtaining crucial life history data. Such data include frequent accurate census and age structure information in rookeries, as well as body mass and condition estimates of individual animals prior to, during and after fishing seasons. In a novel approach, we propose to use remote 3D-photogrammetry to significantly increase temporal resolution and numerical accuracy of remote census operations, to determine the age structure of rookeries through measurements of animals lengths, and to use photogrammetric volume determinations as estimators of body mass, in a technique recently validated by our laboratories.  The proposed Satellite-Linked Data collection and Photogrammetric imaging system (SLiDaP system) will consist of initially four independent sub-stations, linked via wireless LAN to a fifth core-station. All stations will contain ultra-high-resolution digital still cameras and PCs, and will be independently powered by solar panels and batteries. The core station will be remotely accessible via an INMARSAT high speed data link. Key system design criteria will center around extreme ruggedness, highest reliability with minimal service requirements, low temperature capability, complete independence from any local power and communications infrastructure, rapid system deployment capability, as well as very low environmental impact. \r\n\r\nTwo prototype SLiDaP systems. The first system will be tested in Astoria, or for greater accessibility and early developmental refinement. The second prototype system will be tested under realistic field conditions on Ugamak Island, in the Aleutian Island chain.\r\n\r\nThis cooperative proposal between Texas A&M University Laboratory for Applied\r\nBiotelemetry & Biotechnolgy and the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMFS), brings together leading academic research and marine resource management laboratories, as well as the industry leaders in photogrammetry and mobile archival tag design. Our efforts aredesigned to enhance basic biological research as well as marine ecosystem management. The proposed system will have applications far beyond our projected use: geologists, glaciologist and vulcanologist should profit from the availability of accurate remote close-range measurements for monitoring of shore degradation, land movement hazards, or volcano hazards to arctic air traffic routes along the Aleutians.\r\n",
