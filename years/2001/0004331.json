 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tPolitical philosopher Immanuel Kant asserted that democracies are fundamentally different domestically from non-democracies.  Accordingly, democracies behave differently than do other types of states in the international arena.  In particular, he argued that democracies are more pacific at the dyadic and systemic level than other governmental forms.  This theory is known alternatively as the \"Pacific Union\" and the \"Democratic Peace.\"  This project explores one component of the Kantian theory, that is, the contention that the cultural norms of citizens in democracies are favorable to increased cooperation and harmony among formerly hostile neighboring states.\r\n\tSince the time of Kant's initial formulation of the theory, scholars have written extensively about reasons for the existence of a Democratic Peace.  Numerous authors have made four specific arguments about why democracies are more likely to cooperate with other democracies and why they do not go to war with other democracies.  These arguments center on democracratic institutions that favor compromise, high levels of trade among democracies, disproportionately high levels of democratic membership in international institutions which lead to a complex interdependence, and domestic cultural norms of trust and tolerance which become internationalized.  The first three sets of arguments have been tested carefully and repeatedly in the scholarly literature.  However, the assertions about the connection between domestic democratic norms and international behavior have not been demonstrated robustly.\r\n\tThis project assesses the link between domestic political cultural values of democracies and international cooperation and peace.  Scholars of international relations have relied on proxy measures for domestic norms favorable to democracy and, in turn, they have argued that these same values affect international behaviors.  This project directly measures both domestic political cultural values and how those values translate into feelings towards neighboring countries through scientific survey research.  The research consists of surveying scientific samples of citizens of two democratizing neighboring countries to assess two groups of ideas:  first, the prevalence and depth of values associated typically with democracy and, second, the degree to which democratic political culture translates into an extension of the same values to citizens of a neighboring democracy.\r\n\tThe project is conducted in El Salvador and Honduras, two democratizing countries that have a prior history of animosity and distrust of each other.  The two cases also are appropriate venues for this project in that I am fluent in Spanish and have extensive experience conducting survey research in El Salvador.  If the Kantian argument regarding democratic political culture holds true, then citizens of these two Central American neighbors should express both pro-democratic responses to survey questions regarding their norms and values as well as feelings of trust and cooperation across the border.  Their feelings of trust and cooperation should be stronger still regarding more established democracies, but considerably weaker toward non-democratic states.\r\n\tThis research fills a gap in the existing literature regarding the relationship between democracy domestically and peace and cooperation internationally.  By directly asking citizens about their norms and values through survey research, this projects offers an important test of the extent to which democratization contributes to changes in international attitudes and behaviors. \r\n",
