The sea-surface microlayer  plays a major role in the exchange of matter and energy in the ocean-atmosphere system.  Organic matter enriches the surface microlayer and influences its chemical, biological, and  physical characteristics.  Different constituents concentrate in the  microlayer non-uniformly; consequently, the ratios of many dissolved elements and organic  compounds therein differ from those in bulk water.   These studies will focus on the transfer of dissolved free and combined amino acids  between particulate and dissolved pools under the unique conditions of the interfacial  laminar layer.  A number of factors will be considered: increased physical stress on the biological  community at the sea surface (e.g., by UV-radiation, evaporation, entrapment in spray),  which causes leaching of organic matter from the resulting dead or injured organisms;  dissolved organic matter decomposition by metabolically active neuston (hydrolysis, oxidation, and uptake); adsorption of dissolved matter onto particles which in the microlayer; and bubble scavenging from bulk water to the  surface microlayer of proteinaceous matter that is dissolved or weakly associated with  particles. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
