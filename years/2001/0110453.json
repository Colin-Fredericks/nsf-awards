 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, build, and test a hybrid Raman analyzer suitable for \"on-demand\" or continuous process monitoring.  The Phase I project demonstrated feasibility by designing and testing a unique combination of components that yielded greater than 100 times improvement in sensitivity (defined as the signal-to-noise ratio) compared to traditional Raman analyzers. The novel design also demonstrated high resolution (1 cm -1), invariant wavelength stability, and freedom from fluorescence interference; which are critical requirements for autonomous chemical process monitoring or rapid raw-material identification.  The Phase II project will further improve sensitivity, as well as demonstrate long-term temperature and vibrational immunity, and fast \"turn-on\" time.  Complete internal analyzer diagnostics will allow greater than 1000 hours of unattended operation.  As such, the analyzer will be rugged, compact and portable (10\"x 12\" footprint), low-maintenance, require minimum power, and suitable for numerous industrial applications. \r\n\r\nThe commercial applications will be directed toward the chemical manufacturing industries. The Phase II prototype will be used to develop specific applications with customers during Phase III.\r\n",
