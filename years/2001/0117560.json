 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will organize a workshop to review the current state of theoretical and numerical modeling and high resolution observations of several important processes in the solar atmosphere, and to develop recommendations for future observations. The workshop will focus on physics of small-scale processes including those that take place before and during initiation of the coronal mass ejections, which are crucial for understanding CME phenomena and space weather. The last few years have seen exciting development of numerical simulations and theory of small-scale solar processes. However, these numerical simulations and theory alone cannot solve the puzzling aspects of many solar phenomena - high-resolution observations are crucial. On the other hand, observers need \"clues\" from theorists and modelers on what they shall try to observe. This workshop will foster a discussion between theorists and modelers on one side and observers on the other and will help to refine the requirements for the Advanced Technology  Solar Telescope (ATST). Sacramento Peak Summer Workshops are topical meetings sponsored by the National Solar Observatory and have a tradition of bringing together an international group of observers and theoreticians for productive interactions that are not normally available through the format of larger meetings. The intimate setting of the observatory in the Lincoln National Forest, combined with the proximity to telescopes and observing hardware provides a unique environment for these events. Travel grants will be made on a competitive and need basis.",
