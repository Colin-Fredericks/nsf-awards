 "awd_abstract_narration": "The George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Program is a project funded under the NSF Major Research Equipment Program.  This cooperative agreement, under the NEES Program, establishes a NEES biaxial multiple (3) shake table research equipment site at the University at Nevada Reno, Reno, Nevada.  The University of Nevada Reno will design, construct, install, commission, and operate one new biaxial shake table and the upgrade of two existing shake tables for large-scale geotechnical and long, linear structural and lifeline earthquake engineering experimentation.  This equipment will be operational by 2004 or earlier and will be managed as a national shared-use NEES equipment site, with teleobservation and teleoperation capabilities, to provide new earthquake engineering research testing capabilities for large structural systems through 2014.  This NEES equipment site will be connected to the NEES collaboratory through the high-performance Nevada Research Network that serves as the University's connection to Internet2's Abilene Network, with Gigabit Ethernet capabilities.  Shared-use access and training will be coordinated through the NEES Consortium.  This award is an outcome of the peer review of proposals submitted to program solicitation NSF 00-6, \"NEES: Earthquake Engineering Research Equipment.\"  The following equipment is provided under this award:  (1) one new, relocatable, 4.3 x 4.5 m, 445 kN payload, +1 g, + 300 mm displacement (longitudinal and lateral) shake table, (2) upgrades to two existing, moveable, 445 kN shake tables from uniaxial to biaxial (longitudinal and lateral) capability, to be identical to the new table, (3) new hydraulic distribution lines, (4) new blowdown bank with the same capacity as the existing banks, (5) upgraded hydraulic power supply, by addition of a third pump (720 lpm), (6) digital control system for three tables, (7) expansion of existing data acquisition system to accommodate teleobservation, teleoperation, teletransmission, and telestorage, and (8) equipment for teleobservation and teleoperation capabilities so that experiments on the tables will be observable and controllable via high performance network connections.  The facility will consist of three biaxial shake tables, which will be relocatable on the strong floor of the Large-Scale Structures Laboratory on the University of Nevada Reno campus.  A variety of table configurations will be used to meet present and future research needs. Furthermore, each table may be operated independently of the other two tables, in-phase with the other two tables (thus forming a single large table), or differentially with the other two tables for the simulation of spatial variation effects in earthquake ground motions.  The facility will be the only one of its kind in the United States and will enable next generation experiments to be conducted.  These include studies of spatial variation in earthquake ground motion on critical extended-in-plan lifeline systems, the biaxial response of long structural systems and their components, and the behavior of very large-scale systems that are either physically too large for existing, single-table facilities, or too heavy, or both.  Together the three tables can host specimens up to 1.35 MN in total weight, with the tables separated up to a maximum of 36 m centerline-to-centerline.  The total cost of the equipment requested in this proposal is $7,017,200.  The University has already obtained $2,618,750 towards this goal from the U.S Department of Energy ($1,000,000) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ($1,618,750) reducing the budget request to NSF to $4,398,450.  The University will integrate this shake table equipment into its research program, undergraduate and graduate assistantships and internships, high school summer camps, and K-12 outreach.  The University will also provide training opportunities for outside researchers through on-site courses and workshops.",
