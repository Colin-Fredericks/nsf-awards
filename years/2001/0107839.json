 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grid Forum is a grass-roots community organization that began as a BOF session at SC98 in November\r\n1998. Grid Forum has held five highly successful workshops in the US since that time and has formed ten\r\nfocused working groups, each developing best practices and standards within a particular set of technical\r\nareas. Over 500 individuals participate in Grid Forum electronic newsgroups and typical workshop\r\nattendance is 150-190 people. Grid Forum has served as the primary gathering point and collaboration\r\nvehicle for major initiatives including the NSF Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure\r\n(PACI) program, NASA's Information Power Grid (IPG) program, the DoD modernization program, DOE\r\ngrid-based programs, and others.\r\nTwo of the primary advantages to the existence of such a collaboration vehicle are that it allows these\r\nprograms to leverage one another and it assures that the various agency-specific grid  systems are able to\r\ninteroperate. During the past year, Grid Forum has joined with similar efforts in Europe and Asia-Pacific,\r\nincreasing the opportunity to leverage to major grid projects outside of the US. Beyond the advantages of\r\nleverage and ensuring interoperability, a single global standards activity ensures that grid technologies do\r\nnot fragment at continental boundaries.\r\nGrid Forum will hold its sixth major workshop, \"Global Grid Forum 1\" in Amsterdam in March 2001.\r\nThis meeting will be held in conjunction with the kick-off meeting for the European Data Grid project\r\nthat is managed by CERN. This project supports travel by approximately 30 US participants, including students and researchers from Minority Serving Institutions, to that meeting. The participants will be\r\nrecruited from the ranks of existing Grid Forum leaders.\r\n",
