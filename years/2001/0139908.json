The objective of the study is to (1) analyze the value orientation of the publics; (2) understand the connection between social groups and value structure; (3) assess the relationship between secularization, rational-legal authority and liberal urgency; and (4) examine the degree of similarity/dissimilarity of the values in the three countries.  Funds requested by this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) would be used to gather data on concerns and attitudes of people in Egypt, Iran, and Morocco after the September 11th terrorist acts.  A survey presently in the field in Jordan will capture the same information from citizens in Jordan.  The rationale informing this request is that the current events have introduced a significant contextual factor (i.e., socio-political crisis) that potentially will impact the determinants of the publics attitudes and value orientations in Islamic countries.  Pre-and post terrorist events will allow the investigator to capture and examine such changes, (e.g., whether and how the September 11th events affects values and beliefs of citizens in the Middle East, and shed light how sociopolitical crises may affect attitudes and concerns more generally).\r\n",
