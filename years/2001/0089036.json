The project is based on an earlier proof-of-concept effort, built around the case study entitled \"Crist Power Plant\", which helped engineering students to understand how expert systems are used in the real-world to solve complex problems that involve many criteria and several alternatives.\r\n\r\nIn the present project, eleven companies are working with us to create new case studies. We are also developing background competency materials, instructional manuals, multimedia CD-ROMs, web sites, and videos to support the case studies. The instructional materials are being tested with engineering students at three minority serving institutions as well as at four other Universities. In addition, as a pilot project, the concept of a case emporium is being evaluated. This case emporium provides student teams at Auburn and Mercer Universities an opportunity to work together in a virtual environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
