 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues organize the 2001 John H. Barrett \r\nMemorial Lectures in the University of Tennessee at Knoxville from \r\nMay 10-12, 2001. The Barrett Lectures have been held annually since 1972. \r\nEach year a different topic is chosen, representing the research interests \r\nof the mathematics faculty of the University of Tennessee. \r\nSince 1993, the lectures have consisted of three\r\none-hour survey talks by each of three leading researchers\r\nrepresenting different themes/directions in a single field. The topic of \r\nthe 2001 Barrett Lectures is: ``New Directions and Developments in \r\nComputational Mathematics\". The focus of the lectures is parallel \r\nnumerical algorithms for partial differential equations and their \r\nimplementations and applications. The main speakers of the 2001 Barrett \r\nLectures are Jinchao Xu of Penn State University, David Keyes of \r\nOld Dominion University and ICASE, and Mary Wheeler of University of \r\nTexas at Austin. Each of them will deliver three one-hour survey lectures \r\non recent developments on parallel numerical algorithms with three \r\ndifferent emphases: theory (Xu), computer implementation (Keyes), \r\nand application (Wheeler). In addition to the main speakers, six\r\nspeakers are also invited to give one-hour talks on topics related \r\nto one of the main lectures.\r\n\r\nThe Barrett Lectures are partly funded by a grant from Tennessee Science \r\nAlliance, and have often received additional support from the National \r\nScience Foundation. They attract wide interest, with an audience of between \r\n40 and 50 participants from the whole country, in addition to faculty and \r\nstudents from Knoxville and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. They represent \r\none of the few long standing lecture series in mathematics in the southeastern \r\nUnited States. The main objective of the 2001 Barrett Lectures is to provide \r\nthe participants with an exposition of parallel numerical algorithms for \r\npartial differential equations arising from various \r\nscientific/engineering/industrial applications, through in-depth survey\r\nlectures and informal discussions with the above three leading researchers \r\nin the field. Additional goals are to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, \r\nparticularly with researchers in the Computer Science Department and in the \r\nCollege of Engineering at the University of Tennessee and several other \r\nsoutheastern institutions, and to generate a set of written surveys in the \r\nsubject, which the organizing committee will endeavor to have published \r\nin book form. The fund being requested from the NSF will be spent\r\nproviding partial support towards travel and accommodation for $20$ graduate\r\nstudents and recent Ph.D.'s who do not have research grants. \r\n\r\n",
