 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society/Bronx Zoo seeks NSF funding to develop an exciting \r\nnew three-year program designed to engage girls and young women in science. Operated with the \r\nGirl Scouts of the USA, the National 4-H Council, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Girls Inc., \r\nand the Children's Aid Society, the program will reach thousands of girls across the U.S. over the \r\ngrant period and thousands more thereafter. The WCS is uniquely qualified to run this program, \r\nhaving on its staff many women science professionals who are national and international leaders \r\nin their fields, and having conducted a number of pioneering programs for young women in the \r\nrecent past. The 36-month program will consist of: \r\n- An Annual Earth Summit that will introduce 80 girls ages 14-17 to environmental science, \r\nincluding key environmental issues in regions across the U.S., as well as to careers and women \r\nrole models in environmental science. (The girls will attend the Summit in teams of two or \r\nthree.) \r\n-A series of service-learning projects through which the Earth Summit participants will be \r\nstrongly encouraged to apply what they have learned in a community-based project that \r\ncombines knowledge, service and reflection. \r\n-A program of technical assistance, through which the participants will be provided with \r\nongoing assistance that will enable them to more effectively plan and implement their service- \r\nlearning projects; and \r\n- A ``Virtual Club House,'' through which the girls will be able to communicate with each other \r\nand WCS staff about the program and environmental issues. The clubhouse will also showcase \r\nprojects that the Earth Summit participants will conduct and explain how other young people \r\nmight undertake similar community outreach and research projects. \r\n\r\nThe proposed program represents a unique means of increasing the participation of girls \r\nand young women in science. It will capitalize on the enthusiasm young people have for animals, \r\nnature, and for visiting informal science centers, such as the Bronx Zoo, to excite girls and young \r\nwomen about science learning. The program will also seek to increase involvement through a \r\nfocus on ecology and environmental science, subjects that are of immediate relevance to students. \r\nWith their world being increasingly altered by human activity, what happens to the environment \r\nis of tremendous importance to the daily lives of girls and young women today and will become \r\neven more so in the future. By focusing on content that is immediately relevant, we believe the \r\nprogram will significantly increase participant involvement. \r\n\r\nThe program will build on a hugely successful Wildlife Science Careers Program that the \r\nWildlife Conservation Society has been undertaking over the past three years in conjunction with \r\nthe Girl Scout Council of Greater New York. This extremely popular program has involved 315 \r\neighth- and ninth-grade Girl Scouts and trained many of them to introduce thousands of younger \r\nGirl Scouts in New York City to career opportunities in science. The new program will allow the \r\nWCS to reach girls across the U.S., to involve girls in science projects that will be of benefit to local \r\ncommunities, and to broaden the emphasis of the Wildlife Science Careers Program from science \r\ncareers to a more general focus on environmental science and local environmental issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
