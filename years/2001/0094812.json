 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University is operating an NSF Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) program to support 80 students for the academic years 2001/ 02 and 2002/ 03. The CSEMS program supports a cohort of beginning first year students and beginning community college transfer third year students for each academic year in one of the designated majors: computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology or mathematics. First year students are primarily recruited from high schools in the southeast Texas region and the Houston Independent School District. The third year transfer students are recruited primarily from the Houston Community College System. The community college transfer students are required to have completed the associate degree in science, mathematics, engineering or technology (SMET). Under the CSEMS Program students are awarded the scholarships from the NSF grant during their first academic year at the University. Through the Honors Program and other financial aid sources these awards are supplemented to ensure full- tuition for the first year and subsequent years through graduation in one of the designated majors. Mentoring and exposure to professionals in the field has proven to be very important for retention and graduation of students in SMET undergraduate majors. The CSEMS program provides students with professional mentors and summer internship in industry or research experiences in University laboratories or off campus. Industrial and external sponsorship of the TSU CSEMS program and students are significant.",
