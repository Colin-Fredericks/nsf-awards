 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Gordon Research Conference on Electronic Materials will be held July 15-20, 2001 at Connecticut College. The conference will focus on the most exciting developments in synthesis, processing and usage of electronic materials. There will be extensive contributions representing nanoscience, new materials, and device concepts based on semiconductor, organic, polymeric, and biological materials. Presentations on new deposition methods, such as atomic layer deposition, will emphasize the increasing need for atomic level control of interfaces. The program is organized around invited speakers, discussion leaders, co-chairs, and co-vice-chairs; both contributed papers and posters are scheduled. Objectives are to stimulate communications among the broad community of researchers who address Electronic Materials research from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds--chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science, and to formulate and delineate critical research necessary to further basic understanding and move concepts closer to technological success. The conference is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues surrounding Electronic Materials. Topics include: Nanoscale Materials and Molecular Electronics; Patterning Strategies; Organic Optoelectronic Devices, Biological Computing and Bioelectronics; Deposition and Properties of Dielectric Films; Layered Inorganic and Organic Structures; Dendrimers and Conducting Polymers in Devices; Semiconductor Surfaces and Microelectronic Processing; and MEMS and Miniaturization. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established between universities, research institutions, and industry. \r\n%%%\r\nAn evaluation of the progress and status of Electronic Materials research issues associated with growth and processing of a variety of electronic materials including semiconductor, organic, polymeric, and biological materials and device related structures along with current assessments of the most important developments will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of materials in computing, data processing, and communications. \t \r\n***\r\n",
