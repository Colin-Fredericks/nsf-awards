 "awd_abstract_narration": "An NSF-CBMS Regional Conference on Modular Elliptic Curves is to be held at the Department of Mathematics, University of Central Florida, August 8-12, 2001.  Professor Henri Darmon, McGill University, will serve as the Principal Lecturer of the conference.  The organizing committee will consist of mathematicians selected from the Departments of Mathematics in different universities at national and international levels.  The general area of the conference's endeavor is of great topical interest and has seen an explosive expansion of research activity in the last ten years.  Despite this intense activity over the past decade, there are still numerous unsolved problems and outstanding issues, many of which are among the greatest mathematical challenges of the 21st Century.  Darmon, who is a consummate lecturer and a major contributor to the area, has a very broad view of the subject matter.  He is currently leading a research program to develop the recent body of work of Bertolini and Darmon on the generalization of the theory of complex multiplication to modular elliptic curves over real quadratic fields.  His lectures would serve to survey and unify major developments in the field, assessing both achievements and future directions of research in the field.  Consequently, Professor Darmon is an obvious choice to lead a gathering of experts in this area.",
