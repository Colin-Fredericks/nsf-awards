 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Self-Reliance Foundation (SRF) will implement a comprehensive three-year project that provides Hispanics with greater access to science resources and increases their participation in informal science activities.  The Hispanic National Community Science Festivals Project makes optimal use of radio and print media, as well as the Internet, to deliver much-needed services to the families in their homes and communities.  First, the SRF will partner with the Hispanic Radio Network (HRN) and the Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation (HBC) to reach major Hispanic markets in Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Dallas and Yakima, Washington.  A community coalition, including members of the radio station, community organizations and science centers, will be created in each of the targeted locales to plan events and support the project.  \r\n\r\nRadio broadcasts will include information on community science festivals organized by science centers in these cities.  Daily science radio capsules will also be developed, produced and distributed nationwide.  Topics for radio capsules will include parental involvement and participation in informal science activities, and pathways to science careers.  The Self-Reliance Foundation will serve as a clearing-house for community science resources by establishing an 800 number-hotline and bilingual Internet site with referral information on science opportunities within the community.  It is anticipated that the festivals alone will reach 100,000-200,000 visitors per weekend, while broadcasts have the potential to reach the majority of the U.S. Hispanic population of 32 million people.\r\n\r\n",
