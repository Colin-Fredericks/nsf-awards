 "awd_abstract_narration": "0087776\r\nMcConnell\r\n\r\nThis award supports a three year project to acquire data on the concentration of trifluoroacetate (TFA) in Antarctic snow.  Trifluoroacetate is a highly persistent, atmospheric degradation product of the halogenated ethane derivatives (HCFC, HFC) that have been introduced as environmentally friendly chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) substitutes.  However, there is concern that the widespread introduction of HCFC's and HFC's will lead to the accumulation of TFA in aquatic ecosystems.  Current data on pre-industrial, background concentration of TFA in meteoric and surface waters, including Antarctic ice, are ambiguous and the impact of anthropogenic TFA on these background concentrations is unclear.  Ice core records can provide proxy records of background and anthropogenic TFA deposition.  The primary objective of this research is to use ice cores and snow pits at South Pole to develop a temporal record of TFA deposition spanning ~ 1000 years but focused on the past 20 years.  The pre-industrial to present record of TFA in near surface snow and ice at South Pole and in West Antarctica will be unique and will lead to a much better understanding of the origin, transport and fate of this contaminant over Antarctica and possibly the globe.  In addition, understanding the natural and anthropogenic sources, the regional and long-range movement, and the eventual fate of contaminants is critical to assessing potential impacts on Antarctic ecosystems. \r\n\r\n",
