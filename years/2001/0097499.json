 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate students will take part in a three year summer research site\r\nprogram in the Department of Biological Sciences at Wellesley College, an\r\nundergraduate college for women, which has a strong interest in the\r\nresearch training of undergraduates.  Applications will be actively\r\nencouraged from Wellesley College Biology, Psychobiology, Biological\r\nChemistry and Environmental Sciences majors, students from regional\r\nliberal arts colleges and universities, as well as similar institutions\r\nnation-wide.  These students will have a serious interest in gaining\r\nresearch experience to add to their demonstrated academic talent.  They\r\nwill already have shown an ability to think independently and\r\nimaginatively, and will have strong recommendations from knowledgeable\r\nfaculty at their own institutions.  Ten participants for each of the three\r\nyears will be selected by the PI and the participating faculty.  The\r\nselected students will take part in a lively, instructive, ten week\r\nprogram.  Under the guidance of their faculty mentor, each student will\r\nparticipate fully in an active research program.  This will include\r\neverything from pursuing a literature review, to carrying out independent\r\nexperimental procedures and observations, and continuing to the analysis\r\nof data and the determination of conclusions.  Each will also prepare and\r\ndeliver a presentation of results to the entire program in a weekly\r\nseminar series.  This, along with a series of demonstrations of the\r\ntechniques utilized by other laboratories, and a final poster session,\r\nwill familiarize each student with the wide variety of active research\r\nprograms in the Department.  Throughout the summer seminars and workshops\r\nwill be presented by scientists, and field trips will be taken to field\r\nresearch sites and biotechnology companies. It is expected, based on\r\nprevious experience, that participation in this program will have a\r\nsignificant impact on the future of these undergraduates, as most will\r\npursue advanced degrees.",
