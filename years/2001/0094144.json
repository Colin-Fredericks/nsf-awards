 "awd_abstract_narration": "The career development plan described in this proposal focuses on diblock copolymers, a class of hybrid macromolecules that represent an extremely interesting set of self-assembling materials with a wide variety of applications.  Diblock copolymers are simple macromolecules consisting of two segments of chemically distinct monomers connected by one covalent bond.  This one bond prevents macrophase separation of the two polymeric segments and leads to the formation of a variety of nanoscopic assemblies depending on the nature of the monomers, the molecular weight of the chain, and minority component volume fraction.  While their uses as thermoplastic elastomers, pressure sensitive adhesives, and compatibilizing agents are wide spread, it has only been recently that the nanoscopic compositional heterogenties have been exploited for the preparation of other nanostructured materials.  A strategy for the preparation of nanoporous materials using ordered block copolymers templates will be investigated.  The ultimate of this research goal is the preparation of polymeric monoliths that contain aligned nanopores with a narrow pore size distribution and an extremely high pore density.  Two general strategies for the preparation of porous materials starting from ordered block copolymers are presented.  One utilized block copolymers with a degradable block and the other utilized block of an array of interesting nanomaterials.  The work described in this proposal depends on the combination of polymer synthesis, supramolecular self-assembly and characterization, and solid-state chemistry of ordered block copolymers.\r\n%%%\r\nThe science and technology of structures on the nanometer length scale is central to many research initiatives.  The research described in this proposal addresses an area that will have significant impact on the development of nanostructured templates and scaffolds for the design and synthesis of new nanomaterials.  The target materials will have remarkable potential as nanostructure scaffolds, separation media, and optical devices.  Furthermore, this plan also includes a section on integration research and educational activities.  There are two primary aspects the proposed educational plan.  The first is focused on graduate education in the field of polymer science, and the second is centered around undergraduate education at the Freshman level and adult continuing education.\r\n",
