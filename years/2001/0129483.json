 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this workshop is to gather for the fourth time, a diverse group of leading researchers in solid state technology, devices, circuits, and system architectures to:\r\n\r\nAssess the change in the knowledge base since 1999\r\n\r\nInteract in an open discussion and free exchange of ideas across the broad spectrum of communication/information processing technology\r\n\r\nIdentify areas on the research frontiers that extend communication/information processing progress into\r\nthe 21 st Century and beyond shrink limitation\r\n\r\nEstablish a communication link between researchers from around the world from different disciplines\r\nand backgrounds for a fruitful exchange of experiences and ideas\r\n\r\nAs the cost and performance factors of microelectronic devices improve through advances in technology,\r\nnovel and/or improved information/communication systems are enabled. Conversely, new concepts for\r\ninformation/communications applications often create a demand for more advanced microelectronics\r\ntechnologies that offer unique capabilities. As an example, the need for mobility has driven the creation of\r\nhigh performance, low power, microelectronic devices used in portable electronic assistants with\r\ncommunication capabilities\r\n\r\nThe objective of the 4th IWFIPT is to examine the push and pull between microelectronics technology and\r\nemerging application areas to obtain a sense of future technology trends and capabilities. Leading\r\ncontributors will describe their views on hardware performance and functionalities needed in the\r\ninformation society of the future. These projections will be juxtaposed with anticipated trends in\r\nmicroelectronics and with potential ioradical technologiesli arising from advances in carbon-based materials,\r\nquantum physics, molecular nanotechnology and other areas. A synthesis of views is planned to identify\r\ntrend feeding, trend fighting and trend setting microelectronic technologies that are likely to emerge over\r\nthe next few decades.",
