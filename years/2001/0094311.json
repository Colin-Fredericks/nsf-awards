 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the detailed interactions of reactive radicals with well characterized semiconductor surfaces.  Using molecular beam scattering methods, the interaction of hyperthermal ions and radicals with the Si(100) and (111) surfaces will be examined.  Effects of rotational steering in interhalogen reactants, chemical selectivity in the reactions, atom abstraction processes, and reactions with adsorbed layers will be studied to provide insight into these reactions of fundamental importance to semiconductor processing.  A program will be developed to include high school teachers in the basic research associated with this project, in order to foster increased understanding of current technology and its application.  This program will impact  high school teachers and their students through participation in cutting edge research during the summers, and follow up with classroom activities throughout the school year. \r\n\r\nThe fundamental interactions of small reactive ions and radicals with semiconductor surfaces forms the research basis of this CAREER project.  Involving local high school teachers in the basic research effort during summers, and outreach to their classrooms during the academic year, forms its educational basis.  Molecular beam scattering methods coupled with spectroscopic characterization of silicon surfaces will allow the research group of Professor Sean Casey at the University of Nevada-Reno to examine the fundamentals of these surface reactions which are of significant importance to the area of semiconductor processing.",
