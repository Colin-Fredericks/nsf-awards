 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constraints on Performance and Pelagic Periods of Larvae\r\n\r\nRichard R. Strathmann\r\n\r\n    Many marine animals live on the sea bed as sedentary adults but swim and\r\nare carried by ocean currents as planktonic larvae.  Many of these larvae\r\nfeed and grow for weeks or months before they can settle on the bottom.\r\nLarval feeding supports growth from a small egg to a larger size at\r\nmetamorphosis.  There are costs to this means of supporting early growth and\r\ndevelopment, however.  The longer the period of larval growth, the more\r\nlarvae are eaten by predators or carried by currents away from areas of good\r\nhabitat on the sea bed.\r\n    Many larvae feed by concentrating algal cells and other small particles\r\nof food  This food can be scarce, and food-limited growth has been\r\ndemonstrated.  Maximum rates of concentrating scarce food from suspension\r\ndepend on traits of larvae that differ among major groups (phyla) of marine\r\nanimals.  Because food is often in limiting supply, one might expect larvae\r\nin the same waters, whatever their other differences, to increase their\r\ncapacity  to concentrate scarce planktonic food as they increase in weight\r\nand energy requirements and in order to achieve greater growth rates as they\r\ndevelop.  Surprisingly, some animals' larvae appear to be poorly adapted to\r\nlow concentrations of food.  They have a very limited capacity to\r\nconcentrate scarce planktonic food, even though they grow from tiny eggs to\r\nmuch larger juveniles at metamorphosis.  Moreover, these larval forms have\r\nremained unchanged during much of animal evolution.\r\n    The proposed research tests the hypothesis that food-limited growth\r\nrates depend on highly conserved traits of larvae.  The prediction is that\r\nsome forms are particularly constrained to slower growth when food is\r\nscarce.  Some of these larvae feed with short ciliary bands throughout their\r\ndevelopment.  These include the larval forms of bryozoans, which are\r\ncolonial animals that live on rocks and seaweeds, and nemerteans (ribbon\r\nworms), which are common predators on other small marine animals. The\r\nbryozoan and nemertean larvae do not seem to fit predictions based on the\r\nmore extensively studied larvae of molluscs and sea urchins and thus\r\nchallenge biologists' understanding of the ecology and evolution of\r\nplanktonic larvae.  The growth of bryozoan and nemertean larvae at limiting\r\nand satiating concentrations of food will be compared to growth of sea\r\nurchin larvae, whose maximum rates of clearing food from suspension are\r\ngreater and increase more nearly in proportion to body mass.  If the\r\nhypothesis is correct, then major groups of animals differ in\r\nfood-limitation for their larvae, with consequences for death rates and\r\ndispersal of their larvae.\r\n    Another case of an apparently ill-equipped feeding larva is the planula\r\nlarva of sea anemones.  These larvae lack ciliary bands entirely and are\r\nanatomically the simplest feeding larval forms, yet some of them grow\r\nsubstantially before metamorphosis.  In other groups of animals, larvae that\r\nare this simple do not catch particulate food.  Analyses of feeding capacity\r\nand growth rates of larval sea anemones will indicate the capabilities of\r\nthe simplest feeding larvae. The results will indicate constraints on the\r\norigination of ciliated feeding larvae in other groups of animals.",
