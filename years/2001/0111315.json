 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economists have developed a theory of \"sunspot\" equilibrium to describe situations\r\nwhere economic fluctuations are not driven by changes in market fundamentals, but are\r\ninstead due to extrinsic, non-fundamental factors. This project involves the design of an\r\nexperiment that will explore whether and how such extrinsic factors can result in market\r\nfluctuations, and whether the particular market institution also plays a role.\r\nThe experiment consists of two main treatments. In the first, human subjects participate\r\nas buyers or sellers in a computerized \"double auction\", where goods can be bought and\r\nsold continuously over a fixed trading period at mutually agreed upon prices that are\r\nobservable as they occur to all participants. In the second \"call market\" treatment,\r\nsubjects submit private bids and offers, and a centralized mechanism determines the\r\nsingle, market clearing price, as well as the quantities that each participant can buy or\r\nsell. Thus, the only information subjects receive in this environment is the resulting\r\nmarket price and the quantity they were able to buy or sell at this price.\r\nIn both treatments, subjects face uncertainty in that they are given two sets of values or\r\ncosts for the goods they can buy or sell; these two sets correspond to the\"state\" of the\r\neconomy, and are referred to as \"high\" or \"low\" in reference to the equilibrium price in\r\nthe two states. (the equilibrium quantity is the same in both states). Initially, subjects are\r\ntold the state of the economy in advance, so that they become familiar with the two states\r\nfor prices. After several rounds, subjects are informed that the true state of the economy,\r\nwill henceforth be determined expost, after all trading is completed. Furthermore, the rule\r\nfor the determination of the state will depend on the median trade price in the double\r\nauction environment or on the analogous market clearing price in the call market\r\nenvironment. If this price lies within a proscribed domain of the equilibrium low price,\r\nthen the state is declared to be low and if it lies outside this domain, in that of the\r\nequilibrium high price, then the state is declared to be high. Subjects are provided with a\r\npotential coordination device (or sunspot realization) which takes the form of a random\r\nannouncement by the experimenter of the forecast for the state of prices in the current\r\nperiod. Subjects are instructed that this announcement has no binding consequences.\r\nPreliminary findings suggest that subjects coordinate perfectly on the announcement in\r\nthe highly centralized call market environment but fail to do the same in the more\r\ndecentralized double auction environment. These experimental findings if replicated,\r\nhave significant implications for the architecture of real financial markets.\r\n",
