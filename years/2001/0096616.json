US PI Krzysztof Jarosz of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and Indian PI T.S.S.R.K. Rao of the Indian Statistical Institute(ISI), Bangalore will initiate joint research on maps determining topology, local isometries, and other problems concerning Banach spaces and algebras.  The US side brings expertise in areas of function algebras and spaces of analytic functions; the Indian side has expertise in the geometry of Banach spaces.      \r\nScope:  This is a new collaboration with mathematicians at one of India's most highly respected institutes in this field.  It will provide the framework needed by Indian researchers to communicate with others working in modern functional analysis.  Among its strengths, this collaboration involves researchers with overlapping but not identical interests.  Thus far, the problems to be addressed have generated broad interest among mathematicians at several other institutions including the Indian Institutes of Technology at Madras and Mumbai.  The research is of high quality, is likely to result in some very worthwhile contributions to mathematical research, and will open up further avenues of cooperation between India and the United States.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
