 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to implement a  Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process for the production of anode electrocatalyst layers for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) applications requiring reformate fuel feed gas.  In Phase I it was  demonstrated  that fabrication of Pt:Ru electrocatalysts as unsupported, metallic nanoparticles is possible using CCVD. These electrocatalyst layers behave electrochemically in a similar manner to commercially available Pt:Ru electrocatalysts prepared on carbon supports using wet chemical methods, but can be deposited directly onto both gas diffusion media and proton exchange membranes. The Phase II project would involve optimization of catalyst composition, continued development of web coating technology for mass production of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) and commercialization of the technology through construction of production equipment and licensing.\r\n\r\nFuel cells are of huge interest to the marketplace, as illustrated by sizable investments in the technology and market capitalization of fuel cell companies. For example, Daimler Chrysler has targeted the year 2004 for planned production of fuel cell vehicles, and has slated more than $1.4 billion in investments to reach that goal. However, for commercial viability, performance and cost of the electrocatalyst layers must be improved. MCT, if successful, could contribute in both arenas.\r\n",
