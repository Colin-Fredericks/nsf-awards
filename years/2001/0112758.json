 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is  to develop an interactive geometric approach  to creating, editing, transforming, and computing with models of spatially distributed physical phenomena. The funded effort  will involve fleshing out sound theoretical foundations, developing appropriate data structures and  algorithms, as well as implementing a prototype system for interactive physical modeling.  At the heart of the proposal is  a novel use of tools from algebraic topology and geometric algebra to describe, classify, and unify physical  phenomena.  The prototype system  will allow users to create models of physical phenomena through an  interactive geometric interface designed in terms of familiar and intuitive control  elements.  The created models may be interactively transformed, modified, combined, visualized, and instantiated.  \r\n\r\nThe successful outcome of the proposed research should have broad  technological, economic, educational, and social impact. The physics editor will allow users to create, visualize,  test, and experiment with new models of physical phenomena quickly and effortlessly. It could greatly enhance the  ability to efficiently create and modify scientific software that is modular, reusable, and consistent across the  disciplinary boundaries. Engineers may discover a practical tool that will allow them to communicate  with computer-aided design systems in a visual intuitive language that does not require deep  mathematical knowledge and unifies a multitude of theories and special cases. And perhaps most importantly, the proposed  research could open doors of computational sciences to college and high school students and others who  may have been discouraged or intimidated by traditional methods of mathematical physics and scientific  computing.   \r\n",
