 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Living and Learning Science Retention Program (LALSRP) at Saint \r\nAugustine's College is designed to facilitate entry into the junior year by providing a \r\nsupport system for entering freshmen and sophomore science, mathematics and computer \r\nscience (SMC) majors. A comprehensive approach to provide a support system will be \r\naccomplished by implementing the following objectives: \r\n1. To revise and update curriculum to incorporate cooperative learning which will \r\nenhance study skills and generate independent learners; \r\n2. To provide participants with intramural research experiences which will increase \r\ntheir analytical reasoning skills and provide hands-on laboratory experiences; \r\n3. To build students' confidence so that they can successfully pursue an \r\nundergraduate degree in science and technology by providing positive role \r\nmodels, mentors and a strong academic support system; \r\n4. To assist participants in the understanding of the process involved in pursuing a \r\ndegree in science and technology by offering seminars, workshops and field trips; \r\nand \r\n5. To enhance and develop faculty participants by providing research and curriculum \r\ndevelopment opportunities. \r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish the stated objectives, the program will consist of five components: \r\n(1) Curriculum Enrichment which will include a Pre-freshman Summer Bridge Program, \r\nEnrichment Center and a Village of Science and Technology (VOSAT); (2) \r\nUndergraduate Research Experience; (3) Seminars and Workshops; (4) Scholarships and \r\n(5) Faculty Development. \r\n\r\nThis program will enhance the living and learning community on the campus of \r\nSaint Augustine's College. It will serve as a model that can be replicated across the \r\ncampus and can also be applied to other disciplines. It is anticipated that by the end of \r\nthe 5-year funding period, the number of SMC graduates at Saint Augustine's College \r\nwill increase 2 fold. In five years the campus will have an established infrastructure to \r\nsupport the transition of freshmen into the junior year. The dormitory VOSAT in \r\nparticular, will stimulate scientific and technological discussions among majors and \r\nnonmajors on the campus. This proposed Living and Learning Science Retention \r\nProgram will support 30-50 students each year and impact approximately 1,400 \r\nundergraduate students who reside on the campus of Saint Augustine's College. This \r\nprogram will serve as a model that can be replicated on any campus that has a minority \r\nbased population. \r\n",
