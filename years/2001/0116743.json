 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Curt M. Peterson, Catherine Gardiner, and John Moore at the University of Northern Colorado to significantly improve the ability of faculty and students in the biological sciences to utilize modern microscopy tools in their research, enhance their opportunities to expand into new research areas, and increase the competitiveness of their research programs for external funding.  The grant will be used to purchase ancillary support equipment for a scanning electron microscope (SEM) including a digital image analysis system, a critical point dryer, and a sputter coater.  In addition, a confocal microscope and equipment to prepare and observe biological specimens for light and electron microscopy including a tissue processor, an ultramicrotome, and a diamond knife will be acquired.  At present, there are active research programs in the department ranging from cellular biology of early embryo development to studies of soil community ecology that will benefit from the availability of this equipment.  \r\n\r\nFive research projects will utilize this microscopy equipment to advance current and projected research efforts.  One project will use confocal microscopy and fluorescent dyes to study the three-dimensional distribution of specific cellular compounds that protect cells during early cellular differentiation in developing mouse embryos.  This study will increase our understanding of the development of mammalian embryos.  A second project will use the ultramicrotome and confocal microscope to record, reconstruct and analyze sectioned tissues of venom glands in rear-fanged snakes in order to elucidate mechanisms allowing for long-term storage and stabilization of venom components.  The goal of a third project is to develop a theoretical framework for the dynamics and stability of food webs that couple primary producers, detritus, consumers and nutrients.  Accurate identification of invertebrate taxa using SEM and microbial biomass using confocal microscopy will provide more precise identification of food web organisms than is possible with existing techniques.  The goal of a fourth study is to use SEM and confocal microscopy to investigate the positional differentiation of the separation layer leading to abscission or dropping of cotton leaves and the shattering or breaking apart of seed heads of native grasses.  Both forms of microscopy will permit much clearer imaging of the cellular processes that lead to abscission and shattering.  The fifth project will use this microscopy equipment to investigate the embryo anatomy and morphology of Eugenia, a very large and poorly known genus in the plant family Myrtaceae.   Embryo anatomy has been shown to be an important source of variation in this genus and will further elucidate the taxonomy of this ecologically widespread genus.\r\n\r\nThe equipment will not only strengthen current and projected research efforts of faculty in the biological sciences and each of the respective research areas but will have a broad impact on undergraduate and graduate research training as well.  Many of the questions and problems forming the basis for the five research projects described in this grant can be answered or resolved with this modern microscopy technology.  This equipment also will significantly improve access to and increase the use of modern instrumentation and state-of-the-art microscopy applications in the research training and education of both undergraduate and graduate students in biology.  Finally, this equipment will have a significant impact on K-12 outreach efforts designed to increase college entrance and graduation rates of minority students traditionally underrepresented in science, mathematics, and technology disciplines.  \r\n",
