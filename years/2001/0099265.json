 "awd_abstract_narration": "The issue-oriented and eigth grade courses in life and physical science developed by SEPUP (Science Education for Public Understanding Program) are extended to the sixth grade covering Physics and Earth Science.  Students will understand the unique physical characteristics of the Earth in comparison with other planets, the relationship between force and motion, the role gravity plays in planetary processes, how energy in sunlight interacts with the Earth and its atmosphere, the role convection plays in atmospheric, oceanic and geologic processes and how the study of rocks provides evidence of current and past Earth processes and conditions.  Each of these topics is considered in the context of making informed, non-emotional, evidence-based decisions that affect students and their families such as global warming, need for space exploration, location of essential, but potentionally dangerous structures, etc.  The course materials include kits, printed materials, teacher guides and community outreach tools.  The materials are developed by teachers and scientists and are tested in classrooms.  Specific learning goals for students are derived from national and state standards.  Student assessment is based on the previously developed embedded assessment system.  The materials are published and distributed by LabAids.",
