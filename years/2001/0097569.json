 "awd_abstract_narration": "Minarik\r\n\r\nDuring a ten-week summer program, thirteen undergraduate students will be given the opportunity to actively participate in the research program of a staff member at the Broad Branch Campus of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Broad Branch Campus includes both the Geophysical Laboratory and the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Recruitment efforts will especially target groups historically under-represented in science and students from institutions that are unable to offer a research experience. Scholarship, possible influence on career objectives, and the ability to match the student's scientific interests with available research projects will all be considered in the selection process.  While at the Geophysical Laboratory and the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, each student will be assigned an advisor and a research project. Although varied, most of the student's projects will involve some aspect of earth or planetary geoscience research. The students will be instructed by their advisors in the use of the experimental, and/or analytical and computational apparatus that are utilized in the research programs. Each week the students will also meet in a group for a lunch seminar.  During this time Carnegie staff members will describe their own research interests and laboratory facilities.   Students will tour some of the government research laboratories in the area.  The students will be expected to prepare a paper describing their summer research results and to participate in a special student symposium where they will present their work to their peers and the scientific staff.",
