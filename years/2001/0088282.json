 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54) \r\r\n\r\nRepresentatives from the environmental engineering profession frequently comment that university graduates entering the workforce understand process theory but lack the hands-on experience necessary for a smooth transition into the workplace. The hand-on experience they refer to is a basic working knowledge of the processes used in industry for pollution treatment. At several universities in the US, undergraduate students in Chemical Engineering are given the opportunity to develop a working knowledge of their industry in classes taught at pilot plant facilities operated by the university. The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Michigan Technological University is adapting this hands-on approach to Environmental Engineering education through the implementation of a laboratory with pilot scale environmental treatment systems. The project will be informed by Michigan Tech's own chemical engineering program as well as other programs throughout the country. Undergraduate students taking classes in this Environmental Process Simulation Laboratory (EPSC) are benefiting from this experience in numerous ways including: implementation of the theoretical tools the students learned in previous classes; a better understanding of these theoretical tools; a familiarity with how the real-world treatment unit functions; experience with industrial process controls; an increased knowledge of industrial safety practices; an introduction to pollution prevention strategies; and the experience of working in a multidisciplinary team on a common project. The end result will be students with advanced skills and an improved understanding of the theory and mechanics of treatment processes.",
