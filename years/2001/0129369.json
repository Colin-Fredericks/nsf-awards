The scientists involved, both in the U.S. and East Asia, are among the world's best, with excellent records of prior research.  The science to be incorporated is cutting edge, innovative, groundbreaking, and facilities and opportunities available for U.S. scientists at research sites in Taiwan related to COSMIC project and the Earth Simulator in Japan are unique in the world. \r\n\r\nThe two-year start-up phase of this program will allow UCAR to develop a relationship with its international counterparts, to formulate detailed plans for its educational programs, and to establish its cooperative research and training projects.   At the end of the start-up phase, UCAR will submit a follow-up proposal to continue the collaborative education, research and training program. This broad-based program can create new and strengthen existing research, operational and education linkages between the U.S. atmospheric science community and that of the nations of East Asia, and will greatly benefit to U.S. students and junior scientists in atmospheric science. \r\n\r\n",
