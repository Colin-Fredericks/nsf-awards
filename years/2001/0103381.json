In the first area, problems related to traveling wave solutions in time dependent continuous and discrete equations of bistable and Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov types are studied.  The second research topic is focused primarily on uniform persistence, coexistence and convergence in time dependent multi-species competition models.  The third area concerns a general study of oscillatory dynamics in quasi- or almost periodic oscillators and wave equations through investigation of the existence and structure of attractors in general quasi-periodically forced first-order \"oscillators\" as well as some second order oscillators.  The results of the project will enhance understanding of dynamics in time-dependent continuous and discrete equations and will have application to numerous physical and biological problems.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to understand the asymptotic behavior of solutions of nonautonomous differential equations, especially in situations where the nonautonomous part depends on time in a roughly, but not exactly, periodic way.  Such equations are widely used as models for processes in biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering.  A deep understanding of such almost-periodic or quasi-periodic equations will have a great impact on the development of theory as well as on applications.  The objective of the proposed research is to investigate various aspects, of interest in applications, of the solutions to such equations.  The results of the project will have significant impact for the analysis of a wide range of mathematical models that are based on these equations.\r\n",
