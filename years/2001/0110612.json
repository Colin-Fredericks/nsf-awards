 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ancient DNA is a valuable tool with which to test hypotheses relating to population movements and expansions in prehistoric times. Advances in molecular biological techniques, including the automation of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), has made it possible to examine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) extracted from ancient human remains.  This provides an opportunity to directly investigate genetic material from prehistoric peoples.  \r\n\r\nArchaeological and linguistic evidence suggest that prehistoric population movements in North America were widespread and common. Consequently, many contemporary Native American populations occupy a different geographical region from their ancestors and assessing relationships between ancient and modern populations is difficult without genetic information.  In this project, ancient and modern DNA from populations in the Central Valley of California will be used to test specific hypotheses regarding the peopling and population structure of the region. Linguistic evidence suggests that a Penutian speaking population began replacing Hokan speaking populations in California Central Valley approximately 4000ybp. While archaeological and linguistic data suggest substantial interaction among the peoples of California, the Great Basin, and the Columbia Plateau, the genetic data obtained through ancient DNA studies in these regions will provide insight into the association between cultural similarities and biological relatedness. \r\n\r\nMigrations in prehistoric California have also been tied to the spread of technology in the last 3000 years. DNA extracted from these prehistoric human remains can be used to model the speed and timing of migrations of hunter-gatherer populations, and to examine the demographic consequences of a shift in resource acquisition practices. This information bears directly on modeling the timing and mode of the initial peopling of the Americas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
