The collaborators are Professor Umesh Garg, University of Notre Dame and Professor Sandeep Ghugre, Inter-University Consortium for DAE Facilities, Calcutta Centre.  The PIs will investigate nuclei in the vicinity of the N=50 closed shell.  In addition to obtaining data on high-angular momentum states in the N~50 nuclei, they propose to do a \"complete\" spectroscopy of a number of nuclei with a view to understanding the evolution of nuclear structure effects.  Novel effects include \"anti-magnetic rotation\" and \"wobbling motion\" in nuclei.\r\n\r\nScope:  Experiments will be performed at the Gammasphere facility in the US and at the MEHIA facility at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India.  This project will actively involve graduate students and Postdocs at both institutions.  In addition to providing the opportunity to work at state-of-the-art facilities, the proposed experiments will form Ph.D. dissertation projects for students in both countries.  This project is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Government of India's Department of Science and Technology.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
