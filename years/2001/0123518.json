 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been a comfortable fallacy that the optical fiber has infinite bandwidth, and, therefore,\r\nwe have bandwidth to burn. With the explosion of multiple-channel communications through the use\r\nwavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM), available bandwidth now takes center stage. When\r\ncomparing optical communications with other types of communications, we lag far behind in terms of\r\nspectral efficiency (i.e., bits/Hz) and we are not even close to the Shannon capacity limit. In fact, higher\r\nspectral efficiency is probably the area of least creative activity within the field, and yet it holds the\r\npromise for revolutionary increases in future systems capacity.\r\n     One of the technical areas within optical communications that has shown the most bandwidth\r\nwaste and has many future potential applications is subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) of many lower-speed\r\nchannels on a single wavelength carrier. In SCM, half the data bandwidth is wasted since either:\r\n(i) transmitting double-sideband signals will, in essence, duplicate the data being sent given that each\r\nsideband carries the full information needed for reception, or (ii) transmitting single-sideband signals\r\nrequires that the mirror frequencies on the other side of the carrier wave (i.e., where the second sideband\r\nwould have been located) remain unoccupied by any other data signals.\r\n     Subcarrier multiplexing has many advantages for future optical communications systems,\r\nincluding: (a) the transmission of many lower-speed digital data signals on a single high-capacity\r\nwavelength, (b) the transmission of many analog-modulated signals, (c) the transmission medium for\r\nnetworks that accommodate wireless microwave-based optical signals, and (d) the transmission of control\r\nlabels for efficient routing in packet-switched networks.\r\n     We propose implementing a new multiplexing scheme that enables double the spectral efficiency\r\nfor optical systems that use subcarrier multiplexing. The scheme is called dispersion-division-multiplexing\r\n(DDM) and relies on placing two data channels simultaneously in the same frequency space\r\naway from an optical carrrier. For example, one double-sideband data channel is transmitted\r\nconventionally, and a second double-sideband channel is transmitted in the shadow of the first\r\nchannel. Shadowing occurs due to the chromatic dispersion of the optical fiber. Due to dispersion, each\r\nof the two double sidebands of a single channel will travel at slightly different speeds. These sidebands\r\nwill periodically be out-of-phase will each other relative to the optical carrier wave, thereby canceling\r\neach other and inducing RF power fading (i.e., a nearly complete disappearing of the given channel's\r\npower at a receiver). One channel would be faded when the other channel would be in-phase and have\r\nfull power. By using a tunable dispersion-inducing element, a receiver can change the relative phase\r\nbetween each cannel's two sidebands and thus recover either of the two frequency-co-located channels.\r\n     Our research program will investigate unique functionalities, opportunities, and limitations when\r\nusing spectrally-efficient dispersion-division-multiplexing that could bear significant fruit in the 5-10\r\nyear time frame. The key fundamental features of our systems and networking research program are as\r\nfollows. We will:\r\n(a) demonstrate highly-spectrally-efficient DDM for many WDM channels,\r\n(b) demonstrate the utility of DDM for interconnecting nodes in a wireless-based photonic\r\nnetwork,\r\n(c) demonstrate SCM label swapping and routing in a WDM photonic network, and\r\n(d) investigate the fundamental limitations of generating, transmitting, and receiving DDM\r\nchannels when considering SNR, extinction ratio, and data bandwidth.\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS",
