 "awd_abstract_narration": "Krasny\r\n0107187\r\n     The investigator develops new computer algorithms for\r\nparticle simulations in fluid dynamics and molecular dynamics,\r\nand he employs the algorithms to study important application\r\nproblems.  The main technical tool is a new adaptive treecode\r\nalgorithm for solving the N-body problem in the context of\r\nlong-range particle interactions.  In this algorithm, the particle\r\nforces or velocities are evaluated using Taylor approximation in\r\nCartesian coordinates, and the necessary Taylor coefficients are\r\ncomputed by a recurrence relation.  The adaptive features include\r\na divide-and-conquer evaluation strategy, nonuniform rectangular\r\nclusters, variable order approximation, and a run-time choice\r\nbetween Taylor approximation and direct summation.  The\r\ninvestigator develops an optimal strategy for choosing the\r\nparameters in the code, in order to maximize the accuracy and\r\nefficiency of the algorithm.  The application problems to be\r\nstudied in fluid dynamics include the onset of chaotic dynamics\r\nin vortex cores, high precision computation of vortex sheet\r\nroll-up and spiral formation in the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem, and\r\nbreakdown and transition in vortex rings.  An important component\r\nof the work is to compare regularized particle simulations with\r\nexperiments and with genuine viscous flows computed by finite\r\ndifference schemes.  The application problems to be studied in\r\nmolecular dynamics involve potential energy and force field\r\nevaluation for electrostatic interactions.\r\n     The results of this research affect several areas of\r\nstrategic national interest, including civil and military\r\naviation and biotechnology.  One outstanding problem in aviation\r\nis the simulation of the trailing vortex wake that forms behind\r\nan aircraft on takeoff and landing.  The vortex wake is a serious\r\nhazard to other aircraft, especially in crowded airports.  It\r\nimposes a minimum time and distance between takeoffs and landings\r\non a given runway, and it is a source of wind shear, which has\r\nbeen implicated in accidents.  The project sheds light on the\r\nstructure and dynamics of vortex cores, and this helps\r\naeronautical engineers in designing vortex wake remediation\r\nsystems.  In the area of biotechnology, one far-reaching problem\r\nis to simulate protein folding in a physically accurate way.  This\r\nis in fact the next step required to make use of the data\r\ncollected in the human genome project.  The project contributes by\r\nenhancing the computer algorithms that are used by biochemists to\r\nstudy protein folding.  In the area of education and human\r\nresources, the investigator directs an applied honors calculus\r\ncourse for freshman science and engineering students, develops a\r\nnew graduate course on scientific computing, and mentors the\r\nprofessional development of undergraduate and graduate students\r\nand postdocs.\r\n",
