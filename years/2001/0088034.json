 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) This uses astronomical laboratory instrumentation to improve and enrich the educational experience of both undergraduate non-science and science majors. The project involves creation of a comprehensive series of laboratory exercises that are integrated into courses ranging from Introductory Astronomy for non-science majors to advanced highly-technical labs and research projects for physical science majors. Equipment consists of twelve 8-inch optical telescopes to complement the laboratory experience the non-science majors are currently receiving through CLEA labs. Second, an existing Celestron 14-inch telescope is being upgraded with a CCD camera and spectrograph that provide more scientifically and technological focused students the experience of true modern astronomical observation and data reduction. This equipment will also be utilized to incorporate on-site (perhaps real-time) data into the CLEA laboratory exercises. \r\n\r\n The 8-inch telescopes afford the non-science students hands-on experience in astronomical observations and techniques to enhance the important but cookbook nature of the computer labs at a level appropriate to their abilities and interests. The CCD camera and spectrograph for the 14-inch telescope serve several purposes. One is to adapt the CLEA labs in order to supply local data, and even real-time data when possible, from this rooftop telescope for use by the students. This provides an immediate connection between the students' laboratory work and real astronomical observations. It also allows the development of more sophisticated labs and research experiences for the science-orientated students and majors. Students can also use this equipment in their Senior Thesis projects. Future directions will be to modify a subset of the labs developed for the Introductory Astronomy course for use by the William and Mary School of Education in their Earth Sciences teacher development program in association with the Department of Physics. \r\n",
