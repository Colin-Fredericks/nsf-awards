Additionally, gaining a better understanding of many important problems, such as those associated with the global environment, data quality and access, and the training and utilization of research personnel, require cooperative efforts on a multilateral basis. An increasing number of such problems cut across and transcend individual scientific disciplines. The\r\noldest and most extensive mechanism for facilitating world-wide communication between U.S. scientists and engineers and their foreign counterparts is the array of non-governmental international disciplinary unions and interdisciplinary organizations that together comprise the International Council for Science (ICSU), a non-governmental, multilateral organization comprised of an adhering organization in over 90 countries. This award will enable the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (the U.S. adhering organization to ICSU) to continue to manage U.S. participation in ICSU. The award provides dues payments to ICSU, and support for two international disciplinary unions (the International Commission of Mathematical Instruction and the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics) as well as two interdisciplinary organizations (the Pacific Science Association and the Committee on Science and Technology for Development).  \r\n",
