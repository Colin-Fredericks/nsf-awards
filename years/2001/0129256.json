 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is submitted with the acknowledgement that project and program evaluations are indispensable to those agencies and organizations that emphasize mathematics, science, technology and staff and funders with valuable information to make informed decisions about the implementation, progress and success of a project or program.  Therefore, it is imperative that the evaluators responsible for planning, collecting and analyzing evaluation data are trained to be both technically competent in their work efforts and sensitive to the cultural context in which the project or program takes place.  This planning grant would provide the structure for the development of a summer training institute for participants to broaden thier knowledge of evaluation models, methods, and standards, as well as raise both their awareness and understanding  of a very important aspect of evaluation - its cultural context.  That is, a fundamental aspect integrated throughout all the institute's training activities will attend to the reality that evaluations do not occur in a vacuum but instead are contextual because of the variety of racial, cultural, socio-economic, and other settings in which the project or program is operating.  As such, there is a pressing need to develop a framework for identifying the many \"hidden\" variables (e.g., stereotypes, attitudes, ecpectations) that frame the cultural contex of evaluation.  A major focus of this planning grant would be to develop a culturally relevant evaluation training model and plan for its utilization at a summer training institute so that mid-level evaluators will appreciate and understand the need for a cultural context of educational evaluation of math and science and other projects.  Upon completion of the Institute, the participants will be able to effectively transfer theoretical knowledge learned to procedural knowledge, and then to actual evaluation practice within a responsive and relevant context.",
