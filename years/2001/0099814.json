 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses problems in dimension theory of\r\ndynamical systems and ergodic theory of tilings and substitutions.\r\nIn the first direction, it is proposed to study the dimension\r\ncharacteristics of invariant sets for non-conformal dynamical\r\nsystems and natural measures on them. These questions are related\r\nto problems on self-similar sets with overlap and arithmetic sums\r\nof Cantor sets. The second direction concerns non-periodic self-affine\r\ntilings, their generalizations, and symbolic analogs. There are many\r\nlinks between the two directions; for instance, self-affine tiles often\r\nhave fractal boundaries, and number-theoretic issues\r\n(e.g., the appearance of PV-numbers) are prominent in both areas.\r\nThe problems to be studied are concerned with dynamical and diffraction\r\nspectra of tilings and substitutions.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical chaos theory deals with the appearance of chaotic\r\nmotions in dynamical systems (which are mathematical models of\r\nvarious phenomena in physics, biology, economics, etc.). These\r\nchaotic motions are often associated with various \"fractal\" phenomena.\r\nThe modern dimension theory uses a wide variety of tools to\r\nstudy the fine structure of these motions and their invariant sets\r\n(such as \"strange attractors\"). Still, many aspects of this\r\n\"fractal chaotic world\" remain mysterious, and the proposed research\r\naims to get further insights into them. The second part of the project\r\nis concerned with the so-called \"aperiodic order,\" the hallmark\r\nof which is the remarkable class of solids, discovered in the\r\nearly 1980's and called quasicrystals, which exhibit sharp diffraction\r\nspectrum with a forbidden 10-fold symmetry. Penrose tilings,\r\ndiscovered in the 1970's in a purely mathematical development, turned\r\nout to be a good model for certain quasicrystals, but many open problems\r\nremain, both on the mathematical and on the physical side.\r\nThe second part of the proposed research investigates some of these\r\nproblems using the techniques of ergodic theory and symbolic dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
