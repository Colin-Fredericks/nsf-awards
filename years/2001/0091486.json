 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support for the work of Dr. William E. Billups in the Department of Chemistry of William Marsh Rice University in Houston.   The work will include the synthesis of new elusive compounds, using a vacuum gas-solid reaction method  developed by Dr. Billups to prepare small ring alkenes and bicycloalkenes from beta-halocyclopropylsilanes.   Aromatic compounds to be prepared will include cycloproparenes, fullerenes, buckytubes, and functionalized fluorinated single-wall nanotubes.   Low temperature reactions of Os atoms with ethylene oxide and of Rh atoms with diazomethane will be carried out to complete studies of low temperature reactions of metal atoms with organic molecules.   Structures of gas hydrates will be determined by low-temperature x-ray crystallography.  \r\n\r\nDr. Billups' research covers a wide variety of areas in physical organic chemistry, including the synthesis and properties of small ring alkenes and bicycloalkenes, fullerenes, fluorinated single-wall carbon nanotubes, and products formed from the reactions of transition metal atoms and small organic molecules at low temperatures.   Work will be initiated on the nucleation, growth, and structures of methane hydrates, with the goal of finding inhibitors for their formation.   These hydrates can cause serious problems in long distance natural gas pipelines.",
