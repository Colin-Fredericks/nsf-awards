 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator organizes an international conference at\r\nInstitut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques to study folding and\r\nself-assembly of macromolecules.  Self-organization of\r\nmacromolecules is a fundamental question in molecular biology.\r\nHow molecules fold plays a major role in their organization.  The\r\nmeeting fosters the creation of new tools by bringing together\r\nscientists from several domains to consider the problem from\r\ndifferent perspectives.\r\n     DNA is like a long zipper whose teeth are pairs of\r\nmolecules, called base pairs, one molecule on each side of the\r\nzipper.  Links between the base pairs close the zipper.  The zipper\r\nis about six feet long in human DNA; to fit inside a cell, it\r\ncoils up.  It partially uncoils to expose sections --- genes ---\r\nthat are read to produce an intermediate molecule, called\r\nmessenger RNA.  Ribosomes read the messenger RNA and produce a\r\ncorresponding amino acid chain.  The chain folds up spontaneously;\r\nthis is a protein.  Proteins in turn perform their functions by\r\npartially unfolding to interact with other folded macromolecules.\r\nProteins, genes, and DNA all fold and unfold to do their work.  So\r\nfolding and self-assembly are central issues in molecular\r\nbiology.  A goal of the conference is to stimulate synergistic\r\ninterchanges between different disciplines by bringing together\r\nbiologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, and computer\r\nscientists to discuss these issues from different perspectives.",
