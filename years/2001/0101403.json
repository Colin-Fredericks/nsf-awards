 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bellevue Community College and The Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges provide professional development for secondary, post secondary and adjunct faculty in information technology (IT) in Washington State. The workshops build upon the programs of the Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) to improve the overall level of IT instruction through out the State. The faculty are provided the skills to effectively use onsite, online, and distributed instructional delivery systems to make effective use of media-based instructional resources. The professional development also provides opportunities in the use and application of industry-identified IT skill standards and the NWCET curriculum development kits to align curricula with national standards. They develop the skills needed to evaluate, select and use media-based components in standards-based courses applicable to IT certificates and degrees. The website also provides collaborative opportunities for faculty to update and refresh current Washington State-approved IT related programs and identify areas for new courses. A special emphasis is on increasing the number of IT instructors by attracting IT professionals and instructors from related fields to increase their knowledge about pedagogy and content.\r\n",
