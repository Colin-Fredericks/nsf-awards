 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an interdisciplinary REU Site in climate modeling and societal impacts (CMSI) at the University of Colorado in Boulder.   CMSI is a cooperative program between academia (The University of Colorado) and a government laboratory (NCAR, the National Center for Atmospheric Research).   Its goal is to introduce a group of undergraduates in physical sciences, social sciences, and the humanities to the constellation of perspectives surrounding the use of numerical climate models .  The project's premise is that it is crucial for all scholars and citizens to have a deep appreciation of the power and limits of scientific knowledge for the resolution of societal problems.\r\n\r\nTwelve undergraduates per year will participate in the program for eight weeks.  Students will gather and evaluate scientific data and investigate the social, political, psychological, economic, and philosophical issues surrounding the interpretation and use of data for addressing contemporary controversies over global climate change.  Research projects will begin with the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data from radiosondes and the characterization of cloud cover used as input to general circulation models.  As this scientific inquiry continues, students will engage in political and philosophical reflection upon their work and the relationships between science and public policy.  At the end of the eight weeks, students will draw their own conclusions concerning the relevance of global climate change research to societal needs.  Program outcomes will include papers published in scientific, public policy, and philosophic journals and presentations at national conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n\r\n",
