 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the ubiquitous use of interactive web services, the technology\r\nfor programming such services has remained low-level, tedious and \r\ninsecure. The overwhelmingly common method of extending web\r\nservers with external applications is to use the Common Gateway Interface\r\nprotocol, which, while conceptually simple, has several known security\r\nloopholes. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this research is to establish type systems as the\r\nfundamental methodology for reasoning about interactive web services,\r\nand as a basis for designing and implementing tools that guarantee\r\nsecurity and reliability of these services. Some objectives of the\r\nresearch are to:\r\n\r\n(a) Provide tools to create secure programming environments for\r\ninteractive web services by building on existing tools and\r\ninfrastructure, notably the <bigwig> tools for interactive web\r\nservices developed at the University of Aarhus, Denmark.\r\n\r\n(b) Implement prototype tools that check the satisfaction of security\r\npolicies (e.g., type-safety, memory-safety, secure information flow)\r\nfor interactive web services, and that provide feedback about failures.\r\n\r\n(c) Foster fundamental progress in the area of modular program\r\nanalysis; this is not only essential for interactive web services (and\r\nmore generally, mobile software) because of their componential nature\r\nof construction, but also has the potential to impact scalability and\r\nefficiency of more conventional optimizing compilers as well.\r\n",
