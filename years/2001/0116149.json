 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Jean Hardwick at Ithaca College for the acquisition of a core microscopy facility for the Biology Department.  This instrumentation will be used by four separate faculty members with diverse research interests in developmental biology, comparative physiology, neurobiology and  plant ecology.  Specifically, these funds will be used for the acquisition of a research-quality compound microscope equipped with advanced imaging capabilities such as DIC, phase contrast  and fluorescence imaging.  This microscope will also be equipped with a cooled digital camera (CCD) and image analysis system for the capture of publication-quality electronic images as well as advanced image analysis. In addition, this facility will included a stereomicroscope with a epi-fluorescence for imaging of fluorescently-labeled plant and animal specimens and a dual viewing bridge for training students in various procedures.  \r\n\tThis instrumentation will become a major component of a core departmental facility for microscopy which will complement existing equipment as well as expanding our facilities to include electronic imaging and analysis. Several faculty members use microscopy as part of their ongoing research efforts in projects including the localization of neuropeptides in the amphibian nervous system, analysis of the regulation of embryonic development in Xenopus, the physiology and biochemistry of mucus production in invertebrates, and the response of plants to injury.  All of these projects require significant analysis of tissue specimens using a variety of optical techniques.  For example, analysis of neuropeptide localization utilizes the technique of immunohistochemistry to determine the specific organization and function of neurotransmitters in the nervous system.  The developmental studies use gene markers, such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP), to investigate the molecular signals underlying specific aspects of development.  The study of mucus production requires histological analysis of the mucus producing organs themselves, and the analysis of plant response to injury will also use a GFP marker to determine the cellular responses to insect herbivore.  Thus, this facility will become an integral part of the research facilities for a wide range of current faculty as well as future hires.  \r\nThe Biology department at Ithaca College has a long-standing commitment to the involvement of undergraduates in research.  All biology majors are required to spend at least one semester doing research in a faculty member's lab.  Undergraduates are involved in every facet of faculty research and are trained in the use of all equipment associated with that work.  This would mean that, with at least four different faculty members using this facility as a part of their research program, a significant number of undergraduates will also have the opportunity to use this equipment.  Undergraduates at Ithaca College routinely present their research efforts at conferences and are included as co-authors on publications. Continued involvement of undergraduates in ongoing scientific research is critical in stimulating students to pursue careers in science, as well as increasing their overall scientific literacy.\r\n",
