 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is proposed as a starter grant to support a follow-on effort to PFSIVIETE fellowship\r\ngrant number 9896381, \"A Longitudinal Study of Eight Engineering Colleges using the\r\nSUCCEED Longitudinal Database.\" The primary goal of the original fellowship was to prioritize\r\nfactors that contribute to engineering student success by studying programs designed to help\r\nengineering students at nine institutions. The breadth of data required to conduct such an analysis\r\ncould not be collected within the fellowship tenure, so this greater goal remains a subject for\r\ncontinuing research. During the fellowship tenure, a number of individual studies were\r\ncompleted, and results from these have been published or are being developed in collaboration\r\nwith the investigators who originally designed and implemented the programs under study. This\r\nrequest asks for support necessary to complete the study of data already collected and to collect\r\nadditional data needed to begin to address the more aggressive goal of characterizing factors that\r\ncontribute to engineering student success. The Southeastern University and College Coalition for\r\nEngineering Education (SUCCEED) will continue to significantly leverage this work.\r\n\r\n",
