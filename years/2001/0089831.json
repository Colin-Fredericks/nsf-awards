Lucchese at Texas A&M University, Danielle Dowek and Georges Raseev at the Universite de Paris/Sud in Orsay, France.  Their collaboration addresses theoretical and experimental studies of the photoionization process and development of a methodology for comparison and for application to small molecular systems.  Photoelectron angular distributions in photoionization is the project's principal focus. The US investigator brings to this collaboration theoretical expertise in molecular photoionization processes.  This is complemented by the French group's experimental expertise on photoionization and experience computing molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions.  The project also provides access to a specialized synchrotron light source in Orsay.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate students.  The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance understanding of fundamental processes in photoionization. Studies of photoionization probe the nature of highly excited states of molecules. These states have applications to many fields from astrophysics and atmospheric chemistry to biology and materials processing. \r\n",
