 "awd_abstract_narration": "0105004\r\nShkoller\r\n\r\nThis three year research effort is founded upon the author's recent \r\ndevelopment of a novel Lagrangian averaging procedure for the Euler and \r\nNavier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.  The method is based on \r\nexpressing the exact Lagrangian fluid flow as a composition of a smooth \r\ndeterministic volume-preserving Lagrangian flow and a rough stochastic \r\nflow consisting of volume-preserving near-identity transformations.  This \r\ndecomposition is asymptotically expanded about the identity, substituted \r\ninto the variational principle, and then averaged.  The resulting \r\ndeterministic system of equations is termed the Lagrangian averaged \r\nNavier-Stokes (LANS) equations in the presence of viscosity, and the \r\nLagrangian averaged Euler (LAE) equations in the ideal case when \r\nviscosity is absent.  Both the LAE and LANS models are parameterized by \r\na small spatial scale alpha, and are derived in such a fashion as to \r\naccurately reproduce the dynamics of the Euler and Navier-Stokes \r\nequations at spatial scales larger than alpha, while averaging (or \r\nhomogenizing) the fluid motion at scales smaller than alpha.  Unlike \r\ncurrent approaches such as Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or \r\nLarge Eddie Simulation (LES) models which add artificial dissipation to \r\nthe system to remove subgrid scales, the LAE/LANS equations preserve \r\nthe underlying structure of the inviscid dynamics, namely, energy, \r\nhelicity, and circulation, by instead using a geometric, nonlinear dispersive \r\nmechanism.  As a result, our LANS model, unlike RANS or LES, does not \r\nartificially suppress intermittency, a fundamental feature of fluid \r\nturbulence. The resulting system is a set of dynamically coupled partial \r\ndifferential equations for the mean velocity field and covariance tensor.  \r\nThis system will be the backbone of a massive analytic and computational \r\nassault on the modeling and understanding of fluid turbulence.\r\n\r\nAlthough heavily studied by numerous researchers for over a century, \r\nincompressible fluid turbulence elusively remains one of the last great \r\nchallenges of modern scientific exploration.  Its understanding is of \r\nparamount importance in a wide range of engineering and physical \r\napplications, ranging from the design of airplanes and automobiles, to \r\ndaily weather forecasts and global climate prediction.  Roughly speaking, \r\na flow becomes turbulent when all of the spatial scales in the fluid are \r\nactivated, or in other words, when the fluid is moving so chaotically, as to \r\ncreate smaller and ever smaller vortices.  In such a flow regime, the \r\ntrajectory of each fluid particle appears unpredictable, yet the challenge is \r\nto derive a mathematical set of equations which can describe this \r\nunpredictable motion.   About 150 years ago, the Navier-Stokes equations \r\nwere introduced for this very purpose, and although it is now generally \r\naccepted that these equations do indeed provide a remarkable physical \r\nmodel of reality, it remains a mathematical mystery as to whether or not \r\nunique solutions to these equations exist for all time.  Moreover, even \r\nnumerical approximations of these equations on the world's fastest \r\nsupercomputers are incapable of modeling the small-scale structures and \r\npatterns which are formed in a turbulent regime -- the computer simply \r\nruns out of memory long before it can simulate the prohibitively small \r\nvortical motion.  The LANS model, described above, is intended to \r\nalleviate these fundamental difficulties, and make the computational \r\nsimulation of turbulent flows feasible.\r\n",
