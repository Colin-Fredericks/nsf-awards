 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the viability of a new manufacturing Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) representing an innovation in enterprise resources planning (ERP) supply chain management that:  (1) Is more effective than existing supply-chain management software paradigms;  (2) Incorporates many of the \"lean manufacturing\" principles; and (3) Is more available to smaller manufacturing companies than existing systems in that it can be delivered via the worldwide Web.  The result would be more effective inventory management, production planning, and production control resulting in greater customer responsiveness, lower inventory levels, and higher utilization of critical resources.  By delivering over the worldwide web with a free trial period followed by a \"pay-per-use\" protocol, smaller companies can make use of the same powerful scheduling tools that are used by large companies.  The concept is a considered to be a better fit for real manufacturing systems than existing ERP approaches.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results would enable U.S. manufacturing companies to be better suited to compete in the new web-based marketplace that takes low cost and high quality as given, leaving customer service as the key aspect for distinction.  Such companies will be able to deliver customized products to customers with almost zero lead-time, thereby enhancing their position in an increasingly competitive global environment. \r\n",
