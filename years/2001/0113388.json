 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although various IPSec policy issues [2,3,4] have attracted a lot of attention, within the IETF IPSP (IP\r\nSecurity Policy) working group, there is certain amount of confusion and concerns about the two\r\nfundamental issues: 1) How to ensure the correctness of a set of distributed security policies? 2) How\r\nto systematically determine the correct set of policies and securely distribute them across the\r\nnetwork?\r\nInternet will be more and more dynamic in many aspects. With the capability of various wireless network\r\ntechnologies, users and even sub-networks can be mobile. Mobility implies potential changes in the\r\npolicies or the inter-relations among distributed policies. Adaptive security is another cause of policy\r\nchanges. It will be uncommon in the near future that, in reacting to a newly detected intrusion, a security\r\nmanagement system might on-the-fly determine to strengthen the security level by modifying the IPSec\r\nsecurity policies. Therefore, it is critically important to have a safe and rigorous solution to handle the\r\nabove two issues.\r\nPolicy Specification Correctness\r\nCurrently, in the research community of IPSec/VPN policy, to our best knowledge, no rigorous definition\r\nfor IPSec/VPN policy correctness has been developed. Later in this proposal, we will give a formal and\r\nreasonable definition for correctness such that we will have a basis for policy specification analysis. Such\r\ncorrectness analysis must be automated such that the security configuration of a network system can be\r\nadaptive to changes, faults/intrusions, and mobility. On the other hand, if there are inherent constraints\r\nand conflicts among the existing security policies such that it is impossible to have a consistent policy set,\r\nthe policy analysis engine should also automatically determine the impossibility.\r\nInter-domain Secure Policy Distribution\r\nThe proposed work under the first issue assumes that we have a perfect and centralized collection of\r\ninformation related to the policies and security requirements around the whole Internet. However, in reality,\r\nthis might not always be possible as Internet is owned and managed by different administrative domains,\r\nwhile, for trust and privacy consideration, information regarding local policy and network topology might\r\nnot be sharable across domain boundaries.\r\nThe second objective of this proposed research is, under some inter-domain related constraints, to develop a\r\ncollaborative framework/architecture and a suite of distributed protocols such that we can still analyze the\r\ncorrectness of a set of decentralized IPSec/VPN policies. We will study the issue of the minimum amount\r\nof policy information needed for a particular policy domain to determine whether its local policies and\r\nrequirements will be consistent with other domains. Once the set of policies is decided, a policy distribution\r\nmechanism is also needed.\r\nUnder this proposed research project, we will first focus on the theoretical aspect of policy and requirement\r\nspecifications and their analysis. We will develop algorithms and analytical results to fundamental enhance\r\nour current technology in policy-driven networking systems such as IPSec/VPN. Second, we plan on\r\nimplementing a prototype to validate and evaluate our proposed approach on a realistic networking\r\nenvironment. The first phase will be a small testbed to run the prototype software, which will be open\r\nsourced and available to the community. Furthermore, we would like to collaborate with industry partners\r\nsuch as equipment venders and ISPs to further evaluate and validate our approach against real-world\r\nchallenges. Furthermore, we will pay special attention to the application of our solutions in a mobile\r\nnetwork environment. In such environment, the capability of dynamically updating IPSec security policy is\r\nextremely critical. To summarize, we will not only deliver academic publications about our proposed works\r\nbut also produce a prototype system and perform extensive experiments, including the real-world data set if\r\npossible, to evaluate the performance and accuracy and to validate our theoretical model in handling\r\ndifficulty issues in Policy-driven networking systems.",
