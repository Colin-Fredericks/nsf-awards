 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Lynne Goldstein and her students will continue their archaeological research at the site of Aztalan. Situated on the Crawfish River between Madison and Milwaukee Wisconsin, this large and unusual site covers approximately 21 acres. It was surrounded by a stockade or palisade with individual posts set into the ground and covered with clay plaster. Bastions or watchtowers were constructed at regular intervals and in addition to this outer wall, several inner palisade walls have also been identified. Excellent preservation of houses within the site has permitted identification of individual activity areas. Dating from the late prehistoric period, ca. 800-1300 AD Aztalan is unusual because it is associated with the Middle Mississipean culture which has its geographical focus in the southern Mississippi Valley. No other occurrences are known this far North and the site is an anomalous outlying frontier community. Dr. Goldstein wishes to understand the range of variability within the Middle Mississipean, how Aztalan was organized and how it interacted with other local communities. While clearly Middle Mississippean, preliminary data demonstrate that Aztalan's spatial organization differs significantly from its Southern counterparts. To address these questions three approaches will be employed. First, selective test excavations in four areas of the site will provide additional information on site structure. Secondly, abundant botanical and faunal remains will be analyzed. A pilot study demonstrates that such data will provide important information on the nature of food production and plant an animal use for ritual purposes. Finally a geographic information system will be expanded to include basic site data such as topography and modern features as well an information on individual features and houses excavated by Dr. Goldstein as well as past researchers. \r\n\r\nThis research will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed light on an important and poorly understood aspect of U.S. prehistory and increase scientific understanding of  chiefdom organization. It will also assist in training both undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n",
