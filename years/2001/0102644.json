 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Focused Research Group  project will address priority areas in the formation of uniform particles of simple and composite monodispersed colloids. The focus will be on the synthesis of nanosized particles, and modelling and characterization of their unique properties which develop for dimensions smaller than the typical submicron-sized colloid scales. Experimentral and theoretical evidence that a great many monodispersed colloids of spherical and other shapes are formed by aggregation of nanosized units will be developed to link the nansize and micrometer size particles. Coatings produced by surface precipitation and by adhesion of smaller particles on well-defined cores will be investigated. Nucleation, growth of nanoparticles, and their aggregation, will be kinetically controlled to identify different process stages which will be modelled theoretically. Both the intermediate and final products will be characterized in terms of shape, size and structure using techniques that include combined dynamic and static light scattering. \r\n%%%\r\nThe broader impacts on science and technology will span areas involving both physical and biological disciplines. These include catalysis, pigments, clays, magnetics, ferroelectrics, and several medical areas such as sensors and localized drug release. This excellent team effort integrates research and education in such a way as to have a significant impact on areas of high interest to industry. Students trained in these areas of nanoscience and technology will be very competitive in the job market.  This award is co-funded by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research.\r\n",
