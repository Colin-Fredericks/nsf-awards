 "awd_abstract_narration": "0104019\r\nLiu\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to study the shock wave theory for conservation laws and \r\nthe Boltzmann equation in the kinetic theory. Shock waves occurs in many \r\nnatural phenomena, such as supersonic flight, sonar wind, earthquakes and \r\nhurricanes. There is now a satisfactory mathematical theory for the \r\ninviscid plane motion. It is planned to study the multi-dimensional gas \r\nmotion as well as the dissipation effects. The Boltzmann equation models \r\nthe gas motion on the microscopic level. This is necessary for important \r\nphysical phenomena such as the thermal effects of the boundary on the gas \r\nmotion. The nonlinear waves and the boundary effects for the Boltzmann \r\nequation will be studied.\r\n\r\nThe Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations for the gas dynamics are \r\nconsidered. The project will include the study of the nonlinear stability of \r\nshock waves for these and more general systems of hyperbolic-parabolic \r\nconservation laws. The approach combines the pointwise estimates and the \r\nenergy estimates and is based on the new understanding of the structure of \r\nthe Green's function for the equations linearized about the shock. For the \r\nBoltzmann equation, the positivity of Boltzmann shocks has been shown \r\nand the boundary effects such as the thermal creep are being studied. \r\nThese are based on the new macro-micro decomposition of the Boltzmann \r\nequation and time-asymptotic analysis.\r\n",
