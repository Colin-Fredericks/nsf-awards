 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the  proposed research  we address  the modeling and analysis of mesoscopic equations describing  pattern formation in materials and complex fluids. We focus mainly on two paradigms, surface processes and  field-responsive fluids. Mesoscopic models are coarse grained PDE or Stochastic PDE, derived directly and exactly from microscopic interacting particle systems and include detailed atomistic/molecular information. The principal question we attempt to answer  is how microscopic intermolecular forces affect  pattern formation and evolution at much larger\r\nlength scales. The analysis proposed here draws techniques from nonlinear PDE, calculus of variations and  stochastic processes. In the first  project we study pattern formation  and evolution  in surface processes under the influence of multiple and possibly competing mechanisms such as surface diffusion, reaction and adsorption/desorption. Here we employ Gamma-convergence \r\ntechniques in order to understand patterning at  equilibrium, and viscosity solutions and varifolds for their dynamic counterparts. In a second project we focus on molecular dynamics and\r\nrelated mesoscopic models describing particle suspensions in fluids and in particular on the  derivation and analysis of  mesoscopic PDE for field-responsive fluids. Here we employ\r\nmass transport and relative entropy methods combined with Riesz Transform  estimates\r\nto show existence of solutions as well as relaxation to equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmple experimental evidence indicates that interatomic and intermolecular forces dictate macroscopic properties of matter and determine formation and selection of  patterns and textures.\r\nNotable examples arise  in polymer blends, alloys, catalysis, epitaxial growth of advanced\r\nmaterials and biological media. Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo algorithms, developed in a Quantum/Statistical Mechanics framework, provide detailed, quantitative dynamic and equilibrium\r\ndescriptions of these phenomena; however they are limited to short  space/time length scales, while  experimentally observed morphologies involve much larger  scales. This disparity between computations and experiments underscores the need to develop models (PDE, Stochastic PDE)\r\nfor larger scales,  which take in consideration microscopic details. The \"mesoscopic\" models we develop and study numerically and analytically  are geared towards this direction, incorporating systematically, (a) microscopic interactions, and (b) underresolved microscopic scales fluctuations. The developed models and analysis methods can allow for  a more direct comprehension of  macroscopic dynamic and equilibrium morphological behaviors  and also provide comparisons to experiments which typically involve larger length scales than the ones arising in microscopic modeling and simulation.\r\n\r\n",
