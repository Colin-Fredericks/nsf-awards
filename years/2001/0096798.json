US PI Prabir K. Dutta, Ohio State University (OSU) and Raksh Vir Jasra, Central Salt & Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI), Bhavnagar, India will study the synthesis of two classes of microporous materials, zeolites, and hydrotalcite-based layered double hydroxides (HT).  The objectives are to understand the factors leading to incomplete crystallization and/or formation of impurity phases in zeolite X systhesis systems, and to understand the crystallization dynamics of HT-like compounds.\r\n\r\nScope:  The research groups compliment one another and each group has highly qualified senior researchers with established research records.  For CSMCRI, microporous material synthesis is a key technology area and Dr. Jasra has extensive research experience in the area of zeolite synthesis.  OSU will focus on the fundamental structural aspects and identify the specific features that control the crystallization of zeolite X.  Their collaboration is expected to produce advances that increase scientific understanding of zeolites and hydrotalcites. The project has clear mutual benefits for the US and India, as well as potential for broad commercial application.  This award is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Materials Research.   \r\n",
