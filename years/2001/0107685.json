For the Past 21 years the locations have alternated between North America\r\nand Europe; in 2001, the conference will be held in Asia for the first time.  The first eight conferences have produced highly desirable interactions between academic and industrial and government workers in this vital area of chemical process design and simulation.  The meetings have also become the most important gathering for workers from all over the world; the Eighth conference  held in 1998 in Nordwijkerhout, The Netherlands attracted 250 participants from 29 countries.  Each conference has produced important collections of papers in review  archival proceeding volumes. The Eighth Conference provided over 1000 pages of reviews  and new research published in the international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.\r\n\r\nThe Ninth Conference is scheduled for May 20 -25 2001, in Kurashiki, Japan, with a similar format that has been successful at the previous Conferences, though with some significant enhancements in workshops and new session topics.\r\n\r\nThe present proposal requests funds for travel, and meals and lodging in some cases, for as many needy US academic researchers as possible.  A small request is included for communications costs between them and the PI.  Those supported would include presenters of invited and contributed papers as well as young research workers who would not be able to attend without such support.  No request is made for meeting organization expenses or for non-US participants.  \r\n\r\n   \r\n",
