Houston\r\nLouisiana State University \r\n\r\nAttracting Women into the Information Technology Workforce through Technology Immersion\r\n\r\nThis CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to investigate IT immersion on the college major and career choices of young women.  The IT immersion program is modeled on the total immersion method of learning a foreign language.    In the IT immersion program at Saint Joseph's Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school, entering freshmen receive a laptop computer the summer before they enter the Academy.  They are required to take two weeks of summer school to learn to use their laptop and software that will be used in the classroom.  Information technology has been totally integrated into the curriculum, and teachers are evaluated on the degree of information technology integration  in their classes.  This research project will use a longitudinal case study approach including observation, interviews, and biannual surveys focussing on the current 9-11th grade young women at the Academy (using the IT immersion curriculum) and comparing them to the current 12th grade and alumni from the Academy (using a similar curriculum without IT immersion).  The student using the IT immersion curriculum will also be compared to another private high school which does not use the IT immersion curriculum.  This project has the potential to provide valuable insights about factors that both motivate and discourage young women from choosing IT majors and careers. \r\n",
