 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research project is the development and application of mathematically and computationally rigorous gradient-based optimization methodologies for a virtual materials process design that is based on quantified product quality and accounts for process targets and constraints including economic aspects. A framework for preform as well as process parameter optimization of multi-stage metal forming \r\nprocesses is considered. The design of each individual process is performed using gradient-optimization techniques that are based on an innovative continuum sensitivity analysis. Optimal microstructure evolution paths, ideal forming techniques and knowledge based expert systems are used to select the required sequence of processes and to develop feasible initial designs.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the computational design simulator under development can be applied to select the necessary sequence of forming and intermediate thermal-stage processes, select appropriate dies and preforms  and control/design the various process parameters such that, for a given raw material with a given initial geometry, one can obtain a final product with desired microstructure and shape under various process\r\nconstraints and with minimal utilization rates and overall cost. These developments will lead to a virtual process laboratory that will assist industry in reducing lead time for process and product development, in trimming the cost of an extensive experimental trial-and-error process development effort, in developing processes for tailored material properties and in increasing volume/time yield.",
