 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development ( CAREER) project integrates research and educational initiatives focusing on micro- and nano-scale processing of biodegradable polymers using laser techniques for biomedical and bioMEMS applications.  Research focusing on laser micro- and nano-scale processing with parametric studies using both a UV excimer laser and a femtosecond laser to produce controlled micro-features on polymer surfaces will be addressed.  Biodegradable polymers hold immense promise as new materials for implantable biomedical micro-devices due to their biocompatibility and ability to naturally degrade and disappear in tissues over a desired period of time.  This degradability eliminates a second surgery to retrieve the implanted micro-devices.  The CAREER project will:   (1) develop an advanced laser technique with a near-field beam delivery system to produce controlled micro- and nano-scale patterns on biodegradable polymer surfaces; (2) develop an experimental system and a numerical model to investigate the transient laser-material interaction process on extremely small time and length scales; and (3) implement the research into the development of biodegradable micro- and nano-devices.  This research will make significant contribution to the emerging and interdisciplinary field of micro- and nano-manufacturing science and technology, bioengineering, and polymer science.\r\n\r\nThe integrated education plan will focus on curriculum development in micro- and nano-manufacturing at the undergraduate and graduate levels by infusing emerging and multi-disciplinary research into the classroom. This plan also encourages women students in research and adopts cooperative learning techniques in teaching. The PI also incorporates a learning plan for himself in new methods of  educational pedagogy and curriculum development.",
