 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is submitted to the National Science Foundation in response to the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP). The purpose of this interdisciplinary proposal is to request funds to develop and implement Southern University at New Orleans's (SUNO) ``Program of Excellence in Science and Computer Technology (PESMaCT)''. The PESMaCT web address is www.suno.edu/cs/pesmact/.\r\n\r\nStudies have confirmed that the shortage of manpower in the science and technical workforce is particularly acute within the underrepresented minority population.  Minorities make up only 14.5% of the present enrollment in graduate science and engineering programs, and 6% of the science and technical work force. Compared to the 28% minority representation in the population as a whole, there is an untapped minority resource for building the nation's scientific and technical workforce. The origin of this problem can be traced to inadequacies in science education in K-12 schools. It has also been documented that lack of achievement in science is due to shortcomings in present instructional methods which lack emphasis on gate-keeper and lab centered courses, hands-on training, and ineffective or non-collaborative efforts to utilize local universities resources and facilities.\r\n\r\nSUNO is proposing a solution to this problem through PESMaCT. The goals of this project are to: (1) increase the \"pipeline\" flow of minorities from high schools and junior colleges to science, mathematics, and computer technology (SMaCT) fields,(2) improve retention of minorities in SMaCT, and (3) improve the quality of graduating SMaCT majors. The overall objectives are to: (1)integrate technology into all gate-keeper courses, (2) double the current retention rate of 30%, (3) graduate 300 quality SMaCT majors within a 5 year period, and 4) get 15% to be accepted to graduate or professional schools.\r\n\r\nThese goals and objectives can be achieved by: (1) engaging in aggressive recruitment, (2) implementing a strategic retention plan, (3) enhancing undergraduate curricula, 4) utilizing undergraduate research as a valuable teaching tool, and (5) establishing a collaborative and synergistic relation with Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP).\r\n\r\nThe important catalysts for our plan are: (1) collaboration among departments in the College of Science at SUNO and (2) collaboration between SUNO and the New Orleans Public Schools (NOPS) which supply 74% our student population.  Unlike other institutions in the city of New Orleans, SUNO is an open-admission institution serving about 4,000 students with majors in liberal arts, sciences, business and education. Also, the University has graduate programs in social work, criminal justice, computer information systems, and education. NOPS district serves about 84,000 urban students with 85% being African Americans.  Compared to the rest of the state with 59.2 % poverty level, 88% of NOPS students come from families with incomes below the federal poverty level.\r\n\r\nPESMaCT is designed to improve the educational experience of minority students in science, mathematics, and computer technology from high school through college. Implementation of PESMaCT in high schools will motivate students to pursue degrees in careers of SMaCT fields. As a result, this will lead to an increase in the number of minority graduates and serve as a crucial pipeline in increasing the number of underrepresented minorities receiving graduate degrees and working in SMaCT fields.  Beyond the funding period, PESMaCT will be sustained by support from the University, local industries/companies and funds acquired from other grants. PESMact will support the University strategic plan to: (1) increase opportunities for students' success, (2) ensure quality and accountability, and (3) enhance services to the community and state. Most importantly, the project outlined in this proposal will help PESMaCT to achieve the NSF HBCU-UP goal to enhance the quality of undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) at Historically Black Colleges and Universities as a means to broaden participation in the SMET workforce. In addition, PESMaCT will positively impact the largest urban public school system in the State of Louisiana.",
