 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) \r\nFaculty in the Colleges of Science and Education have been working collaboratively for the past three years in addressing problems of student performance and retention in first semester chemistry. During this period, faculty recognized the need to examine their own practice including design of course curriculum, the quality of the problem-solving, in-class activities for students, and the alignment of course components and the importance of addressing problems of achievement and retention from multiple solution paths. The objectives being addressed in the current project include: (1) revision of the course curriculum and BONDing (Building Opportunities for Networking and Discussion) sessions through adaptation/adoption of aspects of the NSF Chemistry Initiatives and the integration of technology-based instructional tools and models, (2) professional development of faculty in order to facilitate implementation of these reforms, (3) continually building a professional learning community. The objectives are being accomplished through an action plan in which a cross-disciplinary faculty team simultaneously addresses curriculum revision, meaningful learning, and innovative instructional approaches. Curriculum reform efforts, including use of technology, are well-established methods to improve the learning of under-prepared and/or diverse student populations. Mechanisms for extensive collaborations have been established with community colleges in the area through the Region V Area Center for Educational Enhancement.\r\n",
