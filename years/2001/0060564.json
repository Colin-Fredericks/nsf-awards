 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the development of Advanced Carbon Composite Transmission Conductors for application in high voltage transmission grid systems.  This technology will enable greater electric power transmission capacity to be realized by facilitating operation at higher temperatures as compared with conventional metallic conductors.  The demand for electric power in North America and Europe has risen in proportion with economic growth.  Utilities worldwide are seeking new methods to transport more power though overhead transmission corridors.  This demand is not anticipated to diminish as the technological age advances.  Environmental, regulatory and economic constraints have constrained the installation of new transmission line corridors that are needed to meet this demand. An alternative is to upgrade existing transmission corridors to accommodate increased power flow.  In order to address the increasing power demands of industrialized nations advanced conductors offer the potential to enable distribution grids the capacity to meet this challenge. \r\n\r\nThis project will address the requirements for utilities worldwide to facilitate increased power flow through existing overhead high voltage transmission corridors.",
