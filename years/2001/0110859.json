 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference award to the University of Delaware is made by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research in support of the 9th-11th Materials Chemistry Workshops. The goals of the Workshops are to bring together scientists from diverse disciplines including inorganic, organic, physical, biological, polymer and analytical chemistry as well as other science and engineering backgrounds for discussion of ongoing and emerging areas of research and education in materials chemistry.  In addition, the Workshops are to promote dialog between industry, government and academic scientists in their endeavor to identify and investigate fundamental and technological issues.  Workshops will be held on the third week in October with up to thirty participants selected by a competitively reviewed application process.  Special efforts will be made to encourage industrial, government, minority, women and young material chemists to apply for the Workshops.  Specific workshop sites will be determined by the Workshop Chairpersons and are expected to be in Delaware, Wisconsin and Michigan.  \r\n\r\nThe Materials Chemistry Workshops will provide a forum conducive to the development of ideas, help bridge gaps among the materials chemistry constituencies in academia, industry and government laboratories, lead to new collaborations and define the frontiers of materials chemistry.\r\n",
