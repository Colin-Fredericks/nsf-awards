 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to use Arabidopsis thaliana as a\r\nmodel system to determine the signaling events leading to systemic acquired\r\nresistance (SAR). SAR is a secondary pathogen resistance which can be\r\ninduced after a local infection.  SAR is broad-spectrum and long-lasting.\r\nThrough genetic screens, NPR1 has been identified as a key positive\r\nregulator of SAR; mutants of the NPR1 gene are nonresponsive to SAR\r\ninduction.  NPR1 encodes a novel protein with functionally important\r\nprotein-protein interacting domains, the BTB domain and the ankyrin-repeat\r\ndomain.  Recent data show that nuclear localization of NPR1 is essential\r\nfor its function.  In the nucleus, NPR1 may affect the activities of the\r\nTGA subclass of bZIP transcription factors as well as the WRKY\r\ntranscription factors, which have been implicated as transcriptional\r\nactivators and repressors of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, respectively.\r\nA genetic screen for suppressors of npr1 has led to identification of sni1,\r\na mutation that restores systemic induction of PR genes in npr1.  The\r\nwild-type SNI1 is believed to be a negative regulator of SAR whose\r\ninactivation requires the function of NPR1.  It is hypothesized that NPR1\r\ninduces SAR by activating the TGA transcription activators and inactivating\r\nWRKY transcription repressors, and relieving the negative control of SNI1.\r\nIn this project, molecular genetic and biochemical experiments are designed\r\nto (1) determine the functional significance of the interaction between\r\nNPR1 and WRKY transcription factors in SAR;  (2) determine the mechanism by\r\nwhich SNI1 functions as a negative regulator of SAR; and  (3) identify\r\ncomponents in the NPR1-complex.  Because NPR1, SNI1, and WRKY transcription\r\nfactors are either novel or plant-specific proteins, characterization of\r\nthese components may unveil new mechanisms of signal transduction.\r\nUnderstanding molecular mechanisms of disease resistance in plants will\r\nlead to the development of technology in enhancing plants' innate defense\r\nto control infection.  Such technology has the potential to reduce the use\r\nof hazardous pesticides without using non-plant genes.  Therefore, the\r\nstudy of plant-microbe interactions is of interest to advancement of basic\r\nscience as well as to protection of the environment and improvement of\r\nhuman life.\r\n",
