 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this NSF-CONACyT project between Texas A&M University (College Station, Texas, USA) and the Universidad de las Americas (Puebla, Mexico) is to develop and deploy instructional material that allows the easy incorporation of global manufacturing knowledge into the industrial, mechanical, manufacturing or similar curricula.  The material developed in this project will be implemented in the industrial engineering, mechanical and manufacturing curricula affecting more than 1,200 students in these institutions. The approach is to develop lecture supplements and case studies based on real industrial situations.  Case studies provide the student and instructors with realistic industrial context that includes technical data, as well as, a description of the cultural and socio-economic environment of the community in which the facility is located.  Companies targeted are in industry sectors where there is significant trade between Mexico and the USA including the auto, electronics and textile industries.  Lecture supplements are focused analytical modules, developed within the context provided by a case study, that deal with problems specific to topics taught in engineering and science courses.  Lecture supplements will be carefully designed for their easy adoption in the curricula of the participating organizations.  Detailed guidelines for deployment will de developed based on the educational methodologies developed by the Foundation Coalition at Texas A&M University.  \r\n\r\nActive learning and teaming will constitute the essential pedagogical method for the in-class delivery of all course material.  Moreover, the use of technology-enabled education such as web technologies and instructional software will be incorporated in all CS and LS.  The assessment, evaluation, and dissemination techniques developed and implemented by the Foundation Coalition will be central to these activities in the proposed project.  It is expected that the results of this project will help future engineers and scientists understand how to efficiently exchange and deploy technology and scientific knowledge, and conduct business across the USA-Mexico border.",
