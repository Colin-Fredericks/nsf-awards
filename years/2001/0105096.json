 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diana Lane, University of Illinois, Chicago.  Ecosystem restoration has become a widespread activity in recent years. Little is known, however, about the success of restoration projects in restoring soil quality. The objectives of the research are 1) to characterize changes in soil nutrients as restoration proceeds over time, and 2) to determine the mechanisms that control such changes. The investigators will conduct field studies and experiments across a unique 25-year chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restoration sites that were created on former agricultural land. An important aspect of this research is to determine whether the temporal and spatial variability of soil resources increase following restoration. Variability in soil resources is characteristic of natural systems but may decrease when soils are used for agriculture. Results from this study will improve understanding of the functional consequences of restoration. In addition, these results will have broader implications for understanding the development of plant-soil feedbacks following disturbance.",
