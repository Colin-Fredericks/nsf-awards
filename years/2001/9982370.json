 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development, organisms may increase dramatically in size, and many switch the type of food they eat and the way they capture it. At the same time, their environment may change unpredictably and suddenly.  In marine systems, the temperature may spike, and storms may alter salinity or transport small larvae long distances. Thus, many immature stages are often more sensitive to environmental change than are adults.  Yet for a species to persist, members must be successful at each stage of development, and during the transitions between them. \r\n\r\nOn January 4th, as part of the 2001 Annual Meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, researchers from four nations will gather for a symposium, \"Ontogenetic Strategies of Invertebrates in Aquatic Environments\". This symposium explores the way that fundamental systems such as eyes, hormones, and behavior change during development. What can be learned about evolution from novel solutions? What can be learned from common strategies in diverse groups? Exploring patterns in a diversity of organisms will yield insights into basic principles of successful developmental patterns and strategies.\r\n",
