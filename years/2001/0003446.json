 "awd_abstract_narration": "Freedom Machines is a one-hour special for public television which will highlight the information about the newest technological advances which support over 54 million Americans with disabilities.  Through personal narratives, high-impact storytelling, and a comprehensive public education and outreach campaign, the show will inform viewers about assistive technology (AT) being used, and how it is adapted and designed by people with disabilities.  The individuals to be profiled, many of them leaders in science and technological fields, will encourage young people with disabilities to pursue careers in the sciences.  Many of the devices and approaches to be featured will also show how valuable these technologies are for the able bodied, general public.\r\n\r\nThe sixty-minute documentary is structured around the themes of Pioneers, Partners and Prophets in order to examine the evolving relationship between technology and the disabled, profile emerging technologies and explore the larger societal implications of this growing phenomenon.  A companion website and extensive outreach program will continue the informative material, support and create networks, and promote linkages between viewers, either abled or disabled, and the technology that might benefit them.  Technological changes have always been influenced by people with needs beyond the ordinary.  This dynamic is even more relevant in today's information age.  Freedom Machines will dramatically demonstrate that designing a world of inclusion benefits everyone.\r\n",
