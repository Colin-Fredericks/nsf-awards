 "awd_abstract_narration": "0129535\r\nKolodzey\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to evaluate the performance of a novel bio-chemical sensor based on the\r\nelectrochemical field effect in MOS-type transistor structures. He has fabricated\r\nprototypes of this MOS sensor, and have found that they produced non-linear\r\ncurrent-voltage responses to DNA molecules in an aqueous solution. Calculations indicate\r\nthat the device should be highly sensitive to the electrochemical potential of bio\r\nmolecules such as DNA and proteins. It should be capable of nanosecond response times for\r\ntime-resolved measurements. These preliminary results will be described briefly here and\r\nin more detail in the Motivation Section of this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the sensor is based on the semiconductor surface field effect in MOS\r\ndevices in which the electrochemical potentials (Fermi levels) of bio-compounds influence\r\nthe electrical current flowing in a transistor-like device. The detected biomolecules are\r\nlocated within a Debye screening length of the gate insulator electrode. Calculations\r\nindicate that the proposed field effect device may be sensitive to less than 110 molecules\r\nper square micron of active sensor area. By reducing the active area to 100 nm square,\r\nwhich is within lithographic capabilities, the sensor may be able to detect the charge on\r\none DNA molecule.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the exploratory and high-risk status is that the PI has not yet performed a comparison of sensor responses with different types of DNA and other biomolecules.  He has not yet measured the time resolved response. The sensitivity is unknown, and it is uncertain if the sensor can distinguish different concentrations and different types of DNA. For this SGER proposal, the PI wants to measure the sensor response with different types of DNA to determine its sensitivity and selectivity. The measurements will be calibrated with an optical fluorescence microscope. If it turns out that this bio-chemical sensor is a valuable instrument that can yield useful information on biomolecules, he plans to submit a full proposal for a comprehensive research program.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive proposal based on this sensor was submitted in November 2000 to the\r\nNanoscience NIRT program, but was unsuccessful. The reviewers stated that a weakness was the lack of sufficient chemical and biological data on sensor operation. In this SGER proposal, the PI requests the funds to support a student and travel to obtain measurements of the sensor for different DNA molecules and reference solutions. These results would be used to justify further research and large funding programs.\r\n",
