 "awd_abstract_narration": "Newman\r\n0109086\r\n     The principal investigator and his colleagues study the\r\nstructure and function of real-world networked systems,\r\nparticularly but not exclusively social networks.  An empirical\r\ncomponent is concerned with the discovery and analysis of the\r\nstructure of networks, including networks of collaboration\r\nbetween scientists, networks of company directors, networks of\r\npersonal preferences, and networks of citations between academic\r\npublications.  Studied quantities include local observables such\r\nas transitivity and degree distribution, and nonlocal ones such\r\nas centrality and community structure.  The investigator develops\r\nmodels to aid in the understanding of the effects of network\r\nstructure.  Of particular interest are random graph models of\r\nnetworks, percolation models of network resilience, and models of\r\nepidemics taking place on social networks.  The investigator\r\ndevelops new algorithms for extracting and visualizing network\r\nstructure, particularly the existence of communities in networks\r\nand structural properties related to network resilience, such as\r\npath counts and centrality measures.\r\n     A knowledge of the structure of networks of acquaintance is\r\ncrucial to the understanding of how information, such as news,\r\nrumors, consumer trends, etc., spreads through society.\r\nSimilarly, networks of physical contact between people govern the\r\nway in which diseases spread.  A proper understanding of the\r\nnature and progress of epidemics is impossible without good\r\nnetwork models.  In this project the investigator determines what\r\nthe structure of the networks in question is, and also models the\r\neffect of that structure on, among other things, the spread of\r\ninformation and disease.  As well as enhancing basic\r\nunderstanding of these problems, the project points to ways in\r\nwhich network structure or dynamics can be changed in order to\r\neither improve network transmission (in the case of information)\r\nor slow it down (in the case of epidemics).  For disease\r\ntransmission, for instance, it may be able to suggest effective\r\ntargets for immunization or education campaigns to slow disease\r\nspread.  The new data resources and analysis techniques developed\r\ncan be used to study other problems in which network-structured\r\nprocesses arise.\r\n\r\n",
