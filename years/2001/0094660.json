 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Engineering/ Education Partnership Scholar Program is an innovative, interdisciplinary two- year scholarship program that seamlessly integrates professional development, community service, and technical education for low income engineering, computer science and applied mathematics undergraduates. Selected Partnership Scholars experience an intense and integrated educational program leading to an undergraduate degree in either engineering, computer science or applied math and an education minor resulting in initial New York State Teacher Certification. Scholars are provided with multiple advising and mentoring tracks starting in their second year. During the summer of their sophomore and junior year, they participate in special workshops designed to support professional development. In the summer between their junior and senior year, they work with secondary school students as mentors themselves as part of their teaching hours for the education minor. These major elements of the project combine to create a comprehensive development model for low- income students providing them with an integrated set of educational experiences leading to successful completion of both an engineering degree as well as initial Teacher Certification in New York State. A secondary and important objective of this program is the creation of a sustainable teacher- training model that significantly infuses technology- competent teachers into urban school systems.",
