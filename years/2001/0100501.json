 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PI will investigate several different aspects of the\r\ntheory of linear partial differential equations associated to manifolds\r\nwith singular Riemannian metrics.  These include the propagation and\r\ndiffraction of singularities for the wave equation on manifolds with conic\r\nand edge singularities, and the structure of the fundamental solution for\r\nthe time-dependent Schrodinger equation on manifolds with scattering\r\nmetrics.  Tools such as the Fourier-Bros-Iagolnitzer transform will be\r\nstudied and refined as needed.\r\n\r\nLinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe wave propagation\r\n(such as the classical wave equation and the Schrodinger equation) are of\r\nfundamental importance in physics and geometry.  The propagation of waves\r\non curved spaces often involves the geometry of the underlying space in a\r\nsubtle manner.  When the space is `singular,' either in the sense of being\r\ninfinite in extent or of having degenerate properties in a finite region,\r\nthe relationship between geometry and the properties of solutions to PDEs\r\nis especially fascinating and poorly understood.\r\n",
