 "awd_abstract_narration": "San Francisco State University's College of Science and Engineering (COSE) and the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) have collaboratively developed a GK-12Fellows project to serve students at underperforming middle and high schools (3 each).Fellows will be systematically prepared to support the efforts of SFUSD teachers todeliver an inquiry-based pedagogy rich in science and math content. Fifteen SFSUFellows per year will directly benefit by enhancing their teaching and learning skills;SFUSD will benefit by the having these Fellows co-teach with SFUSD teachers, tutor,and serve as school-based resources, knowledgeable about the content and the applicationof SMET. Fellows will complete two formal classes--one focused on pedagogy andanother focused on either the physical or natural sciences. To ensure compliance withstate and national standards as well as to develop collegial relationships, teachers willpartner with the Fellows in the content classes which will provide both with basicconcepts in integrated biological areas and in fundamental concepts of physical sciences,along with laboratory curriculum modules. Fellows will be selected from COSE's diverse(63% minority) student body. Inverness Research Associates, an evaluation groupspecializing in science education, will conduct a comprehensive evaluation with bothquantitative and qualitative components.\r\nA-1\r\n",
