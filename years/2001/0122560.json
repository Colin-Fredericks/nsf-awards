Practioners develop their kit during a week-long workshop in the first year, implement it with support during the academic year and re-convene to discuss results and plan for dissemination in the following summer.\r\n\r\nThis project will lead to the improvement of the computer science education research community by developing educators skills and by exposing them to the relevant theory and methods of educational research.",
