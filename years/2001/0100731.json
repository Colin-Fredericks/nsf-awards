 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tIn the study of local rings of equicharacteristic p, the \r\ntight closure has proved very useful, This closure also extends \r\nnicely to local rings of equicharacteristic zero.  Unfortunately this \r\nclosure does not naturally extend to mixed characteristic rings. \r\nThis project is designed to fill this void.  In earlier work, the \r\nprincipal investigator defined four variants of an extended plus \r\nclosure.  As the name suggests, these closures are based upon the \r\nplus closure of an ideal, the set of elements which are in the \r\nextension of the ideal in some integral extension of the original \r\nring.  In the earlier work, a number of properties of the closures \r\nwere demonstrated,  In this project, additional properties will be \r\ndemonstrated,  While the benefits of this project will probably not \r\nbe restricted to these, the objectives are the properties which shall \r\nallow the extended plus closure to fill the role of tight closure. \r\nAssuming the program is successful, the following will be \r\ndemonstrated.  Ideals in regular local rings will be shown to be \r\nclosed.  The colon-capturing property will be proved.  The \r\npersistence property will be proved - an element in the closure of an \r\nideal will remain in the closure upon taking homomorphic images.  It \r\nshould also be shown that an element which is not in the closure of \r\nan ideal of a local ring will also not be in the closure when the \r\nideal is extended to the completion.  A successful project will have \r\nmajor ramifications for the homological understanding of mixed \r\ncharacteristic rings.  Among other things, this will imply the truth \r\nof the Direct Summand Conjecture.\r\n\tOne of the most fundamental subjects in algebra is the \r\nunderstanding of ideals and modules in local rings.  For those local \r\nrings which contain a field, tight closure has evolved as a way to \r\ngive a unified presentation - and a simplified one - for many of the \r\nknown properties of these objects.  As a natural byproduct, it has \r\nalso led to the discovery of new properties.  Understanding of local \r\nrings which do not contain a field has always lagged behind.  The \r\nprincipal investigator has proposed several closely related and \r\nhighly promising candidates to play the role of tight closure in the \r\nalternate setting.  In this project, the investigator will attempt to \r\ndetermine to what extent these new closures fill the void.",
