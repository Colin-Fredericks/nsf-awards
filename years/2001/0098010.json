 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to develop a web-based data system to enhance the visibility, networking, and professional success of minorities in the aquatic sciences. Specifically the PI will 1) create a centralized database to identify, characterize and eventually track minority undergraduate and graduate students in aquatic sciences, 2) implement an on-line Student Registry to allow students to network with each other and potential employers and graduate schools, 3) develop a minority webpage, housed on the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) website, containing links to student resources, 4) establish electronic distribution lists to facilitate communication within the minority aquatic science community.  These activities are necessary first steps to develop a coherent infrastructure to facilitate career development of underrepresented groups and establish networks within and beyond the community of minority aquatic science students and professionals. This system will have an important impact on the recruitment and retention of minority students in the aquatic sciences. The database, student registry, website and electronic distribution list will be important tools for a centralized tracking of minority programs, for distributing relevant information to minority students and scientists, and for recruiting students into graduate programs, and eventually, into faculty positions.",
