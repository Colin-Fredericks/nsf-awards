 "awd_abstract_narration": "For nearly 30 years, the National Science Foundation has provided support for EERI's Learning from Earthquakes (LFE) Program. These funds have enabled dozens of \r\nmultidisciplinary teams of researchers to carry out field investigations of significant \r\nearthquakes throughout the world, to observe and document effects on the natural and\r\nbuilt environment and resulting social, economic and policy impacts. Over the years the\r\nprogram has generated much new knowledge, leading to changes in practice and stimulating new research in each of the related fields.\r\n\r\nAs the US leader in post-earthquake investigations, EERI proposes significant\r\nrevisions to the LFE program to improve the overall coordination of NSF funded post-earthquake research efforts and  to incorporate new technologies to improve the collection and management of perishable data.  During the duration of this award, EERI  will coordinate post-earthquake investigations and improve the collection of perishable data in the first weeks after the earthquake.   Equipment will be acquired to enhance data collection and dissemination, training will be provided to team members, and a new program of small grants for follow up research in each of the disciplines that contribute to fundamental understanding of earthquake impacts will be initiated.   The LFE program will be integrated into the new Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). The LFE program will work with other agencies, organizations and NSF funded centers to reach diverse population of young people and students to stimulate their interest and involvement in science and engineering.   These and other activities  during the five year duration of this award will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the science and practice of earthquake engineering and the reduction of future earthquake losses.\r\n",
