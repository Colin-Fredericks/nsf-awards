The first part is research in conformal geometry. \r\nThe second part is a continuation of the research of \r\nformation and structure of singularity developed along \r\ngeometric flows. For conformal geometry part it takes surface \r\ntheory as the guideline of geometry in higher dimension. The \r\ntheory of conformally flat structure, in 4 dimension for \r\ninstance, has not been so successful because of the lack of \r\nright analytic tools, in our view point.  But it seems that \r\nsome replacement of complex analysis by theory of fourth \r\norder PDE is found to be very promising to study conformal \r\ngeometry. Therefore the  main thread in the part of this \r\nproposed research is to further develop conformal geometry \r\nwith those newly developed analytic tools. The proposed \r\nresearch takes a fundamental and comprehensive approach \r\nto the study of conformal geometry. It will significantly \r\nenhance and develop the conformal geometry.  It will also \r\nprovide some ways to better understand topology in 3 and 4 \r\ndimension. For the second part of this proposed project we \r\ncontinue our research in the study of formation and structure \r\nof singularity developed along the heat flow for harmonic \r\nmaps from surfaces. It is always very interesting to \r\nunderstand the behavior of the flow across the finite time \r\nsingularity. The better understanding of the finite time \r\nsingularity is believed to be very helpful in further \r\napplications of the theory of harmonic maps in topology and \r\nphysics.\r\n\r\nThe development of conformal geometry has a very long \r\nhistory and extensive literature. It is intimately tied with\r\nmodern physics as we have seen it in conformal field theory.\r\nParticularly it becomes even more important as the correspondence \r\nbetween quantum gravity and conformal field theory relatively\r\nwell understood in physics demands mathematical foundation, as\r\nwell as stimulates development in conformal geometry. Therefore\r\nit is clear that conformal geometry is an exciting frontier of\r\nmodern sciences. Singularities naturally develop in many \r\nmathematical models for almost everything in sciences. Singularity,\r\nfor instance, develop when some parameters in the physical system \r\napproach certain critical values, like Ginzburg-Landau model in \r\nsuper-conductivity and super-fluids. To study the singularities in \r\nevolution systems have been the major problems in the theory of \r\npartial differential equations with tremendous applications to \r\nmany physical and engineering fields. Any essential analytic \r\nprogress in this line will greatly attract attention from experts \r\nin all related areas. At last, but not the least, the proposed \r\nproject is also generating research activities to the benefit\r\nof the graduate program in the Department of Mathematics at UCSC.\r\n",
