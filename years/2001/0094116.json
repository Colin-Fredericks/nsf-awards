 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anna Krylov of the University of Southern California is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop electronic structure methods for excited states to treat spin-orbit coupling, non-adiabatic coupling, and spin-forbidden relaxation.  Applications include halomethyl radicals and singlet diradicals.  As part of her educational plan, Krylov will employ in her courses multimedia demonstrations, problem-solving software, and mini-research problems using a new computer lab specifically designed for the integration of teaching and research.\r\n\r\nAccurate theoretical modeling of electronically excited molecules is a current challenge, and is needed for a detailed understanding of chemical processes such as those found in the environment and in materials synthesis.  This research program is directly related to a teaching program at the undergraduate and graduate levels, which includes innovative uses of computer-based learning systems.",
