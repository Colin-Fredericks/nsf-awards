 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal logic is an extremely powerful and general conceptual tool that\r\ncan be made even more useful if it can be manipulated computationally.\r\nSince computational logic is often difficult to implement and\r\ncomputationally expensive, progress on automating it has lagged\r\nsomewhat.  However, the problems and their solutions are becoming\r\nbetter understood and computational power has continued to advance\r\nexponentially, so the possibility of developing practical\r\ncomputational solutions to many interesting logic problems is now\r\npotentially solvable.\r\n\r\nThere are three themes to the project: computational logic components,\r\neducational applications, and systems applications.  The first theme\r\nencompasses both the theoretical research and implementation work\r\nnecessary to develop practical software components for manipulating\r\nlogical representations at several levels of abstraction, including\r\ndecision procedures for fragments of first order logic and automated\r\ndeduction for first-order logic.  The second theme involves the use of\r\ncomputational logic for computer-assisted analysis of designs in three\r\napplication areas of critical importance: networking, hybrid systems,\r\nand computer security.  The third theme is the development and use in\r\nthe classroom of instructional courseware for mathematical concepts\r\nrelevant to computer science. This work is in collaboration with\r\nStanford's Educational Program for Gifted Children (EPGY).\r\n\r\nThe impact of this work follows from making computational logic\r\naccessible and available.  Computational logic components will make it\r\neasier to construct sophisticated software applications, by providing\r\npowerful off-the-shelf building blocks for solving problems that would\r\nnot otherwise be tractable.  Improved analysis tools and techniques\r\nwill result in superior system designs achieved faster and at lower\r\ncost.  Instructional software will enhance the sophistication and\r\nproblem-solving abilities of computer science students.",
