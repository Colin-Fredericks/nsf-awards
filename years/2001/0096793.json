US PI David Myrold, Oregon State University and Indian co-PI Arvind Misra, North Eastern Hill University, Shillong will study the molecular diversity of Frankia that nodulate several actinorhizal plants in the eastern Himalayas.  This research extends previous studies on the molecular diversity of Frankia, an important N2 -fixing bacteria genus, to include strains from the montane region of India.  The objectives are to: 1) assess the molecular diversity of Frankia as a function of host plant and geographical location, and 2) use sequence information to add to the current phylogenetic tree of Frankia.               \r\n\r\nScope:  This work builds on the joint expertise of the PIs in using molecular methods to study Frankia.  Research results will complement studies done in North America and Oceania, which have yielded differing results regarding the relative importance of host plant species or environmental factors as determinants of Frankia diversity.  Practically, this research may prove useful in attempts to use actinorhizal plants in revegetation and restoration efforts, as they are important early colonizers of disturbed sites. This award is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Environmental Biology. \r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n",
