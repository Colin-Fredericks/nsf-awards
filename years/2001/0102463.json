Their unifying theme is the\r\nautomorphisms of 3-dimensional manifolds, including homotopy\r\nequivalences, diffeomorphisms, and isometries. Specific projects\r\ninclude: the Generalized Smale Conjecture for elliptic\r\n3-manifolds, the isomorphism problem for diffeomorphism groups of\r\nelliptic 3-manifolds, generalization of the Abikoff-Maskit\r\nstructure theory for Kleinian groups using topological methods,\r\ninvestigation of free actions of finite groups on orientable\r\nhandlebodies using Nielsen equivalence classes of generating\r\nsets, and fibration theorems for spaces of fiber-preserving\r\ndiffeomorphisms of manifolds having fiberings and singular\r\nfiberings.\r\n\r\nThe primary mathematical constructs that will be investigated are\r\n3-manifolds, which are geometric objects locally modeled on the\r\n3-dimensional spatial structure of the physical universe, and\r\ngroups, which are algebraic systems with an operation akin to the\r\naddition of ordinary numbers. Some of the ongoing work has\r\nalready been applied in the theoretical physics of gravitation,\r\nbut most of its applications are entirely within pure\r\nmathematics. The guiding philosophy of most of the research is to\r\nuse topological and geometric structure of 3-manifolds to\r\nunderstand groups of symmetries and other kinds of\r\nautomorphisms. Groups of automorphisms of a mathematical object\r\noften exhibit their own interesting structure. A classic example\r\nof this is the finite-dimensional vector spaces. They are rather\r\nsimple objects, but their automorphism groups, the general linear\r\ngroups, have a rich structure and find wide-ranging uses in\r\nmathematics and physics. Within the proposed work, an example is\r\nthe 3-manifolds called handlebodies. These are among the simplest\r\n3-manifolds to describe topologically, but their groups of\r\nsymmetries are subtle and varied. In fact, any finite group can\r\nbe a group of symmetries of some handlebody, and the number of\r\ndistinct ways that a group can act as symmetries on a given\r\nhandlebody can be quite large. A different use of the philosophy\r\ninvolves Kleinian groups, which are discrete groups of symmetries\r\nof 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. Each Kleinian group produces a\r\nquotient 3-manifold, and one of the projects uses the topological\r\nstructure of these quotient 3-manifolds to give an algebraic\r\nclassification of Kleinian groups.\r\n",
