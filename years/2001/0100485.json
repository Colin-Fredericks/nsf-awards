 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lenstra\r\n0100485\r\n\r\nThe proposed research belongs to the interface between number theory and\r\nalgebra. It is inspired by problems that come up in an algorithmic\r\ncontext and in arithmetic algebraic geometry. Altogether, the proposal\r\ncontains 19 problem sets: five from Algorithmic Number Theory, three\r\nfrom Algebraic Number Theory, five from Commutative and Homological\r\nAlgebra, three from the Geometry of Numbers, and three from Group Theory.\r\nThe collection has been composed with a view towards assisting the\r\ninvestigator's many current and future graduate students in choosing\r\nsuitable thesis subjects. The problems have the appealing features of\r\nappearing to be feasible without being trivial, and of being specific\r\nwithout being narrow. They belong to mainstream areas that will also\r\nserve the students after obtaining their degrees. Of the nineteen\r\nproblem sets, the following two are both easy to formulate and\r\nattractive. The first is the development of an algorithmic theory of\r\nquadratic forms over rings and fields of arithmetic interest. A typical\r\nquestion is how quickly one can find a representation of a positive\r\ninteger as a sum of four squares. Or: it is known that any odd unimodular\r\nindefinite inner product space over the ring of integers is\r\ndiagonalizable; given the symmetric matrix that defines the inner\r\nproduct, how quickly can one find the change of basis that diagonalizes\r\nthe form? A first investigation shows that one may expect a wide spectrum\r\nof answers to the algorithmic questions in this area, displaying all the\r\nriches of number-theoretic algorithms. The second is giving class number\r\nestimates for orders in number fields. What is a good upper bound for the\r\nnumber of equivalence classes of fractional ideals of a giving order,\r\nexpressed as a function of the degree and the discriminant of the order?\r\nAnd can one find better estimates for orders that have nice properties,\r\nsuch as being Gorenstein? This type of question is of importance in the\r\ntheory of abelian varieties, and one will need to apply techniques coming\r\nfrom commutative algebra, abelian group theory, combinatorics, and\r\nelementary analytic number theory.\r\n\r\nIn order to place the project in perspective one may consider the recent\r\ndevelopment of number theory. Present day number theory differs in two\r\nimportant respects from number theory twenty five years ago, namely in\r\nthe roles played by algorithms and computers, and by algebraic geometry.\r\nIt has been found that algorithmic number theory has important\r\napplications, notably in cryptography, and in addition number theorists\r\nhave learned how to use computers for their research. Inventing good\r\ncomputational methods for number-theoretic problems has thus become of\r\ncentral importance. One of the principal investigator's strengths is in\r\nthe interaction between theory and practice, on the one hand using recent\r\ntheoretical advances for algorithmic purposes and on the other hand\r\nderiving purely mathematical inspiration from the problems suggested by\r\nthe applications. At the other end of the spectrum, knowledge of\r\nalgebraic geometry has become a standard requirement for aspiring number\r\ntheorists. Virtually every breakthrough in number theory over the past\r\nfew decades, including Andrew Wiles's work on Fermat's Last Theorem, has\r\ninvolved arithmetic algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry depends on a\r\nbroad spectrum of techniques from algebra and algebraic number theory,\r\nand gives rise to an unending array of tantalizing questions in those\r\nareas, of which the project studies a sample. What is maybe the most\r\nexciting of all, is the way in which arithmetic algebraic geometry and\r\nalgorithmic number theory are presently being tied together, both in the\r\napplication of geometric objects to cryptography and in the application\r\nof algorithmic techniques to investigate geometric objects in number\r\ntheory. The project will be carried out by the investigator's graduate\r\nstudents, many of whom will, as experience shows, acquire combined\r\nexpertise in these two areas, which is a very precious but fairly rare\r\ncommodity.\r\n\r\n",
