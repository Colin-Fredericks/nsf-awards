The project is collecting and analyzing data and information on the subject, will develop suggested actions for interested agencies and other organizations to take, and will establish means to collect the data and information on an ongoing basis so that it will be on hand as problems arise in the future.  The study group consists of twelve to fifteen qualified individuals selected from various areas of the computing research community.\r\n",
