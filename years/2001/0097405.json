 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an REU Site in Psychology at City University of New York, Baruch College.  Sixteen students, who attend colleges in New York City, will participate in the Site as a paid research assistant for three, 12-week semesters.   The REU undergraduates will join existing research teams and contribute to ongoing empirical research programs in areas of applied and basic psychology.  Students will also propose and complete projects of their own under the direct supervision of a research scientist.  The REU project itself will be an experiment in research education evaluated with outcome data.  The program will: (1) prepare students for advanced graduate training in scientific psychology and ultimately for careers in academic and applied settings; (2) identify early promising minority students and prepare them for careers in scientific psychology; (3) increase psychological scientists' interests in minority issues and concerns as research topics; and (4) develop a CUNY pipeline to provide a pool of talented and diverse students to become the research scientists of the future.  Each REU student will join a research team working in an area that matches the student's expressed interests.  Each team will focus in one area of psychology, planning and executing studies with the intention of presenting professional papers and submitting research reports to quality peer-reviewed journals.  Students will choose one of four ongoing research teams: (a) The psychology and law team; (b) the industrial/organizational team; (c) the social psychology team; and (d) the educational psychology team.  Students may also work with a faculty member whose research does not fit one of the four research teams.  Students will participate in the entire research process.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
