 "awd_abstract_narration": "CDMA systems have achieved great commercial success in wireless communications since the first\r\nIS-95 system was deployed in Seattle in 1994. In fact, most of the future wireless communication\r\nsystems will be using CDMA technology. Yet, as far as reaching the great potential of CDMA in terms\r\nof higher system capacity, lower bit error rate, and lower packet loss rate, the problem of demodulation in\r\nthe presence of multiple access interference remains as a significant bottleneck for all CDMA systems.\r\nTo solve this multiple access interference problem, researchers and engineers have worked since the early\r\n1980's on so-called multiuser detectors (MUD). Unfortunately, thus far none of the multiuser detectors\r\nhas been implemented in a real CDMA system, because of the prohibitive complexity of these structures.\r\n     There are two major factors that contribute to this situation. First, CDMA systems must use long\r\nspreading sequences for several practical reasons, whereas multiuser detectors must use short spreading\r\nsequences. Second, the complexity of even the simplest multiuser detector is still too great to be\r\nimplemented in the fastest electronics, for all but the smallest of data rates. In this work, we propose to\r\naddress both of these problems in a collaborative effort. The collaboration will be organized so that Dr.\r\nQingchong Liu of Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, will initially focus on the first objective,\r\nand Dr. David W. Matolak of Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, will initially (and concurrently) focus on\r\nthe second objective. Results will be exchanged frequently, and meetings will be held quarterly. After\r\nsome early progress, our collaboration will grow closer as we combine the work objectives and consider\r\nsystem (transmitter and receiver) performance.\r\n     We propose first to extend some recent results obtained for the construction of long spreading\r\nsequences from short sequences. This can be termed the system objective. These new sequences will\r\nbe appropriate for both conventional CDMA systems and for multiuser detectors. This method was\r\ninvented by one of us and has been implemented in possibly the fastest wireless network running at\r\n400Mbps in the Spaceway system by Hughes Electronics. It has significantly reduced receiver\r\ncomplexity and cost, and gives essentially optimum performance. By measuring sequence correlations at\r\nmultiple levels, the method provides new insights on sequence design and tremendously reduces\r\ncomplexity in signal design and detection for broadband wireless communications. This method has the\r\npotential to help bridge a gap between current CDMA systems and multiuser detectors.\r\n     We also propose to study reduced complexity multiuser receivers from the perspective of reduced\r\ncomplexity trellis search techniques, combined with one of the most promising MUD receiver structures,\r\nin a partitioned manner. This can be termed the receiver objective. The MUD receiver of interest is\r\nthe minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver, which is attractive for its good performance and\r\nmodest complexity. The partitioning approach will aim to share the detection tasks between the MMSE\r\nfront-end and the reduced-complexity trellis processor. These receivers will make use of the new\r\nspreading sequences specified for use in future 3 rd and 4 th -generation CDMA wireless communication\r\nsystem standards, and the multiple level sequences developed in the system objective. The reduced\r\ncomplexity trellis search techniques will explore use of the analogous techniques researched for\r\nequalization, but not fully applied to the problem of CDMA multiuser detection. Our goal for these two\r\nobjectives is to create a fundamental bridge to connect the existing and planned CDMA systems with the\r\ntheoretical multiuser detectors so that the bottleneck of the multiple access interference problem in\r\nCDMA systems can be surmounted.\r\n     Both objectives of this proposed work will employ analysis, followed by computer simulations.\r\nBoth objectives will also require the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students. The modeling\r\nwork will aim to reconcile theory with practical implementation and thus provide engineering education\r\nin the best sense: connecting principles and practice. Training students in both system design and\r\nreceiver design for CDMA will also naturally be valuable to the wireless industry. In addition, the\r\nresearch will provide material for inclusion in several new graduate courses, and in undergraduate design\r\nprojects, at both universities.",
