 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CAREER proposal will develop a framework to characterize durability of composites in civil infrastructure by integrating fiber-optic embedded sensors with damage mechanics models and life prediction methods.  To tackle this problem, a combined analytical and experimental methodology is proposed, as follows: 1) Integrate embedded sensors in composites fabrication by VARTM and filament winding; 2) Implement strain, temperature, moisture and chemical degradation fiber-optic sensors; 3) Evaluate the embedded sensor system with controlled damage; 4) Develop a damage mechanics model and life-prediction methodology for durability analysis based on interrogating senors; 5) Assess reliability of sensor data and scale to composite structures (bridge decks and pipe walls); and 6) Validate the durability methodology and synthesize into a health-monitoring protocol.  The educational approach is two-fold encompassing student recruitment and advanced graduate education.  First, and educational collaboration is being developed with an applied technology center at a high school in Maine.  The objective is to introduce high school students to the engineering experience by collaborating with civil engineering juniors in a composite bridge design and fabrication project.  Second, an advanced graduate course on composites in civil engineering will be developed.",
