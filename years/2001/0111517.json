The PI, Stephen Nelson, is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geology.  He and his colleagues in the department, Alan Mayo, Ron Harris, and Matthew Mabey, their students and collaborators will use this facility in support of hydrology, paleoclimate, and tectonic studies.  In addition to NSF, BYU is sharing 40% of the cost for this system.  The counters and sample preparation facilities will be housed in a laboratory that already contains vacuum lines and a Finnigan Deltaplus isotope ratio mass spectrometer for stable isotope analysis. These counters will be used primarily to make measurements of 14C and 3H activity in water and 14C activity in organic matter and carbonate materials.  One low level and one ultra low level counter will be acquired to facilitate both routine counting as well as counting of low activity materials.  Electrolysis cells will be constructed to permit 3H enrichment where necessary.  A majority of the work conducted in this facility will support studies of ground water systems, paleoclimate studies, estimates tectonic uplift rates, and fault slip rate investigations by BYU geologists and their collaborators.  Other departments at BYU provided substantial support for the facility, and it is anticipated that this facility will permit faculty and students from other departments to expand and augment their research capabilities.  The facility will be unique to Utah and it is expected to support additional collaborative studies in the geosciences with colleagues in Utah and nearby states.\r\n***\r\n",
