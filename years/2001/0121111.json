However, though we have learned much from these studies, there is still much that we do not know.  This became alarmingly apparent upon examining the initial phase of the annotated genome where it was found that over two thirds of Drosophila genes had not been identified from prior studies.  Further, though numerous genetic screens have been completed, there are still many gaps in our understanding, even in well-studied processes.  There may be several reasons for this; one significant reason is that some genes are refractory to analysis by conventional genetic screens because of genetic redundancy.  Given that genes with redundant or overlapping functions are likely to have important roles, and that there may be numerous cases of overlapping gene functions in Drosophila, it is essential that we develop methods to detect and to test the function of potentially redundant genes, yet a systematic method to identify redundant genes has not been employed in the past.\r\n\r\nDr. Mahaffey will conduct a screen to identify potentially redundant gene pairs functioning during Drosophila embryonic development.  The scheme involves first identifying potential candidates by similarity, then cloning and using in situ hybridization to determine if there is overlap in expression.  Finally, RNA interference will be used to determine whether or not the gene pairs have overlapping roles.  To test the validity of this method, Dr. Mahaffey will initially select candidate gene pairs that encode zinc finger proteins.  It is important to note that the design of this project is not limited to Drosophila; it should be useful in studies of redundant genes in other organisms (certainly; C. elegans, and in other model organisms using morpholino antisense procedures).\r\n",
