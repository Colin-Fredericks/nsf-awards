The introductions of stable \r\norbits and stable action-manifolds follow closely the idea of investigator's earlier work on stable degeneration of polygons. \r\nNote that just like a stable polygon is a collection of ordinary polygons, a stable orbit is a collection of ordinary orbits. The connections from stable orbits and stable action-manifolds to the corresponding Chow cycles are to be established by moment map. \r\nNext, he also attempts to interpret the Uhlenbeck compactification \r\nas a topological analogy of a Chow quotient.  In the same vein, \r\nthe investigator proposes a moduli problem for stable tuples of homogeneous polynomials of a fixed total degree in two variables.\r\nThe investigator anticipates that the resulting moduli space is \r\nthe smooth compactification of the variety of holomorphic maps \r\nfrom one-dimensional projective space to n-dimensional projective \r\nspace as constructed in his earlier work on blowups along \r\narrangements of subvarieties.\r\n\r\nThis proposal deals with the fruitful interaction between \r\ntopology and algebraic geometry. Algebraic Geometry as a field \r\nis both old and new.  It is old because of its long history, \r\nit is new because it is still vigorously developing as one of \r\nthe main stream mathematics. It has numerous beautiful connections \r\nand applications to other subjects. Roughly speaking, Algebraic Geometry studies spaces which are locally the set of solutions\r\nof some polynomial equations. Topology is another amazing \r\nmathematical achievement of this century and is the study of \r\nflexible geometrical properties of spaces.  One of central \r\nproblems in algebraic geometry is the classification of spaces \r\nin algebraic geometry. A key idea here is to treat every type of \r\nspaces as a point in a \"master set\" which is technically called \r\na moduli space. This paper focus on the topological and \r\ngeometrical aspects of moduli spaces. The proposal consists\r\nof some new ideas and methods which are substantially based \r\nupon investigator's earlier papers, among others.\r\n\r\n",
