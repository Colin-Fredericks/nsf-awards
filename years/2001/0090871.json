 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will seek to develop new bond-forming methodology by investigating the reactivity and selectivity of nucleophilic carbenes.  The synthetic applications of this novel methodology will be illustrated by synthesis of several polycyclic compounds.  Efforts to develop solid support-based synthesis using nucleophilic carbenes as key elements are also planned.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Professor James H. Rigby of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University.  Professor Rigby's studies are directed towards the development of new bond-forming reactions with precise control over the detailed three-dimensional structure (stereochemistry).  This new synthetic methodology will add to the roster of bond-forming reactions available to the synthetic organic chemist and is most likely to be useful in the preparation of pharmaceutical and/or agricultural agents.  Students trained in this area will learn skills to solve problems pertaining to synthetic organic chemistry in the specialty chemical or pharmaceutical industries.",
