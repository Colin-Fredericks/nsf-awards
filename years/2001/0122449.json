Establishing the framework for the NVO is the first step towards a system that can provide seamless integration of data-intensive resources in astronomy.  When fully implemented, the NVO will serve as an engine of discovery for astronomy.  Large scale surveys of the sky from space and the ground are being initiated at wavelengths from radio to x-ray, generating vast amounts of high quality, irreplaceable data.  The potential for scientific discovery afforded by these new surveys is enormous.  Entirely new and unexpected scientific results of major significance will emerge from the combined use of the resulting datasets, science that would not be possible from such sets used singly.  Their large size and complexity require tools and structures to discover the complex phenomena encoded within them.  \r\n\r\nThe NVO framework will be built by coordinating the diverse efforts already in existence and provide a focus for the development of capabilities that do not yet exist.  The NVO will act as an enabling and coordinating entity to foster the development of further tools, protocols, and collaborations necessary to realize the full scientific potential of large astronomical datasets in the coming decade.  The components of the NVO include not only the archives, but also metadata standards, a standardized data access layer, query and computing services, and data mining applications.  The new capabilities of the NVO will be essential to realize the full value of the tera/petabyte datasets that are in hand or soon to be created.  Rapid querying of multiple large-scale catalogs, establishment of statistical correlations, discovery of new data patterns and temporal variations, and confrontation with sophisticated numerical simulations are all avenues for new science that will be made possible through the NVO.  Future surveys will have well defined templates available to enable them to publish their data more easily.  The NVO, through its rich content and special portals designed for students, teachers and the public, will have major impact on a wide range of science education and public outreach projects.  The goal of the NVO is international in scope and the project will coordinate its development activities with the international community, to assure that the end result is a Global Virtual Observatory.\r\n\r\n",
