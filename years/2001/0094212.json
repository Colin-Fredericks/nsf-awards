 "awd_abstract_narration": "These scholarships support low- income students who are majoring in math, computer science, or any engineering discipline. The overarching goal of the program is to help low- income students in the targeted disciplines to successfully complete a stage within the degree program which is documented as a point of unusually high attrition at the Unviersity of Rochester. The program aggressively supports and retains low-income students within the first and second years, leading up to the declaration of the major during the second semester of sophomore year. The Program seeks at least a 50% participation rate for women and members of minority groups. \r\nUnique learning communities of small groups of first and second year students are established in each of the targeted disciplines. Each learning community is guided by a graduate student, and meets weekly for study, enrichment activities, and group- building events. The full group of scholarship recipients meets on a monthly basis with members of the Steering Committee. Each student recieves intensive support services aimed at keeping the student in the major.",
