 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broadband satellite systems have an important role to play in the delivery of multimedia applications.\r\nIn this proposal we concentrate on GEO (geo-synchronous) based satellite networks. GEO based systems\r\ndeliver continuous services to a specific region with a single satellite. They play an ever-increasing role in\r\nthe public and private Internets, due mostly to their large geographic coverage, inherent broadcast\r\ncapabilities and fast deployment. They are attractive to support data, audio and video streaming; bulk data\r\ntransfer such as software updates or dissemination of Web caches; and applications involving limited\r\ninteractivity such as distance learning. They are also attractive to provide broadband access to users who are\r\neither beyond the reach of the terrestrial network, or have particular needs for broadcast/multicast\r\napplications or fast deployment.\r\n     We will focus in this proposal on Next Generation Satellite Networks that comprise one (or more) GEO\r\nsatellite with some form of onboard processing (OBP). Two of the essential issues regarding broadband\r\nsatellite network are 1) end-to-end resource management, and 2) network availability.\r\n     Resource management is key to deliver acceptable Quality of Service (QoS) to services while providing\r\nadequate efficiency. It is central to any satellite system, be it a bent pipe or an onboard processing (OBP)\r\nsatellite system. Indeed, in order to offer flexibility and efficiency to bursty applications, the capacity of the\r\nmultiple access uplink has to be managed using some bandwidth on demand (BoD) scheme.\r\n     We define network availability as the ability for the network to offer some level of services to some\r\napplications even during degraded periods. Most of the next generation systems will be using the Ka band,\r\nwhich is known for its very difficult transmission characteristics. Many solutions involving variable rate\r\ncoding, power control, and/or variable modulation have been proposed to make this band friendly to\r\nbroadband applications. This proposal will not study directly those layer 1/2 mechanisms but rather study\r\nhow their use affects BoD and more generally end-to-end resource management.\r\n     Hence the final objective of our proposal is to design and evaluate end-to-end resource management\r\nfor the Next Generation of Satellite Networks that interworks efficiently with the range of solutions\r\nproposed by the air-interface designer to improve the availability of the transmission. In particular, we\r\nwant to understand the trade-off in terms of efficiency and system complexity.\r\n     To achieve this ultimate objective, we will study:\r\n1. Static end-to-end resource management for large GEO OBP systems. The term static refers to the\r\nfact that the coding and modulation are fixed. The focus here will be to develop and evaluate\r\nmechanisms that are scalable, robust, flexible and protect the OBP (i.e., the switch in the sky). We\r\nwill build upon our extensive previous work in the domain where we developed scalable, robust,\r\nflexible end-to-end resource management for large GEO bent pipe systems.\r\n2. Network availability. One of the main concerns of satellite network designers is to offer an\r\n\"appropriate\" level of service to the users in spite of the difficult characteristics of the frequency\r\nband. However it is not very clear what is meant by \"an appropriate level of service\" since it may\r\nvary from a user to another or from an application to another. Most of the studies have focussed on\r\nlink availability without taking into account the networking and applications aspects. We believe\r\nthat coordinating the lower layers with the upper layers will give us a flexible and cost-efficient\r\nsolution allowing the system to deliver different levels of network availability to the users\r\ndepending on their need and their willingness to pay. Hence network availability can be seen as a\r\nQoS requirement and should be defined and studied that way.\r\n3. Designing end-to-end resource management for a system comprising layer 1/2 mechanisms to\r\ndynamically improve the uplink availability so as to offer flexible and cost efficient services to the\r\nusers. We need to propose solutions and to evaluate them to ensure that the increase in complexity\r\nis worthwhile in terms of efficiency. We will also propose and study some dynamic pricing schemes\r\nintegrated with the BoD so as to allow the users to indicate their willingness to pay for capacity in a\r\ncontext where the total available capacity is variable due to link impairment.",
