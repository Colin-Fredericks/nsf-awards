The efficiency of arsenic uptake by Brake fern suggests the cost-effective use of this plant for the remediation of arsenic contaminated soils. This research focuses on elemental interactions of arsenic with calcium and phosphorus, plant biochemical responses under arsenic stresses, speciation and characterization of arsenic in the plant using analytical, microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, and microbe-root-plant-arsenic interactions.  Arsenic hyperaccumulation characteristics in Brake fern growing in soils of different arsenic concentrations will be investigated using arsenic spiked soils. The impacts of P (increases arsenic availability yet competes with arsenic uptake) and Ca (increases plant arsenic uptake and translocation) on arsenic accumulation, and biochemical responses of Brake fern to elevated arsenic (detoxification) will be examined.  Also, the beneficial effects of mycorrhizal fungi for enhancing arsenic accumulation by Brake fern will be explored. This is a collaborative research project between the University of Florida (0132089) and Northwestern University (0132114).  These two awards were made pursuant to the Joint Program on Phytoremediation, 2001-STAR-C1 (EPA, NSF, ONR, SERDP).\r\n",
