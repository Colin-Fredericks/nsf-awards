 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Kinetic City After School\" is a two-year project that will produce a web-based after-school program for children ages 9-11.  The on-line adventure will enable users to enter a virtual universe where a computer virus (Deep Delete) systematically attacks a new area of science each month (analogous to one of the 12 Project 2061 Benchmarks for Science Literacy).  As students battle the virus, they learn Benchmarks learning goals.  Each unit invites children to think about the problem, take action and reflect on their experience.  The activities accommodate different learning styles and are supplemented by live audio chats with scientists and a self-assessment enables students to earn Kinetic City Power Points.  Power Points can be donated to after school programs without computers and Internet access.  These sites may in turn, exchange their accumulated Power Points to obtain computers, Internet service and a site license for \"Kinetic City After School.\"  Although the program is web-based, most of the activity extensions are done off-line.  \"Kinetic City After School\" will be introduced to after-school sites with a two-day training workshop, with follow-up via phone meetings and site visits.  Supporting materials will include a Leader Guide, Journal and Kinetic City Home Crew activity pages for use in the home.",
