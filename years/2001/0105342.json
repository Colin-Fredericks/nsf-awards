Suciu\r\n  \r\nThis project is centered around a topological study\r\nof complex hyperplane arrangements, with a view towards\r\nfinding effectively computable invariants of their complements.\r\nThe goal is to decide whether a given invariant is\r\ncombinatorially determined, and, if it is, to express\r\nit explicitly in terms of the intersection lattice of\r\nthe arrangement.  An important role is played by the\r\njumping loci for cohomology with coefficients in local\r\nsystems, and the related resonance varieties.\r\nThese varieties have emerged as a central object of study.\r\nThey provide deep information about the homotopy theory\r\nof the complement of an arrangement, as well as\r\na bridge relating various invariants, in often unexpected ways.\r\nAnother key role is played by the rational-homotopy\r\nnotion of formality, which provides the underlying\r\nexplanation for many of the encountered phenomena.\r\nWhenever possible, the study is done in a more general setting,\r\nwhich includes certain types of subspace arrangements,\r\nboth real and complex, as well as certain links in the 3-sphere.\r\nSuch a point of view enlarges the range of applicability of the\r\nresults, and helps explain what is really peculiar to complex\r\nhyperplane arrangements.\r\n\r\nIn its simplest manifestation, an arrangement is a\r\nfinite collection of lines in the plane.  These lines\r\ncut the plane into components, and understanding the topology\r\nof the complement amounts to counting those components.\r\nIn the case of lines in the complex plane (or, for that\r\nmatter, hyperplanes in complex n-space), the complement\r\nis connected, and its topology (as reflected, for example,\r\nin its homotopy groups) is much more interesting.\r\nThe theory of arrangements is a relatively new branch\r\nof mathematics, started in the 1960's with a study\r\nof the classifying space for the pure braid group.\r\nThe theory has developed at the interface between\r\ntopology, algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.\r\nHyperplane arrangements, and the closely related\r\nconfiguration spaces, are used in numerous areas,\r\nincluding robotics, multi-dimensional billiards,\r\ngraphics, molecular biology, computer vision, and\r\ndatabases for representing the space of all possible\r\nstates of a system characterized by many degrees\r\nof freedom. There are also deep connections between\r\nhyperplane arrangements, knot theory, hypergeometric\r\nfunctions, conformal field theory, and quantum cohomology.\r\n",
