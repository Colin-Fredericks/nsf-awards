 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn recent years experimental methods have become an indispensable component of\r\neconomic research. Laboratory experiments are used to test economic theory, to discover\r\nthe properties of alternative institutional rules, and to assist in the design of new market\r\ninstitutions. A few examples are the design of the FCC spectrum auctions, the design of a\r\nnew market institution for matching medical interns with hospitals, and the design of new\r\nmarket institutions for the deregulated allocation of electrical power.\r\nLaboratory experiments in economics and game theory rest on the premise of\r\n\"transference\", or\"parallelism:\" the assumption that the behavior of subjects in the\r\nlaboratory will be the same as the behavior of people in the actual strategic encounters\r\nthat the experiments are designed to help us understand. If laboratory subjects behave\r\ndifferently, for whatever reason, this would present a challenge for experimental\r\nresearch: theory that failed in the laboratory might perform well in the field, or vice-versa;\r\nthe properties of a trading rule in the laboratory might be different from its\r\nproperties in the field; and trading rules designed in the laboratory, and which work well\r\nthere, may perform poorly in the field.\r\nRecent evidence suggests that the behavior of people with expertise in certain kinds of\r\nstrategic situations may be different than the behavior of people who are \"inovices,\" as\r\nlaboratory subjects typically are, with little or no experience in the given strategic\r\ncontext. This evidence includes recent research by Walker and Wooders in which leading\r\nprofessional tennis players were found to make strategic decisions that were more in\r\naccord with the theory of strategic behavior than the decisions of laboratory subjects who\r\nhad no prior experience in the strategic situation.\r\nThe research project consists of experiments designed to study whether, and how, the\r\nstrategic behavior of experts differs from the behavior of less experienced and less expert\r\ndecision makers. The experiments will be conducted primarily on the World Wide Web,\r\nand they will be designed specifically to provide for the development and identification\r\nof varying levels of expertise and the means to identify differences in behavior that are\r\nassociated with differing levels of expertise.\r\nThe results of this research promise to provide a better understanding of the role of\r\nexpertise in strategic behavior and of the strategic contexts in which parallelism can be\r\nexpected to hold, and to help identify the settings in which Web-based experiments are\r\nsuperior and those in which laboratory experiments are likely to be superior.",
