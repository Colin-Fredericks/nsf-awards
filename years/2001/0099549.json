Issues that will \r\nbe studied involve:\r\n(i) finding algorithms to compute the diffusion term of\r\nthe optimal wealth/hedging process, and related questions\r\nabout Martingale Representation Property and Malliavin\r\nCalculus;\r\n(ii) questions on maximizing  Stochastic Differential\r\nUtility and connections to Forward-Backward Stochastic \r\nDifferential Equations and problems of \r\nincomplete/asymmetric information;\r\n(iii)  analytical and numerical methods for finding optimal\r\nportfolio/consumption investment for retirement, in general \r\ndiffusion models;\r\n(iv) theory of utility maximization/risk minimization in\r\ngeneral semimartingale models of markets with frictions;\r\n(v) filtering and calibration of stochastic volatility models;\r\n(vi) optimal design of executive compensation.\r\nIt is expected that tools from stochastic analysis and martingale\r\ntheory, convex duality theory, functional analysis, stochastic \r\ncontrol, Monte Carlo/simulation methods, will prove valuable \r\nin the resolution of  these questions, sometimes requiring \r\ndevelopment of new tools, thus enhancing the understanding of \r\nboth the theoretical and applied aspects of these fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe optimal portfolio selection and  consumption selection \r\nis the theory that provides answers to the question of how \r\nto allocate money between investing in different assets in \r\nfinancial markets, and consuming it in order to buy various goods.  \r\nThe theory has been developed in almost full generality by now. \r\nHowever, it depends on a mathematical model of the markets, \r\nand our ability to estimate the model parameters.  For example, \r\ncorrect pricing of complex financial contracts, such as exotic \r\noptions, depends on how well we can estimate the \"volatility\" \r\n(riskiness) of the stock on which the option is written.\r\nOne of the problems we propose to study is how to do this \r\nestimation by using observed stock prices.  Similarly, the \r\nproblem of actually  computing the corresponding  optimal \r\ntrading strategies has not been resolved in general.  The \r\nalgorithms that are commonly used today typically do not work well\r\nin more complex and realistic models for financial markets, that \r\nare becoming a standard, due to the increased sophistication of \r\nmarket modelers.  Thus, it is important to explore new analytical \r\nand computational methods for finding optimal trading strategies, \r\nsome of which are suggested in this proposal.  Similar methods are \r\nsuggested for exploring important problem of how a firm should  \r\ncompensate its executive so that the resulting behavior of the \r\nexecutive is optimal.\r\n\r\n",
