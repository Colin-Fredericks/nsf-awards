 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nInnovations in computer and communications technologies are making it easier\r\nand faster to do things but also bring with them new security risks.  This\r\nproposal is concerned with cryptography, which is an important component in the\r\nprovision of security in the electronic world.  A cryptographer designs\r\nschemes, or protocols, for tasks such as data authentication, data encryption,\r\nidentification, and key distribution which are implemented and incorporated\r\ninto the computer systems and are responsible for imbuing data and transactions\r\nwith attributes like privacy and integrity.  Providing high-quality,\r\ncost-effective cryptography is a challenge because cryptographic protocols are\r\neasy to specify but hard to analyze, and notorious for containing bugs that\r\ntake a long time to be discovered.  The goal of this project is to identify and\r\ntackle practical problems in cryptographic protocol design and analysis based\r\non theoretical techniques, delivering real-world usable protocols backed by\r\ntheoretically sound security analyses, and thereby impact implementation, usage\r\nand standardization of cryptography in the computer and communications\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe specific research proposed here is on three broad topics: anonymity,\r\nauthenticated encryption and asymmetric identification protocols.  The term\r\n``anonymity'' is broadly used to refer to issues regarding keeping private the\r\nidentities of parties engaging in electronic transactions.  The researchers\r\nwill investigate anonymity for mix-nets, anonymous encryption, and blind\r\nsignatures. In each case they will look at both foundational issues such as\r\ndefinitions, and then the possibility of practical, proven secure\r\nconstructions. In the authenticated encryption domain they will investigate the\r\nsecurity of the popular encrypt-with-redundancy paradigm.  Finally they will\r\nconsider the design of identification protocols secure against attackers having\r\nthe powerful capability of resetting the internal state of the client machine\r\nand also seek improved transformations of identification protocols to digital\r\nsignature schemes.",
