We are studying the Grauert\r\ntube construction for its rigidity and uniquesness properties for\r\nlarge (maximal) radius or domain, and examining whether this point of\r\nview adds to old questions in representation theory and automorphic forms.\r\nSecond, we will study a Kaehler-Einstein version of Min-Oo's rigidity\r\ntheorem which we conjecture to hold. We will continue work with\r\nX. Gong on Levi flat hypersurfaces with singularities, especially\r\nalgebraic ones with isolated singularities. Their importance is\r\nsuggested by recent work of Siu and others proving the conjecture of\r\nCamacho on the non-existence of smooth, Levi-flat hypersurfaces in\r\nthe complex projective plane. Finally we propose to study the rigidity\r\nof special classes of Schubert cycles on flag manifolds, following\r\nupon the work of the PI's former student M. Walters and,\r\nindependently, R. Bryant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal addresses several questions in complex analysis and\r\ngeometry. Most people are familiar with Descartes' analytic geometry\r\nfrom high school: in most respects, this line of investigation is the\r\nmodern descendent of those early ideas. We will study the relationship\r\nbetween a geometric locus, sometimes defined by equations as in\r\nDescartes' original case, and its analytic properties, those\r\nproperties influenced by the calculus of Newton and Leibniz. In\r\nparticular we study a complexification of geometric locus, that is, we\r\nadd \"imaginary points\" to the geometry, related to the imaginary unit\r\n\"i\", and study the influence of the imaginary points on the real\r\npoints and their geometry. Another portion of the project seeks to\r\nunderstand the asymptotic, or long range properties of special metric\r\ngeometries related to the Einstein equations. It is well known that\r\nboth of these properties can be influential in physical applications,\r\nand there is recent work to lead one to hope that both this\r\ncomplexification construction and the asymptotics of Einstein metrics\r\ncan be used to understand parts of the so-called Maldacena\r\ncorrespondence in theoretical physics.\r\n",
