 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program concerns questions at the intersection of\r\ncommutative algebra, integer programming, and discrete geometry. The\r\nlink between these fields is made via toric ideals and their Groebner\r\nbases. The first set of questions concern the characterization and\r\nconstruction of toric initial ideals without embedded primes. Answers\r\nto these questions will provide new structural results in the theory\r\nof integer programming via the classical technique of group\r\nrelaxations due to Gomory and will extend recent work in this area by\r\nSerkan Hosten and the proposer. The second set of questions concern \r\nthe toric Hilbert scheme, a parameter space for all polynomial ideals\r\nwith the same multi-graded Hilbert function as a given toric ideal. A\r\ncentral open question about these schemes is whether they are\r\nconnected. The proposer will work with Diane Maclagan on this \r\nconnectivity question, building on their recent construction of a\r\ngraph on the monomial ideals of the scheme which is connected if and\r\nonly if the scheme is connected. \r\n     \r\nOver the past decade, the proposer has contributed to the development\r\nof several new theories in discrete optimization using algebraic\r\ntechniques and has worked on the application of the resulting,\r\nnon-traditional algorithms to practical problems.  The research that\r\nhas contributed to these theories brings tools from algebra,\r\ncombinatorics, optimization and discrete geometry to bear on problems\r\nfrom all of these fields.  The application of algebraic techniques has\r\nled to new understanding in the field of integer programming, a branch\r\nof discrete optimization, but tools and ideas from optimization have\r\nalso led to new results in algebra. This interplay of ideas and\r\ntechniques has shed light on questions from each of these areas and\r\npromises to lead to greater insight and advancement.  The proposer\r\nworks with students on some of the computational aspects of the\r\nresearch and plans to involve students in the development of software\r\nthat implements these algorithms.  The proposer is also interested in\r\ncurriculum development in subject areas related to this research at\r\nthe University of Washington.",
