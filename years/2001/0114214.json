 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program supports Penn State University with the purchase a state-of-the-art optical image furnace for the growth of up to 10 mm diameter single crystals for the study of oxide ferroic and dielectric materials. The need for the capability to grow highly uniform and sufficient size single crystals is stemmed from the necessity to separate and understand the mechanisms in the mixed valence solid solution and often refractory ferroic crystal systems. The equipment is a NEC double lamp elliptical mirror cavity image furnace is particularly suited to the study of bulk single crystal samples. The ongoing NSF supported research program carried out by this PI, as well as several current NSF, DARPA, ONR sponsored programs would benefit strongly from the proposed equipment. Future research areas particularly the meta-materials, microwave field agile dielectric materials, electrooptic and acoustooptic materials are closely aligned with the proposed capabilities. The equipment will provide invaluable enhancement of available processing and analysis resource at the Materials Research Laboratory, at Penn State. Both graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will obtain training and carry out funded research using the proposed facility. Laboratory intensive senior/graduate level course on Science and Technology of Crystal Growth, currently being developed, will get invaluable enhancement from this proposed addition. Undergraduates and graduates and minority will be trained with the handling of this state-of-the-art crystal growth facility. The award is leveraged by Enthusiasm 30% cost sharing from Penn State. \r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program supports Penn State University with the purchase a state-of-the-art optical image furnace for the growth of up to 10 mm diameter single crystals for the study of oxide ferroic and dielectric materials.
