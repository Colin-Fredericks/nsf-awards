 "awd_abstract_narration": "With modern processor architectures, programs can achieve good\r\nperformance only if they possess sufficient data locality to exploit\r\non-chip caches.  This research focuses on developing and evaluating\r\nsoftware support for improving locality for advanced scientific\r\napplications for both sequential and parallel machines.  The basic\r\npremise is that both compile-time analyses and sophisticated run-time\r\nsystems are necessary.  Run-time systems are needed because many\r\nprograms are not analyzable statically. Compiler support is crucial\r\nboth for inserting interfaces to the run-time system and for directly\r\napplying program transformations where possible.\r\n\r\nThis proposal investigates locality optimizations needed for three\r\nfeatures found in advanced scientific applications (3D arrays,\r\nirregular accesses, and pointers).  It focuses on extending\r\nlocality optimizations to handle cache conflicts between multiple\r\ndata, deep memory hierarchies (multi-level caches and TLBs), hardware\r\nand software prefetching, nonlinear memory layouts, parallel and\r\ncluster architectures, and memory performance tools.  Locality\r\noptimizations will be applied to representative programs and\r\nexperimentally evaluated on advanced computer systems.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research should help improve the performance\r\nof computationally intensive scientific applications.  Because\r\nof trends in computer architectures, lessons learned are also\r\nlikely to be useful for application domains such as image\r\nprocessing and high-performance databases.",
