 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is growing consensus in engineering that a fundamental change is required in the\r\neducation of future engineers to ensure that they be well prepared for their roles in the\r\n21st century. The demands relate both to their success in the job market and to their\r\nresponsibilities as inventors and innovators of powerful tools and technologies that are\r\nincreasingly permeating all aspects of our society. In addition to strong technical\r\ncapability and management skills, future engineers need to develop the understanding and\r\nskills needed to design products and services that can serve the diverse needs of different\r\ncountries, cultures, and peoples.\r\n\r\nIn response to an increasing global economy and marketplace, the changing\r\ndemographics in our society and workforce, and government requirements for product\r\naccessibility, industry is increasingly developing more inclusive approaches to design.\r\nInclusive design of technology means developing systems flexible enough to serve the\r\nbroadest possible range of users. Curb cuts, for example, were originally designed for\r\nwheelchair users, but parents with strollers, bicyclists, youth on skateboards, and senior\r\ncitizens benefit from them, too.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project is a collaborative effort between Rose-Hulman Institute of\r\nTechnology (RHIT), Innoventure, the Education Development Center (EDC), and the\r\nCPB/WGBH National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM). The overall goal of this\r\nproject is to develop and broadly disseminate curriculum materials and activities that\r\nfacilitate the integration of inclusive design concepts into undergraduate engineering\r\ncurricula. To accomplish this goal, the Engineering Education for Inclusive Design\r\nProject will undertake two major activities:\r\n\r\n(1) RHIT faculty members, in collaboration with staff members from EDC and\r\nNCAM, will develop, implement and formatively evaluate case-based approaches\r\ntowards teaching inclusive design concepts and skills to undergraduate\r\nengineering education students. Project staff will develop case studies of\r\ninclusive design projects and design instructional activities to accompany the case\r\nmaterial. The case materials and activities will be incorporated in several\r\ndifferent engineering courses at RHIT, evaluated for their impact on students, and\r\nrevised based on the results of the pilot tests.\r\n\r\n(2) The inclusive design case materials and activities will be broadly disseminated\r\nboth among faculty at RHIT and nationally among other engineering schools\r\nthrough a variety of means: (a) summer faculty workshops hosted by RHIT that\r\nwill introduce participants to the case-based approach towards teaching inclusive\r\ndesign; (b) through the Engineering Case Library sponsored by the American\r\nSociety for Engineering Education (ASEE) and housed at RHIT in print and\r\nelectronic formats (world wide web); (c) and through papers and reports,\r\nincluding proceedings of the summer faculty seminars. These publications will be\r\ndisseminated nationally in print and electronic formats to schools of engineering,\r\nprofessional organizations, industry councils, and foundations.\r\n",
