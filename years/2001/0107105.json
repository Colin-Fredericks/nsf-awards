 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to University of Arizona is supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division.The research by Professors Seth Marder and Joseph Perry will address structure-property relationships and applications of molecules and molecular ensembles that exhibit two-photon absorption. The goals of the research are to develop a detailed understanding of how to optimize the two-photon absorption cross section in centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric (dipolar,quadrupolar, octupolar and hexadecapolar) molecules and to design chromophores that utilize effectively the excited states to efficiently drive chemical reactions that create reactive radicals and Bronsted or Lewis acids and bases. The research will enhance the three dimensional spatially resolved patterning of materials. Processes enabled by either photoinduced electron or energy  transfer, will yield species that will microscopically photopolymerize reactive monomers, photodeposit metals and semiconductors,and photogenerate catalysts.\r\n\r\nHighly efficient two-photon initiators allowing the patterning of a range of materials,will make three dimensional microfabrication a viable technology for the production of micro-optics, micro-mechanical components and microfluidic circuits. The scope of this  interdisciplinary research is broad, encompassing synthesis, materials, theory, characterization and fabrication. Students will be trained across the fields of chemistry, physics, materials and optical science.",
