 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thomas G. Leness\r\n\r\nThe goals of this proposal, to be done in collaboration \r\nwith P. Feehan, are to prove Witten's conjecture relating \r\nthe Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth \r\nfour-manifolds, to understand the relation between\r\nthe conditions of Seiberg-Witten simple type and \r\nKronheimer-Mrowka simple type, and to search for possible \r\ntopological constraints on these invariants.  This work \r\nwill be carried out by exploring the moduli space of PU(2) \r\nmonopoles which contains a moduli space of anti-self-dual \r\nconnections and the moduli spaces of Seiberg-Witten \r\nmonopoles for certain Spin C structures.  This implies \r\nthat the Donaldson invariant can be expressed as a sum, \r\nover these spinc structures, of an expression given by \r\npairing certain cohomology classes with the link of the \r\nmoduli space of Seiberg-Witten monopoles in the Uhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space of PU(2) monopoles.\r\nThe first phase of this work is to complete the proof \r\nthat the pairing of these cohomology classes with the \r\nlink of the moduli space of Seiberg-Witten monopoles can \r\nbe expressed in a universal form depending only on the \r\nSeiberg-Witten invariant and the homotopy type of the \r\nmanifold.  This work will also yield a proof of the \r\nKotschick-Morgan conjecture on wall-crossing formulas \r\nfor Donaldson invariants.  The second phase of this work \r\nis to calculate this universal form in sufficient detail \r\nto allow the computation of the explicit relation between \r\nthe Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants.  We intend to \r\ndo this calculation by using known surgery formulas for\r\nboth invariants (e.g. blow-up formulas), examples where \r\nboth invariants are known, and some internal symmetries \r\nof the sum mentioned above.  It is possible that this \r\nrelation between the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten\r\ninvariants is over-determined and thus will reveal \r\nconstraints on these invariants given by the topological \r\ntype of the four-manifold, as was done in earlier work \r\nwith Kronheimer and Mrowka.\r\n\r\nAn n-dimensional manifold is a topological space that \r\nlocally looks like n-dimensional Euclidean space.  \r\nManifolds are important objects to study because they \r\nare ubiquitous: the solution set of k equations in\r\nn variables will usually be an (n-k)-dimensional manifold.  \r\nThe main tools for distinguishing between four-dimensional \r\nmanifolds are the Seiberg-Witten and Donaldson invariants.  \r\nThus, understanding the relation between these invariants\r\nis crucial to an understanding of four-dimensional\r\ntopology.  In addition, the conjectures relating these \r\ninvariants arise from Witten's work using quantum field \r\ntheory.  These methods of quantum field theory are not \r\nmathematically rigorous, so our mathematically rigorous \r\nproof of Witten's conjecture can be viewed as an extremely\r\ninexpensive form of experimental physics.\r\n",
