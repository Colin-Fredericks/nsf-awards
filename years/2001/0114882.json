This new collaborative project is entitled Middle School \r\nStudents' REALM (Really Exploring And Learning Meteorology). The project's foci \r\nare: (1) to expose more middle school girls to meteorological science content, (2) to \r\ndevelop a positive and supportive learning environment for participating girls and boys, \r\n(3) to provide on site technical assistance to participating science teachers for content \r\nimplementation, and (4) to provide a vehicle for greater parent-girl participation in \r\nscience activities. In order to maximize resources, available \r\nmeteorology resources (weather stations) that are in demographically dispersed middle \r\nschools will be used. Involvement in this project will enhance girls' awareness of career opportunities \r\nfor women in the field of science in general and meteorology in particular. This project \r\nwill also increase middle school girls' self-esteem and confidence in learning science \r\nconcepts, which integrate the use of mathematics and technology. This project model \r\naims to reduce the attrition in advanced level science, mathematics and technology \r\ncoursework that typically occurs as girls move from middle school to high school, \r\nwhich carries over into higher education.",
