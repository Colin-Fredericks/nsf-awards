Many of the proteins involved in neurotransmitter release are known, but the mechanisms regulating the release process are not fully understood. The gene unc-13 in Caenorhabditis elegans codes for several protein products that are necessary for proper release of neurotransmitters at synapses. The roles of these proteins will be examined by (a) determining the subcellular localization of UNC-13 proteins using indirect immunofluorescence, (b) exploring regulation of unc-13 expression through GFP fusions to putative promoters, and (c) identifying proteins that interact with UNC-13 using genetic screens and the two-hybrid system. \r\n\r\nThe broad impact of this research project will be a more thorough understanding of the function of the nervous system. The study is scientifically important, because it will increase our knowledge of how a neuron sends a signal to another neuron, or to a muscle. Similarities between the nervous system of the worm, C. elegans, and more complex animals, including mammals, make C. elegans an excellent model organisms for exploring the details of neuronal regulation.  Laboratory techniques that would be prohibitive with mammals are straightforward in C. elegans. This CAREER research project will engage undergraduate students, including minority students, in cutting edge research. Some students will pursue independent research projects, while others will utilize research tools developed in the laboratory in their coursework. The research program will have an impact on basic scientific knowledge, and on the future careers of undergraduate students. \r\n",
