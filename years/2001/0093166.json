 "awd_abstract_narration": "As network performance has increased, the high-performance computing community has begun to\r\nturn to distributed systems to meet their performance needs. Research that combines the concurrency\r\nmanagement techniques from parallel computing with scalable and adaptive distributed systems design has resulted in a new software architecture known as the \"Computational Grid\". Its main tenet is that user programs should be able to draw computational \"power\" from a distributed resource pool the way\r\nelectrical appliances draw electricity from a power utility: ubiquitously, seamlessly and reliably. This\r\nproject will investigate a novel approach to building software systems that implement the\" Computational\r\nGrid\"  model of computing and how to foster new curricular directions based on this investigation.\r\n\r\nAs vehicles for this proposed work, two research thrusts will be combined in the form of EveryWare and G-commerce to define a new programming methodology for the Grid. EveryWare is a software toolkit for building robust, high-performance distributed applications that can use existing Computational Grid\r\nmiddleware as building blocks. An EveryWare program is structured as a set of application customizable\r\nservices that use the EveryWare toolkit as an adaptive server framewirk while leveraging the functionality\r\nprovided by existing Grid systems. G-commerce is a computational economic system that allows applications to purchase resources from computational suppliers. A key feature of G-commerce is that it is a macro-economic system which provably achieves economic equilibrium and market stability. By combining these two we will define a new and powerful approach to programming Grid applications.\r\n\r\nTo do so we will:\r\n.extend and implement the EveryWare software toolkit,\r\n.study and develop economic formulations that will form the basis of G-commerce\r\nbased resource allocation strategies,\r\n.develop a computational exchange for implementing resource economies an\r\ninfrastructure for empirical G-commerce resource scheduling studies and,\r\n.verify our results using non-trivial Grid applications in \"live\" Grid settings.\r\n\r\nThe research approach of this project is both analytical and experimental.\r\nIt will approach  the problem of ensuring resource allocation stability and\r\nequilibrium theoretically and using simulation. Then implement promising\r\neconomic formulations using the computational exchange, and test their\r\nvalidity with EveryWare implimentations of Grid applications. At the same\r\ntime, EveryWare will be enhanced so that it enables the aplication programmers\r\nand schedulers to consider computational price when making resource allocation\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\nEveryWare and G-commerce will also serve as the basis for new directions in\r\ncurriculum development. A course sequence will be designed that combines\r\ndistributed computing techniques, statistical analysis of load conditions, and\r\neconomic modeling methods from the literature with practical implementation\r\nusing Computational Grids. The resulting multi-disciplinary course will allow\r\nstudents to compare and combine different strategies easily for the purpose of\r\nmaking quantitative evaluations, which will be a primary focus of each sequence.\r\n\r\nPractica will also be organized in which students from different Universities\r\nwill be invited to participate. Each practicum will focus on the implementation\r\nof a chosen application using different Computational Grid infrastructures.\r\nStudents will compare different techniques and use the EveryWare toolkit and\r\nG-commerce to combine those that are the most effective.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
