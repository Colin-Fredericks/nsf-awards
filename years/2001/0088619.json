 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55) \r\nThe Power Engineering Group at the University of Puerto Rico is integrating laboratory practices within courses in order to illustrate fundamental concepts of the course, and is increasing opportunities for undergraduate research in power engineering to spark student interest and desire for scientific exploration. The effort draws substantially on successful learning tools developed at other power engineering programs, and adapts these tools to tailor a program based on learn-by-doing and cooperative learning concepts. Notably, the PowerLearn multimedia modules for power system education, as showcased at a 1999 NSF Workshop, are utilized. These experiences are improving student learning and ensure that there will be qualified professionals to meet the ever-growing energy demands of the U.S. and Puerto Rico. \r\nNew instrumentation for the study of power system components is being used to implement these strategies, and is combined with the Electric Machines laboratory to form the new Energy Systems Instrumentation Laboratory (ESIL). The ESIL provides both students and professors an environment to explore engineering ideas and concepts, fundamental principles as well as current issues and new research areas in power engineering. Activities and resources at ESIL motivate students to learn more about energy principles, cultivating a desire for life-long learning. Professors are able to combine teaching and research, and develop new teaching methods for the improvement of undergraduate education.\r\nActivities at ESIL include traditional laboratory practices, laboratory practices\r\nintegrated within courses, undergraduate research projects, demonstrations, seminars and short-courses. The use of technology and collaborative/cooperative learning techniques is a key element at ESIL.\r\n",
