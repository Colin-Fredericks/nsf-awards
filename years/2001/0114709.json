 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nThis study examines energy loss mechanisms during the transition of a cable from a slack state to a taut state and undertakes optimization of the associated energy loss for use in design of low-tech/low cost/high performance dampers for mitigation of seismic damage in structures. Cables comprised of helical wires wound around a central core to form a strand or strands wrapped helically around another strand will be modeled to capture axial, flexural and torsional displacements.  Dynamic friction at the contact points or lines between wires absorbs energy and affects the responses.  Understanding these effects will enable design of a snapping cable energy dissipater that does not produce harmful shock to the structure, yet dissipates sufficient energy and/or adds sufficient stiffness to be effective in reducing damage induced by seismic events.  \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that this analytical, numerical, and experimental research program leads to a novel and effective tool in the effort to protect lives and property during earthquakes and other natural or man-made hazards.  Additionally, during the course of the research, techniques and results will be incorporated into courses cross-listed in Civil Engineering and Mechanics at Virginia Tech and the participation of undergraduate research students will be encouraged. \r\n\r\n",
