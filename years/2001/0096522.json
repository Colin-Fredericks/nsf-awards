 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the next decade the likely detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical\r\nsources will open a new window for astronomy and provide new tests of Einstein's theory\r\nof general relativity.  Interpreting the observations will require accurate theoretical gravi-\r\ntational waveforms calculated from the theory. This project will endeavor to provide the\r\nneeded waveforms, by solving Einstein's equations systematically in a post-Newtonian ap-\r\nproximation, which amounts to an expansion in powers of v/c, where v and c are the speeds\r\nof the source bodies and of light, respectively. The goal will be to find the equations of\r\nmotion for the bodies correct to order (v/c)7 beyond Newtonian gravity, and the flux of\r\ngravitational radiation to order (v/c)6 beyond the lowest \"quadrupole\" approximation. This\r\nwill make use of a method known as Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations\r\n(DIRE), that has been developed at Washington University. Using this method it will also\r\nbe possible to study the effects of the interior structure of the bodies, including their spin,\r\non the motion and gravitational waveform, to high order in the post-Newtonian expansion.\r\nWays to use gravitational-wave data to test alternative theories of gravity will also be\r\nstudied. This includes testing the scalar-tensor alternative theories by observing gravita-\r\ntional waves from neutron stars inspiralling into black holes, and testing whether or not the\r\ngraviton has a mass by observing waves from inspiral of pairs of supermassive black holes\r\nusing the proposed space-based gravitational antenna, LISA. A recently published class of\r\nalternative theories of gravity that predict a massive graviton will be studied in detail as\r\n\"foils\" against which to compare and contrast the predictions of general relativity, and as\r\nguides to other possible tests of a massive graviton.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
