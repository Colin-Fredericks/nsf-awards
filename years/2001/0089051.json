 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54) \r\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that knowledge is acquired through diverse learning styles, with each student usually having certain preferred styles. These styles are typically grouped into four scales: sensory to intuitive; visual to verbal; inductive to deductive; active to reflective; and sequential to global. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a repertoire of educational materials that cater to a mix of learning styles of undergraduate engineering students. The repertoire includes computer-based lecture support notes, tutoring modules, simulation models, and assessment tools; physical demonstration devices; and, a compilation of unique riddles, fallacies, and problems. Some materials are for in-class use, some for out-of-class use, and some for a combination of the two; some are for small group use; while others are for individual use. The materials target undergraduates at the junior/senior level in the fields of civil, mechanical, and chemical engineering, pursuing engineering or technology degrees. The subject area of hydraulics/fluid mechanics was chosen for this project, because it is an area common to many different engineering disciplines. It is anticipated that these tools will optimize teaching efforts and improve student achievement by: increasing student-faculty and student-student interactions; enhancing the learning experience; stimulating critical thinking; and cultivating problem solving skills. \r\n",
