 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hope College REU program is intended to provide students with an opportunity to have a significant research experience which will enhance their desire to undertake a research career. The projects available to the students come from a wide variety of specialties; nuclear physics, both experimental and theoretical, technical education of the nonscientist, fracture mechanics, aircraft safety, biomechanics and relativistic astrophysics. The eight REU student researchers, and a similar number supported by other sources, will work side-by-side with the faculty in the lab with daily personal contact. Most of the students arrive with little or no experience in the special area of research. At the same time, we have only the undergraduates to help us do the research we undertake so that it is important that they learn quickly and start contributing early. Thus, they will be given responsibility and freedom to think for themselves while being supervised closely. The process has been successful in the past with many students being co-authors on refereed publications.  Students will present their results and prepare posters.  Funds are available to support travel to a meeting. Students will receive stipends, housing and travel allowance.",
