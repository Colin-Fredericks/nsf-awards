 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Jeffrey S. Moore, of the Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is exploring the synthesis and properties of chain molecules that adopt ordered conformations in solution (\"foldamers\"), analogous to the behavior of proteins and nucleic acids. Professor Moore's studies target the molecular recognition properties of foldamers and the development of approaches for the synthesis and selection of functionally active foldamer sequences. Phenyl piperazine substrates are designed to be accommodated in the helical cavities of oligomers, while alternative functionalization of the oligomers provides fully encapsulated cavities with end capping groups capable of further pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions.\r\n\r\nProteins and nucleic acids adopt ordered three dimensional structures in solution, with the details of their structures critical to their biological function. With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Jeffrey S. Moore, of the Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is exploring the properties of synthetic molecules (\"foldamers\")  which are designed to fold into specific three dimensional structures. By studying methods to bring about the formation of desired, compact structures, complemented by the development of new techniques for the efficient synthesis of large molecules (macromolecules), Professor Moore is addressing the structural features responsible for the adoption of specific structures by foldamers. This information, in turn, is providing insight into the factors responsible for the binding of small organic molecules by macromolecules. Since macromolecular structure dictates many of the properties of polymers, these studies promise a better understanding of polymer chemistry and materials science,  and, in addition, may enhance our understanding of the structure and properties of biological macromolecules.",
