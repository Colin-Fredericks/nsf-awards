 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virtual Cognition Laboratory at Saint Anselm College was established in 1998 to support faculty research and undergraduate research training in Cognitive Psychology, Sensation and Perception, and Consciousness, as well as develop innovative, hands-on laboratories for related courses. This grant supports upgrades and expansion of the Virtual Cognition Laboratory.\r\n\r\nToday, the Virtual Cognition Laboratory Research Center has two testing computers with related peripheral devices and an EEG station to support three different programs of research: gender differences in navigation, developmental models for place learning, and the impact of daytime sleepiness on attention. In addition, the Virtual Cognition Laboratory Education Center has another six computers to support hands-on laboratories for students to complete as part of their requirements for a variety of courses. Since the inception of the Virtual Cognition Laboratory, the development of software, hardware, and peripheral devices to support highly immersive virtual reality environments (IVEs) has grown at a rapid pace. In order to offer faculty and students a state-of-the-art facility to conduct research and support research training, the laboratory will be enhanced to include two new high speed computers, software, and peripheral devices. The peripheral devices include two different delivery methods, i.e., head mounted display versus dome.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this equipment will support both ongoing and new research activities in the following areas: developmental models for place learning, individual differences in linear optical trajectory strategies, and the impact of daytime sleepiness on a variety of cognitive processes. The Virtual Cognition Laboratory will facilitate interdisciplinary research activities on our campus and collaborations with investigators from other institutions. The Virtual Cognition Laboratory will also support research training for undergraduates and provide them with the opportunity to use state-of-the-art equipment to develop their technical skills. Finally, the Virtual Cognition Laboratory will continue to serve as a resource center for faculty to develop new laboratory modules for their courses.",
