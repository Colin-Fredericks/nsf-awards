 "awd_abstract_narration": "James Aspnes\r\n\"Fault-Tolerant Distributed Resource Location\"\r\n\r\nResource location is a fundamental problem in distributed computing.\r\nExamples include such basic tasks as translating URLs into machine\r\naddresses, mapping telephone numbers to individual telephones, and\r\nsearching for documents on the Web.  Typical current solutions involve\r\nmaintaining centralized directories that become bottlenecks that\r\nimpair speed and reliability; such solutions are also unsuited to\r\npeer-to-peer systems where individual machines come and go freely. The\r\nresearch examines how to distribute directory information\r\nholographically throughout the network, so that the costs of searches\r\nare spread evenly, no specialized server machines are needed, and\r\nresources can still be found even if a large fraction of the machines\r\nleave the system.\r\n\r\nThe main technique is the construction of random graphs whose nodes\r\n(representing resources and machines) are assigned coordinates in some\r\nspace based on their keys.  Searching for a resource involves moving a\r\ntoken from some initial node to adjacent nodes closer to the target\r\nuntil the target is reached.  Core components of the project are the\r\ndesign of graph structures that provide the correct mix of\r\nshort-distance and long-distance edges for fast searching and the\r\ndesign of local mechanisms for building and repairing such structures\r\nquickly without central coordination.",
