The first phase of the project consists in the development of a novel nanoparticles pulsed beam laser deposition technique that delivers size-selected nanoparticles to deposit arbitrarily shaped patterns on a substrate.  The second phase of the project consists in the integration of the new technique with conventional Pulsed Laser Deposition technique into a single deposition facility.  The new facility will provide a new method for creation of nano composite materials. The facility will be a multi-user tool for research and training in nanostructured material at the UAB. The instrument will help establish five new research initiatives at UAB.  This instrument development project will complement an existing NSF-Supported REU -site.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program to the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB) is for the development of a multipurpose laser deposition facility for research and education in nanostructured materials.
