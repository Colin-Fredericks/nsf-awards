Woodward\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator plans to develop the theory of group\r\nactions on symplectic manifolds and geometric invariant theory,\r\nand extend applications to certain 2d conformal field theories\r\nand algebraic combinatorics.  In particular, he will investigate\r\nthe theory of loop group actions, group-valued moment maps, and\r\nrelations to the Wess-Zumino-Witten model in conformal field\r\ntheory and cohomology pairings on moduli spaces of flat\r\nconnections; the asymptotic limit of the quantum 6j symbols; and\r\ndecomposition of products of conjugacy classes in disconnected\r\ncompact groups and twisted forms of quantum cohomology.  He will\r\nintegrate his research with a variety of educational projects,\r\nsuch as dynamical systems in the calculus and linear algebra\r\nsequence at Rutgers; strengthening the joint major with computer\r\nscience; laboratory activities in the undergraduate curriculum\r\nand evaluation of their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nSymplectic geometry is the mathematical framework for the study\r\nof classical mechanics, and in particular Hamiltonian dynamical\r\nsystems.  Woodward will undertake a number of projects to develop\r\nthe field and its role in the undergraduate and graduate\r\ncurriculum.  He will seek to understand symmetries, especially of\r\ninfinite dimension, in this setting.  Possible applications\r\noutside of mathematics are the development of new computational\r\ntechniques in conformal field theory, an important topic in\r\nrecent high-energy theoretical physics, and improvement of the\r\nefficiency of wireless communication, via the construction of\r\nbetter packings in the unitary group.\r\n",
