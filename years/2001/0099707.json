 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is centered around the study of  A-hypergeometric\r\nfunctions.  These have been introduced in the 80's by Gel'fand\r\nand his coworkers as solutions of a system of partial\r\ndifferential equations encoding combinatorial data of polytopes. \r\nSpecific problems to be addressed in this project  include: the\r\nclassification of rational hypergeometric functions and their\r\nrelationship with toric residues; bounds for the holonomic rank\r\nand rational rank; hypergeometric functions arising as periods of\r\nCalabi-Yau manifolds.  Potential applications of this work\r\ninclude a deeper understanding of the properties of the\r\nA-discriminant and new algorithms for the computation of total\r\nresidues -a rational expression on the coefficients of a system\r\nof polynomial equations which is of considerable interest in\r\ncomputational algebraic geometry- and, ultimately, the\r\ndevelopment of algorithms for solving polynomial equations.  \r\n\r\nThe study of polynomial equations is of fundamental importance on\r\nalmost all branches of science and technology.  In the last few\r\nyears it has become clear that the best approaches to their\r\nsolution are those that combine numerical and symbolic methods. \r\nThe work on this project attempts to answer some basic questions\r\non the symbolic study of a class of partial differential\r\nequations closely related to systems of polynomial equations with\r\nthe goal of developing new algorithms.  This same system of\r\ndifferential equations arise also in Mirror Symmetry, a\r\nfundamental theory in high-energy physics, with remarkable\r\nconsequences in pure mathematics.  The investigator hopes to be\r\nable to relate the symbolic approach to the classical algebraic\r\ngeometric (Hodge Theory) approach.",
