The PI will continue a broad based research program on (III, Mn)V semiconductors, quantum Hall systems, high temperature superconductors, aromatic molecular crystals, carbon nanotube systems, and properties of exotic solid state q-bits.\r\nWork on (III, Mn)V semiconductors aims to develop a reliable theoretical description of transport and magnetic properties.  Work on quantum Hall systems involves developing quantum field theory models for quantum Hall ferromagnets at integer fillings, investigating possible explanations of the huge longitudinal resistance discovered at Landau filling of 2/3, exploring a real-space picture of composite fermion correlations, and exploring a theory of double superfluidity and its possible extensions to the high temperature superconductors. \r\n This award also contributes to broad and rounded educational experiences in condensed matter theory at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award supports a broad-based research program in theoretical condensed matter physics. The work attacks a wide range of open problems in quantum Hall systems and ferromagnetic semiconductors with possible repercussions on the fields of high temperatures superconductivity, and the emerging field of quantum computing. This award directly contributes to the emerging fields of \"spintronics\" and nanoelectronics that may form the basis of future electronic device technologies. The PI is also committed to providing broad educational experiences in condensed matter theory from the undergraduate level on up.  \r\n***\r\n",
