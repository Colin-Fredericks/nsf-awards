Gustafson, Ohio State University, Guy Buntinx and Olivier Pozat of the Universite des Sciences and Technologies de Lille, Lille, France. The objective of their collaboration is to conduct systematic investigations of photophysical properties of several related monomers, oligomers, segmented block co-polymers, and polymers in solution and as thin films.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in model oligomers and conducting polymers.  This is complemented by French expertise in the photophysics of molecular systems.  The project also takes advantage of complementary instrument methodologies. The US group will utilize ps time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and ns time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. The French group are experienced in fs and ns transient Raman spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of electroluminescent conducting polymers, in particular, the conduction process, the control of radiative and non-radiative pathways, and the nature of interactions at the interfaces between polymers, and between a polymer and metal. \r\n",
