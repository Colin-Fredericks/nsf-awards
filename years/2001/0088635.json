 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) \r\nThe complexity of human movement has led to teaching practices that compartmentalize physiological systems. Current research has identified the need to take a more integrated approach when solving problems by accounting for interactions between physiological systems. This project is adapting innovative research tools and implementing problem-based pedagogical strategies from the science education literature that enable undergraduate Kinesiology students to discover and develop a clearer understanding of how human physiological systems interact to achieve human movement. Equipment is being acquired to create hands-on inquiry based laboratory experiences that focus on muscle metabolism and force generation in relation to human movement. Web-based software, multimedia, computational tools, and technical expertise is being used to create a student friendly interactive interface that enables students to explore real world problems, make multilevel connections between concepts, and think laterally through self-directed manipulation of multimedia source data and physiological system simulations. The integration of experimentation and multimedia tools in the curriculum engages the students in real world problem solving and enables the students to apply scientific principles, discover relationships using inquiry based experimentation, and critically assess and communicate the implications of the results. Students solve problems independently, as a group and with community groups and gain multimedia, computational, communication, and literacy skills through their interaction with instructional technology.\r\n",
