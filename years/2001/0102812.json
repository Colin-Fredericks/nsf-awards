 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tougaloo College seeks to increase the number of majors in science, math, and \r\ncomputer science who ar successful in their courses, who complete undergraduate\r\nstudies with honors, and who attend graduate school in the sciences and technology.\r\n The college has an excellent track record for placing students in medical and health\r\n professional schools, and has also recently been cited as among the top five \r\nundergraduate sources of African-American doctorates.\r\n\r\nThe program has three strategies. The first is to improve student success in\r\nintroductory courses in biology, chemistry and mathematics. To our tutorial drop-in\r\ncenter we are adding three people (two supported by this grant) to provide weekly\r\nsupplemental instruction sessions for the first two years of of instruction in \r\nthese disciplines. In addition test practice sessions will be held to familiarize \r\nstudents with standardized test questions from examinations such as the \r\nGraduate Record Examination and the Medical College Admissions Test.\r\n\r\nWe will also build the enrollment in our physics, pre-engineering, and computer \r\nscience programs. We will sponsor a six-week summer program to introduce \r\nstudents to both fields, along with reading and English skills. We will offer a \r\nnumber of scholarships to talented students in computer science or physics \r\nwho maintain a 3.3 science GPA.\r\n\r\nFinally we plan to stimulate interest in science and in graduate school by \r\nsupporting research as an integral part of of the life of both faculty and student \r\nscientists. Contrary to its past tradition, the college will provide time for older \r\nfaculty and new faculty to set up a viable on-campus research program, through \r\neither released time or sabbatical leaves. This program will continue to be \r\nsupported by the College after the grant, as faculty acquire outside funding.\r\n\r\nThese initiatives will provide a rich, stimulating environment for students which\r\n will provide a unique window on the reasons why people become scientists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n",
