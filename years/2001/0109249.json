The collaborators are Professors Sashi Satpathy, University of Missouri-Columbia and T. Saha-Dasgupta, S.N. Bose National Center for Basic Sciences, Calcutta.  Colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) oxides are of considerable interest because they exhibit a variety of rich physical properties resulting from the coupling between the charge, orbital, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom.  They have great potential for industrial applications, particularly in the area of magnetic devices.  In recent years, a number of new CMR materials have been discovered and are being studied both experimentally and theoretically.  In this joint project, the collaborators will study the electronic structure and electron-lattice interaction in CMR materials and their relationship to transport and magnetism.     \r\n\r\nScope:  The PIs are both highly experienced in conducting electronic structure studies and this project will synthesize the PIs' respective research skills.  Theoretical study of CMR is a very current, intellectually challenging topic.  This research will make important contributions to the physical understanding and technical applications of CMR materials.  It will, also, encourage international exchange and greatly benefit the participants and their groups including graduate students.  This project is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Government of India's Department of Science & Technology.  \r\n",
