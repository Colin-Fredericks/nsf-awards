 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last two decades, the homotopy continuation method for\r\nsolving polynomial systems has been established and proved to\r\nbe reliable and efficient. Resulting from a previous project,\r\nsupported by NSF Grant DMS-9804846, a source code, HOM4PS, was\r\nproduced. Excellent performance of this code on a large collection\r\nof polynomial systems in a wide variety of applications provides\r\npractical evidence that the newly developed methods constitute a\r\npowerful general purpose solver. Nontheless, there are still\r\nnumerous models of polynomial systems in applications which do\r\nnot have a satisfactory line of attack. Those models provide a rich\r\nsource of interesting and challenging problems with strong mathematical\r\ncontent. The essence of the proposed project is the advance development\r\nof the solver based on the conduct of further research\r\nto greatly enlarge the scope of its applications. The ultimate goal\r\nis a more complete high-quality block-box solfware which will\r\nincorporate the best state of the art to provide the general scientific\r\ncommunity a reliable source for solving polynomial systems in practice.\r\n\r\nThe problem of solving polynomial systems has been, and will continue\r\nto be, one of the most important subjects in both pure and applied\r\nmathematics.  The need to solve systems of polynomial equations arises\r\nvery frequently in various fields of science and engineering, such as,\r\nformula construction, geometric intersection, inverse kinematics,\r\nrobotics, vision and the computation of equilibrium states of chemical\r\nreaction equations, etc. In recent years (1993-1999), a considerable\r\nresearch effort in Europe had been directed to this problem in two\r\nconsecutive major projects, PoSSo (Polynomial System Solving) and FRISCO\r\n(FRamework for Integrated Symbolic/numerical COmputation), supported by\r\nEuropean Commission with thirteen university teams in seven European\r\ncountries involved. Those research projects focused on the development\r\nof the already well-established Groebner basis methods within the\r\nframework of computer algebra.  Their reliance on symbolic manipulation\r\nmakes those methods seem somewhat limited to relatively small problems.\r\nIn contrast, the approch by the homotopy continuation method in this\r\nproject is numerical and exhibits much powerful application results.",
