 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of 28 national alliances, CAMP is entering the ninth year of a ten-year cooperative\r\nagreement between the National Science Foundation and UC Irvine, the lead campus and\r\nadministrative center. The primary numerical goal is to double the number of B.S. degrees\r\ngranted to underrepresented students in SMET (science, mathematics, engineering, technology)\r\nmajors at the University of California. Offered at the eight general UC campuses, CAMP has\r\ncreated a systemwide network of faculty, program staff and students working toward a common\r\nset of measured outcomes. Goals include completion of the B.S. degree, preparation for and\r\ntransition to graduate school or the professional workplace. The program serves undergraduates\r\nthrough enrichment opportunities and faculty mentored research supported by stipends. This\r\neffort has contributed to a 78% increase in B.S. degrees granted by UC from the baseline year\r\n(1990-91). Activities center on faculty mentored research experiences, collaborative learning,\r\npresenting at scientific conferences, science writing and co-authorship, technology literacy, and\r\npreparation for graduate school. Student achievement is disseminated through the Quarterly and\r\non-line, www.camp.uci.edu. A permanent allocation through the UC Regents Diversity\r\nInitiative supports program infrastructure, administration, and expansion. Using a synergistic\r\napproach, the California Alliance collaborates with affiliated initiatives such as UC LEADS and\r\nAGEP (Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate) that enhance baccalaureate degree\r\ncompletion and continuation to advanced study. Responding to the paucity of minorities in\r\nfaculty positions in the university and nationwide, special emphasis is being placed on\r\nencouraging students to prepare for a career in academia, and entering the professoriate. The\r\nCAMP mission: Scientists and engineers are best prepared by other scientists and engineers who\r\nexhibit and expect scholarly excellence.",
