 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program to Princeton University supports the acquisition of equipment to enhance the quality of quantum-confined semiconductor structures grown in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. The equipment includes special (all-metal) gate valves and new effusion cells which will be installed in the MBE growth chamber. It will allow the growth of extremely clean (low-disorder), selectively doped GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction structures in which electron interaction physics dominates. The MBE grown, high-quality structures will be used in on-going NSF-supported projects. Such structures provide a crucial and important test-bed for new many-body physics. The results can also have an impact on the realization of new devices whose fabrication and/or operation is based on semiconductor structures of similar type. The improved material will impact positively the research of several collaborators who receive high-quality GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures from the PI. The equipment will be used primarily by the students and will therefore be crucial for their education and training. The award will strengthen high quality education integrated into forefront research. In addition, fabrication and the physics of advanced layered semiconductor structures are at the forefront of today's science and technology. Well-trained and educated students in this field will be invaluable resources for the US as well as the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program to Princeton University supports the acquisition of equipment to enhance the quality of quantum-confined semiconductor structures grown in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system.
