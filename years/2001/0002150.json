A few important areas of applications for nano-technology include nano-biosensors, nano-chemical sensors, nonlinear optic devices, and bio-resistant/bio-compatible protective coatings.  The oldest method for manufacturing ultra-thin organized chemical layers is the Langmuir-Blodgett technique.\r\n\r\nThe Langmuir-Blodgett technique, however, ahs not been used on an industrial scale for the manufacturing of nano-technology devices due to the apparent inability to control the hydrodynamic variable needed for reliable thin film deposition.  Most of the problems associated with the Langmuir-Blogett techniques for thin film deposition can be traced back to the complex dynamics of the gas-liquid -solid moving contact line.  We discuss in this proposal how recent experimental and theoretical advances on the dynamics of moving  contact lines can be used to develop a fundamental knowledge can be used in turn to provide a physical model of the deposition process that will pave the way for developing faster industrial- scale methods to manufacture ordered thin films.\r\n\r\nThe development of faster, cheaper and reliable L-B deposition processors will impact some of the most active areas in nano-technology, such as the manufacture of MEMS, and the development of extremely sensitive chemical-detecting or bio-detecting devices.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is submitted in similar versions to the NSF by the university of Alabama in Huntsville and to UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) by Leeds University.  The main strength of this proposal is to collaborative team approach that will be used to analyze the experimental and theoretical aspects of this research and on the collective expertise brought into the proposal by the groups at the USA and UK.    \r\n",
