 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a 3-year summer REU site in Environmental Research at the University of Idaho, under the direction of Dr. Margrit von Braun.  This site will provide a challenging summer experience conducting environmental restoration and remediation research for a diverse group of 10 undergraduate students who have limited opportunities to conduct research at their home institutions and who are primarily underrepresented in science and engineering.  Working closely with a faculty mentor the students will work on individual research projects with topics such as phyto-and bioremediation, supercritical fluid extraction of mixed waste, biologically engineered treatment systems, aqueous geochemistry, and watershed restoration.  Students will also participate in scholarly and recreational activities, such as weekly REU research forums, lunches with professional and academic role models, evening dinner seminars, workshops on environmental ethics, and weekend field trips led by faculty mentors.",
