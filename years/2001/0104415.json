His theoretical and observational program will examine heating and enrichment processes in the Universe and their impact on the formation of large-scale structure.  The observational program will carry out the most accurate spectroscopic examination of distant outflows yet undertaken, as well as a search for heated gas around distant galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field.  The observational research will be complemented by three closely related theoretical projects: 1) a detailed numerical study of galaxy outflows that will help to better quantify the role outflows play in the thermal and enrichment history of the diffuse gas from which all galaxies form, 2) a study of how this enrichment history can be related to the metal distribution in the stars of our own galaxy, and 3) a numerical study of the impact of outflows on the cosmic microwave background radiation, one of the most sensitive probes of the heating and ionization history of the Universe. This research is funded through the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
