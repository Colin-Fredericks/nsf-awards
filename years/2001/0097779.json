 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Bowling Green State University (BGSU).  Neocles Leontis is the site's Program Director; Deanne Snavely is the Co-Program Director. Nine faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will participate in a ten-week program.  Recruitment efforts will target the 75 colleges and universities within a 250-mile radius of Bowling Green.  Special efforts are underway to recruit underrepresented minorities, includung contacts with Wilberforce University and Norfolk University. The research focus of the program is the interface between photochemical and biomolecular sciences.  Students will participate in one of two short courses: the fundamentals of photophysics and photochemistry, or an introduction to bioinformatics.  Other activities will include a weekly seminar program, and a joint poster session with other REU sites in the area held at the conclusion of the program.  Surveys will be administered both at the beginning and at the end of the program to determine the students' attitudes toward scientific research. Plans are to continue follow-up efforts with each student via a BGSU REU website.\r\n\r\n",
