 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to the University of Maine, Eric N. Landis, Principal Investigator, for the support of a 3-year REU Site in Advanced Engineered Wood Composites.  This nine-week program will provide an interdisicpinary research experience for9 undergraduate science and engineering students with the focal point being the development of the next generation of engineered wood composites for construction applications.  The program will combine hands-on laboratory work with training in fundamental science and engineering principles.  Faculty mentors will work closely with students.  Weekly seminars wil include discussions of research techniques, ethics, graduate schools, as well as presentations made by the students.  Group field trips will include trips to major field test sites, government agencies, industries, and social events.  Follow-through after the students leave the site will consist of advisors working with their students on a technical paper based on the research, as well as advisors assisting students in applying to graduate school.",
