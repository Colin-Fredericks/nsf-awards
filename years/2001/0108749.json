 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells of microorganisms as well as human cells encounter changes in environmental pH.\r\n Responses of cells to altered environmental pH may involve changes in gene expression.  A system for the\r\nregulation of gene expression by environmental pH was first identified in the filamentous\r\nAscomycete fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Components of this regulatory system include\r\nthe pacC gene-encoded zinc-finger transcription factor and the products of the palA, B, C,\r\nF, H and I genes, which lead to activation of the PacC transcription factor at alkaline pH.\r\nThis system ensures that extracellular enzymes are produced under conditions of pH\r\nwhere they can function: acid phosphatase under acid conditions and alkaline\r\nphosphatase under alkaline conditions, for example. The pH regulatory system is also\r\nimportant for alkaline adaptation (survival in alkaline environments) and for conidial\r\ndevelopment in A. nidulans. The aims of this research are to discover new\r\ncomponents of this regulatory system and to further define the roles of known\r\ncomponents. Research on the A. nidulans pH signalling pathway has contributed to the\r\nlarger field of cell signalling. For example, the palB gene product was the first example\r\nof a calpain, calcium-activated cysteine protease in a microorganism and in a specific\r\nsignalling pathway.  The study of pH regulation in the model organism A. nidulans has also helped the understanding of pH regulation in fungi of medical and economic importance.  The study of pH\r\nregulation is most advanced in A. nidulans. This fact and the availability of well-\r\ndeveloped genetics tools and resources make A. nidulans one of the best systems for the\r\nstudy of this important eukaryotic regulatory pathway. In this research, a\r\nrecently-developed gene library will be used to identify high copy number suppressors of\r\nA. nidulans strains with mutations in the pH regulatory pathway. With this library, the\r\nexpression of A. nidulans genomic DNA inserts is under control of the inducible niiA\r\n(nitrite reductase) promoter. As the plasmid used to construct the library also has the\r\nAMA1 sequence, which allows extrachromosomal maintenance of plasmids, isolation of\r\nplasmids from Aspergillus transformants is straightforward. Significant preliminary\r\nresults have already been achieved in this study. For example, 166 putative copy number\r\nsuppressors of a pacC loss-of-function mutation have been obtained. An assay for palB\r\nprotease activity will also be developed and work will be completed to determine the\r\ncellular location of the palI gene product, which may function as the pH-sensing protein.\r\nFor this study, a palI-green fluorescent protein gene fusion construct has been made. In\r\naddition to the contribution to scientific knowledge of the proposed research, the project\r\nwill make an important contribution to education. As undergraduate students will\r\nparticipate in this research, it will provide valuable training for future scientists and\r\neducators.",
