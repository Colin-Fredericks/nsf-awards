 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe institution is developing a watershed learning environment for their Integrated Natural Resources Technology program's innovative and successful curriculum. The Watershed Research and Assessment Project (WRAP) adds a contextual framework to the existing curriculum by integrating it physically into a small watershed so that students experience the interconnectedness and complexity of an ecosystem. This approach produces multi-disciplinary natural resource technicians with the knowledge, comprehension, and skills to support efforts for solving key environmental issues in the region. An important aspect of the program is the involvement of area high schools and local communities in the learning process. The project enables these groups to participate in collaborative watershed studies. The interdisciplinary faculty include those with extensive technician and technology education, as well as research and natural resources management experience. They are uniquely suited to develop and disseminate the Watershed Research and Assessment Project material and methods to high schools, community colleges and community groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
