 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the 6th Advanced Seminar on Paleodietary Research, to be held on the campus of the Univ. of California, Santa Cruz in September 2001.The Advanced Seminars have been the premier forum for high-level discussion\r\namong anthropologists, geochemists, paleobiologists, and ecosystem\r\nscientists about the ways that fossil chemistry can be used to reconstruct\r\nthe ecology, physiology, and migration patterns of humans and other\r\nmammals.  Approximately 30 seminar participants will explore the diverse\r\nchemical approaches to hominid paleobiology.  The list ranges from senior\r\nscientists to graduate students and from archaeologists to chemists,\r\nincluding speakers from 8 nations.  The speakers will examine the following\r\ngeneral topics: 1) how biological isotope signals are influenced by the\r\neffects of growth dynamics and post-mortem alteration, 2) how isotopes can\r\nbe used to study the scale and pattern of human mobility, 3) new isotopic\r\ntools for studying hominid diets and habitat use, and 4) how physiology and\r\nnutritional status are reflected in the isotope composition of fossils.\r\nFor example, several speakers will focus on the ecology and diet of\r\naustralopithecines that are several million years old, determining the\r\nextent to which these relatives of modern humans consumed meat versus\r\nplants.  Another set of speakers will focus on the diets and food\r\nprocessing technologies of modern humans over the past few thousand years.\r\nA number of speakers will examine shifts in human migration patterns and\r\nnutritional status, looking at the interplay between climate and cultural\r\nchange as causal agents.  As has been the case with all of previous\r\nseminars, we will publish a set of papers resulting from the presentations,\r\npreferably as a special issue of an archaeological journal.  The\r\npublication will summarize important advances, making results available in\r\na centralized format to both specialists and non-specialists.  If the past\r\nis any guide, the chemical approaches to human and animal ecology,\r\nbiogeochemistry, and environmental reconstruction explored in the\r\npublication will extend to workers in many other fields.  For the\r\npast 30 years, anthropologists and archaeologists using chemical methods\r\nhave been blazing a trail, a trail that has recently been picked up by\r\nwildlife biologists, terrestrial paleoclimatologists and global change\r\nresearchers.  The 6th Advanced Seminar on Paleodietary Research should\r\ncontinue this tradition.\r\n\r\n",
