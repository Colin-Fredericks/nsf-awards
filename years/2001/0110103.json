 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs, Prof. Kent M. Ervin of the University of Nevada in Reno will develop an ion-molecule reaction dynamics imaging apparatus for chemistry research.  This new analytical tool will falicitate investigations of the dynamics and energetics of ion-molecule reactions.  In particular, it will allow the measurement of total reaction cross sections and product velocity and angular distributions for ion-molecule reactions with both high sensitivity and high energy and angular resolution.  The design calls for crossed ion and molecular pulsed beams with three major components:  a quadrupole ion trap source; a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer; and a velocity mapped ion imaging detector.  \r\n\r\nApplications include fundamental investigations of reaction dynamics as well as ion and neutral thermochemistry.  Greater accuracy and precision in energetics measurements will be possible compared with traditional instruments because of the high-resolution measurement of the kinetic energies of products.  The instrumentation design is potentially attractive for future analytical chemistry applications - for example, for on-the-fly energy-selective collision-induced dissociation analysis in gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or from electrosprayed ions in liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
