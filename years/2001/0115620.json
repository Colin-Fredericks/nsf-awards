 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to support research in building the theoretical basis and knowledge base in embedded heat pipe technology for elimination of the use of cutting fluids in the machining industry.  This research project adopts a new heat transfer concept for environmentally conscious cutting tool design. This research project will conduct the following investigations: (1) characterization of the embedded heat pipe systems in cutting tools; (2) thermodynamic and heat transfer finite element analyses to predict the temperature distribution of the specific cutting process; (3) evaluation of the performance of the embedded heat pipe for tool wear analysis. The cutting rake insert, heat pipe container, wick structure, and working fluids are design parameters to adjust the temperature distribution. The proposed research will lead to the development of predictive models for heat transfer behavior, and experimental investigation and predictive modeling of the tool wear due to the embedded heat pipes in cutting tools in machining processes. The outcome of these studies will be useful for dry machining in industry.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this research will facilitate the temperature control optimization in the use of the heat pipe in achieving a balance between process productivity and environmental consciousness. The models can then be used in selecting experimental conditions to explore, to interpret the experimental results, and, ultimately, to guide industrial tool design for dry machining.  Finally, the research results within this program will be integrated with education through interdisciplinary activities in curriculum development, Alliance for Minority Participation, high school joint research programs, university/industry seminars and conferences, and web information center.\r\n",
