 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal of the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools (WS/FCS) proposal entitled Science and Mathematics Excellence (SciMaX) is that all students will graduate with the capacity to pursue post-secondary studies and careers in science and mathematics.  Its specific objectives are (1) To complete the implementation of standards-based K-12 mathematics and science program within the District establishing high standards for all students in all classrooms; (2) To increase K-8 proficiency by 4% in End-of-Grade [test] in mathematics, by 5% in 8th grade Algebra I, and by 5 percentile points in science each year; (3) To increase enrollment in upper level mathematics and science courses by 10% each year and achieve an overall completion of 80%; and (4) To partner with universities to ensure that new teachers arrive in the school system with the training needed to teach high-quality, standards-based science and mathematics curriculum.\r\n\r\nWS/FCS plans revision and compacting of the K-8 mathematics curriculum to ensure that all pre-algebra topics are addressed by the end of the 7th grade, which will facilitate successful student performance in algebra at the 8th grade.  Similarly, the District has created a plan to infuse science standards-based, hands-on instruction at all grade levels through the implementation of reform instructional materials and to integrate this subject to mathematics and the Language Arts.  A student safety-net program will be implemented consisting of bridge courses and pre-college programs.  In order to ensure the coherent accomplishment of its objectives, WS/FCS will organize Vertical Leadership Teams (VLT) consisting of a cross section of represented schools, including school principals, counselors, curriculum coordinators, teachers, students, parents, business and post-secondary partners based on a three-cohort model.  \r\n\r\nA comprehensive evaluation plan will enable the leadership to assess progress in every component of the Initiative; and gather, interpret and use data to inform the planning and decision-making process.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
