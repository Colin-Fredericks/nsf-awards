The Paleomagnetics Laboratory Director and PI on this project, is currently collaborating with geologists on research projects in: (a) southeast Alaska; (b) the Bolivian Andes; (c) the Pyrenees of Spain; (d) Nepal; (e) Ethiopia; and (f) northern Tibet.  Funds from this grant will provide partial support for three equipment needs:\r\n\r\n(1)\tThe primary instrument used to measure paleomagnetism is a superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) that uses a refrigeration system to maintain low temperatures of the cryogenic components.  This refrigeration system requires periodic replacement which will be accomplished early in the grant period.\r\n(2)\tA common method of analyzing the magnetism of rock samples is thermal demagnetization in which samples are heated to progressively higher temperatures in a low magnetic field environment.  To increase capacity for processing samples in the laboratory, we will construct three additional thermal demagnetization furnaces. \r\n(3)\tIn paleomagnetic research, it is important to identify and characterize the iron-bearing minerals that carry magnetic signals.  We will purchase and install a Kappabridge susceptometer for measurements of magnetic susceptibility versus temperature and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility.  The resulting data will provide rapid and detailed information permitting identification and characterization of ferrimagnetic minerals.\r\n\r\nPurchase and/or construction of these instrumentation items will permit The Paleomagnetics Laboratory at the University of Arizona to expand productivity and advance the experimental capabilities of this facility.  \r\n***\r\n",
