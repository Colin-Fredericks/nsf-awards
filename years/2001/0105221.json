He will work with the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) project, a program to distribute and operate at least four small, automatic telescopes at widely separated points on Earth in order to capture the early optical emission from an extensive sample of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).  Early observations will yield constraints on characteristics of the burst origins.  The telescope design allows GRB observations during the important window between five and forty seconds after the onset of the event, which no other current or planned experiment will be able to achieve.  Dr. Smith will develop the operational and analysis software, use existing instruments to respond to alerts, install units at the international sites, and train collaborators in the use of the system.  The ROTSE project also provides a large database of all-sky observations for student projects and his work will involve undergraduate students in the research.  He also intends to develop a course in observational astronomy and presentations at a local museum using the ROTSE database, as well as an interactive tool providing access for the public and researchers alike.\r\n***",
