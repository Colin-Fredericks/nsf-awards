Gilmore\r\nDepartment of Psychology\r\nPennsylvania State University\r\nUniversity Park, PA 16802\r\n\r\nWhen moving around the environment, animals generate a pattern of visual\r\nmotion called optic flow.  Optic flow provides information about where and\r\nhow fast the observer is moving.  This information is crucial for safely\r\nmoving through the environment.  Despite its importance, very little is\r\nknown about how the ability to perceive optic flow develops early in life.\r\nThis project will examine how young infants develop the ability to\r\ndetermine which direction they are moving or heading through the\r\nenvironment.  It will examine the role that changes in visual factors, such\r\nas acuity or sensitivity to motion, play in the ability to perceive one's\r\nheading.  The project will examine how infants' emerging abilities to crawl\r\nand walk shape their perceptual capacities.  The project also will examine\r\nhow infants develop the ability to use visual information to maintain\r\nbalance and control posture.  The results will provide new information\r\nabout the development of a perceptual skill that is critical for maintaining\r\nbalance, avoiding collisions, and moving safely through the environment.\r\nIn turn, the results will lay the groundwork for future research into the\r\nimpact of postnatal brain development on other aspects of perceptual and\r\nmotor development.  Finally, this CAREER project will incorporate educational\r\nactivities that will help to train a new generation of students in the\r\nemerging field of developmental \r\n",
