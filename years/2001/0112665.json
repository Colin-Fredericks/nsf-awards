 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research applies networks of sensors and control devices to enhance the performance of civil infrastructure systems, particularly utility lifeline systems, under both emergency and daily operational conditions.  Specific objectives of this research are to: 1) develop a conceptual system design capable of data acquisition, wireless data transmission, data processing/analysis and operational control of a water delivery system;  2) develop innovative neural network-based inverse analysis algorithms and software to determine in near real-time the extent and locations of damage or malfunction sustained by system components such as pipe segments, pipe joints, pumping stations, etc., and 3)  use  Memphis Light, Gas and Water (MLGW) Division's water system for a pilot case study to demonstrate the improvements offered by the system design. The system thus designed represents a new generation of vastly expanded and enhanced  SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems currently used by utilities. In this expanded version, the hydraulic data are sensed and transmitted through mixed wired and wireless communications through the network. The network will automatically detect aggregation points where data from a region are accumulated and trigger local processing.  These points will produce summaries that can then be passed on to central observers.  When necessary, observers will be able to \"drill down\" on specific details with explicit queries and control.\r\n\r\nThe two geographically distant Principal Investigators provide expertise on structures/mechanics, lifeline systems analysis and socio-economic impact of system failure and in computer operating systems, network protocols, and sensor networks.  This combination of civil engineering and computer science expertise represents an ideal interdisciplinary coalition for this research.  Each will support and advise one graduate student and communicate each other through internet and frequently scheduled meetings inviting potential end users from utility organizations.  Broad impacts are expected on the frontier research in lifeline engineering, sensor network technology, simulation and neural network-based analysis of complex systems, and on the practice of lifeline operation and management.\r\n",
