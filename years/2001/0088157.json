 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) The beginning of the new millennium is an exciting time to be teaching and learning Astronomy. Technological advances are allowing us to observe and understand more of our universe than dreamed possible even a few years ago. This project uses the new technology in observational astronomy, combined with simulations, to enhance the laboratory experience of Gustavus Adolphus College students. By changing the focus of the laboratory and observational components of our two astronomy courses, the project provides students with a better appreciation of the universe and of observational techniques, and better prepares advanced students for graduate work in physics and astrophysics. The observational component takes advantage of a combination of 10\" Meade LX- 200 computer-controlled telescopes and Santa Barbara Instrument Group ST7E CCD cameras to provide an introduction to the visible universe through both eyepiece and electronic images. Introductory and advanced students, as well as the many visitors to the Olin Observatory, can explore the solar system, stars, nebulae, and galaxies. With the addition of SBIG spectrometers, filter wheels, and an adaptive optics attachment, the students can make rigorous, quantitative measurements. These measurements, combined with computer simulations, give them a more complete understanding of astronomical research. Approximately 80 students in the general education astronomy course make use of the combination of observation and simulation in the introductory astronomy course each year. About 20 additional students a year benefit when this combination is used at the advanced level in astrophysics in open- ended laboratories and in course-related and student/faculty research projects. Other beneficiaries include grade-school and high-school groups who visit the observatory for programs, as well as the general public who attend for open viewing.",
