 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will focus on the best approaches to sequencing the gene fraction of the maize genome and will develop a comprehensive plan for achieving this goal. Maize is the best studied genetic system in the grasses, with exceptional strengths in facilitating our understanding of plant development, gene regulation (including epigenetics), stress tolerance, transposable element function, and genome evolution. Physical and genetic mapping, mutagenesis, reverse genetics, transformation, and other molecular tools are reliably employed in maize research. However, a major limitation to the continued productivity of maize as a model plant species is the lack of comprehensive understanding of gene content and arrangement of the maize genome. There are now technologies for accomplishing this task in a short time frame and at low cost. Thus, the goal of obtaining a completed sequence of the gene-rich regions of the maize genome is feasible, worthy and timely.\r\n\r\nThe chief goal of the workshop will be to bring together experts in high throughput genomic sequencing and analyses with experts knowledgeable about the properties of the maize genome. This small group, comprising scientists from academia and industry, and observers from government agencies, will discuss strategies for sequencing the maize gene space. The output from this workshop will be a comprehensive plan for proceeding with sequencing the maize genome, an estimation of the resources required, and a timetable for action. This document will be circulated to the wider genetics and genomics communities for comment prior to finalizing the document. A timetable for follow up activities will also be developed.\r\n",
