 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Samuel Galewsky and Dr. Thomas McQuistion at Millikin University.  The grant is for the acquisition of a video microscopy system: including a research compound microscope equipped with DIC, phase contrast and fluorescence optics; a high resolution digital video camera for fluorescence imaging; a zoom stereo microscope with an S-video color low resolution camera attached to it; a color printer; a dedicated computer equipped with a ZIP drive; and software for morphometric and image analysis as well as time lapse videography.  \r\n\tIn Dr. Galewsky's laboratory, which focuses on the developmental regulation of genes during Drosophila embryogenesis, the system will provide significantly better image quality and resolution, enabling student researchers to thoroughly analyze complex staining patterns.   In Dr. McQuistion's laboratory, which is devoted to identifying and classifying intestinal parasites in South American birds, the system will enable further work in determining parasitic prevalence and diversity among different South American host populations.   And in Dr. Judith Parrish's laboratory, the system will enable researchers to view clear images of pollen grains, making possible many additional research projects in the area of pollination ecology.   \r\n\tStudents working in the laboratory will be responsible for independently using the system and its many capabilities in the course of their work.  The system will also be used in multiple teaching laboratories and will thus be introduced to all Millikin biology majors (which number approximately 200 at any one time.) It will even be introduced to all Millikin students via their required science laboratory course, which features a biology laboratory component.   \r\n",
