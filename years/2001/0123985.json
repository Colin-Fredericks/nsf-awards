 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed systems are becoming ever more important as they provide information support for basic infrastructures such as electrical and telephone service, and as a means for corporations to manage worldwide operettas.  They are also becoming ubiquitous because many applications demand greater computational power and require distributed resources.  The net impact is that a vast amount of data needs to be shared across a broad array of users.\r\n\r\nThe proposal plans to investigate the long-term issues of mobility and efficiency in the design of scalable middleware for distributed systems.  The effort will include the implementation of a distributed middleware for mobile environments.  Specific research themes to be pursued are:\r\n- formalization and implementation of consistency requirements for middleware\r\n- algorithms for data placement and replication\r\n- protocols for support of conflict resolution and the support of mobility, and\r\n- incorporation of stream data in a computational framework.\r\n\r\nThe results of these investigations will be the development of an experimental prototype that uses the researched algorithms and protocols.  In order to experiment with the prototype, a number of applications will be implemented in a campus environment.   The goal of the research is to help guide long-term development of middleware at large scale.\r\n",
