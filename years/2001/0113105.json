 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomenal growth of the World Wide Web has resulted in the emergence\r\nand popularity of several new information technology related computer\r\napplications. The emerging computer workloads involve the integration\r\nof a variety of software, protocols, and standards: GUIs, Java, CORBA, \r\ncgi, perl, TCP/IP, HTTP,  and HTML  are  just a few of them. Facilitating\r\nsmooth use of the internet for emerging applications involves designing\r\nefficient computer systems and microprocessors for use in the computers\r\nthat serve these applications.  Most of these workloads are just emerging,\r\nand their behavior is not well-understood by computer designers and\r\narchitects. Many of the microprocessors that run these applications were\r\ndesigned before the advent of these workloads.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research consists of understanding emerging workloads of the\r\nInformation Technology era and designing microprocessors and computer\r\nsystems for their efficient execution. It involves identifying where the\r\ncycles are gone during execution of these workloads, and identifying\r\nsources of  loss of performance. The study will pin point bottlenecks, and\r\nidentify architectural enhancements to improve performance. The\r\nperformance monitoring counters present on commercial processors will be\r\nused for the first level of characterization followed by detailed complete\r\nsystem simulations for analyzing design tradeoffs. The proposed research\r\nwill be conducted in close collaboration with our industrial partners,\r\nIBM, Tivoli, Intel and AMD.  The project will serve as an integral part of\r\na long term, comprehensive research program to influence the design of\r\nmicroprocessors and computer systems for the information technology era. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
