 "awd_abstract_narration": "Program for Gender Equity in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (PGE): Dis: Science, Gender and After School: Creating a Research/Action Agenda\r\n\r\nEducational Equity Concepts, Inc. (EEC), in collaboration with the Directorate for \r\nHuman Resources and Education at the American Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science (AAAS), and the Academy for Educational Development (AED) requests \r\n$100,000 over 18 months from the National Science Foundation Program for Gender\r\nEquity for a dissemination project to create a research/action agenda around SMET\r\nprogramming for girls in the informal, out-of-school learning arena. The overall \r\ngoal of the project is to use after-school programming as a vehicle to both engage \r\nand sustain girls= interest in pursuing education and careers in SMET. Specific \r\nobjectives are to: (1) bring together a multi-disciplinary group of researchers and \r\npractitioners in a working conference setting; (2) develop a research/action agenda; \r\n(3) develop an action plan to carry out the agenda; and (4) disseminate the\r\nconference proceedings to researchers, practitioners, gender equity activists, \r\npolicy-makers, and funders who are involved in informal and SMET education. \r\nResearch focusing on girls at this juncture is critical because although there are \r\na growing number of SMET programs, we do not know which programs are effective\r\nand which are not, especially with regard to engaging and supporting girls interest in \r\nSMET. \r\n\r\nThe out-of-school learning arena encompasses community and school-based after-\r\nschool programs; summer camp and Saturday/weekend programs; museum programs; \r\nprograms at community technology centers; college/university science programs; \r\non-line science clubs and competitions; and programs offered by girl-specific\r\norganizations. After-school as an educational field (rather than child-minding\r\nor purely recreational) is both new and growing. Moreover, we are moving rapidly \r\ntoward a technology-based economy where women are an increasing part of the\r\nworkforce. This conference will take advantage of a ground floor opportunity \r\nto create a research/action agenda and inform the development of SMET programs\r\nthat are free of gender and other forms of bias--race, ethnicity and disability \r\nthat have traditionally contributed to educational inequality. \r\n\r\nThe agenda created at the conference will be distributed to a broad audience of \r\nresearchers, practitioners, gender equity activists, policy-makers, and funders. \r\nIn doing so, the conference will extend awareness and information about the \r\nparticipation of girls and women in SMET education; catalyze new thinking on\r\nthe subject; and serve as a springboard for research and action. Dissemination\r\nwill take place via journals, publications, web sites, listservs, and professional \r\nassociation conferences. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
