 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 12th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research will be held at\r\nthe University of Wisconsin, Madison WI, June 23 - 27, 2001. The aim of this\r\nconference is to provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas among\r\nresearchers of the international Arabidopsis research community.  The\r\nconference will include sessions on genomics, metabolism and metabolic\r\nregulation, cell biology, inductive processes, genetic mechanisms,\r\nevolution, responses to the biotic environment, responses to the abiotic\r\nenvironment, pattern formation and cell fate, and sex and reproductive\r\ndevelopment.  An important component of the conference is that approximately\r\n40 speakers will be chosen by the session chairs from submitted abstracts\r\nfor short talks.  The majority of these talks will be given by graduate\r\nstudents, postdoctoral researchers, or PIs at early stages of their careers.\r\n This will ensure presentation of the latest results and provide important\r\ncareer development for the selected speakers.  The conference will also\r\ninclude workshops on topics put forward by the Arabidopsis community.  A\r\nworkshop to foster international collaboration on Arabidopsis functional\r\ngenomics and the NSF-supported Arabidopsis 2010 initiative is already\r\nplanned.  Last year's Arabidopsis Conference at this same site attracted\r\napproximately 900 participants.  At least this many participants are\r\nexpected this year due to the accelerated pace of Arabidopsis research\r\nresulting in part from the completion of the genome sequence for this\r\norganism, and due to the small number of plant-related conferences scheduled\r\nfor summer 2001.  Facilities are available to accommodate up to 1000\r\nparticipants.\r\n",
