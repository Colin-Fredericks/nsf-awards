 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses basic issues of materials at nanoscale dimensions. The research will investigate thermodynamic properties of Si nanostructures and silicide interfaces using a new and highly sensitive calorimetric device. For example, the phenomenon of melting point depression for surface-supported particles  can be measured for particles as small as 1000 atoms.\r\nThe focus is on understanding unique properties and behavior of nanometer-sized materials. The approach is to measure thermodynamic properties of Si nanostructures and silicide interfaces including structural stability and heat capacity to establish a more complete picture of the material physics of structures at these dimensions. Earlier investigations of magic number(integers of atomic layers) nanostructures from metals to semiconductor Si nanostructures will be extended by measuring the specific heat, melting temperature, and associated enthalpy, as well as particle size using TEM. \r\n%%% \r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a contemporary topical area of materials science with high potential significance and technological relevance. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The project is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to develop strong technical, communication, and organizational/management skills through unique experiences made possible by a forefront research environment. \r\n",
