 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the generation and synthetic applications of short-lived reactive intermediates, including 1,3-dipoles, ortho-quinodimethanes, alpha-keto carbocations, beta-trimethylsilyl- and beta-alkoxy-substituted carbocations.  Both electrochemical and chemical means will be utilized to generate the intermediates.  The use of microemulsions and/or ionic liquids may prove to have advantages over classical solvents as media for organic electrochemical reactions.  In addition, there is a potential benefit to society if new \"green\" electrochemical methods are realized from this research.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Albert J. Fry in the Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University.  Professor Fry's research investigates the generation and reactivity of a number of short-lived organic intermediates.  In particular, the proposed electrocatalytic regeneration of hydrogen iodide as a reducing agent and the electrocatalytic oxidation has the potential to lead to the development of new, environmentally friendly reactions.  These reactions could become new environmentally benign and efficient industrial processes.",
