 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fred Friendly Seminars is producing a three-part, prime-time television series about the ethical, legal and social implications of advances in genetic research and technology.   The audience for the series is the general public with special emphasis on the scientific and policy-making communities.  Each of the programs will begin with a presentation of the basic genetic science linked to a specific ethical and policy issue and then will engage a panel in a Socratic dialogue based on a hypothetical situation related to that issue.  The panel will represent a wide range of perspective including scientists, policy makers and people experiencing the dilemmas presenting in the hypothetical situations.\r\n\r\nOutreach material for the project will be developed by the National Center for Science Literacy, Education and Technology and Exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History.  The center will produce a 16-page discussion guide designed for by a variety of informal education organizations that reach the general public.   This guide will be available in both print and on the project web site.  In addition to the guide, the web site include guidelines about how to use segments of the series as catalysts for discussion, a list of annotated resources on genetics, and a behind-the-scenes look at the genomic research labs of the museum.\r\n\r\n",
