 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a standard award to one of three institutions collaborating as partners on Thompson's project (0121084).   No current system allows a person to naturally walk through a large-scale virtual environment.  The availability of such a locomotion interface would have impacts on a broad range of applications, including education and training, design and prototyping, physical fitness, and rehabilitation;  for some of these applications natural walking provides a level of realism not obtainable if movement through the simulated world is controlled by devices such as a joystick, while for others realistic walking is a fundamental requirement. Prototypes have been built for a variety of computer-controlled devices on which a person can walk, but there has been little investigation of the utility of such devices as interfaces to a virtual world and almost no study at all of the interactions of visual and biomechanical perceptual cues in such devices.   This project addresses key open questions, the answers to which are needed if locomotion interfaces are to offer effective interaction between users and computer simulations.   An effective locomotion interface must provide users with accurate visual and biomechanical sensations of walking;  thus, a key objective of this work is to determine how to synergistically combine visual information generated by computer graphics with biomechanical information generated by devices that simulate walking on real surfaces.   Thompson and his collaborators will investigates methods that allow more accurate walking in a locomotion interface while accurately conveying a sense of the spaces being walked through.  Specific issues to be considered include how to facilitate the perception of speed and distance traveled, how to provide a compelling sense of turning when actual walking along a curved path is not possible, how to give a user the sense that he/she is walking over a sloped surface, and more generally how to give a user a clear sense of the scale and structure of the spaces being walked through.   The team's findings on these issues will be relevant across the spectrum of possible approaches to locomotion interfaces.\r\n",
