 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cammers-Goodwin's research focuses on two biomimetic themes in molecular modularity. In one project the development of chiral foldamer-based molecular recognition is proposed and the other proposes the exploration of molecular encapsulation in the mimicry of the structure and function of viral bodies. The synthesis and study of solution-phase conformations of chiral oligoureas is planned. The binding phenomena between helical conformations of the proposed oligoureas will be studied. The helical conformations of the oligoureas will create hydrophilic internal and hydrophobic external molecular surface area, which will be useful when the oligoureas are included in hydrophobic membranes and on polymeric solid supports to transduce signal. These helical macromolecular conformers will possess protic and/or charged internal cavities and hydrocarbon-based exteriors. Molecular architecture of this sort may find use in chemical sensors or in chiral separations.\r\n\r\nMolecular motifs will be used to assemble viral-like bodies to mimic both the structure and function of real viruses. Encapsulation of anionic species is sought in the structural and functional mimicry of natural viral particles. Perhaps structural mimicry of viral assemblies will lead to drug delivery to cells without the viral pathogenic response.\r\n\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Arthur Cammers-Goodwin of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky. Professor Cammers-Goodwin's research addresses the nature of the interaction between biological molecules. Professor Cammers-Goodwin's educational activities include mentoring students and teaching a new course entitled Computational Molecular design.",
