Optimal foraging theory predicts that defendable territories of limited access are likely to produce conservation-oriented behaviors, such as foregoing the harvest of marine animals based on individual size or local population depletion. An alternative view of small-scale human society holds that people are often socially invested in conserving future stocks without regard for specific territorial rights.  Hypotheses from these alternative theories will be tested in this research, using measurements of catch, patch time allocation, and return rates.  The data and will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the microecology of fishing, and will be useful for localized and cooperative management institutions to provide them with a stronger basis of effective management of coastal resources.  The project in addition contributes to the training of a young social scientist, and advances our understanding of this important region of the world. \r\n",
