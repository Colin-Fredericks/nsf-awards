Each of the 90-second programs will explore an area of on-going research and will feature \"actualities\" or recorded voices of scientists explaining their work.  The programs will be carried on 700+ public and commercial radio stations.  The broadcast programs will be supplemented by an \"Edge of Discovery\" web presence that will contain the radio programs themselves plus a \"More Info\" section for each program that includes references to printed articles and links to other web sites on the day's topic as well as supplementary background material such as transcripts of interviews with scientists.  The \"Edge of Discovery\" web page also will feature a \"Meet the Scientists\" section in which a new scientist will be profiled each month, and it will feature live online \"chats\" with scientists six times each year.\r\n\r\nThe producers/hosts for the series are Deborah Byrd and Joel Block who created, produced and hosted the highly successful radio series Earth and Sky.  The Senior Producer is Marc Airhart who will be primary liaison with the team of researchers and writers.  Review of all material developed for the projected will be done by the project's review committee of 95 scientists.\r\n\r\n",
