The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide twelve months of support to Dr. Anna E. Rhoades to work with Dr. Gilad Haran at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel.  Co-funding for this project comes from the Math and Physical Science Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to characterize the folding and conformational dynamics of a single cytochrome c molecule with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy.  Experiments will focus on developing this technique for measuring conformational fluctuations and using it for studies in varying equilibrium conditions, to obtain both equilibrium and kinetic information.  The PI will develop a model that explains how a protein folds from a linear chain of amino acids through a series of conformational intermediates, to its functional three-dimensional structure.  The protein-folding problem is sometimes referred to as the \"second half of the genetic code\" and is one of the major unresolved problems in contemporary biophysics.  The impact of this research will be in areas such as the determination of the structure of a protein based on its gene sequence, understanding the misfolding and aggregation of particular proteins involved in some diseases.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory of the Weizmann Institute has all the necessary equipment required to accomplish the goals described in this proposal.\r\n",
