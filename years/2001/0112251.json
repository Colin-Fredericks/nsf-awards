Organized by Dr. Michael D. Garrick of SUNY in collaboration with Dr. Marco T. Nunez of the University of Chile,  \r\nthe objective of this workshop is to strengthen international scientific collaboration in research on iron and copper metabolism, and to stimulate the interest of young scientists and students in an area highly relevant to the understanding of toxicology, health and disease states.  \r\n\r\nIron and copper metabolisms are intimately intertwined: systemic copper deficiency generates cellular iron deficiency, which in humans results in diminished work capacity, reduced intellectual capacity, diminished growth, alterations in bone mineralization, diminished immune response and other symptoms.  This workshop will try to provide a better understanding of iron and copper metabolisms and particularly of their interactions.\r\n\r\nThis proposed workshop will convene leading scientists in the fields of iron and copper metabolism from North America, South America, Europe, Israel and Japan, to exchange knowledge, and to establish future avenues of collaborative research.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
