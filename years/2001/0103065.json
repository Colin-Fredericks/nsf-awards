 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to Clemson University is cofunded by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS), and Design, Manufacturing and Industrial Innovations (ENG), and is part of the Nanoscale Science and Engineering program.  Under this project, George Chumanov will develop novel techniques to simultaneously synthesize and assemble silver nanoparticles in multidimensional structures with nanoscale spacing.  Monodispersed silver nanoparticles with tunable optical properties will be formed by liquid droplet formation and hydrogen reduction with electrostatic focusing for particle transport and assembly on different substrates.  This electrostatic focusing method could develop a new bench-top technology for routine particle deposition in the nanometer range and spacing.  In addition, the research project will provide education and training opportunities to undergraduate students in the assembly, processing and characterization of nano particles with specialized optical properties.  \r\n\r\nUnder the award, novel monodispersed silver nanoparticles with tunable optical properties will be formed by liquid droplet formation and hydrogen reduction. Electrostatic focusing will be used to transport and assemble nanoparticles on different substrates. These multidimensional regular arrays of nanoparticles are expected to be robust, and could be used in next generation photonic and optoelectronic devices. The method once fully developed could provide a bench-top procedure for routine nanoparticle deposition.",
