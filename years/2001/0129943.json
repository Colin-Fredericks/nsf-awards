 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to characterize a Nicotiana tabacum membrane transporter that\r\nmay be responsible for the transport of alkaloids from their initial site of biosynthesis in roots to\r\nxylem tissue and for their final accumulation in leaves. This will be accomplished by using a gene\r\nfragment previously isolated during transcriptional profiling experiments as a hybridization\r\nprobe to isolate the full-length cDNA. With this cDNA in hand, an extensive effort will be made\r\nto determine the tissue and intercellular localization patterns of the putative alkaloid transport\r\nprotein, using both RNase protection assays and transgenic reporter gene fusions. Biochemical\r\nconfirmation of alkaloid transport activity will be accomplished by heterologous expression of\r\nthe putative alkaloid transporter in Xenopus oocytes and directly measuring alkaloid transport\r\nkinetics. Finally, in vivo modulation of the putative alkaloid transporter gene expression levels\r\nwill be achieved using overexpression and antisense transgenic hairy root cultures to assess the\r\neffect on overall alkaloid accumulation levels. These experiments may lead to the first\r\nidentification and molecular characterization of a postulated alkaloid transporter that is\r\nresponsible for mobilizing alkaloids between their site of biosynthesis in specific root cell types\r\ntowards their site of action in the leaves. This would be a significant contribution to\r\nunderstanding both how and why the site of biosynthesis of many plant secondary metabolites is\r\noften spatially separated from the site of action of these important defense compounds.",
