 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together a diverse array of scholars from around\r\nthe country, including computer scientists, 3D modellers and animators,\r\ntheater practioners, and theater and music historians. The objective is\r\nto use digital technology to address a problem fundamental to performance\r\nscholarship and pedagogy: how to represent and communicate the phenomenon\r\nof live performance using media. This problem becomes especially pressing\r\nwhen the objective is to represent a performance tradition from the past.\r\nNeither a written description nor a filmed recreation is capable of conveying\r\nthe experience of attending a live performance, an experience that encompasses\r\nnot only the way the performance on stage looks and sounds from the perspective\r\nof spectators in different parts of the theatre, but also spectator's\r\nperceptions of and interactions with one another.\r\n\r\nOur proposed solution to this problem is to recreate historical performances\r\nin a virtual reality environment. The central objective is to simulate\r\na feeling of \"liveness\" in this environment: the sensation of being\r\nsurrounded by human activity onstage, in the audience and backstage,\r\nand the ability to choose where to look at any given time (onstage\r\nor off) and to move within the environment. With respect to the performers\r\nthemselves, a critical concern is to find a way to bring the nuances\r\nof great stage performances into the virtual environment. To this end,\r\nwe propose to use motion capture technology to capture real-world performances\r\nby professional, highly skilled actors, singers, dancers, acrobats\r\nand musicians.\r\n\r\nKey to our project is the depth of the proposed collaboration between\r\ntechnology, scholarship, pedagogy and art. This project is conceived\r\nto make a significant contribution to all four domains simultaneously,\r\nrather than merely using any one in the service of the others. The end\r\nresult will represent an important advance in the design and implementation\r\nof virtual environments, building on recent successes in creating\r\nphoto-realistic simulations of real 3D environments. The scale of this\r\nsimulation, and in particular the complexity and precision of the character\r\nanimation, pose an important technical challenge: how to integrate the complex\r\npre-defined motion capture-generated animations of the onstage performances\r\nwith the autonomous behaviors of characters in the audience and backstage.The\r\nproject also constitute an invaluable work of applied scholarship,\r\nan unprecedented resource for visualizing past performances and testing\r\nhypotheses about historical performance practices. It will provide\r\nan unprecedented resource for students to engage with historical performance\r\ntraditions as performance (and not as literature or film). Finally,\r\nfrom an artistic perspective, the Virtual Vaudeville project will test\r\nthe potential of virtual environments to provide truly high-quality\r\ntheater experiences to remote audiences.\r\n~",
