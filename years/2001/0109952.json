 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Patricia Urban, Edward\r\nSchortman, and Ms. Marne Ausec have worked to describe and explain changes in\r\nprehistoric power relations within the adjoining Naco and lower Cacaulapa\r\nvalleys, Northwestern Honduras.  The basic question has been, and remains,\r\n\"How did a few come to rule the many?\"  Answering this deceptively\r\nstraightforward query requires examining the ways in which local rulers\r\nmarshaled political and economic forces within their societies and forged\r\nalliances with peers in neighboring realms.  The hypothesis guiding this\r\nresearch proposes that: 1. Rulers exercised dominion by monopolizing local\r\naccess to imported commodities valued and needed by the general populace, as\r\nwell as locally produced items, such as ceramic vessels and stone tools; 2.\r\nCommoners surrendered their labor and loyalty to local notables in return for\r\naccess to these goods; 3. Unwilling to go gently into dependence, commoners\r\nalso used their skills and immediately available resources to make as many\r\nitems for their own use and trade as possible, thereby minimizing reliance on\r\nlocal lords; 4. This competition resulted in a population divided by the\r\npower ndividuals, families, or factions could wield and the wealth they \r\nenjoyed.\r\nWork funded by the National Science Foundation in Naco, from 1990-1996, was\r\ninstrumental in establishing this model; investigations pursued in the lower\r\nCacaulapa valley from 1999-2000, also funded by the NSF, are crucial to\r\ntesting these ideas.  Survey of 7km2 in the lower Cacaulapa drainage\r\nidentified a major political capital, El Coyote, with over 340 prehistoric\r\nstructures covering 0.7km2.  Excavation of 2,850m2 on and around 40 buildings\r\nat El Coyote and in five rural sites revealed a history of occupation that\r\ndiverged markedly from the expected.  Specifically, emerging data patterns\r\nsuggest that first, El Coyote came to prominence during the Late Classic\r\nperiod (AD 600-950; the site was founded as early as AD200), possibly as an\r\noutpost of its larger Naco Valley contemporary, La Sierra.  Second, rather\r\nthan staying within La Sierra's shadow, El Coyote's rulers established their\r\nindependence by AD 1000.  Third, building on their new-found autonomy, lower\r\nCacaulapa notables went on to fashion a realm that was growing in size and\r\ncomplexity, and acquiring goods from as far away as central Mexico and\r\nGuatemala's Pacific coast, between AD 1000-1300, when neighboring societies,\r\nincluding those in Naco, suffered profound declines.  Assessing these \r\npreliminary interpretations requires further analyses of ceramics, stone \r\ntools, faunal and floral remains, as well as human skeletons, to be conducted \r\nwith National Science Foundation support during May through December, 2001.  \r\nThese studies will focus on: 1.  stylistic studies of artifacts, particularly \r\nceramics, designed to help date deposits, and infer the external connections \r\nenjoyed by lower Cacaulapa residents through time; 2. technological analyses \r\naimed at identifying the range and scale of specialized production activities \r\nin which residents of El Coyote and its hinterland engaged; 3. functional \r\nstudies aimed at reconstructing changes in patterns of consumption and \r\nproduction across time and space; 4. distributional assessments, to test for \r\nartifact patterns suggestive of wealth and power differences; 5. examination \r\nof skeletal remains to describe demographic processes as well as stresses (for \r\nexample, dietary deficiencies, injuries, physical changes from movements \r\nunique to certain occupations) to which lower Cacaulapa populations were heir.\r\n The planned work is crucial to writing lower Cacaulapa valley prehistory and \r\ncomparing the ways in which political and economic processes were manipulated \r\nthere and within other ancient states.  The research applies not just to \r\nHonduras, or even the ancient New World, but to any society in which those \r\nseeking power tried to alter their societies, while others resisted \r\ndomination.\r\n\r\n",
