 "awd_abstract_narration": "0080040\r\nClearfield, Abraham\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the synthesis of micro and mesoporous materials based upon two types of reactions; the pillaring of a newly synthesized vanadyl phosphate and the designed exploitation of metal phosphonate chemistry.   The novel vanadyl phosphate is a dark green layered compound that intercalates amines and on refluxing in alcohol solution exfoliates.  In this condition it reacts with inorganic polymers to produce porous pillared products with high surface areas and uniform pores sizes.  A second type of reaction involving gel formation of the vanadyl phosphate with first row transition metal acetates also leads to porous materials of unknown structure, where pores in both cases can tuned to narrow ranges in the important intermediate size range of 10 to 25 nanometers.  The second class of materials is more involved with the design of porosity by choice of the phosphonic acid and metal.  The nature of reactions leading to new materials will be probed and the materials characterized by use of X-ray and electron diffraction, NMR and vibration spectroscopies, electron microscopy, surface area and pore size measurements and where needed computer modeling procedures.  The ion exchange, sorption and complexing behavior, and catalytic properties as well as electronic and magnetic behavior of selected compounds from both the vanadium and phosphonate studies will be examined.\r\n%%%\r\nMeso and microporous materials area predicted to be useful as catalysts, adsorbents, molecular silvers, ion exchanges and in special cases exhibit interesting electronic and magnetic behavior.  This project should result in discovery of new phenomena related to formation of porous structures and will serve as an excellent vehicle for training students, including undergraduates, in the design of new materials with functional properties.\r\n",
