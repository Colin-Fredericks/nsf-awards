 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systemic Research, Inc. proposes to develop and implement a progress indicator monitoring system for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP). Since the inception of the program in 1998, HBCU-UP has provided a foundationfor sustainable improvements of science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) instructional and outreach programs. Along with other ethnic diversity continuum programs within NSF, the overarching goal of HBSU-UP is to increases the number of underrepresented ethnic minorities well prepared for participation and leadership in the SMET workforce. The program emphasized the implementation of comprehensive institutional approaches to strengthen SMET teaching and learning primarily focusing on improvement of access, retention, and graduation from undergraduate programs, including the transition between high school and college, 2- and 4- year colleges, undergraduate and graduate studies, and from college to the workplace. \r\n\r\nThe Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA, 1993) mandates that Federal agencies account for program results; the HBSU program has been classified as part of undergraduate support for broadening participation with the primary goal of increasing the number of baccalaureate recipients. The HBCU-UP program also directly aims at the goals defined by the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (November 1, 1993) , \"sustainable improvements of science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) instructional and outreach programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\"\r\n\r\nWithin the context of HBCU-UP goals and relevant GPRA requirements, Systemic Research proposes to develop and implement a HBCU-UP indicator monitoring system (IMS) based on HBCU-UP goals and objectives, project activities and components, and self-evaluation and assessment questions designed to assist in self-assessment of the individual sites' progress, as well as overall program effectiveness. The first year will be devoted to the design of the framework, development of prototype IMS instruments, and field-testing with selected HBCU sites. Beginning in the second year, the IMS instruments will be delivered to HBCUs during a workshop. The workshop will also be designed for institutional data managers to share ideas in indicator management and to enhance the integrity of collected data. The data collected during the second year will be compiled into a two volume Fact Book.\r\n\r\nSince 1995, Systemic Research has had extensive experience working with minority serving institutions, including a few HBCU's, through it's involvement in NSF's Model Institution for Excellence Program (MIE) funded by NSF and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Systemic Research developed a progress indicator database, MSET (MIE Self-Evaluation Template), based on a conceptual and operational framework for MIE program effectiveness. The MIE program goal is very similar to that of HBCU-UP: to strengthen the infrastructure of minority serving institutions (HBCUs, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities) in SMET education and undergraduate research, and to increase the number of students who pursue advanced SMET degrees.\r\nSystemic Research will disseminate a two volume HBCU Fact Book: one for overall progress, and the other for individual sites' progress. The published reports will be available in three formats: hard copy, CD-ROM, and web version. Systemic Research will also host a web site to promote communications and\r\nnetworking among the participating HBCUs.\r\n",
