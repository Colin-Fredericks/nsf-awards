The award supports the acquisition of a focussed ion beam (FIB) workstation for processing of single crystals and nanometer size materials in order to investigate their magnetic and magneto-optic properties. FIB is an ultra-high precision tool for etching and writing with 10-nanometer resolution. The workstation will complement existing facility at UN and will be used in a number of currently funded projects at the institution. It provides new capability for the study of devices at the nano scale with a high probability for discovery of new phenomena. The instrument will benefit the education and training of a large number of graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdocs at the University of Nebraska.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is a joint award from the Major Research Instrumentation program and the NSF/EPSCoR program to the University of Nebraska (UN).
