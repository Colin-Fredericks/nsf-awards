 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for DMS - 0104196\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe three principle investigators on this proposal will be\r\ninvolved in research in the following areas:  Barry Mazur will be involved\r\nin at least four major projects.  The first concerns Euler systems and\r\ntheir applications in algebraic geometry, arithmetic and analytic number\r\ntheory.  The second project will study interpolations of modular\r\neigenforms via special curves.  The third concerns the ABC conjecture in\r\nnumber theory and the fourth concerns rational points on rationally\r\nconnected varieties.  Raoul Bott will conduct research at the interface\r\nbetween mathematics and physics including research topics that relate to\r\ncomputational complexity, equivariant cohomology, diffeomorphism groups\r\nand toric varieties.  The major project of Clifford Taubes concerns the\r\ncoding of smooth 4-manifold structures by the pseudo-holomorphic curves\r\ndefined by their self-dual 2-forms.  The first long range goal is to read\r\noff invariants of smooth 4-manifolds from these curves.  The second goal\r\nis to use them to simplify a presentation of the manifold.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some comments of a less technical nature about this\r\nresearch:  Barry Mazurs work concerns properties of the integers and\r\nrelations between them.  A typical question asks for integers, say a, b\r\nand c, that satisfy some given equation.  An example is the equation of\r\nPythagoreas, which asks that the sum of the squares of a and b equal that\r\nof c.  There are very general and natural classes of such relations (such\r\nas those involved in the now proved Fermat conjecture) that probe to the\r\nheart of the theory of numbers; and the study of such equations forms the\r\ncore of Mazurs research.  Raoul Botts work probes the manner in which\r\nfamilies of symmetries can be used to simplify computations in mathematics\r\nand theoretical physics.  These symmetries relate different structures and\r\noften this relation equates a simple to understand property of one system\r\nto a mysterious and not understood property of another.  Clifford Taubes\r\nmajor project probes the possibilities for the large scale structure of\r\nfour dimensional universes.  Our universe has four dimensions, these the\r\nusual three dimensions of space plus time as the fourth.  This said, the\r\nresearch seeks to provide a complete list of the possible large scale\r\nstructures for a universe such as ours.  To put this in perspective, there\r\nis a conjectured list for all possible three dimensional spaces, but there\r\nis as yet no credible conjecture for a similar list for four dimensions.\r\n\r\n",
