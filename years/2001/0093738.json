The investigators will focus on developing methodologies for analyzing symbolic data. The approach involves scientific computing in conjunction with numerical and statistical analysis concepts. This project addresses the twin goals of developing methodologies for symbolic data analysis, extending it to more general and complex data, and the reviewing of current methods for areas that need further research.  Mathematical foundation and robustness of these methods will also be studied.  Symbolic data are useful for summarizing large data sets to render them manageable for analysis.  Few methods currently exist to analyze symbolic data and will be needed as the demand for large scientific data sets increases and symbolic data become more prevalent. \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate student.  INRIA will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The project takes advantage of the French investigator's computational expertise. He has developed the basic concepts involved in symbolic data.  This is complemented by US expertise in statistics and statistical analysis.  \r\n",
