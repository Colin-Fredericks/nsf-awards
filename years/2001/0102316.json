They generalize embedded\r\nincompressible surfaces, and are remarkably useful in obtaining\r\ntopological and geometric information of 3-manifolds.  The main\r\ngoal of this project is to explore the relationships between the\r\ntopology of 3-manifolds and these two objects.  The tools that\r\nthe investigator will use include branched surfaces and immersed\r\nbranched surfaces that have been proved to be extremely useful in\r\nthe investigator's previous work.  The investigator intends to\r\ncontinue his research on essential laminations and immersed\r\nsurfaces with the following goals.  (1) To construct essential\r\nlaminations in 3-manifolds obtained from Dehn surgery on\r\nhyperbolic knots.  The techniques to be developed in this\r\nresearch could potentially have great impact on some famous\r\nconjectures in knot theory, e.g., Property P for knots and the\r\ncabling conjecture.  (2) To find an algorithm to decide whether a\r\n3-manifold is a Seifert fiber space.  The investigator intends to\r\nuse immersed branched surfaces and normal surface theory to find\r\na practical algorithm.  (3) To show that two homotopy equivalent\r\n3-manifolds, which contain essential laminations, are\r\nhomeomorphic.  (4) To find an algorithm to decide whether a\r\n3-manifold contains an essential lamination.\r\n\r\nThree-manifolds are objects modeled on the 3-dimensional space\r\nthat we are living in.  These objects can be found in many other\r\nsciences, such as physics, biology, and chemistry.  A geometric\r\nway of studying 3-manifolds, which is extremely fruitful, is to\r\nview a 3-manifold as a collection of 3-dimensional pieces glued\r\ntogether along 2-dimensional surfaces.  The investigator plans to\r\nstudy the structure of 3-manifolds using such 2-dimensional\r\nsurfaces, which are called essential laminations and immersed\r\nessential surfaces.  The research in this project is related to\r\nknot theory, which has helped to understand the structure of DNA;\r\nit is also related to hyperbolic geometry, which has been used by\r\nphysicists to understand the universe.\r\n",
