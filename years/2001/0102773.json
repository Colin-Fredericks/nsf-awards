The UMEB Program will collaborate with faculty researchers in the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) and the Museum of Southwestern Biology (MSB).  The goals of the UMEB program are: (1) instruct undergraduates in the principles of scientific research, (2) expose the students to a wide variety of ecological research techniques and career opportunities, (3) facilitate individual student research projects, and (4) encourage students to continue their scientific education in upper-division courses and graduate school.  Emphasis in student recruitment will ensure high participation by students from underrepresented ethnic groups.  \r\nThese activities will provide training in theoretical and technical aspects of ecological research, and promote a holistic approach to large-scale ecological studies.  \r\n\r\nThe UMEB program will contribute to four significant areas of research training in the United States:  (1)  Assist in counteracting current and anticipated shortages of Ph.D.'s for teaching at colleges and universities and conducting research in the national interest; (2) increase the ethnic diversity of students entering the ranks of professional scientists in the field of Environmental Biology;  (3) provide students with essential information regarding graduate school program selection and enrollment; and (4) facilitate hands-on research experiences for undergraduate minority students, so as to prepare these students for the demands of graduate school and professional scientific careers.\r\n\r\n",
