But it is not easy\r\nfor researchers to collaborate on these topics because of a\r\nhistorical gulf that separates the disciplines.  In order to\r\novercome that gulf, the Board on Mathematical Sciences of the\r\nNational Research Council, in collaboration with the NRC's Board\r\non Life Sciences, holds a workshop, involving some 70 people\r\nacross the disciplines, to (1) stimulate some new collaborations\r\nand insights on the spot and (2) provide an introduction for\r\nmathematical scientists (disseminated via print and the Internet)\r\nof some mathematical research directions that contribute to\r\nimportant ongoing research in the biological and biomedical\r\nsciences.\r\n     At the workshop, leading researchers in dynamical modeling\r\nof cellular functions, in modeling of disease states, and in\r\nneuroscience describe some of the major research challenges in\r\ntheir fields.  They do not limit themselves to \"mathematical\"\r\nchallenges; workshop discussions are focused on identifying the\r\nmathematical and statistical research that should be undertaken\r\nin order to advance the biological and biomedical research\r\nagendas.  By involving a broad range of mathematical scientists,\r\nthe workshop brings a number of different perspectives and ideas\r\nto bear on the open questions raised by the presentations.  The\r\naim is to stimulate a wide-ranging discussion and distill out the\r\nbest ideas.  The workshop's summary will be widely disseminated\r\nin order to give many more mathematical scientists the basic\r\nunderstanding needed to become engaged in biological and\r\nbiomedical research.\r\n\r\n",
