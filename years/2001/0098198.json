 "awd_abstract_narration": "A higher-type function is a function that takes as arguments, or\r\nproduces as results, other functions.  Higher-type functions have\r\nproven to be valuable tools in both theoretical and practical work\r\nin programming.  Indeed, higher-type constructs (e.g., classes,\r\ncomponents, modules, etc.)  pervade contemporary computing.  There\r\nis a great deal of useful theoretical work in support of reasoning\r\nabout the correctness of programs that make use of higher-order\r\nfeatures.  In contrast, there has been relatively little theoretical\r\nwork in support of reasoning about the performance (e.g., time and\r\nspace usage) of such programs.  It is clearly a great folly to\r\nignore correctness in program development, but it is nearly as great\r\na folly to ignore performance.  Thus there is a serious gap in the\r\nscientific underpinnings of programs that use higher-type\r\nfeatures---even benchmarking a higher-type procedure is problematic\r\nin the absence of a theory to help interpret what the results mean.\r\n\r\nHigher-type complexity theory extends the general program of\r\ncomputational complexity to a higher-type setting.  This project\r\nproposes the investigation of several topics in higher-type\r\ncomplexity theory, particularly its relation to the recent results\r\non realizer models of higher-type computation.  These topics\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\n1. Continuity and feasible computation.  The (Scott) continuous\r\nfunctionals of finite type are a key object of study in programming\r\nlanguage theory. There are examples of continuous functionals of\r\nfinite type that are arguably feasibly computable, but do not fit\r\nwithin prior notions of higher-type feasibility.  This project\r\nproposes use an appropriate polynomial-time version of Kleene's\r\nassociate/realizer framework to develop and investigate notions of\r\nfeasible computation in the context of the continuous functionals.\r\n\r\n2. Prompt fixed points.  Various sorts of fixed points are another\r\nkey tool in the theory of programming languages, especially in\r\nexplaining forms of recursion.  The project proposes to explore\r\ncertain form of feasible, or prompt, fixed points so as to provide a\r\ngeneral context for recent work on feasible higher-type recursions.\r\n\r\n3. Efficient programming systems for SR. The sequentially realizable\r\nfunctionals (SR) is another class of functionals that have been the\r\nfocus of some important in programming languages theory.  A key\r\nquestion about SR is whether there is a complexity-theoretically\r\nreasonable programming language for the class.  The PI has a partial\r\nnegative result related to this.  The project proposes to extend\r\nthis work. \r\n\r\n4. Maximal notions of higher-type computation.  The project proposes\r\nto show that the (effective) continuous and the (effective) SR\r\nfunctionals both satisfy a structural maximality property amongst\r\nhigher-type notions of computations.",
