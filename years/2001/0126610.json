 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAfrican American and Latina/Latino Adolescents' Perceptions of and Responses to Racial Discrimination\r\n\r\nWilliam David Wakefield\r\n\r\nStudent achievement typically has been defined as performing well on academic coursework and successfully advancing through each grade level until graduation.  However, in today's multiethnic, multiracial, culturally diverse society, another factor that may influence academic achievement for ethnic minority young people is their perceptions of discrimination in U.S. society. Discrimination likely influences orientation toward school and subsequently academic achievement. This research is grounded in the disciplines of adolescent development and social psychology.  Two facets of particular interest in this study include better understanding factors influencing adolescents' perceptions of discrimination and subsequent thinking about how to respond to racial discrimination.  \r\n\r\nThis project has three goals:  (1) to develop a clear understanding of how adolescents' understand and think about perceived discrimination that they may likely encounter at school and outside of school using developed quantitative measures and through development of qualitative interviews; (2) to disseminate the results to a national audience through peer-reviewed documents and presentations and including undergraduate and graduate research assistants in national conference participation, presentations, and publications; and (3) to create a viable and sustainable research and mentorship program within the Interdisciplinary Program in Child Development at California State University, Northridge.  This program will mentor and train underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in social science research skills and critical thinking through multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to understanding ethnic minority adolescents' development using a multi-tiered approach.  This program will ultimately assist in preparing future minority child & adolescent development scientists for application into M.A. and Ph.D. programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
