 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) The explosive growth of biological sequence information has created a demand for individuals skilled in retrieving, managing, and analyzing scientific data. According to the NIH, \"Researchers who five years ago spent little time on computers report that they now spend 90% of their research time in front of their monitors\"(1). Although the need for biologists with computer skills has increased dramatically, the number of undergraduates learning these skills has not. Few students learn how to use computers as a research tool. Biology teaching has lagged behind, largely, through the lack of \"classroom-ready\" materials available to college and high school instructors. Through this project, computer-based laboratory experiments are being created in collaboration with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Prototype instructional materials are being developed to teach students how to use NCBI's databases and bioinformatics tools to perform novel experiments while emphasizing fundamental concepts in biology. It is anticipated that students that use bioinformatics as a tool for inquiry-based research will have a better understanding of modern biology and new research skills. Laboratory exercises are being formally evaluated and tested by faculty from community colleges, four-year institutions, and high schools.",
