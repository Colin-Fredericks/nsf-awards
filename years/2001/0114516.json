 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe purpose of this research is to increase our understanding of the early career\r\ndevelopment of girls as they form opinions, develop belief structures, and make \r\ndecisions about career options in science, mathematics, engineering, and/or technology \r\ncareers by expanding our theoretical framework and empirical base to include a more\r\ndirect focus on the influence of outcome expectations, perceived barriers, and \r\nperceived support.\r\nThe need to conduct inquiry into the role of outcome beliefs in the development, stability,\r\n and change in career interests, and to examine contextual factors that\r\n impact the eventual entry of young girls and women into the pipeline toward pursuing \r\nscientific and technical careers provides the framework for the research.\r\nThis planning grant involves the recruitment and commitment of several \r\ncollaborating researchers, research institutions, and school systems. Collaborative\r\n researchers will provide the expertise across the disciplines of counseling, \r\neducational psychology , and science. Collaboration across institutions will provide \r\nthe opportunity for multiple sites to bring existing resources to bear on the problem\r\n and allow for research across widely varying demographics and locations. Multiple\r\n school systems will contribute to the opportunity to generalize to populations of rural, \r\nsuburban, and urban youth, as well as varying socioeconomic groups.\r\nThe planning year will include the identification of a sufficiently large and diverse\r\n sample of girls, and the design and pilot testing of both qualitative and quantitative\r\n instrumentation. This study will use a multimethod approach to examine the outcome \r\nexpectations and perceived barriers and supports ofgirls, ages 10-14, the impact of\r\n these expectations on career-related interests, and, if funded through a future grant,\r\nthe development of these interestS and outcome expectations over time. Focus groups\r\nwill be used to identify factors to be used in the development of items for several \r\nQ-sorts and to be incorporated into assessment tools. Quantitative instruments that\r\nwill measure the constructs of interest will be  designed, when necessary , revised\r\nwhen appropriate, and then pilot tested with middle school youth.",
