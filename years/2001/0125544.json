Magnetic fields play decisive role in many astrophysical processes from mediating star formation and transporting angular momentum in ubiquitous accretion disks to influencing heating/cooling within clusters of galaxies. In all these situations, the large magnetic Reynolds numbers of the flows require that any changes of magnetic field topology be implemented through fast reconnection, while magnetic field generation requires fast dynamo.\r\n\r\nThe project makes use of recent advances in numerical capabilities to test recently advanced theories of fast reconnection and fast dynamos. It also proposes further development of reconnection theory, comparisons of theoretical and numerical results with liquid sodium measurements, and simulations of the galactic dynamo. Another very important outcome of this effort will be the development of a parallel AMR MI-ID code, RIEMANN, for simulating MHD phenomena in rotating astrophysical systems. This will be a general-purpose utility that will be made widely available to the community. Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).\r\n***\r\n",
