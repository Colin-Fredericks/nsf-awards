 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the need for tribal communities to have a Native American work force who can help meet their local needs in science education and in the management of their resources. The main objective is to increase the number and quality of community college students who transfer into Bachelor of Science K-12 teaching programs or environmental science programs. Emphasis is being placed upon Tribally Controlled Colleges (TCCs) using environmental science as an educational implementation mechanism. Strategies used to address this objective include development of recruitment programs for each participating TCC, development of recruitment programs, faculty/student articulation agreements, transition support for the students to successfully enter an appropriate baccalaureate program, support for student retention, dissemination of program results and program evaluation. The project utilizes a successful student retention program, the Mesa State College New Environmental Student Transition (MSC-NEST), as a model developed to attract, motivate, and retain students. The focus is upon using the Environmental Science and Technology Bachelor of Science degree program as a model articulation partnership program with the participating community colleges. This degree program enables a student to select either a K-12 teaching degree path or an environmental science/technology related degree.\r\n\r\n",
