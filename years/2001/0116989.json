This project will involve an examination of the applicability of Kolmogorov complexity theory to ecological complexity in the categories of structural, embedded, and dynamic complexity.  Various nonlinear mathematical and physical systems will be examined including networks, chaos, cellular automata, and artificial life.  The goals of the project are to: 1) identify the central questions that relate ecological complexity to predictability, controllability, and knowability; 2) develop a definition of complexity for ecosystems; 3) develop a methodology for estimating how complex a given ecological system is; and 4) organize current knowledge of complexity, and develop the elements of a coherent theory of ecological complexity.  The PI also plans to organize a symposium for a national meeting to stimulate thinking about complexity. \r\n",
