The initial stages of this project have been highly successful, with distribution of materials currently proceeding in seven countries to audiences in excess of one million students. The continuation of this project is allowing us to complete a series of approximately 15 video tapes, comprising a library of fundamental concepts in the chemical sciences, for use by teachers and students worldwide. New videos being produced include: Atoms, Molecules, and Moles; Chemical Thermodynamics; Spectroscopy and Molecular Motion; Point Groups, Symmetry and Group Theory; Binary Crystals; and DNA/RNA/Proteins. These will complement the existing video titles covering the topics of Atomic Orbitals, VSEPR, Crystals, Stereochemistry, Nucleophilic Substitution, the Diels-Alder Reaction, Periodic Trends, and Molecular Orbitals.",
