 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Larry Viehland of Chatham College is funded by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to perform theoretical studies on a new separation method based on ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).  IMS is based on measuring the average drift velocity of different ions through a neutral gas under the influence of an electrostatic field.  The PI is conducting a two pronged approach to the theoretical study of a new aspect of IMS, namely the use of asymmetric applied fields (FAIMS).  First, simple extensions of methods employed for similar projects involving drift tube mass spectrometers will be applied to questions about peak shape, ion transmission efficiencies and model cross sections.  Undergraduates will be involved in this portion of the research.  Secondly, the PI will himself develop new kinetic and dynamic calculations allowing, for example, the calculation of transport cross sections from a set of potential energy surfaces. \r\n\r\nSeparation methods based on ion mobility pervade analytical chemistry, and IMS  has become an important technique for the detection of chemical and biological compounds in the field due to its high sensitivity, amenability to miniaturization and ruggedness in operation.  Improvements in this method are likely to be rapidly assimilated in applications such as industrial quality control and environmental sampling.  This work is to be conducted with undergraduate students at Chatham College, a women's college.",
