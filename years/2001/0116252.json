 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently within the College of Engineering at Michigan State University (MSU) faculty\r\nwith research interests at the micro and nano dimensions have coalesced about a new College of\r\nEngineering Center research activity entitled the Micro and Nano Engineering Center (MNEC).\r\nMNEC builds upon the past strong research capabilities of faculty within the College of\r\nEngineering, such as carbon-based materials and plasma technologies and combines them with\r\nnewly hired research faculty and their associated research initiatives in nano-device technologies,\r\nminiaturized millimeter wave and optical systems and micro/nano machine instrumentation.\r\nMNEC's mission is concerned with the application of frontier knowledge and techniques that\r\nsynthesize, characterize, manipulate and modify materials in order to create integrated structures,\r\nelectronic, and photonic devices and machines in the micro and nano environment. The emphasis\r\nof the Center's research activities is the development of novel devices, machines and systems in\r\nthe micro and nano world. Faculty form synergistic interdisciplinary research teams which\r\ninclude cross-campus and multi-university collaborations. Notable among these are the NSF\r\nMRSEC Center for Sensor Materials and the NSF Wireless Integrated Microsystems (WIMS)\r\nERC collaborations. Additionally, MNEC's research activities provide the university setting in\r\nwhich to train and educate both graduate and undergraduate students. Presently, the Center\r\nincludes ten faculty and 40 graduate students of which over half are Ph.D. students. Of the ten\r\nfaculty, five have been newly hired during the past five years and it is anticipated to expand to a\r\ntotal of 15-20 faculty over the next five years via additional faculty interest reorientation and new\r\nhires. MNEC's research activities have been and continue to be transferred to industry and\r\ncommercialized into applications relevant to manufacturing, health care, the environment and\r\nnational security.\r\nThe rapid advance of micro/nano-fabrication technology requires continual reassessment of\r\nour facilities and capabilities. Micro-scale technology has been an important economic driver for\r\nthe United States as well as the entire world. MSU's MNEC faculty have pioneered several\r\nimportant micro-fabrication technologies, including microwave plasma processing machines for\r\netching and diamond deposition, IC-compatible diamond processing and fabrication techniques,\r\nand diamond micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Now, as we enter a new millennium,\r\nnano-scale technology is becoming increasingly important to the center, the college, the\r\nuniversity, and the nation. The instrumentation requested in this proposal will improve the\r\nCenter's faculty ability to perform research activities and student training in nano-scale and\r\nmicro-scale technologies.\r\nSpecific, new long-term goals of the Center have been established over the past year through\r\nmany strategic planning discussions amongst the Center faculty. Current and developing micro\r\nand nano-engineering research activities in MNEC can be described and organized into five areas\r\nincluding: (1) carbon-based technology, (2) microwave plasma technology, (3) nanodevice\r\ntechnology, (4) manipulation and probe technology for micro and nano applications, and (5)\r\nminiaturized millimeter wave and optical systems. The proposed equipment acquisition described\r\nbelow is part of the MNEC's multiyear strategy to improve its laboratory facilities, which will\r\nfacilitate research activities and student training in these five areas. In developing our request, we\r\nhave considered the availability of similar instrumentation on campus and the capabilities of such\r\ninstrumentation. The equipment requested in this proposal will be housed in common facilities in\r\nthe Micro and Nano Engineering Center (MNEC) cleanroom located on the MSU campus. The\r\ninstrumentation requested in this proposal includes the following systems:\r\n Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) System\r\n Multisource Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) System\r\n Scanning Probe Microscope\r\n Wet Chemical Processing Station\r\n Electrochemical Plating Station",
