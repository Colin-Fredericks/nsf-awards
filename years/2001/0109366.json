 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytochrome c and apoptosis activating factor-1 (apaf-1) are the judge and\r\njury of mitochondrially-mediated programmed cell death (apoptosis). Their\r\ninteraction seals a cell's fate by launching a tightly controlled program that ends\r\nin cellular disintegration, and imbalances in this regulation are associated with\r\ncancer, neurological diseases, and heart disease. Given the biological and\r\nmedical relevance of this protein-protein reaction, it is surprising that its\r\nmolecular basis is unknown. The broad long-term goal of this project is to\r\ndetermine the molecular basis for the interaction between cytochrome c and\r\napaf-1. The main hypotheses are: a) Cytochrome c uses the same cationic\r\npatch to interact with apaf-1 and its redox partners. b) Apaf-1 uses specific\r\nanionic patches to interact with cytochrome c.\r\nThe specific aims are 1) Quantify apaf-1 / cytochrome c binding, 2) Identify\r\nprobable binding sites on apaf-1 and cytochrome c, 3) Test the binding sites.\r\nSedimentation equilibrium methods will be used to quantify binding, but\r\nalternative methods are also discussed. Probable binding sites on the WD repeat\r\ndomain of apaf-1 have been identified in modeling studies, and the redox-partner\r\nbinding site on cytochrome c has been known for many years. The sites\r\nwill be tested by using site directed mutagenesis. To ensure that biologically\r\nsignificant data are obtained, the variants will first be assessed by using a quick\r\nand biologically relevant caspase activation assay. Once the biologically\r\nrelevant residues have been identified, the biophysics of the variants will be\r\ncharacterized. Circular dichroism spectropolarimetry will be used to assess their\r\nintegrity. Sedimentation velocity experiments on apaf-1 variants will be used to\r\nassess their effects on intraprotein interactions. Sedimentation equilibrium\r\ntechniques from aim 1 will be used to quantify their effects on the free energy\r\nand stoichiometry of complex formation.",
