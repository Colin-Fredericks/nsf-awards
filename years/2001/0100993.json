The wide-ranging discussions are held in locations that rotate around the globe from Asia to Europe and the United States. Its purpose is to foster collaborations and information exchanges among the best and brightest in the field of fracture.  It has been especially successful in introducing a host of graduate students and post-docs to senior researchers and has led to the development of a significant number of new, long-standing relationships. This series of meetings is specifically dedicated to the science of fracture. The list of topics shows the organizing committee's desire to cover a broad range of materials systems and physical aspects of fracture. The preliminary list of topics include: atomistics of fracture, mesoscopic scale modelling, multiscale phenomena & modelling, crack dynamics, steels & other engineering materials, environmental effects, fundamentals of fatigue, and interfacial fracture.Support in the amount of $5K is provided to fund graduate student and post-doctoral attendee fellowships to maximize attendance from these groups that are traditionally under-represented at international meetings. \r\n%%%\r\nWith the exception of isolated symposia within national meetings, such as the MRS, there are no meetings specifically dedicated to the science of fracture. The closest one is the International Congress on Fracture held every 3 years (the last one held in Australia in 1997). That series of meetings has an engineering-oriented flavor and does not deal with fundamental scientific issues. \r\n***\r\n",
