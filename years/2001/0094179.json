 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cortez\r\n0094179\r\n     The investigator develops, analyzes, and applies\r\ncomputational techniques for the motion of elastic filaments\r\nembedded in an incompressible fluid.  This general situation\r\narises in many physical contexts, including the motion of\r\nmicroorganisms, swimming of aquatic animals, fluid flow around\r\nelastic bodies, bubble motion and more.  The project encompasses\r\nthe development of numerical methods for flows corresponding to a\r\nwide range of length scales.  The methods are based on the use of\r\na force field along filaments made of localized but smooth terms\r\nrather than delta distributions.  Regular expressions for the\r\nfluid and filament velocities induced by the forces are then\r\nderived as the basis for the methods.  Important properties of\r\nthis approach are that it eliminates the singularities that would\r\nnormally be present if the forces are assumed to be delta\r\ndistributions, the volume of fluid within elastic boundaries is\r\nconserved extremely well, and high accuracy can be achieved.  The\r\nwork is aimed at extending well-known numerical techniques to\r\nthree-dimensional flows driven by forces along filaments and to\r\nthe full range of length scales.  Analysis of the methods is\r\ncarried out to establish and improve their stability, convergence\r\nand accuracy properties.  The applications that are pursued\r\ninclude a wide variety of flagellar motions, the motion of\r\nflexible membranes around obstacles, and others.\r\n     The motion of microorganisms in a liquid and the flow of\r\nblood in capillaries are two examples of phenomena that can be\r\nstudied with computational methods.  Computer techniques that can\r\naccurately simulate motions of this type are very valuable\r\nbecause they can be used to determine how arteries become\r\nobstructed or how flagellated organisms perform specific\r\nfunctions in the human body and the effects of defects in this\r\nmechanism.  From a mathematical point of view, these computer\r\nsimulations are not ready for scientists to use; there is a need\r\nto improve the accuracy with which the underlying equations are\r\nbeing solved and increase the reliability of the methods.  This\r\nproject is aimed at developing computational methods for fluid\r\nflows interacting with elastic structures.  The goal is to develop\r\nhigh-accuracy methods, improve on their mathematical properties,\r\nand apply them to problems from biological sciences.\r\n",
