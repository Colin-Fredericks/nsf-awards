 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIntegrating Undergraduate Geoscience Education and Research via a  Watershed Management Approach\r\n\r\nThis project enhances undergraduate training in the geoscience component of the interdisciplinary Environmental Science Program through curriculum development/revision and expanding student research training opportunities, with particular focus on watershed management approaches. The geoscience component in the Louisiana State University at Shreveport (LSUS) Environmental Science Program is enhanced by the inclusion of a comprehensive watershed and ecosystems approach in several new and revised undergraduate courses. The focus of the curricular enhancement and related student research and experiential learning opportunities is on the Red River watershed and ecosystems in Louisiana. This project integrates research and education, offering undergraduate students interdisciplinary curricular education and experiential learning opportunities, and builds upon collaborative linkages with partner agencies such as USGS. LSUS students participate in public outreach efforts and in publication and dissemination of research results via papers and presentations. Dissemination is aided via a tri-state Red River Public Radio network, headquartered on campus, and through a new inter-agency working group composed of faculty and government agency personnel who are developing a broad regional initiative. \r\n",
