 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  research project is focused on the analytical aspects of the theory of\r\nintegrable systems related to the Riemann-Hilbert  and isomonodromy methods.\r\nThe problems under consideration include the  asymptotic analysis of the\r\ncorrelation functions  of  exactly solvable quantum field and statistical\r\nmechanics models, the investigation of the double scaling limits in the \r\ntheory of orthogonal polynomials, the analysis of the integrable systems \r\ndescribing the distribution functions of random  matrix theory and random \r\npermutations,  and  the global asymptotic analysis  of the solutions of \r\nintegrable differential  equations of the  Painleve' and KdV types. \r\n\r\nThe theory of integrable systems is an expanding area  which plays an\r\nincreasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new\r\nanalytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and\r\ntheoretical physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytic tool\r\nfor the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising \r\nin  modern nonlinear science and technology.  Specifically,  the research \r\ndirections indicated above deal with the mathematical models which form \r\nthe  theoretical basis for the following fields: condensed matter, \r\nhigh energy and plasma physics, nonlinear hydrodynamics, and  high-bit rate \r\ntelecommunication systems.  A special attention  in the project is given \r\nto  the  analysis of the distributions of random matrix theory which govern  \r\nstatistical properties of the  large systems which  do not  obey the usual laws  \r\nof classical probability. This kind of systems appears in  many different areas\r\nof applied  science and technology including  heavy nuclei, polymer growth, \r\nhigh-dimensional data  analysis, and  certain percolation processes.\r\n",
