 "awd_abstract_narration": "We trust others to gain the benefits of cooperation.  In the business\r\nworld, trust supports interfirm alliances, acceptance of organizational\r\nchange, the transfer of knowledge, and more.  In public life, trust\r\nunderlies voting for candidates and support for government initiatives. \r\nIn private life, trust guides relations among patients, physicians, and\r\nmedical organizations.   Given this clear, pervasive importance of trust\r\nto our lives, it is not surprising that it has become the focus of a\r\ngrowing body of research activity.  The goal of our project is to test a\r\nnew model of social trust within the applied context of environmental\r\nrisk management.  Our model differs from others by clearly\r\ndistinguishing social trust from confidence as separate, but\r\ninteracting, paths to cooperation.  Social trust is based on judgments\r\nof values or intentions; confidence is based on judgments of past\r\nperformance.  Social trust is associated with uncertainty and risk; it\r\nis required when confidence fails.  Confidence is the normal state of\r\naffairs, sometimes lost when performance is judged to be bad, but\r\nrestorable through the establishment of social trust.  Social trust is a\r\nbridge between steady states; it has primacy and control over\r\nconfidence.  Our model has clear, practical implications for the\r\npractice of risk management: attempts to communicate about performance\r\n(i.e., the management of risk) should be preceded by the establishment\r\nof social trust relations.  The state of trust relations conditions the\r\ninterpretation of performance information.  In a state of distrust,\r\npresumably good performance information is discounted and does not lead\r\nto confidence.  Similarly, in a state of trust, presumably bad\r\nperformance information does not lead to the loss of confidence.  Social\r\ntrust, according to our model, is resilient, and helps us to remain\r\nconfident in the lives we lead; it can be progressive or conservative. \r\nOur research project will provide a test of this model of social trust\r\nand confidence in risk management, improving our understanding, moving\r\nus closer to the goal of using social trust to improve our lives.\r\n",
