 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design and implementation of a modern microprocessor presents many reliability challenges.  Designers must verify the correctness of large complex systems and construct implementations that work reliably in\r\nvaried operating conditions.  The research examines the role that speculative execution could play in improving the quality and reliability of future microprocessor designs. A novel processing paradigm, called\r\ndynamic verification, is proposed that pushes speculation into all aspects of program processing. The approach couples a traditional core processor design with a simple checker processor that verifies its\r\ncomputation. The resulting core processor design has significant resistance to permanent and transient errors.  The proposed research examines the design of the checker processor, with emphasis on\r\nminimizing its cost and impact on core processor performance.\r\n\r\nThe educational component of this work seeks to better prepare the student for coming challenges in computer system design. The VeriSimple Processor tool kit will provide students with a unified computer design\r\nexperience, starting with high level design in undergraduate classes, to microarchitectural design in advanced undergraduate classes, and finally research-oriented design in graduate coursework.  The tool kit\r\nwill be incorporated into the SimpleScalar tool set (simulator tools developed by the PI) and freely distributed to other institutions.\r\n\r\n",
