Siegel, RPI\r\nCTS-0100019\r\nPartial travel support for 18 invited participants and speakers at the Nanomaterials Workshop in Montreal, Canada,  October 22-25, 2000, co-sponsored by CNRS and NSF, has been requested.  The objective of this meeting is to evaluate the current research results in the field, discuss future research directions and technological developments, the work needed in order to increase industrial relevance, and explore opportunities of collaboration.   Engineers, material scientists, chemists and physicists from academe and industry will attempt to identify common principles and approaches.  The main sessions will cover synthesis of building blocks, theoretical challenges, characterization (local and bulk techniques), mechanical properties, magnetic and optical properties, chemical and thermal properties, and applications.  Participation of young researchers is encouraged.   There will be about 18-20 invited speakers from each U.S. and France, as well as invited speakers from Canada.  Ample time will be allowed for questions and discussions.  The workshop is expected to be an interactive forum for participants.  A purpose of the meeting is to facilitate the establishment of long-term cooperation among researchers from U.S., France and Canada, in academe and industry in the area of nanocomposite materials.\r\n",
