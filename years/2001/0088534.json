 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nAtomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) is an indispensable tool for the quantitative analyses of trace elements critical to environmental health. To provide undergraduates with experience with environmentally relevant AAS, the Departments of Chemistry and Geological Sciences are introducing intensive, hands-on, project-oriented experiments in Instrumental Methods Laboratory, Environmental Chemistry, and Aqueous Geochemistry Laboratory. Students in the upper-division chemistry courses are also performing an analysis of lead in paint chip samples gathered and prepared by General Chemistry laboratory students. Collaboratively, the advanced and beginning chemistry students are preparing a report for the Memphis and Shelby County Health Department summarizing results and assessing the regional scope of the lead-paint risk. Students in the Quantitative Analysis Laboratory are gathering trace metal analysis data and creating a database to be used for teaching the statistical treatment of experimental data. The AA spectrometer, capable of trace-level determinations of metals such as arsenic, selenium, mercury, lead and chromium, is also becoming a significant resource for undergraduate researchers who choose environmental projects in Chemistry and Geological Sciences and for environmental courses in and interdisciplinary research with Physics, Geography, Biology, and Biomedical Engineering Departments and the Groundwater Institute.",
