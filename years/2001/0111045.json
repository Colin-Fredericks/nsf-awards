 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, combines the demonstrated intellectual and physical resources at the IBM Almaden Research Center (IBM/ARC) and San Jose State University (SJSU), a primarily undergraduate institution.  Professors Joseph Pesek and Maureen Scharberg head the SJSU effort and Dr. Charles Wade coordinates the IBM/ARC effort.  Together, these two institutions will offer undergraduate students and high school teachers/small college faculty research projects in many areas of analytical chemistry, interfacial science, and materials science. This academic-industrial research and education program builds on two previous NSF grants, CHE-9300131 and CHE-9625628.  .  \r\n\r\nIn this project, both year-round and summer programs are offered:  For undergraduates, there are six positions year-round and twenty ten-week summer appointments.  There are four summer positions for high school teachers and two summer positions for visiting small college faculty.  Mentors come from the 22 chemistry faculty at SJSU and among the 240 scientists at IBM/ARC.  Students work in the areas of polymer chemistry, materials characterization, lithography, semiconductor packaging, magnetism, computational chemistry, and surface chemistry.  Each of the participants will spend time working in laboratories at both SJSU and IBM/ARC, giving them a broad understanding of both academic and industrial research opportunities and procedures. The assessment and evaluation of the project is evolving.  Exit surveys have already been performed, and now long term tracking protocols are being developed.\r\n",
