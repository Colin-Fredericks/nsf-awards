It will involve a close collaboration between Dr. S.S. Bang, Biochemical Microbiologist, and Dr. V. Ramakrishnan, Civil Engineer, at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD and Dr. J.R. Warmington, Molecular Microbiologist, and Dr. B.V. Rangan, Civil Engineer, at the Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia.\r\n\r\nThe research objectives include 1) biochemical and molecular investigation of urease in calcite precipitation utilizing genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs), 2) use of immobilized urease and whole cells including GEMs in calcite precipitation, and 3) application of bioremediation technology in in-base and sub-base stabilization as well as remediation of cracks and fissures in various structural formations.  Experimental steps will be carried in a coordinated manner to compensate the weaknesses and to complement the strength of each campus.\r\n\r\nThe SDSM&T team has expertise in microbial mineralization and biochemistry, whereas the Australian team has expertise in molecular microbiology.  This proposed international collaboration would enable the Australia and the USA.  The combined project will result in joining of the complementary skills of the SDSM&T and Australian research teams, exchanging students not only to encourage their participation in the research and but also to train their laboratory research techniques.  Combination of these complementary areas of expertise will promote further development and application of the microbial mineralization technology to the future benefits of both countries.\r\n",
