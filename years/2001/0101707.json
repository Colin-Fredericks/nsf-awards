The goals are to bring IT education and skills training to the unique and underserved multi-ethnic residents and business population of Brooklyn and Queens. The project creates a comprehensive, interdisciplinary curriculum that emphasizes experimental learning and industry internships for students and faculty and leads to an A.A.S. degree in New Media. A total of 200 students will be enrolled and no less than 15 faculty members will be trained and participate in externships. The project will also establish skill standards, based on those developed by ACM and the Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies. The project will collaborate with the New York New Media Association, Consolidated Edison of New York, Queens County Overall Economic Development Corporation, and other area businesses and community organizations to form an advisory board and set benchmarks. The Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies also serves as the project evaluator.\r\n",
