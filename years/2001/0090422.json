The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0082).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners are South Dakota State University; Daktronics, Inc; Falcon Plastics, Inc; MTR, Inc.\r\n\r\nProposed Activities\r\nThe activities of this award include support for education; product development; research in rapid prototyping; technology transfer; developing a rapid prototyping facility at the university; product design; assistance in rapid prototyping to small industries in the region.\r\n\r\nProposed Innovation\r\nThe innovation goals include transfer of the latest research in rapid prototyping to medium and small manufacturing firms in the state.  The proposed activities will bring an important capability to a region that needs to develop more technology-based manufacturing.  This activity will make the region more attractive to businesses and manufacturing firms and make the existing firms more competitive nationally.  The educational component will provide a technologically literate workforce at the engineering level.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe rapid prototyping facility will provide a laboratory for education of engineers in South Dakota, provide the economic benefits for small companies in the region who cannot afford to own the facilities, provide technical support for emerging small manufacturing firms in the region.  The facility should be self-sustaining by year four by membership fees.\r\n\r\nPotential Societal Impact\r\nThe activity will provide more high tech manufacturing jobs for the state, and raise income in a region that has lagged the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
