 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this proposal is the design and implementation of\r\ncluster-based electronic commerce servers (or simply distributed\r\ne-commerce servers) that are efficient, scalable, and capable of\r\nservice differentiation.  To achieve these properties, our servers\r\nwill efficiently adapt their quality of service, will efficiently\r\nhandle any type of incoming request according to the client's profile,\r\nwill not involve any centralized resources, and will cache both static\r\nand certain dynamic content.  The key challenges are in determining\r\nthe set of policies and mechanisms that should be used to\r\ndifferentiate the services provided and to implement truly efficient\r\nand scalable policies and mechanisms for request processing.  At the\r\nend of the project, we will demonstrate two distributed e-commerce\r\nservers (an on-line store and an auction server) running on a cluster\r\nwith 64 processors.\r\n\r\nThe contributions of this project will be the following: (1) A\r\ncomplete and general characterization of e-commerce workloads; (2) An\r\nunderstanding of the issues involved in service differentiation for\r\ndistributed e-commerce servers, including the use of optimizations\r\nbased on the past history of actions taken by high-priority clients;\r\n(3) The design, implementation, and evaluation of mechanisms for\r\nshared state maintenance and transaction support in distributed\r\ne-commerce servers; and (4) The study of techniques and mechanisms for\r\nimproving the efficiency and scalability of distributed e-commerce\r\nservers.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the potential implications of our research and\r\ncontributions are far reaching.  In fact, we think that the impact of\r\nour research can be substantial, given how significantly various\r\ncompanies have come to rely on their on-line networking operations.\r\nFurthermore, our research can be useful for operating systems and\r\ndistributed systems teaching purposes, as our software infrastructure\r\nwill provide a tool for the study of distributed e-commerce servers.\r\n",
