Stephan and Pascal Besnard at the Ecole Nationale Superieue de Sciences Appliquees et de Technology in Lannion, France.  The objectives of this collaboration are to develop disk and ring optical microcavities and to combine common research on theory and application of microsphere resonators.  Experiments and calculations will be conducted. The collaboration takes advantage of complementary expertise and facilities.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in quantum optics, laser noise, and use of passive microcavities for laser frequency stabilization.  This is complemented by French expertise in microsphere lasers, microcavity fabrication techniques, and semiclassical laser theory.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate student. The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of microcavity devices, which have potential for communication, optical sensing and biomedical applications.\r\n",
