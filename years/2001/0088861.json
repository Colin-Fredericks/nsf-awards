 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric Sciences (41) Understanding transport in the Earth's stratosphere is an important foundation for atmospheric science. Transport in the stratosphere plays a crucial role in determining the seasonal and spatial distributions of many trace gases in the atmosphere. The intrinsic complexity of the atmosphere precludes the exclusive use of analytic solutions. As a result, numerical models are standard tools for studying the atmosphere. This project is adapting the Atmospheric and Research 'short\" numerical modeling program for use as an educational tool to teach undergraduates how trace chemicals are transported in the atmosphere. Subsequently, an accompanying set of 8 lesson plans will be developed, which will provide a framework of how the software can be used. The model provides hands-on experience simulating transport in the stratosphere with the ability to compare model results to satellite and other observations. The AER \"short\" model is a mature Fortran code developed in the early eighties with funding from NASA, Air Force and industry and has been continuously improved through its applications in scientific research in the past 15 years. It is one of five models that were developed and maintained by institutions in the United States and have remained active over the past 15 years.",
