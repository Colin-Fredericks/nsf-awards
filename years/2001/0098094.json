 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a research conference and competition for undergraduate and masters level graduate students who are conducting research with faculty members from the disciplines of Anthropology, History, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology. In a variety of ways, the conference encourages undergraduate students to enter graduate school and encourage masters level graduate students to continue.  First, it helps give them the motivation and opportunity to participate in the kind of research with faculty mentors that they would do in graduate school.  Second, it exposes them to other students involved in research, and possibly interested in continuing their education.  Third, it brings in outside speakers to discuss the values and rewards associated with the research process, and an invited plenary speaker to further address the topic of minority students in graduate education.  Fourth, it makes awards of $500, $250, and $100 for the top three places in the undergraduate and graduate competition.  \r\n\r\nThe conference expands on previously smaller conferences that proved successful in getting participating students to apply to graduate school.  It recruits student participants from the South Texas region, hoping in particular to attract minority and first-generation college students, and to enhance their motivation and competitiveness in being accepted into graduate programs and in seeking leadership roles in diverse professions.\r\n",
