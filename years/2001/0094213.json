Model alloys based on the ferromagnetic L10- and L12-ordered intermetallic phases in the Fe-Pd system undergoing severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing will be the focus of the research. The main experimentation techniques are differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), vibrating-scanning-magnetometers, mechanical testing, and in-situ and post-mortem microstructural observations by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction.  Strategies for property optimization and microstructural control will be devised based on the mechanistic models of the processes responsible for the observed microstructural changes. Unique exploitation of reaction processing of heavily deformed reversibly ordering alloys will be used to control microstructures at the nanoscale. The educational component centers on the development of Web-based educational tools and their implementation into upper-level MS&E undergraduate and graduate courses.  These new tools will incorporate results and experimental capabilities developed from the research and they will be made available to the public cost-free. The national and international collaborations that will be fostered through this award offer unique opportunities for interaction with outstanding researchers in the field of intermetallics and physical metallurgy of advanced materials. \r\n%%%\r\nThis research facilitates a systematic study of scale-related effects in truly bulk nanostructured functional intermetallic alloys with commercial potential. There is considerable interest in these functional intermetallics for advanced permanent magnet technologies, e.g. thin film media, data storage and futuristic micro-devices. Refinement of the microstructure to the nanoscale offers enormous potential for property improvements. Future success of these and many other intermetallics requires a detailed knowledge of the synergistic interplay between competing solid-state reactions during processing.\r\n***\r\n",
