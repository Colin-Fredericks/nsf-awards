 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project addresses the formation, strain relaxation, and morphological evolution of metamorphic buffer layers and their impact on the properties and performance of device applications specific to the wireless communication industry. Buffer layers based on Sb-containing alloys will be studied to achieve flat and low defect layers. Layer designs that reduce roughness and threading dislocations will also be studied. Properties will be characterized using a in situ (Multi-Beam Optical Stress Sensor, Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy)and ex situ (triple axis x-ray diffraction, transmission electron diffraction, photoluminescence, Hall measurements) techniques to assess microstructure and morphology, and their impact on electronic and optical properties. Additionally, MHEMT devices will be fabricated based on optimized metamorphic buffer layers, tested, and performance compared to the state-of-the-art devices. The project will be integrated into educational activities that include undergraduate and graduate curriculum development, undergraduate research opportunities, and outreach to young women.\r\n%%% The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science and physics knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic materials. The scope of the project will expose students to challenges in materials synthesis, processing, and characterization. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, outreach to young women, and the integration of research and education. ***  \r\n",
