 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the proposed project, the nonlinear vibration of rotating disks, induced by fluid-structure interaction, is investigated because rotating disks are extensively used as computer disk drives, turbine disks, automotive disk brakes, and circular machine tools and saws. The objectives of this project are to develop an accurate mathematical model to describe such a nonlinear vibration of rotating disks, and to further determine the corresponding stability for a better understanding of nonlinear dynamics for these fluid-structural systems and the development of control strategies for vibration and instability suppression. \r\n\r\nTo solve the aforementioned problem, the Galerkin method and perturbation approach are used for the reduction of the vibration problem to a dynamical system, and the bifurcation and stability theories in nonlinear dynamical systems are used for obtaining the stability conditions.  The work plan includes: the vibration model for disks rotating on the air film close to the rigid wall is developed; the steady state response and stability and bifurcation conditions are obtained, and numerical simulations are completed; and the achieved results and further research directions in this area are summarized.\r\n\r\nThe impact and significance of this research include that the approaches and methodology, and results achieved in this research are applicable for other problems in nonlinear fluid-structure interaction. Additionally the proposed understanding of harmonic vibration, stability and solitary waves in a disk rotating on the air film will bring an improvement of hard-disk drive technology\r\n",
