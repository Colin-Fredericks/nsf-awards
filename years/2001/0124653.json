 "awd_abstract_narration": "0124653\r\nBronzino\r\nBioinformatics is a scientifically broad discipline involving the use of computer technology to develop new medical (virtual) instruments, create and protect computerized patient records, enhance the operation of medical imaging systems, utilize artificial intelligence techniques (i.e. expert systems, neural networks, etc.) to develop decision support systems, create efficient and effective data mining and modeling approaches, and use robotics in a host of medical applications. This field is vast and it is difficult to cover all of the topics. Therefore, the Symposium is to focus on computer-based instrumentation in medical systems. \r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of the Bioinformatics Symposium are:\r\nPresent insights into the new research and development efforts underway in virtual instrumentation, medical imaging and storage, and decision support systems.\r\n\r\nPresent examples of successful academic/industrial collaborations in these areas.\r\n\r\nProvide an opportunity for students in biomedical engineering, computer science and health sciences to learn more about the field of Bioinformatics.\r\n\r\nThe convening of academic and industrial professionals from the various disciplines involved in Bioinformatics at the Symposium and associated Technology Fair will facilitate interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations in research and development efforts within the realm of Bioinformatics. The Bioinformatics Symposium and associated Technology Fair offers a timely opportunity to facilitate the development of innovations in this emerging area of biomedical engineering. \r\n\r\nThis award  provides support for the publication of printed proceedings of the meeting.\r\n",
