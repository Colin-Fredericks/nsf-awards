Three basic types of systems will be studied: systems approaching equilibrium where regions of frustration give rise to defects, such as domain walls, vortices, monopoles, and disclinations, which anneal over time; systems forming near stationary patterns with defects serving as disordering agents; and driven systems where defects are created as part of the driving process.  Superfluids, magnets, nematic liquid crystals, and structures formed from block copolymers are among specific systems for application.  Aims of this proposal include: investigating methods for deriving the equations of motion of defects from more microscopic descriptions of spatially varying order, determining statistical properties of defect dynamics, and studying various aspects of defect dynamics in driven systems.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award supports theoretical research in the dynamics of defects and their role in  the development of ordered phases.  Defects are ubiquitous in condensed matter systems, for example, vortices in superfluid and normal liquid helium, domain walls in magnets and disclinations in liquid crystals, and play an important role in determining many properties of materials. An important part of this research involves the determination of the equations of motion for defects that exist on intermediate length scales from more microscopic equations that describe ordered states and their spatial variation.  The proposed research will support training graduate students in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
