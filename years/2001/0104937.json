 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title:  Quantitative Genetics of Social Behavior\r\n\r\nPI:  Penelope F. Kukuk\r\n\r\n Social behavior is found in all types of organisms and is a characteristic\r\nof ecologically dominant species.  The study of how social evolution came\r\nabout has concentrated on selection. To date, theoretical and\r\nempirical work has focused on how group life and social cooperation influence\r\nsurvival and reproduction.  This work began in the nineteen sixties and\r\ncontinues today.  The other side of the evolutionary coin, the study of the\r\ngenetic mechanisms underlying social cooperation, has been neglected.  Even\r\nin the social Hymenoptera there is very little information concerning the\r\nmost basic issues.  It is not known to what extent differences in social\r\nbehaviors among individuals in a species are based on differences in their\r\ngenetic makeup. In species where females all have the potential to be\r\ncompetent reproductives, we do not know if there are enough genetic\r\ndifferences between individuals underlying any given social behavior to\r\nsuggest that the behavior has the potential to evolve.  Due to this lack of\r\nknowledge it is not possible to predict the evolutionary trajectory of\r\nsocial behaviors or to examine how inheritance of a suite of socially\r\nrelevant traits may be correlated.  This one-sided approach to social\r\nevolution is based on methodological constraints.  Appropriate social\r\nspecies have neither the large reproductive output nor the ease in\r\nlaboratory rearing needed to use the powerful methodology of quantitative\r\ngenetic research, a methodology that can best address these questions.  This\r\nlimitation is changing.  Due to new but well tested methods for obtaining\r\ninformation rich genetic fingerprints for individuals, based on multiple\r\nhighly variable marker genes such as microsatellites,  in combination with\r\nconceptual and statistical advances it is now possible to apply the methods\r\nof quantitative genetics to social behavior in a field setting for the first\r\ntime.\r\n A collaboration between a quantitative geneticist (Allen Moore) and a\r\nbehavioral ecologist  (Penny Kukuk) will apply new methodologies in a field\r\nbased quantitative genetic study of social behaviors for a group living\r\nhalictine bee species Lasioglossum (Chilalictus) hemichalceum.   This\r\ncommunal species, in which all group members reproduce, is an ideal species\r\nfor such a study.  In this species, individuals differ from one another in\r\nsocial behaviors and microsatellite markers are available to produce precise\r\ngenetic fingerprints for individuals.    Information on similarities\r\nbetween individuals in their microsatellite based genetic fingerprints\r\nand easily observed social behaviors will be used to determine components of\r\ninheritance for a suite of behavioral characteristics that are known to have\r\nimportant effects on survival and reproduction.  The research will pioneer\r\nthe quantitative genetic study of social behavior and pioneer the use of\r\nquantitative genetic methodology for behavioral traits in a natural setting.",
