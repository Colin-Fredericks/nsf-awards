In Teichmuller\r\ntheory, the aim of the investigation is to understand the complex\r\nstructure on the Teichmuller space by constructing holomorphic\r\nfunctions arising from flat singular metric uniformization of the\r\nRiemann surface. We have produced many naturally defined complex\r\nvalued functions on the Teichmuller space. The goal is to show\r\nthat they are holomorphic. This will give us a better\r\nunderstanding of the complex structure which is of vital\r\nimportance to the Teichmuller theory.  In 3-manifold topology, we\r\npropose to show that any non-trivial 3-manifold group has a\r\nnon-trivial SL(2,F) representation for some field F. We have\r\ntranslated the existence problem into a problem concerning how\r\nsimple loops propagate in a surface.  With the recent advance of\r\nour knowledge on surfaces, one may eventually solve the problem\r\nusing surface topology.  The existence of SL (2,F)\r\nrepresentations will have many important consequences in\r\n3-manifold topology.\r\n\r\nA 3-manifold is a space in which every point has a small\r\nsurrounding similar to our real world.  It is an important\r\nmathematical problem to classify all 3-manifolds. One of the main\r\ntool developed in recent decades in 3-manifolds theory is to use\r\ngeometry. In particular, the geometry of surfaces has been used\r\nvery successfully in understanding the 3-dimensional spaces.  The\r\nproposed work addresses the topology of 3-manifolds and the\r\ngeometry of surfaces.  We attempt to use the symmetry theory\r\n(SL(2) representation theory) to understand the fundamental group\r\nof 3-manifolds which is a vital invariant of 3-manifolds.  The\r\nSL(2,C) representation theory has been used very successfully in\r\nrecent years by many topologists. Our approach seems to be new\r\nand uses simple loops on surfaces.  The second part of the\r\nproposed work addresses the geometry of surfaces. One of the main\r\nproblems on surface geometry is the moduli space problem. The\r\nmoduli space problem asks for, for instance, what is the shape of\r\nthe space of all convex polyhedrons which look like a cube.  Many\r\ngeometric problems are best expressed in terms of the topology\r\nand geometry of the moduli space. The corresponding object for\r\nhigh genus surface is the Teichmuller space. In contrasts to the\r\ntopology of the Teichmuller space which is well understood for\r\nabout 60 years, the geometry of it is much less understood. Our\r\nproposed work is an attempt to understand explicitly the complex\r\nanalytic geometry of the Teichmuller space. The explicit\r\ndescription of the complex geometry of the Teichmuller space will\r\nhave applications not only in mathematics but also in physics,\r\nfor instance in string theory.\r\n",
