 "awd_abstract_narration": "Verification tools based on decision procedures including OBDD based tools and model-checkers have been effectively used in many application areas including hardware verification, protocol analysis and verification, static analysis and type-checking of code, byte-code verification, analysis of mobile code and proof-carrying code.  These tools are however unable to deal with computations modeled using large state space (including infinite state space), partly because they do not support inductive reasoning. Induction based theorem provers, while quite powerful, lack automation and require tremendous user guidance. A novel and radical approach is proposed to combine decision procedures, rewriting and induction schemes in a restricted way so as not to lose automation.   Using this approach, recursive definitions are given as terminating rewrite rules on top of decidable theories, such as Presburger arithmetic. Induction schemes are generated from these terminating definitions. By imposing structure on recursive definitions, it becomes possible to automatically decide a large class of conjectures requiring inductive reasoning. It is proposed to extend and generalize this approach to consider a large class of recursively defined functions, their interactions with each other, as well as a large class of conjectures about these functions, that can be automatically decided (without any need for user guidance).",
