A fundamental understanding of the processes involved in film formation is needed to develop a predictive, quantitative model for the effects of deposition variables on film microstructure. In this CAREER grant a comprehensive investigation of nucleation and growth processes of a representative set of electrodeposition systems is undertaken with the objective to develop such a model and thus provide better tools for ECD fabrication of metallic films. Electrochemical techniques, which yield spatially averaged information on the growth process, and microscopy/structural methods, that provide morphological data at the microscopic scale, are coupled to yield a comprehensive description of the electrocrystallization behavior of the model systems. These two techniques are uniquely combined by monitoring in-situ and in real time the electrical response and nucleation and growth processes of metals into micro- and nano-electrodes fabricated by lithographic methods. The experimental effort is integrated with a kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of the nucleation and growth process to quantify the effects of metal type, electrolyte chemistry, and deposition variables on the microstructure of the resulting films.  The experimental results are used to validate and improve the numerical simulations, and the resulting models are utilized to develop a quantitative description of electrocrystallization phenomena in electrolytic solutions. The theory, research and practice of ECD will be integrated into the undergraduate and graduate materials engineering curricula at the University of Alabama with the objective of enhancing skills and creative thinking of students in the area of ECD technology and applications. Students at the undergraduate level will be exposed to laboratory projects in this field. Attention will be devoted to recruitment and retention of minorities as well as economically and socially at risk students. Graduate students will have the opportunity to attend a highly interdisciplinary course on the theory and practice of ECD, wherein the lectures will be complemented by laboratory sessions and simulation tools. Multimedia modules developed using these tools will be employed in lectures and made available to the general public through web publishing. \r\n%%%\r\nECD techniques are widely employed for fabrication of thick coatings and for deposition through lithographic patterns. ECD processes have unique capabilities to monitor and control the nucleation and growth of coatings.  This makes ECD ideal for the synthesis of high performance metallic coatings for microelectronics, magnetic recording, and MEMS applications, where control of microstructure and texture over a wide range of length scales is essential.\r\n***\r\n",
