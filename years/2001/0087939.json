 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI's objective is to develop a high-throughput screening method to efficiently measure and characterize the growth of viruses in cell culture. He plans to evaluate the feasibility of his approach. His approach is based on the idea that (1) viruses confined to grow into linear arrays of host cells will spread at velocities that are useful traits of the specific virus-host pair and (2) the spatial distribution of virus and host components in such propagating infections can reflect characteristic stages of the infection process. More specific aims are to: (1) assess how patterning host-cells affects their viability in culture, (2) measure the spatial distribution of markers for specific early and late components, (3) test whether localized initiations of infection into patterned cells can be used to increase the amount of information that a single sample yields, and (4) evaluate how the patterning of host cells influences viral growth.",
