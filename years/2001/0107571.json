 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Dynamic species interactions, uncertainty and the maintenance of ecosystem robustness.\"  The interplay between community complexity and stability is the source of one of the classic debates in ecology.  Heterogeneous spatial and temporal species distributions and trophic interactions, though central to the debate, have been studied little.  To address these issues this research develops new computational methods to parameterize, simulate, and analyze a multi-species, multi-patch model.\r\n",
