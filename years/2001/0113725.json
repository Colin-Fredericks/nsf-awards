This project provides an intensive institute accommodating groups of faculty members for two years. Participating faculty develop a portfolio of educational materials for use in both their own and other educational programs with the help of subject matter experts. The program objectives are designed to help improve the capability of participating computer science faculty to teach effective security practice and design. These include developing a core of multi-disciplinary subject-matter expert mentors; producing research based curricular materials; recruiting undergraduate and graduate computer science and security faculty; developing subject-matter and pedagogical knowledge and skills of faculty attendees; and facilitating adaptation and implementation of curricular materials. There are plans to evaluate project outcomes and the impact of the project model and activities and to disseminate curricular materials to the broader community.\r\n\r\n",
