 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Antonio Urban Systemic Program\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe San Antonio Urban Systemic Program (SAUSP) plans to promote full implementation of K-12 standards-based, inquiry-centered curricula in a coalition of nine school districts through the organization of elementary, middle, and high schools in K-12 school-feeder patterns served by teams of coaches.  In order to increase the competency of the instructional workforce to accomplish this goal, San Antonio plans to implement a comprehensive professional development program in close collaboration with local institutions of higher education.  A Citywide Monitoring System will provide for evaluation of student understanding of mathematics and science.  This system will include a set of performance tasks to evaluate instructional practices and curriculum implementation, a web-based curriculum network to support excellence in instruction providing high-quality assessments and examples of standards-based instruction, and the use of district-based equity teams to specifically address the achievement gaps between ethnic and socioeconomic groups.  \r\n\r\nConsistent with this end, participating districts have proposed the development of a new assessment system that is fully congruent and supportive of effective implementation of standards-based curricula.  Furthermore, in order to secure a permanent coordination of a community coalition comprised of K-12 educators, business and community members, and the university sector, the SAUSP will establish a K-16 Implementation Team.  \r\n\r\nA comprehensive evaluation plan will enable the leadership to assess progress in every component of the Initiative; gather, interpret and use data to inform the planning and decision-making process.\r\n\r\n",
