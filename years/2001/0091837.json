The last few years have seen rapid progress in the development and application of (U-Th)/He dating, and He ages have been shown to provide quantitative new insights to a range of important Earth science problems. Hedges has been an integral part of He dating efforts at Caltech, particularly in promoting collaborations and in dissemination of the details of the techniques we have developed. This Phase II award will allow her to continue to 1) retain responsibility for day-to-day maintenance of hardware and supplies in the He dating laboratory, 2) educate new users from within Caltech and in the outside community in how to prepare and analyze He age samples, 3) analyze samples supplied by collaborators, and 4) prepare, distribute, analyze, and evaluate a small number of mineral standards for distribution within the rapidly growing He dating community.\r\n***\r\n",
