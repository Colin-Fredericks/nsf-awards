 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel drug delivery method for treatment of diseases and symptoms that currently require intravenous, subcutaneous injections or oral intake. This  method is based on the use of drugs in an extremely fine and ultra lightweight particle form called AerohalantTM that is especially formulated for advanced inhalation therapy. AerohalantTM particles will have much higher tendency to stay aloft than state-of-the-art inhalants and next generation inhalants currently under development by the pharmaceutical companies. AerohalantTM particles will reach mucous membranes of the innermost part of the patients' lungs without depositing any matter in the throat or the thoracic region, and therefore, utilize most of the tennis court sized alveolar surface area inside human lungs. These ultra light drug particles, on contact with thin fluid layer on mucous membranes in the alveoli, can dissolve and reach the blood stream much faster than by state-of-the art inhalants, subcutaneous, intravenous injections and orally ingested medications. Alternately, these particles could also be designed to release slowly. This Phase I project proposes to produce one commonly injected pharmacotherapeutic agent in the special powder form and to conduct feasibility tests with respect to suspension characteristics of Aerohalant TM particulates in the air, the in vitro activity, and the rate of dissolution and absorption.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project are in the medical field for production of inhalable forms of common therapeutic drugs.",
