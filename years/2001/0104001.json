 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the next five years, the Principal Investigator proposes \r\nto examine the mathematical issues and develop computational methods\r\nfor solving the following classes of direct and inverse problems\r\nmotivated by industrial applications: scattering and diffraction by periodic \r\nstructures (gratings), second harmonic generation in nonlinear diffractive \r\noptics, and inverse and optimal design problems in diffractive optics.  \r\nThe main topics of the proposed work are as follows:\r\n-- Modeling, analysis, and computation of the diffraction by periodic \r\nchiral structures and the scattering by a perturbed diffractive structure. \r\nModeling and design of electromagnetic resonances.\r\n-- Well-posedness of the nonlinear Maxwell equations in second harmonic\r\ngeneration.  An interface least-squares finite element method for solving\r\nthe three-dimensional model problem.  Structure (grating)\r\n enhanced nonlinear optical effects.  Effects of coatings on nonlinear \r\ndiffractive optics.\r\n-- Optimal design of diffractive structures.  A relaxation technique \r\n(homogenization) and a local approach for the optimal design problem.  \r\nUniqueness, stability, and regularity studies of the inverse diffraction \r\nproblem.  Numerical solution of inverse and optimal design problems in \r\ndiffractive optics.\r\n\r\nThe recent enabling technologies of high-performance computing facilities\r\nand microlithographic fabrication techniques have led to an explosion of\r\napplications of diffraction in optics, establishing diffractive optics \r\nas one of the most rapidly advancing areas of current research \r\nin optical engineering.  The practical applications and scientific developments \r\nhave driven the need for rigorous partial differential equation\r\nmodels, mathematical analysis, and numerical algorithms\r\nto describe the diffraction of complicated grating structures, to compute \r\nelectromagnetic fields and thus to predict the performance of a given \r\ndiffractive structure in linear, chiral, and nonlinear optical media, as well \r\nas to carry out optimal design of new structures.  The proposed research has \r\nsignificant potential for evolving new mathematics and science and providing \r\nindustry with guidance to design and fabricate new optical devices.\r\n",
