 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses several problems in three areas of computational \r\ncomplexity.   The overall objective in each case is to understand the limits \r\nof the capabilities of computers and the algorithms that run on them.  \r\nThe first area of research concerns tradeoffs between the processing time and \r\nstorage requirements of computations: \r\nWhen can one solve problems using algorithms that are both fast and \r\nuse small amounts of storage and when is one limited to trading off these\r\ntwo resources, reducing storage requirements only at the cost of \r\nadditional running time?\r\nThe second area of research concerns the increased efficiencies in data \r\nstructures that are possible by taking advantage of the wide range of \r\ninstructions in modern processors that operate on entire computer words at \r\nonce.\r\nThe third area of research involves the analysis of algorithms to solve \r\nNP-hard search problems.\r\nWhen many such algorithms search but do not find a solution to a problem,\r\nthey implicitly provide proofs that no such solution exists.\r\nIn this portion of the research, the investigators analyze the form of these \r\nimplicit proofs to show the limits of the efficiencies of these search \r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the research in time-space tradeoffs builds on the \r\ninvestigators' previous work on time-space tradeoff lower bounds and is aimed \r\nat extending these results to other natural problems such as graph \r\nconnectivity and improving the complexity limits shown by current lower bound \r\ntechniques.\r\nThe research in data structures works in the model of random-access machines \r\nwith arbitrary unit-cost operations on word-size quantities.\r\nThe goal of this data structure research is to understand the limits of the\r\nalgorithmic improvements possible in this model, particularly for \r\nnearest-neighbor queries, priority queues, sorting, and garbage collection.\r\nThe research on the complexity of NP-search algorithms focuses on\r\nthe proof complexity of co-NP properties of random structures.\r\nThe goal is to show that for randomly-chosen inputs, natural proof systems \r\nsuch as resolution almost always require exponential-size proofs of membership \r\nin the co-NP sets corresponding to the duals of natural NP problems.\r\nA consequence of this would be proofs that large classes of algorithms for \r\nsolving the NP problems require exponential time on large numbers of inputs.",
