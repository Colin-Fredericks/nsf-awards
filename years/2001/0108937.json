 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of laboratory experiments in gravitation is to be continued and expanded, in parallel with continued development of the cryogenic torsion pendulum as a general tool for research in gravitational physics.   Much of this work will be done  in collaboration with the gravitational physics group of Professor Paul Boynton at the University of Washington.  \r\n\r\nResearch to be conducted includes:\r\n\r\nCompletion in the first year of a precision measurement of the gravitational constant G, with\r\ntarget accuracy of 15 ppm.\r\n\r\nJointly with Professor Boynton's  group, a test of the inverse square distance dependence of the gravitational force for mass separation on the order of 15 centimeters.\r\n\r\nJointly with Boynton's group, tests of the equivalence principle over various distance ranges,\r\nfor gravitational field sources which include laboratory masses, a nearby mountain, and the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThese projects will be conducted in an underground laboratory that has been prepared with support from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in a former Nike missile bunker on an isolated environmental preserve near\r\nRichland, Washington.  \r\n\r\nIn conjunction with these projects, the performance of the cryogenic torsion\r\npendulum will be progressively improved through development and refinement of seismic isolation, tilt control, temperature control, and fiber choice and preparation techniques.   \r\n\r\nThe cryogenic torsion pendulum being  developed is of potential value to any research in gravitation or other fields which requires the measurement of extremely small slowly varying forces.\r\n\r\nThis project provides research experience and training in a variety of widely applicable technologies, to undergraduate and graduate students as well as to a postdoctoral researcher.  \r\n",
