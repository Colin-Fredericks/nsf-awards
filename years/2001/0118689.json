 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) Working Group on Women in Physics is undertaking an international benchmarking effort to learn about the status and trends relating to women in physics internationally and it is organizing an International Conference on Women in Physics to be held in Paris, France in March 2002.  Funds from the National Science Foundation will support part of the benchmarking effort, the analysis and publication of its results, the participation of US physicists - especially students and early-career physicists - in the conference, the publication and dissemination of the conference proceedings and action plan, and some follow up.  These NSF funds will be supplemented by other grants and in-kind contributions from other Federal agencies, scientific organizations, international sources, and industry.  Essentially this same proposal is being sent to the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), with complementary but not overlapping budget requests.  The National Academy of Sciences has already committed to provide $25K in general, unrestricted support, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has committed $10K.",
