Current database languages are suitable for querying a single database, but are not powerful enough to reconcile such \"schematic heterogeneity\" among databases. New languages have been proposed to achieve interoperability among multiple databases. This research project is concerned with query optimization for such languages, in particular \"schemaSQL\", a recently proposed extension of the industry-standard database language SQL. The restructuring capabilities provided by schemaSQL and similar languages have applications far beyond multi-database systems. For example, operating data over possibly many years of operation are summarized and stored in a data warehouse. The warehouse data can then be analyzed for patterns and trends to improve the operations. Restructuring of the warehouse data can potentially result in a significant increase in query processing efficiency. This research project involves a team of graduate and undergraduate students, and will enhance the development of human resources in science and engineering both at graduate as well as undergraduate level. The results of this project will provide a new approach to querying and query optimization using restructuring and will have applications in multi-database systems interoperability and efficient query processing, data warehousing efficiency, and physical database structuring for optimized operation. \r\nURL:   http://www.uncg.edu/~sadrif/nsf/query-optimization.html\r\n\r\n",
