 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fort Valley State University (FVSU) has sustained the commitment to its mission \r\nand strategic plan of providing quality educational experiences for under \r\nrepresented minority group individuals (who constitute 93% of enrolled students), \r\nequipping them for productive and effective citizenry in an increasingly\r\ncompetitive society. A recent benchmarking, study conducted by the University \r\nSystem of Georgia, hailed FVSU as one of the top four institutions in the State with \r\na competitive retention rate of 70% or better. Additionally, 88% or more of FVSU's \r\nbiological sciencesgraduates are placed in medical or graduate school. We proposes\r\nto build upon this successful tradition of minority group retention and graduation \r\nfrom general baccalaureate degree programsby increasing more broadly the number \r\nof minority group graduates who pursue advanced studies in Science, Mathematics,\r\nEngineering, and Technology (SMET). \r\n\r\nFunding is requested to achieve the primary goals of increasing the number of minority \r\nstudents graduating with a major in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology \r\n(SMET) by 30%, and achieving a 10% increase over a five- year period in the number of \r\nSMET graduates pursuing master and doctoral degrees. There are three strategic \r\ninitiatives being proposed to achieve these goals namely: i) enhancing the recruitment, \r\nand retention, of SMET major, ii) enhancing the infrastructure for providing technology if\r\nused and research-based SMET courses of instruction, and iii) providing career \r\nawareness opportunities in SMET field of study. These goals will be achieved via \r\nachievement of five interrelated objectives: 1) Enriching the academic preparation of\r\nstudents in SMET disciplines by focusing on developing course reform and enhancement,\r\n2) Broadening and strengthening the research program for faculty development, \r\n3) Strengthening the partnerships with academic institutions and industrial labs to\r\nenhance quality research experiences for students, 4 ) Infusing technology into teaching,\r\nresearch, and professional development, and 5) Enhancing critical transition activities \r\nto improve access and retention of undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nThese objectives will be accomplished in different phases: revising gateway courses and \r\nimproving the performance of students in SMET gate-keeping bottleneck courses via\r\n including research/lab exercises and providing students tutorial assistance. Faculty \r\nenrichment activities will improve their research skills, collaborative research will \r\nprovide wide exposure to students to opportunities to become familiar with SMET \r\nprograms. Providing `hands-on experience'' to students using the state-of-the art\r\nfacilities and other enrichment activities will improve their skills, and motivate them\r\nto pursue graduate studies. Student participation will be promoted by financial \r\nassistance as work study/stipend, and by summer internships at major research \r\ninstitutions. Bridging initiative to address high school/ undergraduate-graduate-\r\njob market transitions in SMET fields will also be established. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that this project will: 1) substantially increase the number of \r\nminority graduates in SMET disciplines and increase the proportion of those graduates\r\n who pursue advanced degrees in these disciplines through bridging and career awareness \r\nprograms; 2) strengthen faculty expertise and capability to mentor students as \r\nresearchers, and overall commitment to continued professional development as SMET\r\n scholars - a 10% increase in faculty research projects, publications, linkages, and \r\ngrantsmanship will be attained; 3) promote gains in learning through the provision \r\nof a revised SMET curriculum which builds on increased faculty interactions with the \r\nincorporation of inquiry-based pedagogy; and 4) promote the greatest potential for student\r\n enrollment and success in SMET disciplines by enhancing the physical infrastructure (e.g.,\r\n teaching/ research facilities) of the university. \r\nDr. Sarwan Dhir, Assistant Professor, having strong project management experience will\r\ndirect the program under the supervision of Dr. Josephine Davis, Vice President Academic \r\nAffairs. A Leadership Team of the Chairs of the SMET departments and an Advisory Committee \r\nof internal and external distinguished scientists will conduct an annual review of the program \r\noutcomes as well as formative evaluation as the program is developed. The results of this \r\nproject will be disseminated widely in the professional community through presentations \r\nat regional and national/scientific meetings and publications in scientific journals. \r\nThe general public will have access to the successful efforts of this project through FVSU \r\nweb site. The commitment of Fort Valley State University is evidenced from the supporting \r\nletter from Dr. Oscar L. Prater, President, FVSU, and overall supervision of Vice President\r\nfor Academic Affairs and participation of Dean's, on the Advisory Committee, release \r\ntime for faculty, matching cost of the equipment, and allocation of physical facilities \r\nfor the teaching and research laboratories and use of other facilities and resources. \r\nThis project will advance the mission of the University through its provision of high \r\nquality degree programs that increase the participation of minority group graduates\r\nin higher education. \r\n",
