This is resulting in changes in species composition and ecosystem functions such as primary production and nutrient cycling. The aim of this research is to obtain a mechanistic explanation for an ecosystem level response to increased nutrient input along a salinity gradient.  Dr. Rejmankova and colleagues propose that there is a context (salinity) dependent switch between phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) limitation in tropical marshlands. This project will use P-limited wetland ecosystems in Belize as a model system on which to document how nutrient limitation can be shifted along a salinity gradient through different constraints on individual components of plant communities. A short-term mesocosm experiment will evaluate response of individual marsh components to different levels of salinity, P and N.  A long-term experiment involving additions of nutrients to a replicated set of marshes of different salinity will verify the predictions of the ecosystem-level response. In addition to the intellectual merit of a better understanding of these ecosystems, the project has immediate relevance to conservation of wetlands, and may provide data that will be relevant to malaria control in Belize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
