Participants in the conferences will include faculty and administrators from tribal colleges, librarians, technology experts, experts in Native American culture and learning, and leaders of selected NSDL projects.\r\n\r\nGoals of the project include:\r\n\r\n-- determining and implementing strategies for making the NSDL more accessible, meaningful, and useful to American Indians;\r\n-- providing opportunities for tribal colleges to participate in and inform the NSDL during its early development and into the future; and\r\n-- creating and extending metadata and classification schemes that incorporate the cultures and views of various American Indians and Alaska Natives.\r\n\r\nAIHEC is conducting the project in collaboration with the Alliance for Community Technology at the University of Michigan's School of Information, which has supported the development of the AIHEC Virtual Library with funding from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.\r\n",
