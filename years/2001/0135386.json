 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis proposal seeks funding for a workshop to bring together some 20 leading scholars and industry leaders to discuss needed research and theory development ininnovation and organization change. Organized by the editors of Organization Science, a leading journal of organization studies, workshop participants will collaborate to write white papers to set a research agenda for organization studies and management for the coming years. Currently managers face enormously changed circumstances from those of most of the last century, during which much organization theory was generated. The accumulated changes in the nature of work, organixations, and the external environment, including science and technology, cry out urgently for new theory based on sound empirical work. The workshop will be convened at NSF in Arlington in June 2002, with knowledge dissemination via the web, a sepcial issue of the journal Organization Science, and a research monograph to be published (tentatively) by Stanford University Press.",
