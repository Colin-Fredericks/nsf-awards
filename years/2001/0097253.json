 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Utah.  Richard Steiner is the site's Program Director.  Ten faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), 10 students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  Recruitment efforts will target students who do not have substantial research opportunities at there own institutions.  In addition, the program will seek to attract a mix of students representing rural and urban upbringing and will focus on females and ethnic minorities. The research projects offered are in the areas of analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.   Throughout the program, emphasis will be placed on students learning how to work independently on a project while also learning the importance of scientific interactions and teamwork.  At the program's conclusion the students will give oral reports, participate in a poster session, and submit s final written report.  Program evaluation will include a Likert scale questionnaire for the student participants, and correspondence with the student participants during the academic year immediately following the research experience.\r\n",
