 "awd_abstract_narration": "0097544\r\nGarbini\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest and most enduring dreams of the scientific community\r\nis to directly observe molecular structure nondestructively, in situ, in\r\nthree dimensions, with Angstrom-scale resolution.  Such an imaging\r\ntechnology would immediately address urgent needs in nanoscale\r\nengineering, materials science, molecular biology, and medicine.  The\r\nobjective of the proposed research is to create such a technology.\r\n\r\nThe proposed method is magnetic resonance force microscopy MRFM, which\r\nwas conceived in 1991, by the proposers specifically as a means for 3D\r\nmolecular imaging.  The central concept of MRFM is to combine\r\nthree-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging with angstrom-scale probe\r\nmicroscopy.  MRFM was first experimentally demonstrated in 1992 in\r\ncollaboration with Dan Rugar's IBM group.  Subsequently, MRFM has\r\ndeveloped into a worldwide sensing and imaging research effort.\r\n\r\nThe specific aims of this NSF proposal are to:  (1) demonstrate\r\nnanoscale resolution in 3D MRFM imaging; (2) achieve a reliable,\r\nexperimentally validated understanding of electron and proton spin\r\nrelaxation in the MRFM environment; and (3) extend present design\r\nprinciples for optimal control and estimation to the quantum environment\r\nappropriate to single spin imaging.\r\n\r\nThe proposed means are to:  (1) validate and calibrate the proposers'\r\nnewly completed 3D MRFM scanner, via force, parametric, and multiplex\r\nimaging experiments; (2) design and operate a next-generation adaptive\r\ndigital controller, incorporating optimal control, estimation, and\r\ndiagnostic algorithms; and (3) survey electron and proton spin\r\nrelaxation in a variety of target samples.\r\n\r\nThe proposed opening of a new imaging window onto the largely unobserved\r\nworld of 3D molecular structure will revolutionize the fields of\r\nnanoscale engineering, materials science, biology, medicine, and\r\nengineering education.\r\n",
