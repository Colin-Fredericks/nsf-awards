Rosenberg\r\n\r\n \r\nProfessor Jonathan Rosenberg will study the topology and \r\ngeometry of manifolds and manifold-like spaces, as well as \r\nC*-algebraic index theory.  By this we mean a combination \r\nof C*-algebra theory, index theory of elliptic operators,\r\nK-theory, geometry, and topology.  One main focus of the \r\nproposal will be the use of invariants coming from C*-algebras (especially Kasparov's KK-theory) to study the geometry and \r\ntopology of manifolds.  For example, KK-classes coming from the classical elliptic operators (the Euler characteristic\r\noperator, the signature operator, and the Dolbeault operator)\r\nwill be intensively studied.  Attention will also be paid to the equivariant case, where a finite group acts on the manifold in question.  These studies will deepen the link between \r\ntopological and analytic approaches to manifold theory.  \r\nIn addition, Professor Rosenberg will study the classification \r\nof manifolds via their Yamabe invariants, and the \r\nclassification of metrics of positive scalar curvature, \r\nproblems which involve a quite subtle blend\r\nof differential topology, differential geometry,\r\nand analysis.  He will also study the applications\r\nof K-theory to the study of C*-algebras, and various \r\nrelated problems on algebraic K-theory, especially on \r\nalgebras of operators or on algebras coming from \r\nquantization of geometrical systems.\r\n\r\nThe context of this project is the use of new methods \r\nin analysis, based on noncommutative operator algebras, \r\nfor attacking problems in geometry and topology.  On the \r\none hand, these methods are useful as a new source\r\nof tools for studying geometry, especially in high dimensions.  \r\nAnd on the other hand, the methods are motivated (and more \r\nor less forced) by the quantization of classical physical \r\nsystems.  The study of the scalar curvature properties of \r\nmanifolds is also motivated by problems in gravitation.  \r\nProfessor Rosenberg will continue to train graduate\r\nstudents in analysis, geometry, and topology, and will \r\nalso work toward integration of mathematical software \r\ninto the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.\r\n",
