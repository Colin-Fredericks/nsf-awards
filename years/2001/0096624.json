Zolandz, NAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current status of nanoscale science and engineering research and development (R&D) was evaluated by the Interagency Working Group on Nanoscience, Engineering and Technology (IWGN) and after August 2000 by the NSTC's Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering and Technology (NSET).  The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) was initiated in FY2001 and White House FY2002 budget request recommended increased funding for the field.  NNI has as its overall objective to assure that U.S. will fully benefit from the development of a new technology, and maintains or attains the capacity to be a leader or a competitive participant in all areas of nanoscale science, engineering and technology.  The National Research Council will compare the current state of the U.S. in this field to the state required to meet the NNI objective.  It will then consider whether the U.S. research portfolio in nanotechnology, as represented by the NNI, addresses those gaps which must be bridged to achieve this objective.  An interim letter-report will be prepared by October 15, 2001.\r\n",
