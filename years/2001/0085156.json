 "awd_abstract_narration": "0085156\r\nKomvopoulos\r\nRecent demands for polymers exhibiting chemical inertness, low adhesion (friction), high wear resistance, and good biocompatibility have necessitated the discovery of surface treatments that can alter the physicochemical surface properties of polymers without affecting the bulk characteristics.  This research is on plasma-assisted modification of the surface chemistry and microstructure of various polymer materials used in the medical field(i.e., polyethylene, polyurethane, polycarbonate, polymethylmethacrylate, and polystyrene).  The proposed research will utilize state-of-the-art plasma-assisted surface modification, microanalysis, and tribotesting techniques suitable for evaluating the material response at different scales.  The novelty of the proposed surface modification method stems from the use of different plasma compositions to modify, in a controlled fashion, the surface chemistry (e.g., crafting of low-surface long-chain molecules in the near-surface region) of the polymers.  Since the resulting surface properties and chemical state strongly depend on controlling process conditions, basic research elucidating the effects of plasma treatment parameters (e.g., power density, plasma composition, working pressure, and gas flow rate)  on the chemical behavior  (e.g., crafting of protein friendly molecules, surface energy, and degree of hydrophilicity)  and tribological properties of the polymers will be conducted.  The ultimate objective is to develop a plasma treatment technique that enables modification of the surface chemistry, microstructure, and mechanical/tribological properties of polymers used in various medical applications.  Specifically, in addition to obtaining insight into the surface characteristics of plasma-treated polymers, the information derived from this research should have direct implications to the fabrication of low-friction catheters for non-invasive cardiovascular treatment and design of wear-resistant artificial joints exhibiting good biocompatibility.",
