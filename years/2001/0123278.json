 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2001 Workshop on Future Directions in Solid State Chemistry will deal with the present status and likely future challenges and opportunities, especially in interdisciplinary research areas. The Solid State Chemistry Workshop which will take place at the University of California Davis from October 12-14,  2001. This is the second NSF sponsored Solid-State Chemistry workshop. Discussions at the first workshop (Journal of Solid State Chemistry 149, 3-8, 2000)  centered on future opportunities and challenges at the core of the solid-state chemistry discipline.  This second workshop will address the challenges and future opportunities at the interfaces of solid-state chemistry with other disciplines in both the biological and physical sciences. \r\n%%%\r\nWith a focus on the integration of research with education in interdisciplinary areas, the 2001 Workshop on Solid State Chemistry will  have a very broad impact. It is a particularly timely venture given that most of the important issues in contemporary materials science and education are clearly multidisciplinary. Eight topical areas focused on the integration of research and educaion are at the interfaces between solid-state chemistry and (1) nanoscale science, (2) biology, (3) theory and condensed matter physics, (4) molecular and macromolecular materials, (5) earth, planetary, and environmental science, (6) interdisciplinary and graduate education, (7) energy storage and conversion, and (8) national facilities. Publication of the results of the discussions is anticipated for the benefit of the whole materials science community.\r\n",
