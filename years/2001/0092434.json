 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nucleophility of imidazole and benzimidazole carbenes will be explored.  Novel achiral and chiral [2.2] imidazolophanes will be synthesized and their nucleophilic reactivity investigated.  The educational component of the plan will introduce a form of collaborative learning into an honors organic chemistry lab course.  Students will be divided into small groups and visit several stations (self-contained experiments) during their lab periods.  Outreach to elementary schools in terms of demonstrations and hands-on activities is also part of the educational plan.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Professor Steven T. Diver of the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York, Buffalo.  The fundamental chemistry of a class of compounds known as imidazole carbenes will be studied.  Encapsulation of these carbenes into a rigid framework which may confer unusual properties onto these molecules will also be accomplished.  The educational portion of the plan will continue the PI's visits to elementary schools to give demonstrations and allow the implementation of the PI's cooperative learning modules into an honors organic chemistry lab course.",
