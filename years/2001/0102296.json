 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action provides support for U.S. participation in the tsunami symposium to be held in Nice, France, March 2001.  This symposium is a part of the Natural Hazards program within the 26th General Assembly of the European Geophysical Society.  It will present the state-of-the-art as regards tsunami generation, propagation and impact along coastlines, as well as discuss the tools needed to assess and mitigate the tsunami hazard.  The participants supported by this grant include key researchers and junior members of the U.S. tsunami community; their presence at this meeting is critical for future cooperative research efforts.  The symposium topics include contributions from geophysics, geology, numerical modeling, social and economical sciences, urban planning, and warning systems.\r\n\r\nTsunami research has become increasingly important and international in its focus.  Strong international cooperation is necessary since tsunamis can affect not only the region near the source but also distant regions through propagation across oceans.  There were eleven major tsunami disasters around the world during the last decade, starting with the 1992 Nicaragua tsunami.  A spectrum of challenging tsunami-related research will be presented and discussed at this symposium; it is expected that collaborative projects in many of these topics will be initiated by the participants.\r\n",
