Starting around 1980, Gromov proposed classifying\r\ngroups geometrically using the relation of quasi-isometry.  He\r\ndemonstrated that the quasi-isometry class of a group G can often\r\nbe described explicitly in simple algebraic or geometric terms, a\r\nprocess now referred to as ``quasi-isometric rigidity'' or\r\n``QI-rigidity'' for the group G. The first part of this project\r\nwill be to investigate QI-rigidity problems for graphs of surface\r\ngroups and of abelian groups.  An initial focus will be those\r\ngraphs of groups with the simplest algebraic structure, namely\r\nsemidirect products with free groups, determined by a\r\nhomomorphism from a free group into an appropriate automorphism\r\ngroup such as the mapping class group of a surface.  General\r\ngraphs of surface groups are determined by homomorphisms into the\r\ncommensurability mapping class group, a much more mysterious\r\nobject, and this point of view will be used to investigate\r\nconstructions of new and interesting examples.  Also, recent work\r\non graphs of abelian groups has revealed a lot of rich structure,\r\nsuggesting a real possibility of obtaining QI-rigidity in many\r\nnew cases.  In the second part of this project, the focus will be\r\nto study geometric properties of free groups, motivated by\r\nanalogies between surface groups and free groups.  In particular,\r\nThurston's ending lamination conjecture, an important goal in the\r\nstudy of surface groups, has an analogue in the study of free\r\ngroups, in terms of classifying certain group actions up to\r\nequivariant quasi-isometry.  Pursuing this issue will require\r\ngeneralizing many of the standard tools of surface groups, such\r\nas geodesics in Teichmuller space, to the setting of free groups.\r\n\r\nGeometric group theory is the study of infinitely symmetric\r\npatterns.  Popular examples called ``surface groups'' are\r\nfamiliar from wallpaper symmetries and from the symmetries of\r\nEscher's prints.  Scientific examples occur in the symmetry\r\ngroups of crystalline arrays, and the symmetry groups of field\r\ntheories in particle physics.  The development of topology\r\nstarting in the late 19th century, and the concomitant\r\ndevelopment of combinatorial group theory, exhibited a direct\r\nlink between abstract groups and geometry.  The need for deeper\r\nunderstanding of this link has been demonstrated again and again\r\nby different threads within 20th century mathematical\r\ndevelopments.  Many of these threads were pulled together around\r\n1980 by Gromov, whose proposed unification of geometric group\r\ntheory using the relation of ``quasi-isometry'' has been very\r\nfruitful in the intervening twenty years.  The focus of this\r\nresearch project will be to investigate quasi-isometric\r\nclassification problems for several different types of symmetry\r\ngroups.  In particular, by using a constructive technique known\r\nas ``graphs of groups'', new symmetry groups can be constructed\r\nout of familiar examples such as surface groups; these and\r\nclosely related constructions will be the subjects of this\r\nresearch project.\r\n",
