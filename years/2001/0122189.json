 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding for expansion and modernization of the library at The Darling Marine Center.  The library currently contains more marine-related holdings than any other library in Maine, and is an important resource for researchers and students interested in the biology of the Gulf of Maine and the Maine coast.  Because of current space limitations, a third of the library's holdings are stored in other buildings and attic spaces. The library is not wheelchair accessible, has no significant study space, and provides only limited access to electronic databases. The proposed changes include: 1) construction of a 1,500 sq. ft. addition to the main floor of the Library, 2) the reallocation and renovation of 1,650 sq. ft. of existing space on the main floor and second floor, thus providing a total of total of 3,150 sq. ft. of additional space for library use, and 3) the purchase of computers, interactive videoconferencing hardware, and related equipment that will facilitate access to electronic information and data stored electronically.  The planned increase in amount and quality of library space, and improvements in communications equipment available to library users, will significantly improve the ability of this important regional resource to serve the needs of resident and visiting faculty, students and other users.",
