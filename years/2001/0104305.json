 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the emerging technology of smart materials and \r\nstructures has brought to the fore of scientific investigation the \r\npressing need to control, optimize, and stabilize dynamical \r\n'interactive' structures, whose components' behavior is governed by \r\npartial differential equations (PDEs).  A canonical illustrative example \r\nof keen national interest is the noise reduction problem in an acoustic \r\nchamber (aircraft's or rotorcraft's cockpit or cabin, etc).  This couples \r\nthe oscillatory behavior of the unwanted acoustic pressure (noise field) \r\nwithin the chamber with the elastic vibrations of a flexible wall of the \r\nchamber, possibly reinforced by sandwiched layers, and possibly \r\naccounting for thermo-elastic effects.  Pairwise sets of piezo-electric \r\npatches bonded on the flexible wall, once suitably wired, develop an \r\nelastic moment that is meant to dampen out the noise in the acoustic \r\nchamber.  Mathematically, the acoustic pressure is modeled by a second \r\norder scalar hyperbolic equation (wave equation), while the flexible \r\nwall is modeled by a plate-like Kirchhoff equation with or without \r\nstructural damping.  In the first case, the plate has a parabolic \r\nbehavior, in the second a hyperbolic behavior, resulting therefore in \r\neither hyperbolic/parabolic coupling, or in hyperbolic/hyperbolic \r\ncoupling of the overall structure.  Two additional key, novel, \r\ndistinguishing features of the present project are: (i) first, the \r\nlinear or non-linear PDEs describing the coupled structure have variable \r\ncoefficients in space, which is always the case when the properties of \r\nthe medium depend from point to point; (ii) and, moreover,  the flexible \r\nwall may be curved (rather than flat), and thus modeled by a shell \r\n(rather than a plate).  Accordingly, differential geometric methods are \r\nthen proposed in the control theoretic analysis of the overall coupled \r\nstructure, to cope with these two serious difficulties.  The goal is to \r\noptimally control - according to a pre-assigned optimality criterion - \r\nand asymptotically stabilize the coupled structure.  The methodology of \r\nthis project consists in first establishing a mathematical theory, to be \r\nfollowed next by a numerical analysis thereof, to yield effective and \r\ncomputable algorithms.\r\n\r\nRecent Federal research has convincingly demonstrated smart \r\nmaterials/structures to be a laboratory reality.  This is also confirmed \r\nby a Workshop Report for the National Science Foundation entitled: \r\n\"Rebuilding and enhancing the Nation's infrastructures: a role for \r\nintelligent material systems and structures\", 1993.  These new structural \r\nconcepts actively damp noise and vibration, suppress flutter at trailing \r\nedges of airfoils and enable active twist/camber of both fixed wing and \r\nrotorcraft; attenuate or suppress water borne signatures (active \r\nacoustic signature control), etc. The transition of novel smart\r\nstructures into new, truly revolutionary platforms faces many obstacles.  \r\nThe most significant is design optimization: both of the smart structure \r\nand its communication and control systems. The present project aims at \r\nproducing a contribution in this area, based on solid mathematical \r\nfoundations and analysis.\r\n",
