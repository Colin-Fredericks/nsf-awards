 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to produce soft magnetic Fe-Co nanocomposites with end applications in EMI suppression, motors, generators, magnetic bearings, magnetic recording heads and many advanced electric systems. High performance electronic color image display has become a standard feature of many modern commercial products.  These products must use timing circuits and operating frequencies from as low as 30 MHz to over 130 MHz.  Wide bandwidth electromagnetic interference (EMI) noises are inherent to these characteristically high frequency architecture systems.  Hence development of cost effective and high performance materials are of great interest to prevent EMI.  Excellent magnetic properties of nanocrystalline Fe-Co can find an important application in EMI prevention devices.  In accordance with this development, Materials Modification Inc. (MMI) proposes to synthesize and process Fe-Co nanocomposites by the powder metallurgy (P/M) route.  MMI has expertise in nanopowder processing techniques that can be easily scaled up for production. Upon completion of this Phase I project, an\r\nadvanced Fe-Co soft magnet with high permeability, large saturation magnetization, low energy loss (hysteretic and eddy current), and high temperature properties will be developed.  Composition and structure will be tailored at the nano-scale to obtain the desired mechanical and magnetic properties required for EMI suppression devices. \r\n\r\nThe nanocrystalline Fe-Co soft magnets can be used in EMI prevention devices, motors and transformers, generators, magnetic bearings, data communication interface components, magnetic recording heads, sensors, and reactors.  Fe-Co nanocomposite with superior magnetic properties, low core-loss, and creep resistance at elevated temperatures can be used in integral starter/generation (ISGs) and power units (IPUs) in a modern aircraft.\r\n",
