 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for NSF co-sponsorship of a workshop to develop a multi-author, advanced-level textbook for human-computer interaction (HCI) in the area of theories, models, and frameworks. Human-computer interaction is a broad and interdisciplinary area concerned with interactions among computational, behavioral, cognitive, social and organizational factors in the design and use of information technology. This area has rich scientific foundations, but they are not addressed in graduate curricula and are under-utilized in research and development. The approach proposed is to form a committee of leading experts who can represent each of about a dozen important scientific areas and theoretical positions: human perception, motor behavior, information processing, notational systems, interaction languages, problem-solving and exploration, distributed cognition, common ground and grounding in dyadic interactions, small group analysis, ethnographic workplace studies, organizational science and design rationale. A face-to-face workshop will integrate and synthesize first-draft materials and develop a plan for revising chapters into a coherent book. The objective is to raise the quality and legitimacy of human-computer interaction research with respect to underlying theoretical issues.\r\n\r\n",
