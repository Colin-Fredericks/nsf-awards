Moskovits, UCSB\r\n\r\n\r\nPartial travel support is requested for the U.S. academic speakers at the IBM Almaden Laboratory workshop on \"Grand Challenges of Nanotechnology\" to be organized on April 23-25 in San Jose, California.  The main purpose of the meeting is to develop a set of scientific and technological challenge issues for the future development of nanotechnology.  The deliberations and conclusions will be made available to the scientific and engineering communities and to the interested government agencies.  The workshop will bring together leading senior and young scientists from academe, industry and government from U.S. and several invited leading experts from abroad.  A group of young scientists will be invited to participate at the workshop based on nominations received from the community at large.  The information collected at the meeting will help community to guide the research in the most rewarding area, help industry and government agencies in setting up their priorities.  The IBM Journal or Research and Development will publish a selected number of contributions.  The speakers will address issues related to the scope of various grand challenges and the way to solve them, the role of technology, their implications, and the priority in funding future R&D projects.\r\n\r\n",
