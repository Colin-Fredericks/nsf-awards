 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, explores the mechanisms and kinetics of the reactions of chlorinated hydrocarbons on iron and palladium surfaces.  Using a unique suite of experimental tools, including laser induced thermal desorption and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy, developed in Professor Donald P. Land's laboratory, Land and his colleagues at the University of California-Davis are obtaining kinetic information about the decomposition of chloroethylenes on well characterized iron and palladium in ultra-high vacuum.  These model studies promise a fundamental understanding of reactions that are important in wastewater remediation chemistry.  In addition, the work provides basic molecular level information about an important class of surface reactions. \r\n\r\nThe decomposition of chlorine containing hydrocarbon compounds is of significant relevance to the remediation of wastewaters and ground waters in industrialized areas.  The work carried out in this project at the University of California-Davis is exploring the detailed molecular mechanisms of these reactions on well characterized metal surfaces.  The insight gained from these studies will enhance clean-up strategies, as well as provide fundamental understanding of an important class of surface reactions. \r\n\r\n",
