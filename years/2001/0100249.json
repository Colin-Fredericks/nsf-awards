 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposer will continue the research that he has\r\nbeen pursuing under the support of the National Science Foundation.  The\r\nspecific areas of the proposed research include the following:  (1)\r\nSimultaneous diagonalization of commuting tuples of self-adjoint operators\r\nmodulo various norm ideals.   This problem has been solved (with NSF\r\nsupport) in the case where the norm ideal is the Schatten p-class  when  p \r\nis strictly greater than  1.    The proposer will next consider the case\r\nwhere  p  is  1, i.e., where the norm ideal is the trace class.   This is\r\na difficult problem,  but this is also an important problem because of its\r\npotential applications. The proposer will  also consider a class of\r\nideals which are related to the Schatten class.  (2) The complete\r\ndetermination of automorphisms of the full Toeplitz algebra on the unit\r\ncircle which are induced by homeomorphisms of the circle.   This has been\r\naccomplished under previous NSF support in the case where the\r\nhomeomorphism in question is bi-Lipschitz.  The final goal is to remove\r\nthe bi-Lipschitz condition.  This involves some careful estimates of norms\r\nin the Toeplitz algebra and the use of certain singular integral operators.  \r\n(3) Toeplitz algebras associated with minimal flows.  The ultimate goal\r\nhere is to use  K-theory to characterize the invertibility of systems of \r\nToeplitz operators associated with such flows.   (4)   Hankel operators on\r\ncertain reproducing-kernel Hilbert spaces.   Here the main question is the\r\nSchatten-class membership of these operator.    The reproducing kernel\r\nwill be involved in certain quantitative estimates.\r\n\r\nThe proposed problems are fairly representative of the current\r\nresearch interests in operator theory and operator algebras, which is a\r\nstudy of, among other things,  the spectral properties of various linear\r\noperators.  In part inspired and demanded by the development of the\r\nquantum theory in the early part of the 20th century, this study was\r\ninitiated by great mathematicians such as H. Weyl and J. von Neumann.\r\nBecause additivity (i.e., linearity) appears in many fundamental aspects \r\nof nature, operator theory provides the right mathematical tools for\r\nscientific fields ranging from atomic physics to optimal control.  Many\r\nabstract problems in operator theory and operator algebras owe their\r\norigin to these fields of applications. For example,  both for theoretical\r\nreasons and for practical applications,  quite often one must deal with, \r\nor introduce,  perturbations which are \"small\"  by  some measure or other.\r\nProblem (1) is about such perturbations.  The root of this problem can be\r\ntraced back to a paper of Weyl published in 1909, which asserts that a\r\ncontinuous spectrum can be turned into a discrete one by a  compact  \r\n(which a measure of \"smallness\")  perturbation.  Problem (2) requires both\r\nmodern techniques and classical-style mathematical analysis.   A theme\r\nwhich underlies all these problems is the establishment of various  \r\nestimates (i.e., bounds or growth rates).   In general, the sharper the\r\nestimates, the better theorems one obtains.\r\n\r\n",
