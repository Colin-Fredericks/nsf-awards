Activities that some of the scholars are involved in include: tutorial assistance, visitations to research laboratories and graduate programs, career counseling, attendance and/ or participation in national professional conferences within their discipline and national student research conferences, writing assistance, and professional work experiences. The program focuses on students in engineering and engineering technology.",
