 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Xia proposes to continue his investigation of dynamics of\r\nHamiltonian systems. One of the most important problems in Hamiltonian\r\ndynamical systems is whether orbits in typical systems are stable.  The\r\nproposed research will address these problems, with research topics such as\r\nAubry-Mather theory, Arnold diffusions, chaotic behaviors and Newtonian\r\n$n$-body problem. The ultimate goal is to show that typical near integrable\r\nHamiltonians in higher dimensions are topologically unstable.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research concerns the stability problems in Hamiltonian\r\ndyanmics. Hamiltonian dynamical systems model many systems arising\r\nfrom classical mechanics, celestial mechanics and physics. These\r\nproblems has a long history, going back to Poincare and Birkhoff. A\r\ntypical question one often asks is the following: Is our solar system\r\nstable? One of our goals is to find an answer to this and a large\r\nclass of related questions. With recent progresses in the theory of\r\nmodern dynamical systems, we understand much better the chaotic nature\r\nof typical systems. However, the stability problem remains open except\r\nin some special cases and it is one of the most important areas of\r\nstudy, from both theoretical point of view and wide applications it\r\nfinds in various physical systems.\r\n\r\n",
