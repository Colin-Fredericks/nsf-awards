 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel mechanical means of reducing the skin friction of surfaces immersed in water. The concept to be analyzed and tested shows promise of reducing skin friction by 30 percent. The passive device would be fabricated in sheets and installed on existing immersed surfaces. While the concept is straightforward and conceptually simple, a major portion of the Phase I effort will be devoted to a proof of performance test using a simple gravity powered test rig, which will measure skin friction reductions achieved with the proposed device.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the technology would be capable of reducing skin friction drag of moving objects significantly. Reducing the skin friction by 30 percent on a typical tanker crossing a 5,000 mile ocean at 20 knots would save over 156,000 gallons of fuel (one way). Other potential applications include pump inlets and pipes, long-haul tractor trailer trucks, and high-speed trains. Military applications are multifold and include torpedoes and vehicles where high speed is a requirement.\r\n",
