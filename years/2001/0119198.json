This earthquake, called the Republic Day earthquake, had a magnitude of about 7.7 and was an unusual earthquake. It occurred in western India, far from the plate boundary between India and Eurasia. The Republic Day earthquake was an intraplate earthquake, with unusual characteristics. A network of about two dozen seismographs is to be operated for a period of 3 to 6 months to record and locate aftershocks. Related field geological studies are to be done to learn about the liquefaction and other surface effects produced by the mainshock. The hypocenter of the mainshock was relatively deep in the crust for such a large earthquake (25 km) and no surface faulting has been found from it. Recordings from the temporary network will help confirm the depth of the mainshock as well as information about the mainshock fault mechanism. \r\n",
