 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 0086351\r\nLocke\r\n\r\nThis international cooperative research project involves three research groups, one in the Unites States, one in the Czech Republic and one in Croatia.  Bruce Locke of Florida State University, Tallahassee, serves as the principal investigator along with partners Pavel Sunka from the Czech Institute of Plasma Physics, Prague, and Natalija Koprivanac of the University of Zagreb, Croatia.  Their overall objective is the development and analysis of a type of advanced oxidation technology for the degradation of complex industrial and commercial organic dyes in aqueous solutions. Specifically their work features development and evaluation of liquid phase electrical discharge reactors for the chemical degradation of azo dyes, reactive dyes, and 3-phynylmethand type dyes.\r\n\r\nThe international project builds upon the strengths of each lab including Locke's expertise in analysis of chemical reactors including electrical discharge reactors, Koprivanac's expertise in chemical reactions involving synthesis and degradation of organic dyes, and Sunka's strengths in plasma physics and analysis of electrical discharge reactors for both gas and liquid applications.  Findings are expected to lead to an improved understanding and eventual development of: 1) new electrode materials for liquid phase electrical discharge processes using plasma-spraying technology in Prague,\r\n2) new reactor configurations combining gas and liquid phase discharges in Tallahasee, and, in Zagreb, 3) chemical reaction pathways for dye degradation using ozone and or hydrogen peroxide in combination with various zeolites. If successful, combined results should yield more efficient and effective processes for the degradation and removal of complex organic dyes from commercial, industrial and manufacturing wastewater.\r\n\r\nThis project in engineering processes fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
