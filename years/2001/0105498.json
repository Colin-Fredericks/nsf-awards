Each topic is motivated by an application\r\nin on-line resource allocation in computer systems and is studied\r\nusing theoretical analysis as well as empirical evaluation.\r\nThe first topic is focuses on\r\ndesigning protocols for power management.\r\nThe second topic  of this research addresses problems\r\nthat arise in scheduling and load balancing for multimedia servers.\r\nThe third topic focuses on the problem of balancing the use of\r\nbandwidth and storage in caching continuous multi-media objects\r\nfor Web proxy servers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the power management topic, the question addressed is when to move\r\nan idle  device to a lower power consumption state so as to\r\nconserve power usage while minimizing the latency experienced by the\r\nuser.  The investigator expands upon previous work on power management by\r\nintroducing the notion of latency and by studying systems with multiple\r\nlevels of power usage.  The work on multimedia scheduling and load\r\nbalancing focuses on two problems.  The first is scheduling transmission\r\nof data that must be viewed continuously when clients have large\r\nbuffers that can store data transmitted ahead of time.\r\nThe second problem is to perform load balancing in assigning\r\ntasks to servers when there are multiple resource requirements\r\nthat need to be balanced. For the topic of caching continuous\r\nmulti-media objects for Web proxy servers, the challenge\r\nis that continuous data must be transmitted to the client in a\r\ncontinuous sequential stream. To support the real time requirements\r\nof streaming, web caches need to reserve bandwidth as well as space\r\nfor each request for a continuous data object.\r\nThis research investigates algorithms for balancing these\r\ntwo resources.",
