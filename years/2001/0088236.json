 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to reform mathematics instruction at UTPA by adapting cooperative learning models with technology in a studio classroom environment similar to the ones used at California Polytechnic State for Statistics, and at Dickinson College and Kansas State for physics. Mathematics and its Application in Engineering and Science developed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, The Linear Algebra Modules Project developed by Herman, King, Moore, and Pepe, and the Geometry Teachers Activities Kit developed by J. A. Muschla and G. R. Muschla, are implemented in calculus, linear algebra, and geometry respectively. The equipping of two classrooms with computers, software, and other support materials enables faculty to provide a learning environment that emphasizes learning via discovery, exploration of concepts, and visualization. By implementing studio instruction in the gateway courses of calculus, linear algebra, and geometry, the education of pre-service secondary mathematics teachers, mathematics majors and minors, and engineering and science students is effected. Several outcomes are achieved from studio instruction. First there is increased confidence of pre-service mathematics teachers in their use of technology in secondary school classroom instruction. Also, the engineering and science major's ability to apply their mathematics training in their subsequent education is reinforced. And finally, students' understanding of geometric concepts in linear algebra and the ties between linear algebra and geometry are improved.\r\n",
