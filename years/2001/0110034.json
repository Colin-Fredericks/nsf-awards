 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on the spin-charge correlation in magnetic nanostructures.  For layered films, we will extend our research from single quantum well (QW) system to double QW system.   QW states in a single layer can result in the magnetic interlayer coupling.  Interaction between two QWs is expected to generate new magneto phenomena.  For stepped films, we will use nanometer-sized atomic steps to laterally modulate 2D thin films at nanometer scale.  Great achievements have been made in layered structures in the last decade.  Lateral modulation of a 2D thin film should further shrink the dimensionality to generate new properties.  New idea of spherical substrate will be applied to control the step orientation and the step-density in a systematic way.  All samples will be grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and characterized by Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED), Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM).  Electronic properties of the nanostructures will be measured by Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and the magnetic properties of the films will be measured by Surface Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (SMOKE) technique.  Graduate students involved in the project will receive training in fundamental experimental techniques using cutting edge technology.\r\n\r\nThe miniaturization of of information storage technology has reached a stage that physical processes at the nanometer scale dominate the overall properties of the storage materials.  This rapid development challenges fundamental research to understand materials properties in nanostructures.  The goal of this proposal is to gain a deep understanding on how materials properties change as the size approaches the ultimate nanometer length scale in magnetic materials.  To realize this goal, well-defined magnetic nanostructures will be built by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) with a control at the atomic level, and investigated with state-of-the-art techniques such as Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and Surface Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (SMOKE), etc.  Quantum confinement of electrons inside the nanostructures will be studied to explore its role in new magnetic properties.  Success of this project will be important not only to the understanding of low-dimensional magnetism, but also to the development of magnetic technology.  Graduate students involved in the project will receive training in fundamental experimental techniques using cutting edge technology.  This training will prepare them for a range of careers in both academe\r\n",
