 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research will examine atmosphere-biosphere interactions, a key component of the Earth's physical system. Understanding this interaction is crucial to improve general circulation models, as well as to monitor variations in the carbon budget. The PIs will combine models and techniques produced in previously funded projects, with surface vegetation data sets, surface energy balance and carbon flux data, and new remote sensing products. They will further develop the physical interpretation of the first appearance of spring foliage commonly called the 'green wave' in the mid-latitudes. The results will allow the development of a time line that interconnects various atmospheric and biospheric changes associated with the green wave phenomena. Baseline 30-year normals and 20th century change assessments of the timing of the onset of spring across mid-latitude locations will serve as references for future research. The work is important because it will demonstrate the critical roles that surface phenological and meteorological data play in atmosphere-biosphere simulations and for global change monitoring, when used in concert with satellite-derived bioclimatological data.",
