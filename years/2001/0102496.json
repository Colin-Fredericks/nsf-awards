Examples \r\nof nonsmooth (nondifferentiable) functions on manifolds are \r\nprovided by the maximum eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix on the \r\nmanifold of symmetric matrices, the Riemannian metric and \r\nRiemannian distance functions on Riemannian manifold, control \r\nLyapunov functions for stabilization of control systems on \r\nmanifolds and optimal value functions for optimal control \r\nproblems. The major directions  for research are the following: \r\n(i) subdifferential(infinitesimal) calculus for nonsmooth \r\nfunctions on smooth manifolds;\r\n(ii) applications of subdifferential calculus to optimization \r\nproblems on smooth manifolds; \r\n(iii) applications of subdifferential calculus to the study \r\nof invariance of closed sets and monotonicity of semicontinuous \r\nfunctions with respect to  solutions of differential inclusions \r\non manifolds;\r\n(iv) applications of these results to the study of generalized \r\nsolutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations on manifolds; \r\n(v) applications to the derivation of optimality conditions \r\nfor general nonsmooth control problems on manifolds; \r\n(vi) applications of subdifferential calculus for constructing\r\ndiscontinuous optimal and stabilizing feedback controls using \r\nnonsmooth optimal value  and control Lyapunov functions;\r\n(vii) the study of interior point methods in semistable and \r\nsemidefinite programmings via discontinuous feedback techniques \r\nand the study of generalized gradient flows on manifolds.\r\n\r\nDesign of high-performance feedback controls for nonlinear systems \r\nwhose mathematical models include manifolds is an active research \r\narea oriented to automotive, aerospace, and naval applications. \r\nIt has been recognized that, in general, control tasks (such as \r\nstabilization or robust optimal control) for these systems cannot \r\nbe performed using traditional continuous feedback and  require  \r\ndiscontinuous feedback.  Since existing mathematical tools \r\n(differential inclusion theory)  have proved inadequate for \r\nanalysis of discontinuous feedback performance, this research \r\nproject is aimed at developing  new analytical tools and techniques \r\nfor such analysis. But feedback control is not the only one research \r\nfield which will benefit from these new  analytical tools.  Other  \r\nfields of application for  these research results include numerical \r\nand theoretical optimization, in particular, a development of\r\nrobust numerical methods  for new semistable and semidefinite \r\noptimization problems, and  generalized solutions of partial \r\ndifferential equations on manifolds .\r\n",
