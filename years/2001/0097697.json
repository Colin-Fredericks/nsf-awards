 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n         The Graduate Program in Nutrition at The Pennsylvania State \r\nUniversity is pleased to continue its offering of a summer program, \r\n\"Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program:  Biology and \r\nChemistry of Nutritional Processes.\"  The intended impact is to improve the \r\ninterest level and qualifications of participants to apply to and enroll in \r\npost-graduate education, especially in preparation for careers in science \r\nresearch and/or college teaching.\r\n\r\n         This experiential learning program builds on the commitment and \r\ncapabilities of fifteen faculty members.  Research areas focus on nutrient \r\nmetabolism related to neurological development, lipoprotein metabolism, \r\nantioxidant defense functions, skeletal development, endocrinology, \r\nimmunology, inflammatory response, behavioral neurobiology, and food \r\nscience.  The 10-week summer experience will provide 10 students: (a) \r\nknowledge of the varied approaches, techniques, and critical thinking \r\nskills used in research; (b) excitement of hands-on scientific inquiry; (c) \r\npractice to improve communication skills; and (d) guidance in graduate \r\nprograms and career planning.  Seven students will be recruited from a \r\nnational applicant pool composed of minority students or students from \r\ninstitutions with limited research activities; three students will come \r\nfrom PSU.  Penn State will financially support 3 students, assist in \r\npurchasing supplies needed for the student projects, as well as provide the \r\nresources and mentoring available at a top research institution.\r\n\r\n         Within the team environment of the faculty mentor and the graduate \r\nstudent or other staff person, each undergraduate student will design a \r\nresearch project that can be successfully completed within the summer \r\ntimeline.  Students will attend seminars by faculty, as well as go to \r\nworkshops to improve scientific communication skills.  Social events will \r\ncomplement the scientific community developed within the faculty members' \r\nlaboratories.  Finally, the summer will culminate in a student research \r\nposter session, similar to that of a national science meeting.\r\n",
