 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ocean sciences technology development project will develop and construct three new broadband autonomous seismic instruments to be used for 1) compliance measurements on the seafloor, 2) the development and testing of new sensors for broadband seismology and other geophysical applications and 3) studies of the variations in ocean floor seismic noise in preparation for the installation of permanent seafloor seismic observatories.  The instruments will be based on STS-2 three component seismometers. The primary work required involves fitting the sensors into motor driven gimbals within the glass pressure housings after installing a clamp/unclamp system onto the sensors. Broadband seismometers such as the STS-2 are very fragile and must be clamped when not on the seafloor. The compliance technique can map regions of melt within the oceanic crust and is therefore a valuable scientific tool for understanding the formation of the oceanic crust. Better instruments are required to continue the development of this technique and to extend the use of this technique to new geophysical features such as hydrates and hydrothermal areas.  Once developed and constructed, the instruments will be placed is a pool of shared-use equipment accessible by the whole research community.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
