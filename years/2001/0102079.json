 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2001.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. \r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Can selection to minimize the effects of translational and/or mutational errors explain codon usage patterns in microbes despite their diversity?\"  The investigation of error minimization mediated by biased codon usage will be extended from bacteria to their bacteriophage parasites, using both comparative genome analyses of natural isolates and laboratory evolution experiments.  Primarily, the research pursues the preliminary observations that 1) patterns of codon usage bias in bacteria appear to reflect selection for error minimization, and 2) phage genome type (e.g. dsDNA vs. ssDNA) appears to influence the degree of error minimization, but not the degree to which phage codon usage reflects host codon usage.\r\n",
