Damon\r\n\r\nProfessor Damon's research will apply infinitesimal and \r\nstratification methods from singularity theory to investigate\r\nthe topology and deformation properties of a general class of \r\nhighly nonisolated singular spaces.  These spaces arise as \r\nnonlinear sections of certain natural universal varieties.   \r\nFor instance, geometric and deformation properties of mappings \r\nunder various equivalences can be captured by such universal \r\nvarieties.  The structure of the tangent vector fields will be \r\nused to deduce algebraic formulae for certain fundamental \r\ntopological invariants.  These will be given in terms of \r\ncertain natural algebraic and geometric multiplicities, \r\nmeasuring the singular behavior of mappings relative to \r\nassociated geometric structures such as foliations  Second, \r\nhe will refine these ideas for questions in computer imaging \r\nby developing geometric structures associated to objects and \r\nfeatures in images in terms of such highly singular spaces.  \r\nThe presence of discreteness, noise, and distortions in images \r\nrequire a \"scale-based geometry\" which is applicable to nondifferentiable functions, measures, and even distributions.  \r\nSuch a geometry will apply to \"almost all\" objects in a given \r\ntype, and will yield stable geometric structures in scale space.  \r\nThis will allow the geometric analysis of images using functions \r\nand measures discriminating various features in images.\r\n\r\nThe first part of Professor Damon's research will determine \r\nfor specific types of systems of nonlinear equations, the \r\nqualitative properties of the set of solutions.  These can be \r\nobtained from certain universal systems of equations.  He \r\nproposes to use certain infinitesimal symmetries of the \r\nequations to deduce properties of the set of solutions \r\nin terms of algebraic invariants which reflect both properties \r\nof the universal equations and how the specific equations \r\nrelate to the universal ones.  Second, the research will be \r\napplied to problems in computer imaging.  To objects and \r\nfeatures in images, one may associate geometric structures \r\ncapturing their properties for various imaging purposes.  \r\nSuch structures are defined using systems of equations as \r\nabove.  The presence of discreteness, noise and distortions \r\nin images interferes with identifying geometric features.  \r\nThe research will refine the methods described above via \r\n\"scale-based\" versions which introduce robust geometric \r\nstructures overcoming these difficulties, which can then be\r\nused for a variety of computer imaging problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n",
