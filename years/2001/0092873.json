 "awd_abstract_narration": "0092873  Douglas Emlen\r\n\r\nThis project entails a five-year program of research and education.  Research focuses on the development and evolution of extreme shapes in animals. Dung beetles of the genus Onthophagus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) often produce extraordinary horns not unlike the enlarged antlers of elk or moose. Horns in beetles generally are produced by males, and are used in aggressive contests over reproductive access to females. Here, building on almost ten years of prior research with these animals, the PI will integrate approaches of development, genetics, evolution, and behavior to eludidate mechanisms underlying the evolution of diversity in horns of beetles and to examine how functional costs of horn production may constrain their evolution. This research program is designed to provide meaningful research experiences for motivated undergraduates at all levels of the scientific process (design and implementation of experiments, analysis, writing, and dissemination of results). The PI will design a course on evolution that builds on this research program, as well as others at the University of Montana, so that immediate and tangible research projects provide vehicles for conveying major concepts in biology. This research- and concept-based approach to teaching evolution will also entail student internships in local high school biology classrooms, as part of an existing outreach program between the biology department at the University of Montana and the community at large.  \r\n",
