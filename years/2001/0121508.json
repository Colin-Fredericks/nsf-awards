These are relatively new projects and there is great interest in them as possible vehicles for assistance to states and school districts.  The conference, to be held in July 2001, is therefore extremely timely.\r\n\r\nA white paper will be produced that captures successful approaches and strategies.  This paper will be helpful to the field in providing documentation about successful and promising approaches to implementing curriculum reform.",
