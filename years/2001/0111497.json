 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials research will allow Brandeis University to acquire a light scattering spectrometer that will be the keystone f a facility to perform both static and dynamic light scattering measurements. The facility will be multi-user and multi-disciplinary, as well as fulfill research and educational needs. The facility will consist of an ALV light scattering spectrometer ($80k), a homemade static light scattering spectrometer (built in 1999), and a Brookhaven differential refractometer (purchased in 2000). Currently there are no general-purpose light scattering spectrometers at Brandeis. The equipment will be used as a non-invasive probe to study complex fluids, such as liquid crystals, colloidal suspensions, and protein crystallization in the Physics department. Several members of Biology and Chemistry departments will have access to this facility as secondary users. Their research goals are to study protein complexes. The equipment be used to train physics graduate and undergraduate students and biology graduate students in light scattering, an important technique in its own right, which additionally shares many principles with other techniques such as neutron and x-ray scattering. Students will take either a six or nine week intensive training course in light scattering that will integrate pedagogical instruction with research experience. Instructional exercises will be developed to elucidate both physical phenomena of macromolecules and to provide training in light scattering techniques. This combination will give students a greater understanding of complex fluids in general and will enable them to participate in research, at Brandeis with a deeper understanding of scattering techniques and principles. Finally, this will be the only research-grade general-purpose light scattering instrument at Brandeis University. Thus establishment of this facility will have a large impact on research program of the investigators, as well as serve as a resource for the entire campus.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials research will allow Brandeis University to acquire a light scattering spectrometer that will be the keystone f a facility to perform both static and dynamic light scattering measurements.
