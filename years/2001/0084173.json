 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) is operated by a consortium composed of the University of Florida, Florida State University, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Florida State University administers the Laboratory as a national user facility, available competitively to users on the basis of merit. Established in 1990 and dedicated in 1994, the Laboratory through an extraordinary state-federal partnership with multi-agency participation has developed unique facilities in support of magnet-related research at the highest attainable magnetic fields. The Laboratory is structured around four major thrusts: (1) user facilities\r\ndeveloped in response to users' needs that are opening new frontiers for science opportunities, (2) magnet science and technology developed in partnership with the private sector to enhance U.S. competitiveness, (3) basic science research driven by a partnership between external and in-house users that drives new opportunities in high magnetic field science and technology, and (4) the integration of research and education at all levels, and partnership with academia, industry, government and international institutions to advance research and technology in the area of high magnetic fields.\r\n\r\nOver the first ten years the NHMFL has put in place a unique range of instruments and facilities for research in high magnetic fields, including continuous field, pulsed fields, and magnetic resonance research. During this time the Laboratory has established itself as the world's leading center for multi-disciplinary research using high magnetic fields. It has developed an outstanding educational program and built strong collaborations with academic, industrial, government and international partners. The focus of the Laboratory is now shifting from a primary emphasis on magnet technology and development to include increased support for service to users from a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines.  The Laboratory is now building on the federal and state investment to realize the full scientific potential of the new facility, while the science and magnet technology programs expand the current capabilities, develop new magnet systems, and drive new science discoveries at the highest fields and at extremes of pressure and temperature. The Laboratory provides continuous fields (up to 45 tesla) in the magnetic field region formerly thought to be reserved for only pulsed magnets, and reversible pulsed fields (60 tesla for tenths of a second and up to 79 tesla for milliseconds). The availability of opportunities in magnetic resonance at 900 MHz and beyond will be a critical aspect of the Laboratory's efforts to build a users' center of excellence in very high field magnetic resonance spectroscopies. The in-house science program has been developed in cooperation with the external users and addresses a wide range of research areas including highly-correlated electron systems, magnetic materials, magnetic resonance spectroscopies applied to the chemical, physical, and biological sciences, and the development of novel instrumentation to take advantage of the magnet facilities available to users.\r\n",
