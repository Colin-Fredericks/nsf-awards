DeSimone of the NSF Science and Technology Center for Environmentally Responsible Solvents and Processes at the University of North Carolina and Patrick Lacroix-Desmazes of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de Chimie, Montpellier, France.  The project addresses the synthesis of novel fluorinated block copolymers using nitroxides, their characterization in supercritical carbon dioxide solution and subsequent use in the dispersion polymerization of styrene, methacryaltes, acrylates and copolymers. The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in using supercritical carbon dioxide as a polymerization solvent.  His group will characterize the solution properties of the fluorinated co-polymers; and perform static light scattering studies.  This is complemented by French expertise in the synthesis of copolymers.  The French laboratory will make the copolymers by a living free-radical polymerization process based on the use of nitroxides. Fluorinated block copolymers, a class of industrially important polymers, are typically insoluble in traditional organic and halogenated solvents.  The proposed collaboration will advance understanding of characterization of  fluorinated block copolymers and the use of  super critical carbon dioxide as an environmentally benign method for producing them.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover the expenses of visits of members of the US research group. The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States.\r\n",
