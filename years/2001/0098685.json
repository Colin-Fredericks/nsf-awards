 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rankin, Joanna\r\n\"Low Frequency Pulsar and Interstellar-Medium Research at the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory\".\r\nAST-0098685\r\n\r\nWith their almost incredibly high densities and rapid rotations, pulsars provide an opportunity to test familiar physical theories in order to see if they remain valid at extremes.  Radio signals from pulsars have a different character in each waveband because the radiation is being emitted over a range of radial distances. High-frequency emission appears to originate very close to the pulsar surface while low-frequency radiation is generated at a distance of about 100 km. By studying the low-frequency radiation we obtain vital data about the way the pulsar is interacting with its surroundings. During the course of this award, collaborative research will be carried out with a number of Russian astronomers in a study of selected pulsars at low frequency. The Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory is one of the few low-frequency facilities currently available. Support is requested for visits of US astronomers to Russia and of Russian astronomers to the US as well as for some equipment upgrades. Two of the American Co-PIs have already had lengthy experience in this collaboration. The observations are time-critical because man-made radio interference at these low frequencies is increasing rapidly and may become very difficult to make in the near future. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
