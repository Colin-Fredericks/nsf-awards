 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to a special class of chaotic dynamical systems,\r\nnamely hyperbolic mathematical billiards. They serve as the prototype examples\r\nof non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems with singularities. Such systems\r\nplay an increasingly important role in the rigorous mathematical foundation of\r\nstatistical physics, so that the study of their chaotic (i. e. mixing)\r\nproperties is getting more and more physical relevance. The project mainly\r\nfocuses on a fundamental conjecture regarding this family of dynamical\r\nsystems, namely the celebrated \"Boltzmann-Sinai Ergodic Conjecture\", which\r\nstates that any finite system of (totally elastic) hard spheres moving on a\r\nflat torus is fully hyperbolic and ergodic, of course, on the level set of its\r\ntrivial first integrals. The proof of this conjecture (in its full generality)\r\nhas been so far notoriously withstanding any attack against it. The first\r\nmajor part of the present proposal directly targets this conjecture. The\r\nsecond and fourth parts are blueprints for further research in this direction\r\nby generalizing the original Boltzmann-Sinai Conjecture to cylindric billiards\r\n(mathematical billiards with cylindric scatterers) and billiards in physically\r\nmore relevant containers, like rectangular boxes. The third part of the project\r\naims at the biggest open question in the topic of Wojtkowski's one-dimensional\r\nfalling balls: Wojtkowski's still unsolved conjecture on the full hyperbolicity\r\nof the falling ball system with nonincreasing masses. (And such that not all\r\nmasses are the same, of course.) Beside these, the question of ergodicity\r\n(possibly, under the condition that a strictly concave potential acts) is also\r\nposed and targeted.\r\n\r\n The foundation of statistical physics (like heat theory, dynamical theory\r\nof fluids and gases) took place in the last third of the 18th century, mainly\r\nby the groundbreaking works of Boltzmann and Helmholz. That foundation was,\r\nhowever, based upon a strong hypothesis made by Boltzmann himself. That\r\nhypothesis claims that any physical system with a huge number of interacting\r\nparticles (like molecules) has the property that for any fixed total energy\r\nand initial state, the system will evolve to any other state with the same\r\nenergy. Although this conjecture, if taken literally, mathematically cannot\r\nhappen, yet the precise mathematical formalism and its rigorous verification\r\nfor different models of statistical physics bears a particular importance to\r\nthe understanding the physics of the surrounding world.\r\n\r\n",
