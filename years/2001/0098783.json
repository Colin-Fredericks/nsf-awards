 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2001 NCSU Industrial Mathematics Modeling Workshop for graduate students (IMMW2001) is designed to expose students in mathematics, statistics, and engineering to problems from industry and government laboratories, and introduce them to a team approach to problem solving.  The workshop is scheduled for the time period July 23, 2001to July 31, 2001 and is organized by Pierre Gremaud, Zhilin Li, Ralph Smith, and Hien Tran.  The workshop accommodates approximately 36 graduate students (for a total of 6 teams)\r\nfrom national and international institutions.  Scientists from industry or government laboratories will be invited to present current research problems and lead teams of 5-6 students through model formulation and at least partial solution of the problems.  This enriches the traditional graduate experience and provides valuable training for both students considering academic careers and those students preparing for nonacademic careers.  For students preparing for an academic career, the workshop provides experience which will significantly broaden their perspective in the classroom and may provide a catalyst for later research.  The experience is even more significant for students pursuing nonacademic careers since it provides them with an exposure to important ``real life'' problems and gives them some initial experience at addressing such problems.",
