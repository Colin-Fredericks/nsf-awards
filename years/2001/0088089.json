 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) Today's biologists need powerful computer applications to tackle the molecular haystacks of information. To prepare biology students for this challenge, the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin- Parkside (UWP) is further developing an innovative, multidisciplinary undergraduate curriculum in Molecular Biology & Bioinformatics (MBB). The objective of the MBB program is to give our students hands-on facility with molecular biology laboratory techniques, a grasp of mathematical and physical concepts underlying MBB and the ability to apply them, and a proficiency with computational tools and skills of bioinformatics. The effort is an adaptation of problem-based learning pioneered by the BioQuest group centered at Beloit College. To accomplish these tasks, we are expanding and improving our department's expertise through faculty development, redesigning our curriculum, and improving the infrastructure of the department. New equipment and software essential for the development of our program is being acquired to keep our program at the cutting edge. We are also expanding our faculty development program in the area of bioinformatics.",
