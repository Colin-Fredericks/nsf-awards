 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nSeptins are a conserved family of cytoskeletal proteins. Proteins of this family are\r\nrequired for cytokinesis in both fungal and animal cells. During cytokinesis, and in post-mitotic cells, septins are often located near regions of active membrane extension. However, the molecular role of\r\nseptins in membrane growth remains obscure.\r\n     The prospore membrane is an intracellular membrane formed during sporulation\r\nin the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which packages the haploid nuclei produced by\r\nmeiosis into spores. Septin behavior during prospore membrane formation resembles that\r\nof septins in higher cells; septins follow the leading edge of the membrane as it grows.\r\nThis project focuses on illuminating the function of septins during formation of the\r\nprospore membrane.\r\n     A combination of cell biological, genetic, and biochemical methods will be used\r\nto investigate this problem. The possible co-localization of septins with the protein\r\nphosphatase, Gip1p/Glc7p, as well as with proteins required for vesicle fusion will be\r\nexamined. Additionally, proteins that can bind to both septins and the Gip1p subunit of\r\nthe phosphatase will be sought.\r\n     These experiments will shed light on the molecular function of septins in\r\npromoting the growth of the prospore membrane and the development of spores.\r\nBecause of the evolutionary conservation of septins, insights gained into the function of\r\nthese proteins in sporulating yeast cells may provide insight into septin function in higher\r\ncells.",
