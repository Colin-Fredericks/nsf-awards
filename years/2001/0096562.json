Representatives from the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB),  private donor foundations, and several networking organizations, will also be attending, as well as additional scientists from throughout Africa.  The co-organizers are Dr. Alan Bornbusch and Mr. John Schoneboom, of the Africa Program at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS); and Dr. Robin Reid, of the Department of People, Livestock and Environment at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Kenya. The goals of the workshop are to strengthen the African network of conservation biologists (possibly through the formation of an SCB-affiliated professional society), explore areas of mutual interest for cross-regional and international collaborative research activities, and identify methods for collecting and disseminating information on conservation biology as efficiently and effectively as possible in Africa. \r\n\r\nConservation biology is the multidisciplinary study of the phenomena that affect the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biological diversity.  It can have a major role in guiding the sustainable development and use of natural resources and ecosystems.  But at the present time there is no Pan-African organization dedicated to conservation biology, and as a result few African scientists know about related research projects being conducted outside their own countries.  Furthermore, many US researchers are unaware of the research activities of their African peers.  Yet Africa has the potential to produce significant discoveries in such areas as conservation, biological diversity, medicine, and agricultural applications.  At the request of the SCB, the Africa Program at AAAS conducted a survey of members of the US and African conservation biology communities, and found strong support for the formation of an African conservation biology society.  The creation of such a professional society would enable African scientists to communicate among themselves, and with their international colleagues in conservation biology and other relevant disciplines.  This workshop is expected to identify specific ways that US and African conservation biologists can work together to enhance their respective capacities and impacts, create important new research and education opportunities, and develop specific strategies to foster long-term collaborations (such as the creation of a US-Africa network for conservation biology).  The African participants will also gain knowledge about promoting and managing scientific societies, while the US participants will gain important information on the needs and assets of their African colleagues.  This workshop is being jointly funded by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Environmental Biology.\r\n",
