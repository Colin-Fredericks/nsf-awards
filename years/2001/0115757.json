Among the vertebrates, it first evolved in fishes which now display an extraordinary diversity of specializations for viviparity.  The evolution of viviparity established new functional relationships, such as maternal-embryonic nutrient transfer.  Specialized tissues, such as the placenta, evolved for transfer.  Live bearing goodeid fishes, are being used as a model system to study nutrient transfer across a placenta and to investigate the development and evolution of the embryonic portion of the placenta.  Goodeid embryos undergo considerable growth (3500X) due to transfer of nutrients across a placenta composed of the lumenal ovarian epithelium and trophotaeniae, external processes emanating from the embryo's vent.  Trophotaeniae are derivatives of the embryonic hindgut.  Previous research established the structure and function of trophotaeniae and lead to the discovery of an evolutionary intermediate, A. toweri, a species of goodeid fishes whose embryos have vestigial trophotaeniae and rely on gut-based nutrition.  Comparative studies produced a robust developmental model for the evolution of trophotaeniae from the hindgut.  Its key feature is the precocious formation of a new posterior gut opening (vent) instead of the typical anus.  This event permits externalization of hindgut tissue.  Once externalized, the hindgut tissue could evolve into trophotaeniae by incremental modifications of a gut-based developmental program.  Research objectives are to: 1) extend the study of the trophotaenial placenta as part of long term studies of the evolutionary physiology of viviparity; and 2) test the model of trophotaenial evolution.  Standard methods of cell-developmental biology and physiology will be used to: 1) analyze vent formation, externalization of hindgut tissue, and the origin of trophotaenial precursors; 2) analyze the development of rudimentary trophotaeniae, an evolutionary intermediate, in the blue-tailed goodeid (A. toweri) and compare the selective advantages of gut and trophotaeniae-based nutrition; 3) analyze growth and morphogenesis of trophotaeniae; and 4) analyze the temporal and structural course of events and the physiological basis for the shedding of trophotaeniae at birth.  These studies will: 1) advance the general understanding of viviparity, a major form of reproduction; 2) provide a basic understanding of the function and development of the trophotaenial placenta; 3) test a developmental model of trophotaenial evolution; 4) establish the selective advantages of gut and trophotaenial-based embryonic nutrition; and 5) enhance knowledge of the reproductive biology of endangered species.\r\n",
