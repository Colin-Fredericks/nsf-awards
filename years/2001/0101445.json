 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kentucky Information Technology Center (KITCATE) is a regional information technology (IT) center. This consortium of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System and Lexington Community College enables two-year colleges to prepare skilled information technology (IT) workers needed by new and existing Kentucky companies. The goals of the Center are to increase the IT enrollment and completion rates of students in two-year colleges; to implement widely an industry driven IT curriculum; to provide professional development for high school and two-year college IT faculty; and to increase the support and participation of business, government and industry in Kentucky for IT education. To reach these goals the number of capable, qualified faculty to teach IT courses must be increased. A physical center provides the education for faculty and staff and for business, government and industry workers. A virtual center provides information on the IT curriculum, offers IT courses, and supports workshops. Mobile centers provide workshops for instructors and for workers in business, government and industry at their locations. The two year-colleges provide articulation for high school students with vendor certificates who enroll in appropriate degree programs. An IT industry advisory board provides guidance and support to the Center.\r\n",
