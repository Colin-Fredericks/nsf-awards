 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCritical path prediction is a processor architecture technique that uses \r\nthe past behavior of instructions in the instruction stream to predict which\r\nfetched instructions will be on the critical path; that is, which \r\ninstructions will have a significant impact on processor performance, and \r\nwhich will not.  This information can then be used to guide the selective \r\napplication of a variety of processor optimizations.\r\n\r\nModern processors remove most artificial constraints on execution\r\nthroughput.  Therefore, the bottleneck for many workloads on current \r\nprocessors is the true dependences in the code.  Chains of dependent \r\ninstructions constrain the overall throughput of the machine, often leaving \r\naggressive processor technology highly underutilized.  These chains of \r\ndependent instructions constitute the critical performance path, or \r\ncritical path (CP), though the code.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the processor is thus determined by the speed at\r\nwhich it executes the instructions along this critical path.  In our\r\nefforts to get the maximum performance from the processor, it is no\r\nlonger reasonable to treat all instructions the same.  If we can know\r\nwhich instructions are critical to performance, we can accelerate\r\ntheir execution, possibly at the expense of instructions not on the\r\ncritical path.\r\n\r\nThis research will attempt to identify these critical instructions\r\ndynamically in hardware.  We call this critical path prediction.  This \r\nprediction is based on the behavior of previous invocations of the \r\ninstruction in the pipeline.  This prediction will enable the processor to \r\nmake better decisions about where to apply certain policies and \r\noptimizations.  A variety of critical path predictors will be examined.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, critical path prediction will enable more effective \r\napplication of other resources or optimizations.  Possible applications of \r\ncritical path prediction include guiding value prediction, instruction \r\nreuse, instruction issue priority, instruction scheduling on a clustered \r\narchitecture, speculation control on a power-constrained processor, \r\narbitration between instructions or threads on a multithreaded \r\narchitecture, or to guide the spawning of speculative threads in a \r\nspeculative multithreaded processor.\r\n\r\n",
