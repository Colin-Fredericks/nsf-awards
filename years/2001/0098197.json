 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nSearch and optimization problems are central to all areas of computer science\r\nand engineering. Finding the optimal layout for a VLSI circuit or  the lowest \r\nenergy configuration of a crystal are both examples of optimization problems.\r\nWhile such problems are believed to be intractable, requiring exponential time \r\nto solve the worst-case instances, many heuristic methods have been observed \r\nto be relatively successful on instances that arise in different applications.\r\nThis project addresses questions concerning the quantitative measures of the \r\nintractability of search and optimization problems, as opposed to qualitative notions\r\nsuch as NP-completeness.  The following are some of the questions addressed in this project:\r\n\r\n1. Which instances of optimization problems are the most intractable ones?\r\n\r\n2. Exactly how difficult are these problems?  \r\n\r\n3. What are good heuristic methods for solving optimization problems ?  \r\nWhen and how well do they work?  \r\n\r\n4. Are specific non-complete problems such as factoring also intractable?   \r\n\r\n5. How much does randomness help in solving problems? \r\n\r\n6. Are hard problems suitable for cryptographic applications?\r\nIf so, what levels of security do they provide these applications? \r\n\r\nUnconditional answers to these questions first require solving the P=NP problem. \r\nHowever, this project will use two approaches to find the most likely answers to \r\nthese questions.  The first approach is to provide proofs resolving these issues under\r\nplausible complexity assumptions.  The second approach is to examine restricted but \r\npowerful classes of algorithms that include the most successful heuristics for the problems\r\nunder study. This approach will include attempts to  both explain the success of \r\nsuch heuristics and to show limitations that can be used as a guide for the likely inherent\r\ncomplexity of the problems.",
