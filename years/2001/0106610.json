 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a meeting on basic and applied aspects of fish bioacoustics to be held in mid-2001 in Chicago.  There are investigators interested in basic issues of fish bioacoustics ( hearing, sound production, etc.), others interested in use of sound to assay fish populations, and still others are interested in the effects of intense sound on fish behavior and the potential use of sound to control fish behavior.   However, there has been very little interaction or collaboration among these investigators.  Each of these groups has unique knowledge and approaches to questions, and these investigators and their fields would benefit from interactions.  Thus, the purpose of the proposed meeting is to bring together investigators interested in all basic and applied aspects of fish biocacoustics to present material, share ideas, and most importantly, learn from, and develop an understanding of, the questions and approaches taken by one another.   The conference is designed to foster these interactions and help investigators with widely different research interests get to know one another.  Long-term goals of the conference are to educate those in the field who don't normally interact professionally, and to help establish collaborations among investigators across disciplines and research fields",
