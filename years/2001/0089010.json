 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) \r\n\r\nThe project implements an interactive learning strategy for students of lower level mathematics courses utilizing computer assisted instruction in five institutions of higher education, representing varied students and differing goals. The techniques have been used for several years with classes of elementary algebra students in the setting of a comprehensive university. These techniques encourage a mastery approach to education requiring the active participation of each student. Students practice problems with the help of tutorial assistance from both the computer and the instructor. The project is expected to improve the learning of lower level mathematics and in turn increase the success rates in these and subsequent courses dependent on mathematics. The immediate objective of this project is to modify the interactive modular teaching materials for a variety of settings and to validate the pedagogical advantages of this approach to the teaching of college algebra, pre-college algebra and finite mathematics. The more comprehensive goal is to use the results of this project to prepare for the national dissemination of these materials and thus contribute to raising the standard of mathematics literacy and problem solving nationwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
