 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-day workshop entitled \"Narrative that heals\" will be held at the 4th International Congress of Arctic Social Sciences on 16-20 May 2001 in Quebec City, Canada.  This workshop will convene 25 scholars, storytellers and practitioners, more than half of them native peoples, from the U.S., Canada and Greenland. The workshop will enable increased knowledge and understanding of how storytelling, oral history and other forms of narrative can promote well-being and help heal psychological and social wounds that afflict many northern peoples at the individual, family, community and group levels.  Workshop goals include greater understanding of the social and psychological dimensions that can contribute to more effective applications of healing through narrative, and explorations of new applications and future research needs. Workshop participants will address the healing power of narrative through discussions and demonstration.  By combining scholarly and experiential elements, the workshop will heighten understanding and awareness and increase opportunities for interaction, new learning and mutual respect.  At the conclusion of formal presentations, three discussants representing the perspectives of native people, practitioners, scholars and policy makers will summarize, respond to and comment on the presentations.  There will be opportunities also for session participants and audience members to participate in these discussions.  Results of the workshop will be disseminated via audiotapes that will be made available to institutions and individuals, and session abstracts will be placed on the International Arctic Social Sciences Association  website.  All or part of the proceedings will be published, probably grouped in a special issue of an appropriate journal.",
