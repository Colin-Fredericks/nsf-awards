 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Vincent Cobb, Dr. Craig Clifford, Dr. Donna Smith and Monica Macklin at Northeastern State University in Oklahoma to develop problem-based laboratory experiences in their Biology curriculum.  In addition, this grant will promote student and faculty research.  To support these objectives, eleven environmental chambers will be purchased which will allow students and faculty to investigate the effects of temperature and light on plants and animals.  Biology majors will get instruction in experimental design and data analysis early in their university training.  This will begin at the introductory level in General Botany Laboratory.  The experimental process will be further integrated into the curriculum at the upper level.  Students in upper level courses such as Plant Physiology, Animal Physiology, and Entomology will participate in more advanced investigation-centered laboratories that examine the effects of temperature and light on plants and animals.  Once students have gained familiarity with these instruments in classes, they will be more likely to participate in independent research with a faculty mentor.\r\n\r\n \tAlthough environmental chambers are simple instruments, they control two of the most important environmental variables for many living organisms, temperature and light.  At the introductory level, General Botany students will work in small groups to develop experiments.  Four of the purchased chambers will be Arabidopsis Growth Chambers.  Arabidopsis is considered the gold standard for plant research.  Many genetic variants are available of this small mustard-like plant making it an excellent model for student experimentation.  In the upper level courses, laboratories will use environmental chambers to control environmental conditions, thus allowing the students to design and execute their own experiments.  Possibilities include sorting genetic mutations in plants using cell signaling pathways for growth hormones or determining the effect of different nutritional diets on insect growth and reproduction.  Independent student and faculty research will involve examining the effect of temperature on ectothermic animals, such as reptiles.  Among the factors to be examined will be embryonic developmental rate, morphological abnormality frequency, locomotor ability, and physiological performance.\r\n\r\nStudents in the sciences need numerous hands-on experiences to grasp the true nature of science and experimentation.  With this grant, NSU will strengthen its students' curriculum by making class laboratories more experimental and will also promote student and faculty research.  Experience in designing and carrying out experiments involving the manipulation of temperature and light as variables will give students a better understanding of the scientific process and help them to develop the confidence to pursue careers in science.\r\n",
