 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences: Shock Waves and Geometry\r\n\r\n0102493\r\nTemple\r\n\r\nThis project is focused on the interplay between \r\nprinciples of geometry and the principles of the \r\nmathematical theory of shock waves.  There are three main \r\nareas of research.  The first is analysis of regularity \r\nand shock formation in initial value problems for weak \r\nsolutions of the Einstein equations.  The second area is \r\ndevelopment of shock-matching methods with application to \r\nblast waves in general relativity.  The third area is \r\ninvestigation of oscillations in systems of conservation \r\nlaws, with particular emphasis on analyzing oscillations \r\nthat are generated in transonic flow.  As part of the \r\nproject, we combine Glimm's theory of wave interactions \r\nwith the theory of general relativity to analyze shock \r\nwave interactions for Einstein's equations.  Since the \r\nEinstein equations contain the compressible Euler \r\nequations as a subsystem, results on shock wave \r\npropagation in general relativity are expected to have \r\nnew implications for analysis of shock waves in classical \r\nfluids.\r\n\r\nWe are developing a theory of shock wave propagation in \r\nEinstein's theory of general relativity. A shock wave is \r\nbest known as the blast wave that marks the leading edge \r\nof an explosion.  In that case, the shock wave is the \r\nsurface between the rapidly expanding material and the \r\nambient, undisturbed air into which the shock front \r\npropagates. In general relativity, shock waves are waves \r\nin the curvature of spacetime itself. There are thus new \r\nand interesting fundamental issues involved in extending \r\nEinstein's equations to a setting that admits shock wave \r\npropagation.  As part of the project, we are constructing \r\nnew exact solutions of Einstein's equations that \r\nincorporate a blast wave into the Big Bang -- the \r\nexplosion that first set the universe into expansion.  \r\nThe mathematical results will also have application to \r\nshock waves in ordinary fluids.\r\n",
