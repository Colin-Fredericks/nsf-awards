 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viscous conservation laws arise in a wide variety of physical \r\napplications, including fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics,\r\nand materials science.  Of particular importance are solutions\r\nof such equations that are stable and hence typically \r\ncorrespond with observable phenomena.  Unfortunately, establishing\r\nthe stability of these solutions has proven to be a quite\r\ndifficult problem.  The pointwise Green's function approach,\r\nhowever, initiated by Liu and developed by Liu and his \r\ncollaborators, has proven quite robust: in applications to \r\nviscous shock waves arising in single conservation laws of\r\narbitrary order, viscous shock waves arising in systems \r\nwith second order diffusion, planar viscous shock waves, \r\ndegenerate viscous shock waves, and rarefaction waves.  \r\nWe propose to continue and extend this promising line of\r\nresearch in three directions.  First, new techniques \r\nrecently developed by Howard and Zumbrun appear suitable\r\nfor extension to (i) systems of viscous conservation \r\nlaws admitting degenerate viscous shock waves, and (ii)\r\nsystems of viscous conservation laws with high order\r\nviscosity.  Second, we propose to develop further \r\ntechniques that will extend the pointwise Green's \r\nfunction approach to the case of viscous rarefaction \r\nwaves.  Finally, we would like to incorporate new techniques\r\nrecently developed in the context of perturbation theory\r\nfor completely integrable systems into the study of \r\nthe necessarily oscillatory dynamics that arise in \r\nviscous conservation laws of order higher than two.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conservation of such fundamental properties as energy and\r\nmomentum often leads to partial differential equations\r\nthat model some underlying physical process.  For example,\r\nthe Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and \r\nthe Maxwell equations of electromagnetism follow this \r\nparadigm.  Of primary concern are stable phenomena: those\r\nwhose principal structure is robust to minor environmental\r\nfluctuations.  We propose to continue and extend a \r\npromising line of research that has been extraordinarily \r\nsuccessful in establishing a clear criterion for such\r\nstability.  A direct consequence of the approach is a \r\ndetailed understanding of certain fundamental partial\r\ndifferential equations.\r\n",
