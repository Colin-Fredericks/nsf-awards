 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be done in connection with metric properties of harmonic measures on infinitely connected domains, in connection with polynomial inequalities and orthogonal polynomials. The estimates for harmonic measures/Green functions\r\nwill be given via a local integral involving a density function associated with\r\nthe boundary of the domain.  Such results directly lead to estimates for polynomials in the complex plane and to extensions of some classical \r\npolynomial inequalities for general compact sets. The results, in particular, will allow  to find the order of the Markoff factors for Cantor-type sets, which in turn\r\nwill produce compact sets of zero measure for which the Markoff factors are of the minimal growth order O(n^2). Weighted polynomial inequalities\r\nwith respect to general (say doubling) weights will also be studied together with applications in connection with approximation theory and orthogonal polynomials.\r\nAnother part of the research is polynomial approximation and orthogonal\r\npolynomials with varying weights (the weight varies with the degree), which\r\nwill be studied with the help of logarithmic potentials in the\r\npresence of an external field. The approximation problem is fundamental\r\nin proving appropriate asymptotics for Christoffel functions\r\nand orthogonal polynomials with varying weights, that in\r\nturn can be used to test the universality hypothesis in statistical-\r\nmechanical models of quantum physics. The proposed research uses different tools from classical analysis, but the main method is potential thoretic.\r\n\r\nResearch will be done in mathematical analysis. The main effort will be to find new ways to estimate some classical quantities and to  extend some well known results to more general situations. These will allow wider applicability\r\nof several classical tools and will provide some new insights into the theoretical aspects of some fundamental questions in approximation theory\r\nand orthogonal polynomials.\r\n\r\n",
