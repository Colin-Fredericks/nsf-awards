 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hoffman will investigate the properties of endomorphisms which are\r\nisomorphic to one sided Bernoulli shifts.  One direction this work\r\nwill take is to show that particular dynamical systems are isomorphic\r\nto one sided Bernoulli shifts. In particular Hoffman will attempt to\r\nclassify which toral endomorphisms are isomorphic to a one sided\r\nBernoulli shift.  He will also attempt to classify all toral\r\nendomorphisms up to isomorphism.  Hoffman will try to show the\r\ndifferences between Ornstein's theory of Bernoulli automorphisms and\r\nthe emerging theory of Bernoulli endomorphisms.  A particular example\r\nof this relates to compact extensions of Bernoulli endomorphisms.\r\nRudolph proved that any compact extension of a Bernoulli shift that is\r\nweak mixing is isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift.  Hoffman will try to\r\nshow that Bernoulli endomorphisms do not share this property.  Hoffman\r\nwill also continue his work in probability theory.  He will continue\r\nto study infinite percolation cluster on the square lattice.  In\r\nparticular he will compare the properties of simple random walk on the\r\nsquare lattice with the properties of simple random walk on infinite\r\npercolation clusters.  The overall goal of this portion of the\r\nresearch is to determine if the distribution of paths for simple\r\nrandom walk on the infinite percolation cluster can be rescaled in\r\nsuch a way as to generate the distribution of Brownian paths in the\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nThe study of randomness is a major part of the application of\r\nmathematics to many interesting systems.  For example, in statistics\r\nknowledge of randomness is used to make sense of data and in applied\r\nmath random processes are used to model financial markets dynamical\r\nsystems.  This proposal deals with randomness in the context of\r\ndynamical systems and probability theory.  This proposal will attempt\r\nto classify various types of mathematical systems according to the\r\ntype and amount of randomness that they exhibit.\r\n\r\n",
