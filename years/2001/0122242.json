 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - 0122242\t\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to Dr. David Hartnett at Kansas State University to construct a duplex-unit housing facility at the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) in Kansas to expand housing accommodations for visiting research scientists and students.  KPBS is a 8,600 acre tallgrass prairie preserve and research station managed by Kansas State University for basic biological research, long-term ecological research on grassland ecosystems, science education, and conservation.  The station has become recognized internationally as the premier grasslands research station in the United States and has attracted scores of researchers and students from institutions throughout the U.S. and several foreign countries.  The construction of this additional  facility will meet the increasing needs for accommodating visiting scientists and will enhance the research capacity and support facilities at the station.\r\n\r\n\tA 1,750 square-foot duplex housing unit will be constructed at the KPBS near Manhattan, Kansas.  Each of two self-contained living units will contain two multiple-occupancy bedrooms, living area, and completely equipped kitchen, laundry, and bath facilities.  The building will be constructed at the station headquarters site adjacent to the KPBS research laboratories, library and other facilities.  The addition of this housing facility will double the lodging capacity at KPBS and will complement current dormitory-style accommodations by providing private, self-contained housing units suitable for longer-term residency by visiting scientists.\r\n\r\n\tKPBS is a center for important research on global climate change, conservation of biodiversity, rangeland management, agriculture, and water quality.  The station is conducting research on important global environmental issues in grassland ecosystems including exotic species invasions, the role of grasslands in global carbon cycling and sequestration, and loss of grassland due to regional expansion of woody vegetation.   New approaches in remote sensing and other technologies are also being developed to address these important research questions.   In addition, KPBS serves as a regional center for K-12, university, and adult community education programs in ecology focused on both regional and global problems.  Expansion of on-site housing accommodations at KPBS will aid in attracting leading scientists to help address these issues. This expansion of station facilities and support infrastructure at KPBS will significantly enhance these important on-going and new research programs and on-site undergraduate and graduate training and public education programs.  \r\n",
