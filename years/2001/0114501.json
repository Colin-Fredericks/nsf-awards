 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to characterize the entire range of\r\nArabidopsis proteins that are regulated by interaction with 14-3-3 proteins; to identify\r\ncomponents from metabolic and signal transduction pathways that utilize 14-3-3 regulators,\r\nand to address fundamental aspects of 14-3-3 function in plants. 14-3-3s have emerged as\r\ncritical regulators of important and diverse cellular processes that extend to every\r\ntissue and organ. Indeed, 14-3-3s appear to be intrinsically necessary for regulatory\r\nevents that are absolutely crucial to normal growth and development in many species, and\r\nespecially in plants. Initial searches of the Arabidopsis genome predict that 14-3-3s\r\ninteract with fully 10 to 20 percent of the Arabidopsis gene products.\r\nThe most recognized of 14-3-3 activities involve protein kinases, phosphorylation\r\nevents and signal transduction pathways involved in growth and development, with one\r\nunderlying theme being that 14-3-3s bind to specific phosphorylated client proteins in\r\norder to influence the regulation of the target activity. The goals of the present\r\nproject are to identify in the Arabidopsis genome client proteins that possess 14-3-3\r\ndocking sites and to assay the interaction strength of the potential docking site against\r\nthe family of 14-3-3 proteins in order to provide a tested, predictive algorithm for\r\ndetermining of the spectrum of 14-3-3 interactions that should be expected for each client\r\nprotein. These data, combined with emerging data from 14-3-3 knockouts and 14-3-3 isoform\r\nexpression patterns, should provide key insights into the potential regulatory functions\r\nof the 14-3-3 signal mediating molecules, and a central, fully characterized database for\r\npredicting 14-3-3 mediated signaling in diverse pathways.\r\nBy highlighting potential regulatory sites across diverse gene families and metabolic\r\npathways, this project will provide an integrating effect on the many projects identifying\r\nspecific functional aspects of Arabidopsis gene families. As genes are functionally\r\ncharacterized, the 14-3-3 client database will provide immediate predictions of\r\nphosphorylation and 14-3-3 dependent regulation that will accelerate the understanding of\r\nthe regulation of many gene families and metabolic and signaling pathways.",
