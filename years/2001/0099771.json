 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to produce a novel class of aluminum matrix nanocomposites with superior structural and corrosion-resistance properties that can be manufactured rapidly and uniformly. The nanocomposites are formed by first producing aluminum and mullite nanoparticles using high-energy ball milling (mechanical attrition).  The nanocrystalline powders are then processed to near net-shape composites using Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). Further, the incorporation of design innovations to improve the speed and uniformity with which these nanocomposites are formed are being investigated.  Specific tasks include the development and evaluation of a fluidized bed process for the continuous milling of nanocrystalline materials.  Oxidative milling will be incorporated in the fluidized bed process in order to form intimate mixtures of nanocrystalline aluminum and ceramic, that can then be further processed via HIP.\r\n \r\nCharacterization of the interfacial, mechanical, and corrosion properties of nanocrystalline mullite-reinforced nanocrystalline aluminum matrix composites will be conducted. Mechanical properties are to be characterized using nanoindentation and traditional tensile testing.  Corrosion studies will be carried out to determine the effects of nanocrystallinity on chemical resistance. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduates involved in the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LAMP). It is expected that LAMP students from Dillard, Southern and Xavier will participate and be encouraged to pursue advanced degrees.",
