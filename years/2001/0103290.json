 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an interdisciplinary Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) that will investigate the quantum properties of nanometer-sized single-molecule magnets (SMMs).  The miniaturization of magnetic devices to this size using conventional fabrication techniques is a major scientific challenge.  For this reason, there is a growing interest in a bottom-up or molecule-based approach whereby magnetic nanostructures are synthesized chemically using solution methods at room temperature.  These materials enable fundamental studies of the properties intrinsic to magnetic nanostructures that have previously been inaccessible.  For instance, nanoscale magnets (including SMMs) are susceptible to quantum tunneling of their magnetic moment (QTM), which could seriously impair their usefulness in magnetic recording but, at the same time, could provide a medium for quantum computation.  This collaboration will address some of the important open fundamental questions in nanomagnetism and QTM via a concerted program in SMM synthesis and advanced characterization.  Magnetic interactions within SMM crystals will be varied chemically through modification to the molecule site symmetry, intramolecular exchange interactions, interactions between nuclear and electronic spins, and intermolecular dipolar interactions.  Parallel to these synthetic efforts, SMMs will be characterized using quantum level specific Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopies and high sensitivity micro-Hall effect magnetometry.  This program will provide the highest quality interdisciplinary research training to a diverse group of graduate students and post-doctoral scientists, which will include training in new chemical synthesis methods and advanced magnetic measurement techniques. \r\n%%%\r\nThis project is an interdisciplinary Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) that will investigate the quantum properties of nanometer-sized single-molecule magnets (SMMs).  The miniaturization of magnetic devices to this size is critical to advances in magnetic information storage, which is an important industry in the United States. Conventional techniques used to fabricate magnetic nanostructures have seriously limitations.  For this reason, there is a growing interest in a bottom-up or molecule-based approach whereby magnetic nanostructures are synthesized chemically.  These materials enable fundamental studies of the properties intrinsic to magnetic nanostructures that have previously been inaccessible.  For instance, nanoscale magnets (including SMMs) are susceptible to quantum tunneling of their magnetic moment (QTM), which could seriously impair their usefulness in magnetic information storage, but, at the same time, could provide a medium for a new and potentially much faster type of information processing known as quantum computing.  This collaboration will address some of the important open fundamental questions in nanomagnetism and explore new avenues for the implementation of SMMs in future devices.  This will be accomplished via a concerted program in SMM synthesis and advanced characterization.  This program will provide the highest quality interdisciplinary research training to a diverse group of undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral scientists.  Students will be trained in cutting edge chemical synthesis and magnetic measurement techniques.  Their training will also include interactions with leading industrial researchers in the magnetic recording industry.\r\n\r\n",
