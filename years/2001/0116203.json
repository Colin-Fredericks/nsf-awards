 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Lee at Washington State University to set up a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) facility for life science research. Stable isotopes occur naturally in all organisms. Virtually all biological activities involve compounds containing these isotopes.  Measurements of stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur provide a powerful means of establishing the sources of these elements  and the processes involved in their deposition. Therefore stable isotope data provide a fingerprint revealing the history of an organism and the metabolic processes occurring within. Researchers at WSU will apply stable isotope data to investigate questions in diverse disciplines including: wildlife and population ecology, physiology, plant molecular biology, agricultural science, and human nutrition.\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting technology for biologists because information can be gained from wild populations without having to subject them to experimental manipulation. Minute samples can be analyzed, and can consist of leaves, feathers, blood, or a single hair. In addition, experimental investigations can be conducted using compounds labeled with stable isotopes, providing a non-radioactive method that can safely be used in humans and other organisms. C. Robbins and L. Shipley will use stable isotopes to investigate diets of wildlife that are difficult to observe in nature or have been extinct for thousands of years (e.g., grizzly bears and cave bears). Physiological investigations will be conducted by R. Lee, G. Edwards, K. Johnson, and M. Kahn to determine metabolic adaptations in unusual deep-sea vent organisms, mechanisms of photosynthesis in plants, the contribution of microorganisms to digestion in cows and sheep, and factors that promote nitrogen fixation by crop plants. M. Webster will use this technology as a novel means of tracking bird migrations. M. McGuire will use stable isotopes to determine the benefits of breastfeeding vs. formula-feeding in human infants by studying the metabolism of fatty acids found in breastmilk. \r\n\r\nWhile stable isotopes are finding increased use in life sciences, very few facilities are run by biologists. Consequently sample analyses are expensive and receive low priority. New studies are difficult to initiate. This newly funded facility will enhance existing research projects by enabling analyses to be performed quickly and at low cost. Acquisition of instrumentation at WSU will also allow principal investigator, postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate training in stable isotope methods. Expansion of use is likely, due to the large number of life science disciplines present at WSU. These disciplines are represented by academic divisions in biological sciences and molecular biosciences, as well as agriculture, veterinary medicine, natural resource science, and pharmaceutical science.  The presence of a facility geared towards biological studies will likely stimulate new and innovative applications of stable isotope techniques. \r\n",
