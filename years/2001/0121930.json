 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the study of skilled performance, it is fairly well accepted that the cerebellum provides a timing process that is involved in the production of motor skills. This project looks at whether different types of timing tasks use the same cerebellar-timing system. It is expected that discrete tasks with a clear beginning and end (such as tapping) use a cerebellar timing system, because such tasks involve an explicit timing process. Other tasks, however, are not expected to use an explicit timing process. One example is continuous circle drawing. In these cases, continuous timing processes may not depend upon a normal functioning cerebellum. Individuals who have brain damage to one side of the cerebellum will be tested. These patients exhibit a normal, unimpaired hand which is controlled by the normal side cerebellum, and a movement-damaged hand controlled by the damaged side of the cerebellum. By comparing performance of the impaired and unimpaired hand for continuous and discrete tapping and circle drawing, it can be ascertained whether the cerebellum is important for such performance. For smooth continuous tasks such as circle drawing, it is expected that the cerebellum is not crucial for timing performance. However, discrete tasks should require an intact cerebellum.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide important new insight into cerebellar functioning and motor skills.\r\n",
