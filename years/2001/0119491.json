This enhancement of PANGA is aimed at gathering basic data to answer opportune scientific questions. It also provides a demonstration of the ability of the Plate Boundary Observatory community to master the technical challenges of a post-earthquake response in a collaborative manner.\r\nThe continuous GPS observations will further our understanding of these scientific issues:\r\n1. Is the series of slab deformation events recorded in 1939,1946 and 1949 a typical sequence, and will we observe a similar sequence in the 1999 Grays Harbor, 2001 Nisqually, and some near term future event(s)?\r\n2. How is deformation propagated from a down going slab through a viscoelastic lower lithosphere, to surface deformation? What are the rheologies that govern this complex scenario and how is deformation propagated or dissipated? \r\n3. How do these processes reveal the budget of seismic vs. aseismic slip? \r\n4. Is there a causal relationship between intra-slab earthquakes and deformation in the brittle upper crust?\r\n5. How does the concentration of deformation across the Puget Lowlands, where fore-arc migration ends in a zone of concentrated strain, relate to arching of the down-going slab and its consequent deformation?\r\n6. Is there an observable role between deeper, slab events with their broad deformation field, and teconomagmatic deformation?\r\nPage A\r\n011 9491\r\n\r\n",
