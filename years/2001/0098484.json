Modeling the formation of these bodies, however, is challenging because (i) the initial conditions which existed prior to impact are not well constrained, (ii) the physical characteristics of these binaries today represent the subsequent results of modification by multiple collisional, dynamical, and geochemical processes, and (iii) the necessary simulations push our theoretical understanding and computational resources to the limit.  It is possible, however, that similar processes on a smaller scale may provide valuable insights into how the Moon and Pluto originated.  For this reason it is advantageous to examine the formation of satellites of main-belt asteroids, four of which have now been detected.  Studies of the  formation mechanism of asteroid satellites may also yield constraints on the internal structure of asteroids and Kuiper Belt objects that are clues to their origin.  Dr. Daniel Durda, at the Southwest Research Institute, will lead a theoretical investigation of modeling and simulation of various impact phases between colliding asteroids.  Results will be used to estimate binary formation efficiency as a function of collision parameters and to measure the relative importance of each mechanism in forming satellites.  Satellite systems formed by the models will be compared to observed asteroid satellites.  \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
