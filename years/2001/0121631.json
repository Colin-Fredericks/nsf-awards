 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our primary research goal is to develop a prototype voice-enabled\r\ntranslating communicator which will deliver information services across\r\nthe linguistic divide for minority languages in order allow remote\r\nlinguistically-diverse users to communicate directly with Internet\r\ncontent and databases, and more importantly to communicate with others\r\nspeaking a different language from their own. The latter will enable\r\ninformation, education, and, for example, health services, to reach\r\nremote minority-language communities. Achieving this goal requires\r\nmajor advances in machine learning for translation and in cross-language\r\nspeech-recognition adaptability to wider language phenomena.\r\n\r\nTraditional transfer-rule-based MT requires up to a person-century\r\nto build and perfect a new language pair. Statistical and\r\nExample-Based MT replaces human coding effort by vast amounts of\r\nbilingual training data, which are virtually unobtainable for most\r\nminority languages. Without a radical advance, leading to an\r\nover-an-order-of-magnitude improvement in development time, the\r\nonly commercially justifiable MT applications involve the major\r\nEuropean languages, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic and perhaps a\r\ncouple more relatively-popular languages.  The vast majority of human\r\nlanguages are currently relegated to the proverbial MT dust heap.\r\n\r\nWe propose new MT approaches based on extended and new machine\r\nlearning methods. The first approach consists of statistical MT\r\nmethods that learn from orders of magnitude less training data,\r\nand that can more effectively incorporate prior linguistic information\r\n(including dictionaries, word classes, and known linguistic\r\nrule classes or constraints) by using the joint source-channel\r\nmodeling approach combined with exponential (maximum entropy) models.\r\nThe second approach is a new method for acquiring high-quality MT\r\ntransfer rules from native informants which decreases dependence on\r\nhuman experts and reduces development time. Semantically-conditioned\r\ntransfer rules are generalized via a new locally-constrained\r\nSeeded Version-Space method based on a controlled bilingual corpus\r\nand interactive tools to elicit information from native informants.\r\nThe third method builds general phone models across multiple language\r\nfamilies for speech recognition and adapts the recognizer to new\r\nlanguages with minimal new- language training data. All of these\r\nmethods are based on new and existing machine learning algorithms\r\nthat combine prior knowledge with limited amounts of new data in\r\norder to converge quickly on working machine translation and speech\r\nrecognition and synthesis systems.\r\n\r\nThe primary societal impact will be a significant contribution\r\nto the global democratization of informa- tion, a process that\r\nrequires bridging current linguistic barriers, especially for\r\nlow-density or economically- disadvantaged languages. Additionally,\r\npreservation and teaching of endangered languages will be directly\r\nenabled by the new linguistic and acoustic knowledge coupled with\r\nexisting tutorial software. If successful, Avenue (Adaptable Voice-Enabled\r\nNatural-translator for Universal Empowerment) will be the prototype\r\nof an MT system that will empower world-wide access to multilingual\r\ninformation.",
