 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuroscience is the study of the brain and behavior.  It is a rapidly advancing and growing field, which in the 21st century will be poised to address some of the most important and fundamental questions in the biomedical sciences.  With these advances comes the hope for the treatment of a vast array of neurological problems.  This award will be used to establish a ten-week summer training program that is designed to provide undergraduates with an opportunity to gain in-depth training in neuroscience through participation in research.  Students will learn the questions addressed by current neuroscience research, experimental design and techniques, research ethics, the presentation of scientific data, and career options in the biomedical sciences.  During the program, the students will gradually develop as independent researchers.  The program will be administered by 11 neuroscience professors whose expertise ranges from molecular to behavioral neuroscience.  A diverse array of students will be encouraged to apply and 10 promising students will be accepted into the program each year.  Students will immediately begin to work under the direct supervision of their faculty mentor on a research project that will enable the student to gain  practical experience in neuroscience. This will be supplemented by classroom instruction where faculty will present their area of expertise.  This laboratory and classroom instruction will be rounded out by weekly Friday seminars given by neuroscientists from local universities, colleges and industries.  These seminars will cover a variety of research topics and illustrate different career paths in neuroscience.  In addition, there will be a one-day workshop on ethics in neuroscience to educate students about basic ethical concepts, to familiarize them with professional standards of ethical conduct and to introduce them to controversies in research ethics and the role of science in society.  Students will interact with graduate students in the lab and at arranged luncheons to discuss preparation for and the selection of graduate schools.  At the midpoint of the summer, students will attend a neuroscience picnic where they will interact informally with local area neuroscientists.  The end of the summer program will be celebrated by a poster session at which students will present the results of their research project.  Students will also present their results the following spring at a regional meeting, the North East Undergraduate Research Organization for Neuroscience (NEURON, http://www.albany.edu/neuron).  Students will receive regular feedback from their faculty mentors regarding their progress.  In addition, student and faculty participants will be asked to review the program at the midpoint and end of the summer, and the following spring so that changes in the program can be made as necessary.  This program will provide a rich experience, not found in the normal undergraduate curriculum, for the aspiring neuroscience.  It should provide a springboard for those interested in pursuing a career in biomedical research.  Interested individuals can learn more about the program through the web site:  http://www.albany.edu/neuron/summer   \r\n\r\n",
