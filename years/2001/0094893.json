 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college is a public, Hispanic -serving, two year associate degree granting college charged with advancing the state's economic development by educating a skilled workforce. This project is creating a National Science Foundation Scholarship (NSF) program for five computer related technologies. Students receive, upon completion of study, an associate of applied science degree in one of five areas: Computer Science Technology, Computerized Drafting and Design Technology, Computerized Digital Imaging Technology, Computerized Network Information Management Technology, and Computer Maintenance Technology. Scholarship recipients are being selected on the basis of a submitted application, interviews, a written statement on choosing a computer related field, and assessment of career goals. The scholarship awards are being integrated into the overall recruitment and retention efforts of the College which includes specific initiatives for outreach and recruitment to Hispanic families. Intensive retention strategies such as assessment methods using the Noel- Levitz Retention Management System, intrusive academic advising, a structured first year student success course, supplemental instruction, tutoring and mentoring, and the establishment of learning assistance centers provide scholarship students with a strong retention infrastructure for student success as measured by persistence until graduation.",
