Additional NIST laboratories have added such programs, and its youngest lab, Information Technology (ITL), is now doing so. NIST, the second oldest federal scientific organization, is a major  working scientific organization, with many stimulating projects for undergraduate  participation.  Scientists with such projects are given time and resources by NIST to supervise the student research.  NSF funds for stipend, travel, and housing expenses go to students via their academic institutions, which have submitted names of interested students and individual application materials provided by the students.  NIST obtains quality summer housing at a level covered by the funds granted, provides the project resources, and has an office to administer the program, including recruiting through universities.  There is a particular stress on outreach to obtain a group as diverse as it is talented.  In addition to the individual projects, NIST provides a series of special seminars, many run by students who select and invite the speakers.  SURF and post-SURF seminars by students on their projects are also expected, and papers or other participation at scientific conferences is encouraged.  NIST and its individual labs also conduct ongoing reporting and evaluation to assure and increase SURF program quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
