 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposer intends to continue his study of geometric questions \r\nin the theory of meromorphic functions, using the new techniques \r\ndeveloped in his previous work. The main directions of the \r\nproposed research are the following.\r\na) Questions related to Bloch's theorem and the Type Problem of\r\na simply connected Riemann surface, especially the relations\r\nbetween the conformal type of a surface and its integral curvature.\r\nb) Problems of geometric function theory arising in real algebraic\r\ngeometry. More specifically, it includes counting real solutions\r\nof certain systems of algebraic equations of geometric origin, which\r\nhave important applications in linear control theory. \r\nc) Generalization of results of geometric function theory to\r\nquasiregular maps in spaces of arbitrary dimension.\r\nd) Normality criteria for families of holomorphic curves in projective\r\nspaces.\r\n\r\nOne of the basic questions in mathematics and its applications is\r\nwhether a given equation or a system of equations has solutions,\r\nhow many, and where are they located. In the theory of meromorphic functions\r\none studies these questions for equations of the type\r\nf(z)=a, where a is a given complex number and f a given meromorphic function.\r\nThe class of meromorphic functions includes elementary functions,\r\nsuch as rational, exponential and trigonometric ones, as well as the special\r\nfunctions, a. k. a. higher transcendental functions, such as the\r\nGamma function, Airy functions, elliptic functions and so on.\r\nMost functions arising in applications of mathematics belong to\r\nthis class. In modern mathematics, questions about solvability\r\nof equations are usually formulated in geometric language, which makes\r\nthe results appealing to our geometric intuition. \r\nThe logic of development of mathematics and its applications\r\nrequire an extension of results to vector-valued functions known\r\nas ``holomorphic curves''. The proposer plans to continue his study\r\nof geometric theory of meromorphic functions and holomorphic curves.\r\nA part of the proposal is related to existence of real solutions, which is\r\nby far more subtle than the existence of complex solutions, which are usually\r\nstudied. This part is inspired by the so-called \"pole placement problem\", which is a major unsolved mathematical\r\nproblem in control theory of linear systems. The results in this area\r\nwill have implications for the design of complicated automatic control systems. \r\nThese results would establish limitations on the possibility to\r\ncontrol a system of given size by a control device of certain class. \r\n\r\n",
