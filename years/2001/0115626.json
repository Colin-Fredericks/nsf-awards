 "awd_abstract_narration": "The carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) plays a major role in the earth's\r\nphotosynthetic productivity and its capacity to cycle carbon.  The CCM is\r\nessential for photosynthesis at atmospheric levels of CO2 in Chlamydomonas\r\nand most other eukaryotic and prokaryotic algae.  Knowledge gained\r\nregarding the CCM in C. reinhardtii through this three-year project,\r\ncoupled with information from other laboratories, should allow a more\r\ncomplete understanding of how algal cells are able to survive and flourish\r\nin their CO2-limited, aqueous environment.  The primary goal of this\r\nresearch project is to elucidate components and mechanisms of regulation of\r\nthe CCM in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  The focus of the project is the\r\ncomplete characterization of the Cia5 gene and its role as a master\r\nregulator of the cell's response to changes in environmental CO2 and HCO3\r\nconcentrations.  Based on the weight of present evidence, it appears the\r\nCia5 gene encodes a transcription factor that is part of one or more signal\r\ntransduction cascades that allow, or reverse, formation of a functional\r\nCCM.  Experiments to fully characterize the Cia5 gene are outlined along\r\nwith studies of the CIA5 protein, its subcellular location,\r\npost-translational modification(s), DNA binding specificities and other\r\nfeatures required for its function in controlling assembly of the CCM.  A\r\nmodel is proposed in which the CIA5 protein could act either as an inducer\r\nor repressor of transcription of genes whose expression is dramatically\r\nincreased during a shift of cells from high to low CO2 levels.  Experiments\r\nare outlined that will resolve the uncertainty of whether CIA5 acts as an\r\ninducer or repressor of gene expression.  In the long term, an increased\r\nunderstanding of the CCM has the potential for practical application in\r\nagriculture.  For example, certain crop plants have been demonstrated to\r\nproduce higher yields under elevated levels of CO2.  If appropriate\r\nportions of the CCM can be transferred to those crops, their resultant\r\nability to increase internal CO2 concentrations could lead to substantially\r\nimproved crop yields.\r\n\r\n",
