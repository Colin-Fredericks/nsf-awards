 "awd_abstract_narration": "Total syntheses of alleopathic (compounds implicated in the chemical interaction of plants) natural products isolated from the sunflower, the heliannuols, and related natural products will be synthesized based on a biomimetic phenol-epoxide cyclization strategy.  Bioassays on synthetic intermediates and target molecules will be carried out to evaluate their activity as potential herbicides.  The teaching component of the plan will result in the development of a new medicinal chemistry course for majors and the introduction of simple research projects into the undergraduate organic chemistry lab course.  The students must design portions of the experiments themselves by performing online literature searches thus giving them a more \"research-like\" experience.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Professor James R. Vyvyan of the Department of Chemistry at Western Washingtion University, a primarily undergraduate institution.  Professor Vyvyan's research is directed towards the synthesis of chemicals isolated from the sunflower and the evaluation of their ability to inhibit the growth of troublesome weed species.  The educational portion of the plan will develop new research-based laboratory experiments for the organic chemistry lab course and emphasize the relevancy of agricultural and medicinal chemistry in lecture courses.",
