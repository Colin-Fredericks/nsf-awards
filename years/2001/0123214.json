 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of Northwest Indian College (NWIC) is to provide post-secondary\r\neducational opportunities for Native Americans that is sensitive to their worldviews,\r\nbackground, and academic needs and goals, and prepare them for the challenges of \r\nleadership in their tribal communities. In addition to providing effective opportunities \r\nfor students to develop academic competence, the NWIC mission is to infuse students \r\nwith clear communication skills, critical thinking skills, and a developed sense of\r\ncivic responsibility. \r\n\r\nThe Northwest Indian College Division of Math and Science is proposing implementation \r\nof a SMET learning community educational plan that begins with entering freshman and\r\nsupports them through to the completion of an AA or AS degree. \r\n\r\nThe first-year goal of this program would be to generate student interest and growth \r\ntoward further education in math and science. Building on this foundation, the overall\r\ngoal would be to have these students then obtain associates and baccalaureate degrees \r\nin science or math-related fields. The first year would be a \"developmental year\" for\r\nstudents whose test scores indicate that this is necessary. (Note: The majority of \r\nstudents entering NWIC would have test scores reflecting this need. It is often\r\nthe lack of a growth or preparation period that contributes to student failure\r\nin math and science.)\r\n\r\nDuring the first year, the plan would be as follows:\r\n* Each eligible student would enter into an integrated academic group or cohort.\r\n* A testing specialist would evaluate math and science competencies for each student.\r\n* All students would be enrolled in the following courses: Public Speaking, Introduction to\r\nComputers, Native American History/Philosophy, and Introduction to Successful Learning\r\nduring fall quarter and throughout their first (or developmental) year. These courses,\r\nwhich are required for graduation from Northwest Indian College, would be fully\r\nintegrated among each other while also being integrated with introductory science and\r\nmath courses in which students are placed according to their initial test scores.\r\nExample: The cohort would be assigned a relevant science topic such as iswater quality.lo\r\nIndividually and as a group, students would research the topic, using math to compute\r\nstatistics, the Internet to find background material and group discussions to enhance\r\nindividual research. Students would give oral and written presentations using the\r\nprinciples discussed in the cohort instruction. (Note: A somewhat different form of this\r\nschedule and approach has been used successfully with our NSF funded Tribal\r\nEnvironmental and Natural Resource Management program (TENRM). The result has\r\nbeen much higher than average retention and completion for students lacking needed\r\nskills.)\r\n\r\nBy combining required courses where NWIC students typically do well (i.e. Speech), with\r\ndevelopmental science and math courses, students will be more likely to successfully\r\ncomplete essential coursework for graduation.\r\n\r\nNorthwest Indian College students have demonstrated they must be immersed in their\r\nculture, history, and philosophy if they are to effectively understand and build upon \r\ntheir role inthe Native communities. The college knows they must also develop the\r\nscience and math skills necessary to help their culture survive and intends to meet\r\nthese needs by offering introductory science and math courses fully integrated with \r\ncurriculum related to Native culture, history, and philosophy. As they build increased \r\nself-esteem while finding success in the classroom, students will recognize their \r\ncapacity to do science and math. They will then feel comfortable pursuing further \r\nscience and math-related courses as they eventually enter baccalaureate programs and\r\nthe SMET workforce.",
