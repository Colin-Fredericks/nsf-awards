The conference themes will emphasize the role of models in ecosystem science research, education and decision making; testing and validating models; mechanisms, resolution and uncertainty in models; and predicting ecosystem dynamics. The topics were chosen to oblige authors to synthesize the literature, rather than present details of one or a few specific models. Recent years have seen dramatic advancements in the computational power and mathematical tools available to modelers. The body of traditional, mechanistic, empirical research is also growing phenomenally. The field is ripe for major gains in the synthetic and predictive power of models, and this comes at a time of growing need by society for quantitative models that can inform debate about critical environmental issues. Quantitative models provide a means to test understanding of ecosystems by allowing the exploration of interactions among observation, synthesis, and prediction. The utility of models for synthesis and prediction is obvious. The role of quantitative models in informing and guiding observation and experimentation is perhaps less often appreciated, but equally valuable. The conference is being hosted by the Institute of Ecosystem Studies and will take place May 1-3, 2001.\r\n\r\n",
