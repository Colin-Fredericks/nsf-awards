 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship program provides an opportunity for current elementary and secondary mathematics, science, and technology classroom teachers with demonstrated excellence in teaching to serve in federal agencies that impact science and mathematics education. All Einstein Fellowship candidates have been recognized for excellence through the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics or Science Teaching or a similar meritorious award. Einstein Fellows bring to Congress and selected federal agencies the insights, extensive knowledge and practical experience of teachers working in science and mathematics classrooms. This project supports one Einstein Fellow assigned to NSF's Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) for an 11-month period. The Fellow serves as a valuable resource by working with DUE Program Officers on programs focusing on effective mathematics and science classroom teaching, preservice teacher preparation, projects that link teacher preservice and inservice activities, and national teacher education issues. \r\n",
