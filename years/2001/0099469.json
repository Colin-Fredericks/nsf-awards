 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of the proposed research is to develop a new approach to the robust decentralized control of large electric power systems, based on the powerful tools of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI). This problem will be addressed in the general framework of interconnected dynamic systems with piecewise continuous nonlinearities. An important advantage of the LMI method lies in its ability to incorporate decentralized information structure constraints on the gain matrices, and to limit their respective norms. It also allows for the inclusion of a variety of additional design requirements, such as the degree of exponential stability and time delays. \r\n\r\nSeveral different applications of LMI - based control will be considered. All of them are computationally straightforward and well defined, with no tuning parameters or any need for trial and error analysis. In the initial stages of the project we will develop decentralized control strategies using the classical generator model, together with a second order model for the turbine/generator.  The work will then be extended to include the design of robust exciter control, in the framework of two-axis generator models. In the final stage of the research, we will explore the application of LMI to parametric stability. In this context, we will consider the elimination of bifurcations by appropriate control designs, as well as the robustness with respect to uncertainties in model parameters. \r\n\r\n",
