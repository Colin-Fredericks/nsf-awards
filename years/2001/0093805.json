 "awd_abstract_narration": "0093805\r\nKaren Burg\r\nResearch and development of engineered tissue has potential widespread medical application, including lumpectomy reconstruction, liver repair, cartilage replacement, or other conditions.  Tissue engineering involves taking a small number of healthy cells from a patient, growing the cells into large numbers in a laboratory environment, combining them with an absorbable (similar to biodegradable) material that has been sculpted into the anatomical shape of the injured part, allowing the cells to develop, implanting the cell-material system into the patient, and then allowing the cells to grow and acquire the original anatomical shape.  The material gradually breaks down, is \"absorbed\" by the body, and is thus removed.\r\n\r\nThe proposed 5-year work is a focus on the basic science of breast tissue engineering for cancer patients who have undergone a mastectomy or lumpectomy.  The effort will be to develop a program in tissue engineering, encompassing the research and development of new injectable materials and training of graduate and undergraduate students.  It also will promote public awareness of bioengineering and critical thinking through the development of a K-12 educational outreach program, a program developed through the combined efforts of the Department of Bioengineering and the Department of Education at Clemson University.  The mission of the proposed research is to present and justify a new materials approach to tissue engineering.  It is hypothesized that by providing a two-phase, composite, injectable material, cell growth and tissue development may be enhanced within a clinically viable solution.  Previous studies by the applicant have demonstrated general efficacy of such systems, but have not encompassed a careful assessment of the components.  A selection of crafted materials of varying proportions will be addressed and the research will be conducted using a comprehensive battery of mechanical and chemical tests to assess the systems.  The success of the basic research concept relies on a well-orchestrated research plan, as well as on education of the involved scientists and future scientists.  The science and technology derived from this work will be transferred to other clinical applications presenting similar requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
