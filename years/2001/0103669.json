 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on Stochastic Optimization and Applications\r\n\r\nHui Wang\r\n\r\nProject Abstract\r\n\r\nMany stochastic optimization problems assume that the decision \r\nmaker has the total freedom to intervene the system. That is, \r\nthe control policies can be adjusted continuously and \r\ninstantaneously, or the state processes can be stopped arbitrarily \r\nwithin some time interval.  However, this assumption is often \r\nviolated in practice. The first part of the project is concerned\r\nwith some new formulations for stochastic optimization problems \r\nin order to accommodate these practical constraints. These models \r\nshare a common feature: random intervention times determined by \r\nexogenous signal processes. In the context of optimal control, \r\nthe decision maker is allowed to adjust the level of control \r\nonly at times when an exogenous process gives him a green light; \r\nfor example, when an Poisson process makes a jump. In the area of \r\noptimal stopping, the state process is allowed to be stopped only \r\nat times when it receives certain signals from an exogenous process.  \r\nBoth formulations admit explicit solutions and can be applied to \r\nmodel practical constraints on control policies or stopping times. \r\nThe second part of the project is concerned with a class of diffusion \r\nprocesses with jumps. The major effort is put on their applications \r\nto economics and finance.  The reason for the introduction of such \r\nprocesses is that the classical diffusion model for stock prices \r\ncannot explain many empirical puzzles. For example, an abnormality \r\ncalled volatility smile is often observed in option pricing, and the \r\nreturn distributions of financial assets exhibit a leptokurtic feature. \r\nWe intend to explain these phenomena, using the jump processes to model \r\nstock prices in a financial market or the values of economic projects \r\nin investment problems. The discontinuous behavior in the underlying \r\nprocesses requires new techniques to obtain explicit solutions to \r\ncertain pricing and wealth optimization problems.  The research project \r\nincludes pricing commonly traded exotic options, analysis of utility\r\nmaximization, and evaluation of investment projects.\r\n\r\nStochastic optimization is one of the main topics in modern applied \r\nmathematics, with many applications in disciplines like engineering, \r\nbiology, economics and finance, etc. The purpose of this research \r\nproject is to systematically develop mathematical theories that are \r\nmore faithful to real life problems, so that the conclusions drawn \r\nfrom them can be used with more confidence. For example, a better \r\nunderstanding for the uncertainty of stock prices can help agents \r\nreduce the risk in financial practice. However, in developing more \r\nrealistic models, one must be aware of the subtle balance between \r\ncomplexity and mathematical tractability. A realistic yet too \r\ncomplicated model can be mathematically untractable. The goal of \r\nthe project, therefore, is to develop analytically or numerically \r\nsolvable models that embrace the essence of the practical problems. \r\nTo this end, some new formulations are considered for general \r\nstochastic optimization problems in order to accommodate some \r\npractical constraints; for example, the controller can intervene \r\nthe system only at times when an exogenous process sends out a \r\ncertain signal.  Also considered are some new models for \r\neconomics and finance that incorporate the drastic changes of \r\nstock prices over short periods of time. These new models can be \r\nused to explain many empirical puzzles that the classical models \r\nfail to do, and to help agents develop better portfolios to reduce risk.\r\n\r\n",
