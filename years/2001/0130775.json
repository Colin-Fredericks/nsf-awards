Previous conferences on the subject of orientation and navigation have not emphasized neural mechanisms, and a greater understanding of such neural mechanisms is now possible using multichannel recording, and newly-developed techniques for recording from freely-moving animals.  Eleven speakers will each present a 30-minute talk on their work followed by 10 minutes of questions.  All speakers will address common problems, models, and mechanisms shared among all investigators, with the goal of developing a unifying framework to understand the neural circuits utilized as animals find their way over both short and long distances.  The objectives of this symposium are as follows: To exchange ideas about state-of-the-art neuronal, computational, and behavioral approaches to the analysis of oriented locomotion; To seek common neural mechanisms of orientation and navigation used by multiple phyla and in diverse sensory contexts; And to set short-term and long-term goals common to those working on the mechanisms of oriented locomotion toward establishing a general theory of the neuronal mechanisms of oriented locomotion.  These general mechanisms will inform technologies now developing in the form of mobile robots.    This symposium will provide an opportunity for a rich cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers studying animal behavior and those studying neurobiology.\r\n",
