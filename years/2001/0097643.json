 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an REU Site in Psychology at Oklahoma State University.  The purpose of the Site is to provide twelve undergraduate research scholars with an intensive eight week summer research experience in experimental psychology.  In this unique experience they will learn all aspects of the research process, including formulating hypotheses, integrating and analyzing scientific literature, study design, data collection, data analysis, and oral and written presentation of findings.  The scholars will work on research teams in the areas such as infant memory, children's social development, adult cognition, and language processing.  It is expected that scholars will be able to conduct their own independent projects by the summer's end.  Contact will be maintained with all scholars to assure they are receiving adequate support to pursue such projects at their home institutions.  A special feature of this program is that the participants will attend several weekly seminars focused on statistics and research methods and attend workshops on how to apply to graduate school, how to write successful resume or vita, and how to study for the GRE.  Additionally, students will be paired with a graduate student mentor to enhance their summer experience.  Further, students will attend weekly brown bag research seminars in which the faculty mentors will present their programs of research.  The goal is to have students who are better consumers and supporters of science throughout their lives, enhancing the appreciation of science in the lives of those around them.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
