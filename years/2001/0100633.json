 "awd_abstract_narration": "In heterogeneous distributed computing, a network of dissimilar machines is used to\r\nexecute a given application in parallel. With the advent of advanced network technologies,\r\nthe scale at which heterogeneous computing can be practicaly applied is growing to a\r\nglobal scale, thus making it possible to collect high performance computers across the\r\nglobe into a single computational resource. Multiple users will be able to simulataneously\r\nuse this computational resource to execute a variety of large, parallel applications.\r\nHowever, there are a number of problems to solve before this type of computing becomes a\r\nreality.\r\nTherefore this project proposes to develop effective matching and scheduling methods to\r\nallow multiple users to execute applications in a large, decentralized, failure-prone,\r\nheterogeneous computing environment. Due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of this\r\nenvironment, the algorithms that will be developed will use statistical techniques to\r\nallocate resources fairly in a highly dynamic system. The algorithms will be evaluated by\r\nsimulations and also on a small testbed. There are three different aspects of this\r\nproposed work:\r\n1. Methods will be developed to statistically obtain an estimate of the response time of a\r\ntask on an arbitrary target machine. This will be accomplished by developing separate\r\ntechniques to estimate the execution time, machine loads, and network loads. A method for\r\nestimating the execution time using data gathered from past executions of the task has\r\nalready been developed. This method will be refined and similar stochastic methods will be\r\ndeveloped for machine and network load estimation.\r\n2. A dynamic matching and scheduling method for heterogeneous machines will be developed.\r\nThis method will allow each application to make scheduling decisions without direct\r\nknowledge of the other applications executing in the environment. Each application will\r\nhave to compete for the computational resources of the network. The scheduling heuristics\r\nwill take into account the uncertainty in the stochastic estimates of the execution time\r\nand machine and network loads.\r\n3. Finally, reliable scheduling algorithms based on either heuristic cost functions or\r\nevaluation of the reliability of applications will be developed. The heuristic cost\r\nfunctions developed will define the impact of a scheduling decision on the reliability of\r\nan application in time units. These algorithms will consider both the execution time and\r\nfailure probability of applications while making scheduling decisions, and thus, will be\r\ncapable of producing task assignments that improve both the performance and reliability of\r\napplications. In addition, algorithms which can trade performance for reliability of\r\napplications will be designed.",
