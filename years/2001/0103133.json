 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Ohio State University by the Chemistry Division is part of the Nanoscale Exploratory Research in the Nanoscale Science and Engineering program.  Under this project, Jonathan Parquette will develop novel enantioselective catalysts based on the active transition metals, such as ruthenium and copper, incorporated in chiral dendrimers. Monodendrons up to three generations will be prepared using aminopyridine dicarboxamide as the branching units, and chiral nonracemic anthranilamide as the terminal units.  Dendrimers with transition metals will be evaluated for enhanced catalytic Diels-Alder and aldol condensation reactions.  In addition, the research program will provide education and training opportunities in material chemistry to graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nUnder the award, novel enantioselective catalysts based on the active transition metals in chiral dendrimers will be studied. Dendrimers, with up to three generations, will be synthesized and their conformationally based chiral changes in different solvents will be evaluated using circular dichroism.  In addition, different metals selectively placed at the periphery of dendrimers will be evaluated for enhanced catalytic activities for the organic synthesis of chiral materials.  The research program will provide education and training opportunities in materials chemistry to graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n",
