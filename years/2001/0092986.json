 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support for multiple quality-of-service (QOS) levels in mobile, distributed, packet radio\r\nnetworks is required for many commercial wireless applications. Mobile radio networks (or ad\r\nhoc networks) are required in situations where the network itself must be highly mobile and\r\nwhere access to a fixed infrastructure of base stations is not available. To meet demands of\r\nportability and low-power operation, it is desirable for a single ad hoc network to service the\r\ntraffic demands of a wide range of applications, including examples such as all-informed\r\nmulticast voice, real-time video, large file transfers, and interactive web browsing. Each class of\r\ntraffic has specific service requirements and these QOS levels must be provided from a mobile\r\nand distributed network that operates with battery power only and with very limited bandwidth.\r\n     The Wireless Communications Program at Clemson University has recognized that\r\nstrong interaction among different protocol layers in ad hoc radio networks is not only desirable\r\nbut in fact essential. A single protocol layer cannot guarantee a specific quality of service for a\r\ntraffic type, but there must be coordination among the routing, queuing, traffic scheduling,\r\ncongestion control, channel-access, and adaptive-transmission protocols. We have already\r\ndemonstrated that information from the physical and link layers can be effectively utilized by the\r\nrouting protocol to dramatically improve the end-to-end network performance and reduce the\r\ntotal energy expended by the mobile radios. The proposed research and education plan is based\r\non our previous results that show that strong coupling among the protocol layers is vital for\r\nwireless communications networks that must interconnect highly mobile users and link them\r\nreliably to a fixed infrastructure. This career plan is structured to extend previous results through\r\ncollaborative research that is focused on the link and network layers, and to explore a new topic\r\narea by applying the advances discovered in our previous work to new research into the\r\ninteraction between the network and transport layers.\r\n     The proposed career plan is centered on both undergraduate and graduate student\r\nparticipation. The topics are organized so that students with a range of experience levels can\r\nmake significant contributions. A key priority of the research plan is to include students with a\r\nvariety of career goals and motivate them to strive for the highest levels of scientific and\r\nengineering excellence throughout their careers. Ample opportunities are planned to encourage\r\nand develop promising undergraduate students to pursue graduate school. An important\r\ncomponent of the educational plan is to incorporate research tools in the classroom. Animation\r\ntools that illustrate the performance of our distributed protocols have increased our\r\nunderstanding our research and they will prove to be equally valuable in the classroom and\r\nlaboratory. Rather than simply reading about networking protocols in a textbook, students will\r\nimplement distributed protocols within a discrete event simulation program and see the\r\nperformance implications of the various protocols.",
