 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop technologies which will enable communication on a single\r\noptical fiber at rates in excess of 100 Tb/s within a few years. To accomplish this in the\r\nlow-loss window of silica fibers (1200-1700 nm), there will be a need for novel very\r\nwideband devices, particularly optical amplifiers. In addition, modulation techniques with\r\nspectral efficiencies well in excess of unity will be needed. Our research activities will be\r\ncentered in these two areas.\r\n     We will investigate modulation techniques, and associated detection schemes,\r\nsuitable to obtain a spectral efficiency of 4 b/s/Hz by the end of the project. The\r\ntechniques will be designed to be resistant to impairments due to PMD and fiber\r\nnonlinearities. In particular, we will investigate novel techniques using appropriate\r\ncombinations of PSK, QAM, and polarization-based techniques. Coherent detection will\r\nbe utilized where indicated to boost spectral efficiency.\r\nWe will investigate fiber optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) and discrete\r\nRaman amplifiers made from novel highly-nonlinear fibers. These fibers will have\r\nnonlinearity coefficients exceeding those of today's most nonlinear fibers by several\r\norders of magnitude. These fibers will enable the development of novel nonlinear\r\namplifiers , with gain bandwidth of a single device covering most of the 1200-1700 nm\r\nwindow. These devices will also use shorter fibers and lower pump powers than their\r\ncurrent versions, and may thus lead to practical applications in a relatively short time.",
