The activity is to support development of innovative, collaborative industry-university research and educational programs. Support will be provided for eight Ph.D. students (four at UIC [this project] and four at TAMU [award 0101059]), who will be co-advised by university faculty and industrial scientist/engineers. These students will spend one semester or summer each year doing research at GEMS.  \r\n\r\nWhile in residence at GEMS in the Applied Sciences Laboratory, the students will have access to advanced MRI system design and testing equipment and work under the supervision of the industrial Co-Principal investigators, who also will serve as members of the student's Ph.D. advisory committees. Additionally, six senior GEMS engineers/scientists will participate in this project as mentors for the students. \r\n\r\nThis project is expected to establish a new model for industry/university collaborative research and education programs at the Ph.D. level in MRI engineering.\r\n\r\n",
