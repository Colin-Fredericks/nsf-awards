Feehan\r\n\r\nThe principal goal of our research is to prove the celebrated \r\nformula of Edward Witten (1994), relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten series of smooth four-manifolds. Witten used \r\nquantum field theory methods to derive his celebrated formula, \r\nbased on the concept of `duality', whereas the approach we \r\nhave been pursuing jointly with Thomas Leness is a mathematical \r\none, employing a moduli space of non-abelian monopoles as a \r\ncobordism between links of Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten \r\nmoduli spaces. We have already partially verified Witten's \r\nformula using this approach, showing that in many cases the \r\nseries agree up through terms of order depending only on \r\nthe topology of the four-manifold. We aim to build on \r\nthose results, by showing next that a relation between the \r\ntwo series of the overall expected shape exists and then \r\napplying auxiliary techniques to prove that his formula is \r\nthe only one possible.  A second goal of our research is to\r\ndevelop a proof of Witten's formula, in the special case of \r\nsymplectic four-manifolds equipped with Lefschetz fibrations, \r\nand shed light on the relationship between Seiberg-Witten \r\ninvariants, Donaldson invariants, and the structure of Lefschetz fibrations. Ultimately, we also hope to explain the relationship between the mathematical and quantum field theory methods of \r\nderiving Witten's formula.\r\n\r\nWitten's formula, as understood by mathematicians, is part of a physical theory developed by Witten and Nathan Seiberg relating non-abelian Yang-Mills theory (a generalization of Maxwell's \r\ntheory of electromagnetics) and the simpler abelian Seiberg-Witten gauge field theories. In the physical world, quantum Yang-Mills theories provide a theoretical basis for describing elementary \r\nparticle interactions. In the mathematical world, beginning with \r\nthe work of Simon Donaldson in 1983, classical Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten gauge theories have played a fundamental role \r\nin probing the geometry of four-dimensional spaces. String\r\ntheory is often cited by physicists as the most promising \r\ncandidate for a unification of quantum field theory (itself \r\nis a unification of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong \r\nforces) and Einstein's theory of gravity. Such a `grand \r\nunified theory' would give a single theoretical framework \r\nfor explaining both short-range, high-energy elementary \r\nparticle interactions and the long-range gravitational force. \r\nHowever, discovery of such a unified framework has eluded \r\nphysicists for nearly three-quarters of a century. Furthermore, \r\nwhile Einstein's theory of gravity is founded on rigorous \r\nmathematics, the goal of providing a mathematical foundation \r\nfor quantum field theory has not yet been realized. Most \r\nphysicists agree that particle accelerators of impossibly \r\nlarge size would be needed to experimentally verify that \r\nstring theory is the `right' theory of nature. However, \r\nwhile independent, mathematical verifications of quantum\r\nfield theory predictions can never replace experimental tests, \r\nthey may increase our confidence that quantum field theory \r\npredictions are correct when experimental checks are impossible \r\nwith current technology. We hope that our project may serve as a \r\nsmall step in such directions.\r\n\r\n",
