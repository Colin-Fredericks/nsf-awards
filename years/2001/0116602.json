 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost everywhere in the world it is possible to find marine structures, even some relatively new ones, which contain cracked or spalled concrete usually involving corrosion of the reinforcement. Several methods of controlling corrosion, have been adopted, but premature corrosion in the splash zones continues to be a problem of serious concern.\r\n\r\nThe basic philosophy of the 60's \"to replace and not to renovate\" was consistent with relatively low constructional costs and the \"throw-away\" attitude. However, the current concerns regarding economic considerations, energy issues, and environmental problems have significantly altered this mode of thinking. New and innovative developments in materials technology make repair procedures feasible and very cost-effective. This is an identified need for innovative repair concepts for marine piles with lower costs than conventional patch repair methods that require expensive maintenance techniques. The repair concepts will generally be to restore or enhance one or more of the following: durability, structural strength, function, and appearance. Cost-effectiveness is an important factor for feasibility of application.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project, a joint experimental investigation of Florida Atlantic University and the Universities of Mayab and Campeche in Mexico, will lead to the development of appropriate structure-specific and environment-specific repair procedures. The developed methodology will help the coastal engineer to design durable strengthening schemes, ii) select the most appropriate repair procedure from available options, and iii) predict the degree of strengthening and performance for specific options. The repair procedures will provide valuable input to Coastal Repair and Rehabilitation Manuals.\r\n",
