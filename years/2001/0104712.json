The effort will be part of EDC's Adult Literacy Media Alliance (ALMA).  The principal components of the project will be:\r\n\r\nTen new, half-hour episodes of the television series, TV411, which is currently carried by approximately 100 public television stations.  The new programs will shift the emphasis of the series from reading literacy to mathematics skills.  In addition to covering a broad array of mathematical concepts, procedures and vocabulary, the programs will have an explicit focus on problem-solving strategies and attitudes about mathematics.\r\n\r\nA multi-level national outreach and marketing campaign to attract viewers and users to the materials and to increase carriage of the series.  An in-depth implementation effort will be conducted with outreach partners is six large metropolitan areas.  EDC will adapt the outreach, marketing and promotion aspects of this focused effort so that it can be used by all television stations that commit to carry the series.  \r\n\r\nFormative and summative evaluation to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the materials and to inform the understanding of the impact on viewers and users of these types of materials. \r\n\r\n",
