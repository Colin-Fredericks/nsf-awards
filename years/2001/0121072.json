 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to request funds to organize ECS-EPSCoR, NSF\r\nGrantees Conference on Electronics, Photonics and Device Technologies. The\r\nconference will be conducted during summer of 2001 at the University of Arkansas,\r\nFayetteville, Arkansas. Arkansas is an EPSCoR state where significant progress has been\r\ndemonstrated in the conference related topics through major NSF sponsored programs.\r\n\r\nAnother important objective is to establish an interactive platform of leading researchers\r\nfrom the states with leading as well as evolving research programs in the areas related to\r\nthe conference. The meeting will invite grantees from EPSCoR states (over 60% out of\r\nthe total number) and from non-EPSCoR states. This will be a singular opportunity to\r\ngenerate and discuss new academic concepts, research and education directions by\r\nestablishing teams of leading researchers. The conference will provide a basis for\r\ndiscussing recent research findings as well as sharing first-hand-teaching experiences in\r\ninterdisciplinary education across cultural, age and gender boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe choices of conference venue is conducive for the subjects as well as inter and intra\r\nstate teaming due to presence of outstanding research and education programs in the\r\nrelated areas on this campus. For example, this campus houses various leading NSF\r\nfunded laboratories, centers, programs and projects including the Arkansas Center for\r\nElectronic-Photonic Materials Innovation (ACEMI), Materials Research Science and\r\nEngineering Center (MRSEC), Distributed seed Program at AR-NB-OK for Science and\r\nEngineering Research Center (SERC) for Durable Nano and Micro System, femtosecond\r\nlaser microvias drilling at Materials and Manufacturing Research Laboratories (MRL),\r\nIntegrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) in Microelectronics and\r\nPhotonics, and MEMS packaging at High Density Electronics Center (HiDEC).\r\n\r\nThe conference will result in promoting interaction among scientists and engineers\r\nleading to germination of new ideas and themes, team formation, new proposal\r\nsubmissions, student involvement and exchange, proceedings of extended abstracts, and\r\ngeneration of more fiscal and intellectual resources at EPSCoR states, K-12 and school\r\nteacher outreach, more technology transfer. The outcome of the conference will be\r\ndisseminated through proceedings and related material on internet, recordable media, and\r\nat various related technical conferences.",
