 "awd_abstract_narration": "A theoretical study will be undertaken of gravitational models called\r\nspacetimes which contain two kinds of boundaries: mild singularities,\r\ndefined by particle paths which end abruptly,  and Cauchy horizons,\r\ndefined as the stopping point for the equations which describe the\r\nmodel. The research will have three thrusts. The first will be to\r\nstudy the behavior of quantum particles in the vicinity of the\r\nspacetime singularities. The second will be to extend a\r\npreviously-developed conjecture into the stability of singularities and\r\nCauchy horizons. The last will be to study the mathematical\r\nstructure of spacetimes with certain unusual singularities.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical models used are based on Einstein's theory which describes\r\ngravitation, one of the four basic forces of nature.  It is therefore\r\nimportant to understand both the mathematical structure and predictions\r\nof this theory.  Since basic theorems predict the existence of\r\nsingularities in Einstein's theory, it is important to study the\r\nnature of these singularities.  Therefore, Prof Konkowski has chosen\r\nto study spacetime solutions to Einstein's equations which possess the\r\nmost pathological types of singularities. In particular, spacetimes are\r\nstudied with mild singularities and Cauchy horizons.  This study should\r\nlead to a more thorough understanding of general relativity and its\r\nmodels of the gravitational effects of physical objects.\r\n",
