She will study pulsars, the rapidly rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars which emit pulses that are detected once per rotation.  Pulsars have many astrophysical applications, including strong-field gravity, condensed matter physics, particle physics, planetary astronomy, and even cosmology.  While pulsars radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, there are over 1100 known radio pulsars and only 40 known X-ray and/or gamma-ray pulsars.  Consequently, the relationship between low- and high-energy emission and the emission processes themselves are not well-understood.  This research program will lead to a more complete census of the pulsar population, a better understanding of emission mechanisms, and the discovery of unique individual objects.  Techniques for discovery will include radio searches for counterparts to high-energy sources and pulsars that are likely to be detectable at high energies, as well as high-energy searches, spectroscopy, and imaging.   This research is funded through the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n***\r\n",
