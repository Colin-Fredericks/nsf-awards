Galloway\r\n  \r\nResearch under this award will be conducted in the areas of\r\nLorentzian and Riemannian geometry, with applications to General\r\nRelativity and String Theory.  One of the specific aims of this\r\nproject is to investigate the global structure of asymptotically\r\nlocally anti-de Sitter spacetimes, especially in connection with\r\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence. We continue investigations into the\r\nrelationship of the topology of an asymptotically locally\r\nanti-de Sitter spacetime and that of its conformal\r\nboundary-at-infinity, and undertake a study of certain\r\ntopological and geometrical properties of higher dimensional\r\nblack holes, and related objects arising in string theory,\r\nincluding certain solitions conjectured to be least energy\r\nconfigurations. Another aim of this project is to continue\r\ninvestigations into spacetime rigidity phenomena associated with\r\nthe occurence of timelike lines and null lines.  Applications of\r\nthe null splitting theorem will be considered, and a new\r\napproach to well-known conjectures concerning the rigidity of\r\nthe singularity theorems is proposed for study.\r\n\r\nModern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature.  The\r\ngravitational field and other fields, black holes and related\r\nobjects, may be described and analyzed using geometric methods.\r\nIn more general terms, this project is concerned with the study\r\nof certain features of gravity of current scientific interest\r\nfrom this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools of\r\nRiemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and\r\nLorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime.  These\r\ntheories provide a method for studying the relationship among\r\nthree fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature\r\n(i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the\r\nglobal shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal\r\nstructure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays and\r\nlight cones).\r\n\r\n",
