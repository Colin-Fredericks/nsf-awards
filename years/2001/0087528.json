SEA, Inc. teaches hands-on programs in ocean sciences to undergraduate students, high school students, and teachers in various programs, as well as orientation programs for graduate students at the nearby Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  The instrumentation provided here is jointly supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Division of Undergraduate Education, and is an excellent example of efforts to integrate research and education in environmental sciences.  Specific instrumentation to be acquired for shipboard use includes an acoustic doppler current profiler, a remotely operated vehicle, an auxiliary winch for deploying oceanographic instrumentation, CTD instrumentation for both vertical deployment on station and towing, a continuous-flow surface water analysis system, an on-board computer network, a suite of biological sampling nets and a variety of laboratory instruments and microscope systems, as well as other instrumentation.  SEA is providing substantial instrumentation with non-federal funds as well, as well as paying the costs to build the vessel.  Assistance with instrument maintenance is provided by the technical staff at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  The instrumentation supported here will assist students in education and research during 2001 and future years.\r\n***\r\n",
