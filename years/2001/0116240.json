 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation and analysis of the behavior of piezoceramic-elastomer composites is the focus of this work. This newly emerging class of smart-structures combines the adaptability and passive damping characteristics of elastomers with the active capabilities of piezoceramics to create smart-structures with both passive and active vibration suppression capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe development of predictive constitutive models and effective control algorithms for the composites are the two primary objectives of this research project.  A prototype composite, tested in a two degree of freedom vibratory system, is used as a test case.\r\n\r\nThe piezoelectric-ceramic composite is modeled using a novel strain energy approach, following the rubrics of composite mechanics and rubber elasticity, that incorporates state of deformation dependence, composite geometry and anisotropy, the hyperelastic mechanical response of the elastomer and the piezoelectric component's electro-mechanical behavior. Experimental investigation of the composite's response to sinusoidal loadings is performed to develop a transfer function and thereby more robust control algorithms.  Experiment and theory are combined to generate analytical control algorithms that follows from the constitutive model of the composite, but allow for model dynamic uncertainty.\r\n\r\nIn completion of this project, constitutive models for the behavior of a new class of smart-structures, control algorithms for their use as vibration absorbers, and working prototypes of these absorbers are produced.  The adaptability of the composites allows for the creation of highly functional surface mounted, in-line, or molded components. This work will impact the field in a variety of applications, including but not limited to, active automotive mounts, vibratory isolation of specific components in assembly such as shock-proof CD players, telescopes, or rotating machinery, and in other situations where conventional techniques can not be applied.\r\n\r\n",
