 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides educational opportunities to low income, academically talented students through scholarships that promote full- time enrollment and degree achievement in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. The project includes an established priority ranking that focuses on funding for Native Americans and other under- represented populations. The recruiting plan includes using well-established organizations such as the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) and the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native American (SACNAS). Scholarship recipients' academic progress is monitored and information on mentoring and career opportunities is provided. Students are required to establish a degree plan and monitor progress within that plan. The overall goal of the project is to implement a scholarship program where 40 scholarship recipients receive an associate or baccalaureate degree in one of the project's disciplines or transfers from an associate to a baccalaureate degree program. The project also includes a mentoring plan. Through this project, 40 students from across the United States will have the opportunity to participate in a program encouraging them to pursue associate and baccalaureate level degrees in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics.",
