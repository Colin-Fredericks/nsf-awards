 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florida Atlantic University will host a community planning workshop to discuss strategies and procedures  for linking existing coastal ocean observatories along the East Coast of the US.  The goal is to coordinate simultaneous observation of synoptic scale ocean and atmospheric systems, particularly those involving the Gulf Stream and hurricanes, both of which bear major influence on East Coast population centers. Linking the observatories makes it possible to coordinate standardization of oceanographic and atmospheric measurement tools to provide meaningful observations on a synoptic scale.  A coordinated network of coastal observatories would also enhance studies on the influence of type, orientation and extent of local shelf characteristics on coastal processes. The workshop will result in a document that articulates the requirements, methods, and potential funding sources for implementing a functional link between the observatories. A consortium of East Coast ocean observatories is envisioned that will facilitate an integrated approach to ocean observation as well as providing a forum for exchange of data and resources.",
