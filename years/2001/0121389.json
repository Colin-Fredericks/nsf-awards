 "awd_abstract_narration": "0121389\r\nHughes\r\n\r\nThe explosive growth in demand for broadband wireless data services has underscored the importance of low-complexity, bandwidth-efficient communication techniques for multipath radio channels.  Recent information theoretic results have demonstrated that deploying multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver can dramatically increase the capacity of wireless channels. In order to realize the full potential of this approach, it is important to develop new antenna designs and low-complexity signal processing techniques that more fully exploit the space-time structure of multi-input/multi-output radio channels.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to improve the performance of wireless communication systems by jointly optimizing the antenna array geometry, coding and modulation, and receiver processing. Four general issues are addressed: (1) design of new antenna arrays inspired by information theory; (2) design of space-time constellations that achieve full diversity and preserve channel capacity; (3) low-complexity space-time coding methods based on multilevel serial concatenation; and (4) new scalable receiver architectures for joint iterative space-time decoding and array processing. The proposed research is an interdisciplinary effort in communications, signal processing, and RF antenna design. The ultimate goal of this work is to increase spectral efficiency and reduce the power requirements of wireless communication systems.\r\n",
