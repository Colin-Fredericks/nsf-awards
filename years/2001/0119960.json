 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the sensitivity of ecosystems at the land-water interface and our dependence on them, it is increasingly imperative that we understand how they function and manage them wisely. This will require the combined efforts of physical, social and natural scientists, mathematicians, and modelers. Yet graduate students are not trained to interact across these disciplines. To add breadth to graduate training, this project will bring together established leaders in the social and natural sciences and recent graduates to design a capstone educational program. The objective of the educational program is to better prepare graduates for interdisciplinary careers dedicated to understanding, prediction and management of environments and resources at the land-water interface. The recommendations of the assembled group will be used to develop a model program to enhance interdisciplinary understanding, leadership training and networking.",
