 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Second International Conference on Proteins that Bind RNA will be held at the Lakeway\r\nInn Conference Center in Austin, Texas, from March 4-8, 2001. The First International\r\nConference on Proteins that Bind RNA was held in May 1998 in Avalon, New Jersey. This\r\nseries of international meetings brings together molecular biologists and structural\r\nbiologists who share a common interest in RNA-binding proteins. The meetings focus on the\r\nbiological role of RNA-binding proteins and how structural analysis provides insights into\r\nthe function of RNA-protein complexes. The format is designed to maximize the exchange of\r\ninformation, foster collaborations, and to set the stage for future directions in\r\nresearch. Speakers include an interdisciplinary mix of established scientists and young\r\ninvestigators in the areas of molecular biology, genetics and structural biology of\r\nRNA-binding proteins. The format includes a mix of distinguished invited speakers and\r\ntalks chosen from submitted abstracts. Extensive poster sessions provide breadth to the\r\nmeeting and encourage cross-talk among investigators and students. Meeting topics include\r\nthe role of RNA-binding proteins in the following processes: post-transcriptional RNA\r\nprocessing (such as splicing, editing, nuclear transport and mRNA decay), transcriptional\r\ntermination, the function of ribozymes in-vivo, enzymatic RNP molecules, translation,\r\ndevelopmental control, viral replication and human disease.",
