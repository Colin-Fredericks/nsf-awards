 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProject Summary:  Conspicuousness and Concealment: The Visual Ecology of\r\nSignaling and Camouflage\r\n\r\nAll visual tasks that animals perform take place in natural scenes.\r\nConsequently, the visual systems of animals are adapted for efficient\r\n(often nearly optimal) analysis of the scenes they view in natural\r\ncircumstances.  Animals are rarely concerned with general scene\r\nproperties, however.  Rather, most objects of visual interest are other\r\nanimals or plant food items such as fruits or flowers.  Sometimes the\r\nvisual object is decorated to become a strong signal.  Other times, it\r\nmay conceal itself using patterns that are confused with its natural\r\nbackground - it is camouflaged.   Systems of signaling and camouflage\r\nmust contend with both vision of other animals and properties of the\r\nbackground. Furthermore, neither the background nor the organism has a\r\nconstant appearance because of continuous variations in the patterns of\r\nillumination falling upon them. These changing conditions strongly\r\ninfluence the visual appearances of scenes and signals.\r\n\r\nThis project considers the interrelationships among illuminants, scenes,\r\nsignals, and animal vision.  Research will concentrate on marine systems\r\nthat offer excellent preliminary understanding of vision, color, and\r\nbehavioral context: coral reef fishes, mantis shrimps, and cuttlefish.\r\nThe primary goals are to learn how colors (i.e. spectral reflectances)\r\nand patterns of animals are adapted for enhanced conspicuousness or\r\nconcealment, and how visual systems of animals are specialized to detect\r\nsignals and to break camouflage. The power of this approach is that it\r\ncompares a diverse selection of animals, all of which must form and\r\nrecognize biological signals in shallow, clear marine waters. The\r\nresearch will be a pioneering effort to learn how systems of vision,\r\nsignaling, and camouflage operate in extremely colorful (or well\r\ncamouflaged) marine species in the specific contexts of their natural\r\nilluminants and backgrounds. The proposed research will contribute\r\nsignificantly to the fields of sensory biology, visual ecology, and\r\nanimal behavior. It will similarly be of special interest to engineers\r\nand scientists working in remote sensing, machine vision, and artificial\r\nsystems of object detection (including camouflaged objects). It will\r\ncontribute to the training of graduate students and enhance the research\r\nexperiences of undergraduates working in the P.I.s laboratory, including\r\nwomen and minority students. (who are already involved with similar\r\nresearch in this laboratory).  Last - and far from least - the project\r\nholds promise for stimulating scientific interest in the general public\r\nand all those interested in animal vision, color, and crypsis.\r\n",
