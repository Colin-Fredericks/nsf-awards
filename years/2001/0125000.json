This project\r\nsupports the participation of approximately 15 domestic students\r\nand young scientists, selected from a national pool of applicants\r\ngenerated by web and journal advertisements for the meeting.  An\r\nunusual feature of the meeting is an opening day of tutorials,\r\nwhich prepare the attendees for the lectures, with mathematical\r\nscientists introducing basic principles to biologists and\r\nbiologists giving tutorials for the quantitative scientists.  Two\r\nsessions focus on issues of importance to students working at the\r\ninterface between the computational sciences and biology.\r\nStudents are especially welcome to attend the meeting and present\r\nposters on their work.\r\n     The Program in Mathematics and Molecular Biology (PMMB)\r\nconducts research at the interface between molecular biology and\r\nthe mathematical sciences and trains students and postdocs in\r\nthis area.  An essential part of this effort is a series of\r\nconferences on mathematics and molecular biology.  The meetings\r\nprovide a comfortable but challenging environment where students\r\nand scientists from each discipline can learn about the other\r\ndiscipline and about multidisciplinary approaches to the solution\r\nof important problems in modern biology.  This fosters\r\ninterdisciplinary training, catalyzes new interdisciplinary\r\ncollaborations, and in an important scientific area helps develop\r\nmore people with both mathematics and biology expertise.  The\r\nproject supports students and junior scientists.\r\n",
