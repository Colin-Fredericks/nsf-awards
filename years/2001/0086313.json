Dr. Allen D. Hunter of Youngstown State University will spend a first-time sabbatical working with Dr. J. Derek Woollins and Alexander Slawin of St. Andrews University in Scotland.  The objectives of this collaboration are: (1) to conduct research on structures and bonding of main group inorganic and organometallic ring and cage complexes in solid state and determine their spectroscopic properties in solution; and (2) prepare a variety of teaching materials in crystallography.  The US investigator is a crystallographer and brings to this collaboration expertise in diffraction methods .  This is complemented by the Scottish group's expertise in main group inorganic and organometallic chemistry, their excellent crystallography facilities, and different approach to teaching diffraction methods.   The project will advance understanding of the synthesis and characterization of novel main group organometallic and coordination complexes, and result in new teaching materials on diffraction methods.\r\n",
