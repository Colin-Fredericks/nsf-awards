 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of New Hampshire will acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) characterization of new cycloadducts of C60 with polyacenes and tetrazines; b) characterization and dynamic NMR studies of polyamines and derivatives, including compounds with strong potential as diagnostic imaging agents and anti-HIV agents; c) development of a novel zinc carbenoid chain extension reaction that will facilitate the inclusion of ketomethylene isosteres as part of combinatorial libraries; and d) studies of supramolecular clusters formed from hybrid ligands.   \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry, biotechnology and nanotechnology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
