The theory has its basis in socialization practices used by caregivers in interacting with infants at a very early stage of word learning. In determining how infants initially come to perceive the relation between a word and its referent, complexities arise from the fact that the word is a segment of what perceptually is a continuous stream of speech sounds. Additionally, the referent is one element embedded within a complex, dynamic environment. How could an infant detect which span of the speech stream is a word and what that word means? In searching for an answer to this question, a set of four studies has been designed.  These studies test the hypothesis that the types of perceptual information that caregivers present in gesture and speech attract attention and make the correspondence between a word and its referent available and easily detectable.  The research will examine a range of semantic functions that includes nouns (objects), verbs (object motions), and adjectives (object attributes). The sample will be comprised of infants from English-speaking families and will include mothers whose highest education level is a high school diploma as well as those with a college education. The research will be carried out at Ithaca College, a primarily undergraduate institution; the undergraduate students assisting with the project should gain an appreciation of a scientific approach to psychology and a greater interest in pursuing graduate studies. While the results of this research will be of interest to theorists of language development, they also should have great practical significance. Understanding the processes underlying early word learning will help educators devise more effective techniques for impaired language learners, for children with developmental disabilities, and for anyone learning a second language.  \t\t\r\n\r\n",
