 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP) is an \r\nalliance of the Resource Center for Science and Engineering of the University of Puerto \r\nRico, the University of Puerto Rico System, the Inter American University System, \r\nPontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico, and Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico.\r\nDuring the academic year 1999-00, these institutions had a SMET enrollment of 27,441,\r\nor 90% of the SMET undergraduate population on the Island. Ninety-nine percent of the \r\nstudent population is Hispanic and 80% are low-income students. The goal of the\r\nPR-LSAMP is to increase the quantity and quality of minority college students who \r\nsuccessfully complete a BS/BE degree and enter and complete a graduate degree in\r\na SMET field. During Phase I and II (1991-92 to 1999-00), PR-LSAMP institutions\r\nawarded 21,878 BS degrees in SMET, with a 62% annual increment from baseline year,\r\nfrom 1,709 annual degrees in 1991 to 2,771 in 1999-2000. This was achieved\r\nfollowing a two-prong approach: (1) increasing enrollment in SMET disciplines, and\r\n(2) improving retention and graduation rates by implementing a series of strategies \r\nto improve the effectiveness and efficiency of SMET programs. In Phase III, PR-LSAMP\r\nwill build upon these achievements to: (1) further increase the SMET production curve \r\nfrom 2,771 to 3,600, which more than doubles the Phase I baseline figure of 1,709; \r\n(2) increase to 50% the percent of BS SMET graduates from UPR institutions who enter\r\ngraduate school, and to 25% for those graduating from the private institutions, and (3) \r\nincrease the number of BS graduates from PR-LSAMP institutions that complete a PhD\r\ndegree in SMET, either locally or nationally, from 239 to 300 by the end of year 5.\r\n\r\nDuring Phase I and Phase II the core of PR-LSAMP was the revision of the SMET\r\ncurriculum to emphasize for depth of understanding with a \"less is more approach\",\r\nto promote active learning based on inquiry and the use of interactive demonstrations, \r\nto incorporate technology to the learning process, and the development of broad-based \r\nmathematics skills. Teaching strategies such as cooperative learning and the\r\ndevelopment of Study/Learning Skills within the Context of a Course were also\r\nimplemented across SMET disciplines. Jointly with this curriculum revision,\r\nPR-LSAMP offered undergraduate SMET students mentoring and research opportunities\r\nto increase their motivation to remain in SMET careers and enhance their qualification\r\nfor pursuing graduate studies. During Phase I and II a total of 2,363 research stipends \r\nwere awarded, for an average of 262 stipends per year. As a result of these sustained\r\nefforts, the Index of Course Efficiency (the average number of times students have to \r\ntake a SMET course to satisfactorily pass it), was reduced from an average of 2.5 to \r\n1.7. The average graduation rate at UPR institutions increased from 48% to 62% in \r\nscience, while the average graduation rate for engineering at UPR increased from\r\n 53% to 81%. At private institutions the average graduation rate increased to 49%.\r\nAlso the weighted average for satisfactory grades in science and mathematics \r\ncourses increased from 47.5% to 59.3%. In the case of Engineering courses, \r\nthe weighted average increased from 74% to 83%.\r\n\r\nFor Phase III PR-LSAMP proposes the following additional strategies to complete\r\nthe construction of permanent pathways to graduate studies in SMET: 1) the\r\ndevelopment of interactive web-based learning to master hard to teach concepts in \r\nscience and mathematics; (2) the development of electronic modules to expand the\r\ninterdisciplinary capabilities of undergraduate SMET students to further enhance\r\ntheir preparation for graduate studies; 3) the scaling-up of the teaching/learning \r\nstrategies that have proven successful in improving student performance in\r\nSMET courses, through ongoing academic and technical assistance to faculty and \r\nan Annual Best Practices Conference; and 4) the development of Information Technology \r\nskills in SMET students so they are capable of making effective and more critical use of\r\naccurate and valid information in their professional lives. To increase the number of\r\nstudents pursuing undergraduate degrees in SMET, PR-LSAMP will develop a Pre-College\r\nto College Bridging Component that will induct students into research experiences, and \r\nto further enhance the number of students entering graduate school and completing a \r\nPhD in SMET, PR-LSAMP will expand its research and mentoring program to\r\nprovide a larger number of students with key skills and guidance to improve their \r\npreparation and motivation for graduate studies, in coordination with the Alliance\r\nfor Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) Program. The results of the\r\nproject will be disseminated widely in the professional community through presentations\r\nat regional and national scientific meetings. Curricular materials developed\r\nwill be available to other institutions through CD format and the WWW. The general\r\npublic will have access to updated information on the PR-LSAMP through its website.",
