The research focus is on the dependence of hadronic and astrophysical observables as these relate to the search for a quark-gluon plasma (QGP).  The collaboration combines complementary expertise because the German side has experience in exploring evidence for QGP formation in heavy-ion collisions and is now pioneering the search for astrophysical signals, whereas the U.S. side has developed a systematic approach to analyzing constituent-interchange processes from the lightest interactions of pi-mesons to the heaviest B-meson exchanges.  This joint collaborative research effort also presents junior researchers with the opportunity to work internationally, and the work done on this proposal will help institutionalize the relationship between the German and U.S. research groups.\r\n",
