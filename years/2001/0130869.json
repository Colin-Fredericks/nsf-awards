In particular, they focus on visualization of these datasets using perceptually based computer graphics techniques and display the visualizations using a combination PC CAVE and Active Mural.  They also study the issues involved with ubiquitous access to high-resolution spatial datasets from mobile devices, and leverage a powerful wireless network.  They focus on prediction-based adaptation and scheduling for distributed interactive applications and are building a compute cluster to support this work.\r\n\r\nWhat is missing in the existing shared research infrastructure is a facility to store and serve massive datasets interactively, with low latency and high bandwidth.  The researchers will build such a shared data cluster.  The data cluster will be very high performance and capacity PC RAIDs interconnected with a multi-GB/sec SAN.  The SAN will connect to their compute cluster, CAVE/Mural, mobile devices and wired client machines.  The combined data and compute clusters will be sufficient to pump 200 MB/s from disk to the CAVE/Mural screens.  The combination of the data cluster, compute cluster, CAVE/Mural, local network infrastructure, and desktop and mobile clients will let them study interactivity in the large.\r\n",
