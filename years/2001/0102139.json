 "awd_abstract_narration": "0102139  Bryers  The objective of this research is to quantify surface chemistry effects on the conformation and subsequent availability of mixtures of adsorbed contaminants for bacterial degradation.  The added influence of ambient humic acids on the adsorption conformations will also be determined.  Three organic wastes are considered: naphthalene, cyanuric acid and trichloroethylene.  This research has two major objectives.  First, carry out degradation studies (both in suspension and as biofilm culture) of the three selected organic wastes, in prescribed mixtures, both with and without the presence of known amounts of humic acids.  The added influence of ambient humic acids on the adsorption conformations and bacterial responses will be quantified.  Second, develop model substrata that mimic inorganic soil substrata.  Also, determine the spatial conformation and molecular distributions of various mixtures of the three organic contaminants exposed to these different \"mineral mimic\" substrata.  In addition, quantify individual species' metabolic responses when mixed cultures are exposed to these various substrata.  This research is expected to provide fundamental information that is critical to affecting efficient treatment protocols for contaminated land and water. ***",
