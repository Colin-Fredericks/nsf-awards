The journal is published online only, in order to be accessed by anyone, anytime, anywhere. It encourages quality undergraduate research by providing a publishing forum that is managed by a nationwide community of undergraduate learners mentored by faculty and graduate students. Students experience the process of scientific publishing from the viewpoints of all involved stakeholders, i.e., as authors, peer reviewers, and editorial staff. Through its mission, the journal emphasizes to the larger scientific and educational community the importance of research experience in undergraduate learning.  It also bridges research and learning, by using a research activity to enhance learning. The students learn and master communication, networking, and critical thinking skills. Graduate mentors benefit through student mentorship experience and potentially developing into pedagogically more aware geoscience education professionals.\r\n",
