 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study several questions in partial differential\r\nequations which lead to interesting questions in harmonic\r\nanalysis. The first set of questions are related to the inverse\r\nconductivity problem as studied by Sylvester and Uhlmann. My main\r\ninterest is considering the a priori regularity assumption which seem\r\nto be necessary to study this problem.  I propose a technique to\r\nestablish a uniqueness theorem in dimensions 3 and larger for\r\ncoefficients which only have one derivative. In addition, I will\r\nconsider the two-dimensional problem, where such a theorem is\r\nknown. In two dimensions, I propose to extend the result from\r\nequations to systems. The second set of questions are related to the\r\nmixed problem for Laplace's equation. The goal here is to obtain\r\noptimal regularity results for solutions to these problems. Examples\r\nindicate that the positive result depend strongly on the geometry of\r\nthe domain and the sets where Dirichlet and Neumann data are\r\nposed.\r\n\r\nThe inverse conductivity problem is a mathematical formulation of the\r\nproblem of determining the interior physical properties of an object\r\nby making electrical measurements at the boundary. This and related\r\nproblems are of practical importance in medical imaging and in the\r\nnondestructive evaluation of materials. The theoretical investigations\r\nproposed in this project may shed some light on how to improve\r\npractical implementation of these problems.  The mixed problem for\r\nLaplace's equation models the problem of determining the temperature\r\nin the interior of a solid where part of the boundary is insulated.\r\nMy research is focused on understanding how the geometry of the\r\nregion of the region affects our ability to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n",
