Abikoff and McCune; topological computations\r\nand related algebraic and symbolic computations of 3-dimensional\r\nmanifolds and of the structure of modules over the Steenrod algebra\r\nwhich arise from the classifying spaces of certain vector bundles will\r\nbe conducted by Profs. Giambalvo and Tollefson; Computational partial\r\ndifferential equations with applications in the physical sciences\r\nwhich include coupled Schr\\\"odinger equations, travelling waves and\r\nthe non-linear Gross-Pitaevskii equation will be studied by\r\nProfs. Choi, Koltracht and McKenna.\r\n",
