Bloch\r\n\r\nDynamics and Control of Mechanical Systems\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal for the continuation and extension of the \r\nproposer's research into the dynamics and control of nonlinear \r\nmechanical systems in finite- and infinite-dimensions. In \r\nparticular, research is proposed in the following areas: integrable \r\ndynamical systems in finite- and infinite- dimensions including both \r\nHamiltonian and nonholonomic systems, the stabilization and control of \r\nnonlinear mechanical systems via energy methods and the extension of \r\nthese methods to systems with nonholonomic (nonintegrable) constraints, \r\nthe geometry of the smooth and discrete dynamics of rigid bodies, and \r\nthe control of quantum mechanical systems. A general area of interest \r\nthat encompasses several parts of this proposal is the relationship \r\nbetween energy preservation and asymptotic behavior in dynamical systems \r\nand between reversible and irreversible behavior. In the integrable \r\nsystems area the proposer is interested in the nonabelian Toda lattice, \r\ninfinite-dimensional generalizations of Toda, and generalized smooth \r\nand discrete rigid body systems. Finally he intends to analyze the \r\ndynamics and control of various coupled mechanical systems in both the \r\nclassical and quantum regimes.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is aimed at studying the behavior of various mechanical \r\nsystems that are important for applications in science and engineering. \r\nThese include systems such as wheeled or articulated robots, aerospace \r\nsystems, submarine vehicles, and quantum (microscopic) devices. Quantum \r\ndevices, where the laws of motion of atoms and molecules play a key role, \r\nhave become increasingly important in such areas as communication and \r\ncoding theory. In addition to studying the behavior of these systems \r\nthe proposer intends to analyze their control and optimal control -- \r\nthat is, to provide methods for using such systems in engineering \r\napplications in a practical, stable, and efficient manner. The proposer\r\nintends to analyze various key examples of such mechanical systems with \r\nmathematical structure which is particularly amenable to detailed\r\nqualitative and quantitative analysis. Further, the proposer intends to\r\nanalyze the transition between the behavior of systems at the quantum\r\n(microscopic) level and the large scale (macroscopic) level. This \r\ntransition is important for the application of physical devices in the \r\nreal world as well as interesting from the scientific point of view. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
