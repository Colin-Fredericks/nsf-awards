True interoperability among\r\ndatabases is required to answer complex biological questions. This goal cannot be reached without a\r\nmechanism to allow access to all available information on a particular organism.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a foundation component in the development of the GBIF and associated national efforts\r\nmust be a means to provide a list of all the names that should be searched for a given organism. The need\r\nfor this component of interoperability was clearly recognized by the proposers of GBIF, but to date there\r\nhave been no efforts specifically directed at providing software tools to make it possible. In this project,\r\nwe will implement such a mechanism. It will allow even the most naive Web user to obtain biological\r\ninformation without needing to understand the complexities of nomenclature and associated arcana. To do\r\nthis, we will develop a query interface/portal understandable to any user; a set of standards and protocols for representing search requests (which will be sent as a URL) and result sets (which will be returned as XML using HTTP) that is platform-independent; and a set of platform-specific translators and search routines for retrieving data from participating\r\nnomenclatural data providers.\r\n\r\n",
