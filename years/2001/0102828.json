 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nationwide statistics show marked under-representation of minority students attending \r\ngraduate schools or pursuing careers in the areas of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics\r\n(SEM). HBCU's are in the most ideal situation to provide solutions to this problem. \r\nUniversities like Kentucky State University must make every effort to recruit, retain,\r\nand graduate minoritySEM students and subsequently enable them to attend graduate \r\nschool. Unfortunately, enrollmentin SEM disciplines is declining rather than growing. \r\nTherefore, Kentucky State University is submitting a proposal to the NSF HBCU-UP \r\ninitiative designed to increase enrollment of minoritystudents in SEM areas and \r\nenhance their preparedness for graduate school success. Teams Enhancing Access for \r\nMinorities in Science (TEAMS) is a comprehensive program designed to prepare young \r\nminority students for entry into careers in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics \r\n(SEM) fields. The first phase of the program is a summer Undergraduate Bridge\r\nProgram for rising high school seniors and graduates. Once students matriculate at \r\nKentucky State University, they will proceed as TEAMS through several phases of \r\ntheir undergraduate academic program culminating with an intensive Graduate Bridge\r\nProgram in preparation for graduate school. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of TEAMS is to increase the number of qualified minority students \r\nentering graduate schools in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics and to provide\r\nthem with academic experiences and research opportunities which will increase \r\ntheir participation in graduate schools and their degree of successful completion\r\n of graduate endeavors. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of the TEAMS Program will include: \r\n- Providing a conduit that will facilitate the entry of high potential minority high \r\nschool students into Kentucky State University through an Undergraduate Bridge\r\nProgram that will support andprepare high school students to reach above average \r\nachievement in undergraduate studies in SEM courses. \r\n-Providing students with a curriculum that will challenge them in a manner that is\r\n appropriate for developing the content and skills in subject areas pertinent to \r\ngraduatestudies in SEM. \r\n-Establishing Excel Study/Research Teams that will prepare students in content,\r\n problem-solving skills, and cooperative and investigative approaches to learning. \r\n-Establishing a Graduate Bridge Program that will promote readiness for and an \r\nawareness of the expectations of graduate studies by providing students with first\r\nhand experiences in various aspects of research. \r\n-Providing faculty development activities, such as workshops, seminars, institutes,\r\nand conferences on innovative teaching strategies, including inquiry-based teaching \r\nand learning, collaborative learning, and interdisciplinary approaches. \r\n\r\n",
