These labs are adopting and adapting commercial \"SuperLab\" software designed for research and education in psychology, following the lead of many other departments, including departments in research universities, such as Harvard University and the University of Illinois. The labs have been set up using SuperLab as the core, coupled with compatible data acquisition cards from National Instruments, a photometer, and a sound level meter. These labs have allowed our department to integrate technology into a number of psychology courses in sensation, perception and cognition, and are providing a platform for increased student participation in laboratory research experiences and independent research projects. Students are now routinely participating in the design of experiments; stimulus generation, measurement, and control; and the setup and configuration of scientific apparatus used in psychology research in these areas. Student experiments are being supported from three sources. SuperLab LT provides a pool of existing experiments from which to draw. SuperLab software provides the technology and a bibliographic base of published papers (at www.SuperLab.com/papers/) to support adaptations of other experiments for our students. Finally, we are developing new experiments using SuperLab Pro.",
