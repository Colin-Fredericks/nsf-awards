 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction are two scientific techniques that assist scientists in understanding the atomic structure of crystals and hence better understand the macroscopic properties of these crystals, such as growth size, strength and color.  Both techniques are needed to verify the accuracy of the data.  X-ray absorption data is taken at Brookhaven National Laboratory at the National Synchrotron Light Source.  This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program will allow Georgian Court College to purchase an X-ray Diffractometer and an X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry instrument to be used at the home institution. This will support an ongoing research project currently funded by Research Corporation. The project specifically seeks to understand the important role that small amounts of elements have on the crystal hydroxyapaptite.  This crystal is important because it is the key mineral in human bone.  Success in understanding the role of these elements may lead to the better ability to grow new bones for people, as well as other uses.  Undergraduates involved in this research who have had the opportunity to travel to Brookhaven National Laboratory will have the opportunity to finish the analysis of the samples at their home institution.\r\n\r\nX-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction are two scientific techniques that assist scientists in understanding the atomic structure of crystals and hence better understand the macroscopic properties of these crystals, such as growth size, strength and color.
