 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) This project is developing and implementing a Laboratory Investigations in Neurobiology (LIN) course. This course is providing undergraduate students with a hands-on, inquiry-based experience in modern neurobiological techniques. This course addresses a widespread problem of overcoming \"conceptually difficult\" material in neuroscience that can be experimentally addressed by students. The course provides students an opportunity to develop technical skills that will lead directly to increased educational and occupational opportunities. The LIN course complements an existing lecture course in neurobiology and provides an inter-disciplinary link for undergraduate students in other departments. The primary objectives of the project are: 1) acquisition of fundamental knowledge and technical skills, including data analysis and report writing, in an active, inquiry-based learning environment; 2) application of acquired knowledge and technical skills to design and test hypotheses based upon a background of primary literature in neuroscience; 3) access to neuroscience training within the biology curriculum for a large population of underrepresented students at the university; 4) make a significant contribution to faculty and curriculum development. These goals are being achieved by the development of a LIN course in which students first acquire fundamental skills and knowledge and then apply these skills to develop an independent project suitable for presentation to the scientific community. The topics covered include nerve cell bioelectricity, sensory and motor neurophysiology, neuroanatomy and neurotransmitter identification. The modules to be developed are adaptations of experimental protocols published in commercially available lab manuals. The expected outcome of this project is a new laboratory course with a detailed, student-centered laboratory manual for future use in the course. The results of the project will be disseminated via a CSUH website and presentations at national meetings. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
