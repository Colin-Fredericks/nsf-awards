 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for research in the design, implementation, and instrumentation of new\r\nmethods for scalable wide-area on-demand reliable digital (SWORD) streaming. The larger goal of the\r\nresearch is to enable new streaming media applications, such as immediate access to a television show\r\nwhenever a client anywhere would like to view it, by devising new practical cost-effective methods for on-demand real-time streaming of very popular streaming media content. The key aspects of the research to\r\nbe undertaken are:\r\n1. The development of innovative practical new reliable multicast techniques that optimize client stream\r\nsharing to conserve server and network bandwidth, improve bandwidth cost-sharing, and maximize\r\nsystem scalability.\r\n2. The design of delivery techniques that work over the Internet or over satellite/cable networks, or any\r\ncombination of these network technologies.\r\n3. The development of new metrics and models to determine which popular streams or partial streams\r\nshould be cached at regional (or proxy) servers in order to minimize delivery cost for the data.\r\n4. The development of new network instrumentation facilities for the streaming media delivery protocols\r\nthat enable deep understanding of the impact of network events and conditions on the performance of\r\nthe protocols.\r\n5. The use of the new on-line network instrumentation facilities to develop new streaming methods that\r\noptimally adapt to current network conditions.\r\n6. The development of a novel testbed that allows experimentation with alternative new reliable multicast\r\nmethods as well as alternative algorithms for caching streaming content closer to the clients, uses the\r\nnew instrumentation facilities, and operates seamlessly and transparently in a live environment with\r\nordinary clients accessing widely used media servers over large-scale networks such as Internet2 or the\r\nInternet MBONE.",
