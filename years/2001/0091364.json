 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports the work of Dr. Brian Hoffman (as the PI) of the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University, and Anthony Barrett (as co-PI) of Imperial College, London UK, for their collaborative work on star porphyrazines (pzs). Specifically, they will (i) investigate multi-metallic pzs and pz multimers that will exhibit macrocycle-mediated spin coupling among the localized moments in the metal ions; (ii) examine porphyrazine assemblies and metal-linked pz ribbons that incorporate redox-switchable conduction and/or spin coupling; (iii) explore metal-porphyrazine systems as contrast agents in optical tumor imaging; (iv) examine charged pzs containing an active central metal ion (e.g. Fe or Mn) as possible catalysts for peroxynitrite decomposition; and (v) explore the usefulness of porphyrazines with peripheral substituents designed to bind redox-active metals in applications as sol-gel incorporated optical sensors and/or as dual opto/electrochemical metal-ion sensors.\r\n\r\nThe work supported by this award will have significant impact on a variety of scientific and technological applications. The class of compounds known as star porphyrazines will be highly useful as contrast agents in bio-imaging of tumors, and in such applications as sol-gel incorporated optical sensors and/or as dual opto/electrochemical metal-ion sensors. Students and post-doctoral associates will gain fundamental and diverse skills not only in syntheses and physical characterization of these compounds, but also in exploring the potential application of the resulting products in catalysis, bio-imaging, and sensors.\r\n",
