The scientific research is focussed on the study of high temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance and magnetic transitions in perovskites and ruthenites. The program includes materials synthesis and characterization using Mossbauer spectroscopy. The XRD will enhance the materials characterization capability at this undergraduate institution. The instrument will also be used for training undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups at this EPSCoR state. \r\n\r\nWith this award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program, Berea College will acquire an X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) for materials research undergraduate research and education.
