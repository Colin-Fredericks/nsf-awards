 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an optical instrument that measures velocity distribution in a flame species by species---and on multiple scale sizes---with an accuracy of 1%.  This novel velocimeter is nonintrusive and passive, relying completely on light emitted by the flame itself.  The instrument will be developed with experts in commercial combustion chemical-vapor deposition, a process that inexpensively produces thin-film coatings for a variety of applications, including electronics, glass, anti-corrosives, superconductors, catalytics, polymers, and nanopowders.  The velocimeter will monitor species mixing and velocity in the flame, facilitating \"smart\" deposition that can streamline real-time process control and increase the reliability of the coating process.   The instrument will map the velocity of the flame as a whole.  Phase 1 will prove the feasibility of species-specific, variable-scale-size velocimetry.  Phase II will perform a proof-of-principle demonstration with a prototype instrument. \r\n\r\nThe principal commercial application is smart deposition that monitors real-time species-specific velocity distribution in a flame to maintain flame consistency and maximize deposition efficiency.  Other potential applications include plasma-based manufacturing and plasma thruster control.\r\n",
