This project will involve three interrelated research thrusts that investigate various aspects of this paradigm.  The first thrust deals with the problems associated with coordinating the motion of teams of robots. Some of the questions that are addressed by this effort include the problem of controlling the motion of robots moving in formation and coordinating the action of robots engaged in cooperative manipulation of an object. The second thrust focuses on the issues associated with combining the information obtained from distributed robots to form a coherent model of the environment.  The third area of research concerns the problems associated with designing and analyzing networking strategies that are appropriate for use with distributed teams of robotic agents. Since the platforms are mobile, many of the traditional networking strategies, which were designed with fixed infrastructure in mind, are not applicable. As part of this proposal we intend to investigate questions concerning the appropriateness of various wireless networking technologies such as IEEE 802.11b and Bluetooth. This proposal requests funding to purchase the equipment required to develop a fleet of networked robots that would serve as a shared testbed for our research efforts.\r\n",
