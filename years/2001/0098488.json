 "awd_abstract_narration": "The bulk of this research program will concern the \"causal set\r\nhypothesis\", which states that the deep structure of spacetime is that\r\nof an extended \"family tree\", known technically as a \"partial order\".\r\nProf. Sorkin will develop this approach further by advancing the\r\nunderlying theory, while at the same time applying it to questions like\r\nthat of the cosmological constant, which recently has been shown to\r\ncontribute the greater part of the effective energy density of the\r\nuniverse.  The remainder of the research will continue the study of\r\nclosely related questions about the fine structure of black hole\r\nhorizons and questions concerning what happens when the topology of\r\nspacetime changes or deviates from flatness on small scales.\r\n\tAll these questions are important as part of the larger problem\r\nof quantum gravity, which is how physicists refer to the task of\r\nunifying the two main pillars of physical theory in its current\r\nstate of development: Quantum Theory and General Relativity.  A\r\ntheory of quantum gravity is generally expected to tell us about\r\nthe deep structure of spacetime on the smallest length scales\r\nand, at the same time, to help answer questions about how the\r\ncosmos came to be as it is on the largest length scales.\r\n",
