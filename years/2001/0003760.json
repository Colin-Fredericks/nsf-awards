Loos, Co-Director of the Science and Technology Center for Composite Materials and Structures at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, David E. Kranbuehl of the College of William and Mary, Gerard Seytre and Gisele Boiteux of the Universite de Lyon I and Henry Sautereau and others at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquees in Lyon, France. The project addresses studies of polymer forming and non-polymer forming systems. The objective is to monitor chemical and physical phenomena in polymers.  Specifically the investigators will develop new modes for processing through the application of so-called time of flight techniques to a variety of polymer resins and blends.  Changes in polymer resin states will also be monitored.  The US group brings to this collaboration expertise on cure processing models of polymer resin transfer molding, resin film, and use of dielectric sensors for in situ monitoring. This is complemented by French expertise in structure-property relationships of polymer materials and synthesis and formulation of polymer blends.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators and graduate students.  The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of the macroscopic processing parameters of polymers.  The research has potential commercial applications in composite fabrication, reactive processing, coatings, and curing of polymer materials.\r\n",
