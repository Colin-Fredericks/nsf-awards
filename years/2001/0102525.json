Of particular interest\r\nare algebraic cycles and the cycles associated to singularities of mappings\r\nor the higher order contact of geometric structures.  These objects -- of\r\nimportance in themselves -- have been shown to have ties to other areas of\r\nmathematics.  A major aim here is the discovery and development of such\r\nties. The proposal has several interrelated parts. The first concerns groups\r\nof algebraic cycles and cocycles on a projective variety.  A theory of\r\nhomology-type based on cycles has been developed by the proposer and\r\nothers.  It will be used to study concrete questions about algebraic\r\nspaces.  In a variant of the theory involving real algebraic cycles,\r\nsurprizing connections to equivariant homotopy theory have been found.  \r\nThe implications for real algebraic geometry will be explored, and the\r\nquaternionic analogues will be studied. A second part of the proposal concerns differential \r\ncharacters, objects which mediate between cycles and smooth data, and lead to important\r\ngeometric invariants. Recent discoveries have been made concerning them --\r\nfor example, the existence of a fundamental duality theorem.  Further\r\ndevelopment of the theory is proposed.  Geometric results will be sought by\r\nbringing the calculus of variations to bear in this domain.  A third area of the proposal \r\nconcerns the study of singularities and characteristic forms. The subject includes \r\na generalization of Chern-Weil theory which gives canonical homologies between singularities \r\nof bundle maps and characteristic forms.  Many applications concerning the global\r\ngeometry of singularities,  and its relation to characteristic classes and\r\ndifferential characters, will be investigated.  A forth area is concerned with special \r\ncycles in geometry:  Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds, and associative \r\nand Cayley cycles in G(2) and Spin(7) spaces. These latter subjects relate to gauge\r\nfield theory and gravity in Physics as well as many areas of geometry and\r\nalgebra.\r\n\r\n                               \r\nA concept of central importance in geometry is that of a ``cycle''.\r\nIn algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the simultaneous solution of a\r\nsystem of polynomial equations. In differential geometry   cycles arise in\r\nmany ways: as the large scale solutions of certain differential equations,\r\nand as the level sets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings.\r\nCurves and surfaces in space are simple examples.  This proposal is\r\nconcerned with the study of certain important classes of cycles which arise\r\nin geometry.  Part of the study aims at relating them to fundamental\r\nlarge-scale geometry of the surrounding  space. In the algebraic case this\r\nhas led to the establishment of surprizing and important relationships\r\nbetween spaces of algebraic cycles and fundamental constructions in\r\nalgebraic topology that have led to new insights in both fields.  This work\r\nwill be continued with the intent of obtaining further concrete\r\napplications. A second part of the proposal concerns differential characters,\r\nobjects which mediate between cycles and smooth data. They lead to\r\nimportant geometric invariants and have appeared in discussions of the\r\n``Mirror Symmetry Conjecture'' from modern physics. The proposer has made\r\nsome recent discoveries about characters, including a basic Duality\r\nTheorem. Further development of the theory and its applications is\r\nproposed.   Another area of investigation  is concerned with relations\r\nbetween cycles and geometry which arise from connections.  Connections are\r\nfundamental in mathematics, where they constitute differentiation laws, and\r\nin physics, where they represent the fundamental forces of nature at the\r\nclassical level.  The investigator has developed a theory of singular connections which\r\nencompasses much previously unrelated phenomena and has applications to\r\nmany areas of geometry.  The proposal will continue this work with\r\nemphasis on applications. Yet another area of the proposal is concerned\r\nwith very special cycles in geometry which relate to gauge field theory and\r\ngravity in Physics as well as many areas of geometry and algebra. \r\nThis project will also be concerned with graduate student development.\r\nStudents will be part of the research team.  There will also be an\r\nundergraduate educational effort aimed at fostering mathematical\r\nindependence and developing interactive environments.\r\n",
