 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jackson\r\n0114473\r\n     The investigator uses mechanical models to investigate the\r\nmechanisms involved in tumor encapsulation, multiple lobe\r\nformation, and transcapsular spread.  Mass and momentum balance\r\nequations are written for the normal cells, neoplastic cells, the\r\nextracellular matrix (ECM) on which they are anchored, and the\r\ninterstitial fluid in which they are bathed.  This system is\r\nclosed by suitable constitutive relations for the mass supply,\r\nthe partial stress tensor, and the momentum supply of each\r\nconstituent.  The former is defined on the basis of\r\nphenomenological observations of tumor cell growth and the latter\r\nis based on the mechanical properties of each phase.  The model\r\nequations, consisting of a set nonlinear conservation and\r\nevolution equations, are analyzed using asymptotic analysis,\r\nbifurcation analysis, and perturbation theory in order to\r\nquantify the relative importance of chemical processes (such as\r\nECM production and degradation) and mechanical properties of the\r\ntissue (such as ECM density and stiffness) in influencing capsule\r\nformation.  A further objective is to characterize the\r\nbifurcation that leads to multiple lobe formation.  Through\r\nanalysis and simulation of the model, the investigator aims to\r\ndiscover which factors (mechanical and chemical) determine\r\nsuccessful capsule formation and to quantify their influence.\r\n     The mechanisms by which a tumor becomes encapsulated as a\r\ncontinuum of cells or as several lobes of different sizes,\r\nseparated by connective tissue, is an interesting, important, and\r\nunsolved phenomenon in tumor biology.  In fact, the presence (or\r\nabsence) of a dense capsule surrounding a neoplastic mass is a\r\nmajor determinant of prognosis and the ultimate survival of the\r\nhost.  Despite the importance of capsule formation, little is\r\nknown about the process by which capsules arise.  The\r\nincestigator develops a mathematical modeling framework that\r\ndescribes tumor growth, encapsulation, multiple lobe formation,\r\nand transcapsular spread based on the physical forces and\r\ncellular interactions involved.  The specific aims are to use\r\nmechanical models to assist in understanding i) the role tumor\r\ncell, normal cell, and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions in\r\ncapsule formation, ii) the effects of tumor induced ECM\r\nproduction and degradation on the formation of tumor capsules,\r\niii) the role of tissue properties such as ECM density and\r\nstiffness in slowing or impeding the process of tumor\r\nencapsulation, and iv) the bifurcation that allows a simple\r\nencapsulated continuum of cells to make the transition to a\r\nmulti-nodular form.  There are implications for clinical diagnosis\r\nas well as for prognosis.\r\n\r\n",
