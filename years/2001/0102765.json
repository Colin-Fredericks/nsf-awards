The proposed\r\nmolecular diode and molecular nonvolatile memory can be achieved with carbon\r\nnanotubes functionality and heterostructure of carbon nanotubes with a ferroelectric\r\nlinear polymer.\r\nThe carbon nanotube, itself, has many functional properties, such as quasi-one\r\ndimensionality, metal-semiconductor, mechanical stiffness, capillarity, high aspect ratio,\r\nlarge surface area, and chemical stability. In application of these carbon nanotubes to the\r\nelectronic devices, one serious obstacle is handling the chiarlity, which plays an\r\nimportant role in determining the metallic-semiconducting behavior of the carbon\r\nnanotubes. The proposed research program allows us to overcome these difficulties by\r\nutilizing the carbon nanotubes as a backbone for a diode and a sensor for a nonvolatile\r\nmemory.\r\nFirst of all, the proposed molecular diode consists of the differentially doped\r\nsingle carbon nanotube. This is based on our own research work on the electronic\r\nstructure study of the modified carbon nanotubes by ion-bombardments, alkali metal\r\ndoping, and atomic and molecular gas adsorption. These recent studies show that the\r\ndensity of states near Fermi level, work function, and band gap of the carbon nanotubes\r\ncan be tunable. Therefore, it does not require any junction of two carbon nanotubes with\r\ndifferent chirality to make a molecular diode, which has been suggested in a theoretical\r\ncalculation by growth of a single carbon nanotube with different chiraity. To make a\r\ndiode from a single carbon nanotube in this proposed research program, the half of the\r\ntube will be doped with p-type acceptor (like oxygen or fluorine) and the other half will\r\nbe doped with n-type donors (alkali metals) using screening doping.\r\nSecondly, the proposed molecular nonvolatile memory is a heterostructure of a\r\ncarbon nanotube and a ferroelectric linear polymer with a permanent dipole moment. The\r\ncarbon nanotube has been studied as a gas sensor and a gas-storage. Adsorption of gas on\r\ncarbon nanotube induces the conductivity change and band gap opening. In this proposed\r\ncarbon nanotube-ferroelectric polymer heterostructure, we are going to detect the\r\nconductivity change of the carbon nanotube due to the electric dipole reorientation of the\r\nferrolectric polymer by applying the normal TTL (transistor-tansistor logic) voltage.\r\nTherefore, the carbon nanotube-ferroelectric polymer heterostructure is the combination\r\nof the sensor and information storage. The interface between the carbon nanotube and the\r\nferroelectric polymer, PVDF, of the proposed heterostructure systems is changed from\r\nthe hydrogen or fluorine rich to the hydrogen and fluorine mixture across the\r\nconformational switching from all trans to gauch-trans-gauch bar with variation of\r\ntemperature or applied voltage (a gate voltage). This is the working principle of the\r\nproposed molecular nonvolatile memory.\r\nThrough this proposed program on molecular diode and molecular nonvolatile\r\nmemory, graduate and undergraduate students will be involved and trained in the cutting-\r\nedge research area (an emerging area of nanoscale science and technology, in special\r\nmolecular electronics) of science and technology with advanced synchrotron and\r\nmicrofabrication facilities.\r\n",
