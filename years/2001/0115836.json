 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT for Proposal No. ECS-0115836\r\n\r\nHybrid recording is a new recording paradigm that seeks to overcome\r\nfundamental physical limits of existing magnetic and optical recording\r\ntechnologies. Hybridization combines thermally assisted magnetic writing\r\nwith giant magnetoresistive readback, to circumvent the physical limits\r\nof both magnetic and optical recording. This approach breaks the\r\ncoupling seen in magnetic recording systems among the size of a bit, the\r\nfield required to write it and the length of time for which the\r\ninformation is stable. Thus, magnetic grains in the medium smaller than\r\n10 nm can be stabilized, which is a critical advance for reaching\r\ndensities of 1 terabit/in2 and beyond. These advances will only be\r\npossible, however, if a plausible head design is demonstrated that\r\nintegrates magnetic write poles with a localized source (probably\r\noptical) of thermal energy. An essential insight being pursued for this\r\ntechnology is how to apply magnetic write fields and heat, as well as\r\nperform MR readback with a single packaged device from a single side of\r\nthe disk. It is the goal of this project to design, prototype, and test\r\ndevices suitable for this application. Specific novel devices that will\r\nbe investigated will include two-dimensional mode-index lenses, and\r\nnear-field optical antenna structures. The Data Storage Systems Center\r\n(DSSC) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and GOALI collaborator,\r\nSeagate Technology, has extensive experience in the design and\r\nimplementation of new head designs. The collaboration on head\r\nfabrication will include a program of co-design with Seagate\r\nresearchers, joint wafer fabrication, and post-fabrication modification\r\nof existing heads. It is anticipated that the result of this\r\nacademic-industrial collaboration will be a demonstration of a plausible\r\nintegrated head design for hybrid recording, which will remove an\r\nimportant barrier to the advancement and eventual commercialization of\r\nthis technology.\r\n",
