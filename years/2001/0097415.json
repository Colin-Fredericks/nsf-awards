 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding to support the Research Experience Undergraduates (REU) Site located at a variety of institutions in Charleston, SC. The program, called Minorities in Marine and Environmental Sciences (MIMES), would host six minority undergraduate students to actively participate in twelve weeks of research. Major objectives of MIMES include: 1) involving minority undergraduate students in mentor-guided, independent research projects in marine and environmental science; and 2) providing minority students with role models and training in basic principles of marine and environmental science and scientific theory through seminars, classroom work, laboratory and field experiences. The students prepare written and oral technical reports at the end of the program. The program is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a profession and for training young researchers. This program is well designed to encourage highly motivated students to continue the their pursuit of research careers in oceanography. It includes appropriate mentoring and research experience that will provide students with an excellent background for a future career in science. In addition, minority participation in the field of oceanography is unusually low. This program will encourage a diverse set of students to continue their education in the field of marine science and environmental science. These types of efforts are important to improving participation rates for minority students in the geosciences.",
