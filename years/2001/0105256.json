A sufficiently deep understanding of microlocal \r\nperverse sheaves on flag manifolds should lead to interesting invariants of irreducible representations of reductive \r\nLie groups and, hopefully, in the end, to an understanding \r\nof unipotent representations.  Similar techniques are also \r\nbeing applied to modular representation theory.  The goal of \r\nthe last project is to gain insight in the geometric Langlands conjecture in its various forms. In addition to microlocal \r\ntechniques  the point of view of Whittaker models is used.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental theme of the  project is the interplay \r\nbetween geometry and representation theory.  The idea of \r\nreducing the understanding of various geometries to their \r\ngroups of symmetries goes back to Felix Klein at the end \r\nof the nineteenth century. From this point of view the \r\nbasic objects, the \"atoms\" of the theory, are the \r\nirreducible representations of the group of symmetries \r\nof a given geometry. It turns out that these atoms arise \r\nfrom a particular geometric situation and hence we can \r\napply geometric methods to analyze the properties of the \r\nirreducible representations.  This is the goal of the \r\nfirst part of the the proposal. The second part of the \r\nproject deals with the deep conjectures of Langlands. \r\nHere the geometry in question arises from  an arithmetic \r\nsituation and this brings number theory in the mixture of \r\ngeometry and representation theory.\r\n\r\n",
