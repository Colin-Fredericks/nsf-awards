 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed activity aims to improve the recruitment and retention of women in\r\nengineering academia and to enhance career development of women engineering\r\nacademics by addressing publications in refereed scholarly journals. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop a CD ROM that demystifies the journal publication process.\r\nThe CD ROM will contain both text material and digital video. An overview of how the\r\nsystem works and the differences, both in procedure and in impact, of journal articles,\r\njournal short papers, journal notes, refereed proceedings and book chapters will be\r\ndocumented in clear and general terms. How the editorial board of a journal operates\r\nfrom editor-in-chief down to individual reviewers will be explained with suggestions on\r\nhow to become involved with a journal in an editorial capacity. Then, a set of best\r\npractices case studies that follow engineering papers from first submittal through\r\npublication will be included. These will take the user through the review and revision\r\nprocess step by step and at least one case study will involve a rejected paper that is\r\nsuccessfully transformed for another journal. The video clips will provide comments and\r\ndiscussion by article authors, journal editors and reviewers, using women engineering\r\nacademics where possible. While the focus is on journal papers, this CD ROM will\r\nassist the users in developing other peer reviewed publications including proposals.\r\nDissemination will be in two phases and will be aligned with assessment efforts\r\ninvolving surveys and interviews. This project will benefit a large number of women\r\nacademics and potential academics by addressing an issue vital to scholarly success.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. \r\n",
