We will also \r\nconsider multi-particle systems that share properties with both/\r\nOne unifying thread is that we would like to understand the relation \r\nbetween variational approaches and more geometric ones. \r\nIn particular, we would like to produce proofs of diffusion \r\nthat use geometric and variational methods and to \r\nextend  results in  dynamics obtained by variational methods to partial \r\ndifferential equations. An important tool for \r\ngeometric methods is the theory of normally hyperbolic \r\nmanifolds and we would like to extend it to Partial differential\r\nequations and infinite particle systems.\r\n\r\nSometimes, small  short range causes may have large long term \r\neffects. For example, small periodic  forces may build up large changes in energy. \r\nSome small changes in  the local properties of \r\na material may lead to the emergence of patterns that cover large distances. \r\nIn other situations, however, local effects just average out.\r\nWe would like to device a broad based array of methods (including \r\nnumerical studies and geometric techniques)\r\nthat can be used to decide whether build up or \r\naveraging occurs. We would also like to pay special attention to\r\nsome concrete models appearing in technological applications.\r\n",
