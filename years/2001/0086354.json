 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will train and support graduate students in science and mathematics to provide resources for middle and high school students and teachers. Fellows will participate in workshops that focus on interdisciplinary science and math curriculum and effective teaching. University faculty and K-12 teachers will provide a background in inquiry-based techniques and activities, emphasizing national and state learning standards. Fellows and teachers will form school-based teams that will formally assess the science, mathematics, and technology needs at each site. They will collaborate to compile and present curriculum enhancement mini-units, emphasizing inquiry-based activities. The fellows will also adapt the computer technology available at school sites to the needs of\r\nspecific classrooms. Fellows will provide science resources for students through e-mail communication, an 'Ask-a-Scientist' network, Saturday Science workshops, and collaboration with the Children's Discovery Museum of Central Illinois. University faculty, fellows, and staff members of the Center for Mathematics and Science Education will plan and present professional development programs for classroom teachers. The project will address issues of scientific literacy, equity, and attitudes toward science and math among middle and high school students. It will integrate research and teaching, as well as enhance teaching\r\nand curriculum selection/development skills for all participants through collaboration.\r\n",
