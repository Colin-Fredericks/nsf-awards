 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Cincinnati.  John Alexander is the site's Program Director; Allan Pinhas is the Co-Program Director. Twelve faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will participate in a ten-week program.  Recruitment efforts will be targeted on students east of the Mississippi with particular focus on a dozen HBCUs that regularly produce chemistry majors.  Another recruitment effort will be targeted on the city's nationally known college prep high school, Walnut Hills, which sends a significant number of talented African-American students to colleges in other cities and states.  Women's colleges will also be a recruiting focal point.  Student participants will select from projects in analytical, inorganic, organic and physical chemistry.  Each student will work closely with a faculty mentor on a research problem.  There will be weekly luncheons/seminars for all student participants and faculty mentors.  The program will conclude with a student poster symposium.  Each student will also be required to write a project report. In terms of assessment, a two-page feedback questionnaire will be completed at the end of the program, and there will be follow-up communications during the following academic year.\r\n",
