 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Infrastructure Improvement RII Track-4 grant will explore how ecological communities respond to increased environmental change, with a focus on alpine ecosystems. Global change factors, such as increases in temperature and changes in precipitation represent severe threats to the stability of ecological communities. This is especially true in alpine ecosystems where the climate is changing at a rapid rate with high variability among years in both temperature and precipitation patterns. The project will examine how these global change factors alter ecological communities and their stability through time. The proposed work will yield transformative and sustained benefits in jurisdictional research capacity within Wyoming, positively transforming the career trajectory of the non-tenured investigator. The work will foster a new collaboration between the investigator, a PhD student, and the Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research Network in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The investigator and collaborators will host workshops at Niwot Ridge for Wyoming and Colorado scientists, spearheading cross-state collaborations. Additionally, the project will produce an educational module on data visualization and biological statistics that will be integrated into a newly developed course required for undergraduate biology majors. The module will be disseminated broadly through an open-source publication. \r\n\r\nAnthropogenic global change, such as increases in temperature, more variable precipitation regimes, and nitrogen deposition, have previously been demonstrated to have severe ramifications for species persistence, but how these factors may alter ecological communities, including their synchrony patterns and stability remains an open question. The proposed project will examine the effect of multiple, simultaneous global change drivers on alpine community dynamics and ecosystem stability. It will specifically address the following objectives: (1) determine if global change drivers yield increased synchrony of species\u2019 fluctuations and decreased temporal stability of ecosystems; (2) quantify if locations that have historically experienced higher environmental variability are buffered in their responses to current anthropogenic changes; and (3) build a theoretical model for predicting community synchrony and ecosystem stability that incorporates multiple simultaneous global change factors and species interactions. The project will integrate the investigator\u2019s expertise in ecological modeling with 50 years of alpine community monitoring at Niwot Ridge, including collecting and analyzing community composition data from several ongoing experiments. The investigator and PhD student will additionally conduct a species germination experiment and will create a new dynamical model of species fluctuations and ecosystem stability through time under global change. The model will be coupled with empirical results to create a predictive framework for future community dynamics. This project will enhance our ability to predict how community synchrony and ecosystem stability will change with increasing global change, especially in alpine ecosystems. The project is additionally expected to yield sustained jurisdictional benefits and enhanced research capacity at the interface of ecological theory and alpine ecology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Here, we first combined long-term experimental data from an alpine ecosystem with dynamical mathematical models to examine how the interplay of environmental factors and species interactions (e.g. competition and facilitation between different plant species) alter the synchrony of communities&mdash;or the degree to which species&rsquo; abundances simultaneously fluctuate through time. Our mathematical model suggested that synchrony patterns will change, often becoming less synchronous, with increasing environmental change. Working with the Niwot Ridge Long-term Ecological Research Network, we tested model predictions using community composition data from a long-term experiment that manipulates snowpack, summer temperatures, and nitrogen addition in an alpine moist meadow community. We found that changes in environmental conditions can dramatically alter the network structure of pairwise synchrony between alpine plant species. In particular, the addition of nitrogen and increased winter snowpack caused increased network structure, with stronger pairwise synchrony patterns. In contrast, increased summer warming caused network structures to break apart, with previously strong links disappearing. Critically, these network changes occurred faster than many changes in community composition (e.g. evenness, local species extinctions), suggesting that pairwise synchrony could be used as an early indicator of systems responding to environmental variability. Second, we examined how the combination of multiple environmental factors and biotic interactions alters the potential for range expansion of a subalpine buttercup into the alpine. Using a transplant manipulation experiment, where subalpine individuals were transplanted into the alpine moist meadow experiment and monitored for multiple years, we found that species&rsquo; survival decreased with more variable environmental factors in the absence of plant-plant interactions. However, species interactions with the surrounding alpine community were more facilitative under shifting environments, buffering environmental effects. These facilitative interactions primarily arose with the alpine grasses, sedges, and litter, rather than from forbs. This work yielded sustained benefits in jurisdictional research capacity within Wyoming, fostering a continued collaboration between the PI, a PhD student, and the Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research Network in Colorado. The project provided training for a PhD student and 3 undergraduate students in alpine ecology, modeling, and data science.
