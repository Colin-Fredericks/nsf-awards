 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are becoming widespread, and come with great promise: instead of centralized financial institutions that act as middlemen for money transfers, blockchains offer a decentralized ledger, in which transactions occur directly between its participants. Such transactions can range from simple transfers between peers to complex contracts with various conditions. These are written as computer programs that are called \"smart contracts.\" The potential of smart contracts and blockchains on the world economy is huge; however, they also carry many risks. The direct impact smart contracts have on actual assets requires a high level of assurance before this technology can be widely accepted and trusted. Verification methods for traditional software fall short in verifying smart contracts, and hence there is a pressing need to adapt these methods and develop new techniques in order to be able to verify the correctness and safety of smart contracts.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the challenge by developing algorithms capable of reasoning about smart contracts, and implementing them as part of state of the art automated reasoning tools. The project has three main objectives: first, developing algorithms for reasoning about nested datatypes and sequences, which are useful for modeling the execution of smart contracts within a blockchain, as well as for their combination with more traditional data structures; second, using these algorithms for reasoning about real-world smart contracts and collecting and developing challenge benchmarks from them; and third, automatically producing proofs for the verification results of smart contracts, which can either be checked independently or incorporated into proof assistants. Given the current limitations of traditional verification methods and the rapid growth of smart contracts and blockchains, this project intends to increase trust in this technology, which in turn can enable it to fulfill its potential.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In particular, we improved several SMT solvers with capabilities that are suited for these applications, specifically: reasoning about finite fields, reasoning about sequences, and reasoning about large bit-vectors.\r\n\n\nFor finite fields, we built a new solver for finite fields in the cvc5 SMT solver. We showed that outperforms previous techniques by orders of magnitude.\r\n\n\nFor sequences, we developed a new solver for sequences in cvc5. We developed a new algorithm and proved its correctness and showed that its implementation improved performance on benchmarks from smart contract verification.\r\n\n\nFor large bitvectors, we developed a new technique in the bitwuzla SMT solver and showed that it outperforms previous techniques, again by orders of magnitude, on benchmarks coming from smart contract verification.\r\n\n\nWe also obtained new theoretical results on the foundations of \"theory combination,\" an important concept that allows SMT solvers to reason flexibly and generally about many different concepts at the same time. Our results shed light on what is and is not possible and where improvements in efficiency are possible with theory combination.\r\n\n\nWe also produced an SMT tutorial for beginners that is available both as a published paper and online.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/24/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ClarkBarrett\n"
