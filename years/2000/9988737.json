 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nThe area of analysis called geometric measure theory (GMT) was formally\r\nintroduced in the nineteen sixties, when the book ``Geometric Measure\r\nTheory'' by H. Federer was published. Since the beginning of the century a\r\nlarge amount of relevant work had been done in this area by many authors\r\nincluding Besicovitch, Carath\\'eodory, De Giorgi, Federer himself,\r\nFleming, Marstrand, Morrey, Reifenberg, and Whitney. However it was only\r\nwhen Federer's book was published that it became clear how all these\r\nresults fit naturally together as a cohesive subject. Unfortunately since\r\nits introduction the subject has been perceived as somewhat mysterious and\r\ninaccessible. In this proposal the investigator exploits one of the\r\noutstanding features of the field, its versatility. The PI intends to\r\napply techniques of GMT to study free boundary regularity problems, to\r\nanswer questions regarding the existence of good parameterizations for\r\ncertain metric spaces and to classify sets supporting ``Lebesgue-type''\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFree boundary problems arise naturally in physics and engineering. The\r\nfree boundary may appear as the interface between a fluid and the air, or\r\nwater and ice. In the filtration problem, which studies how water\r\nfiltrates from a dam made of a porous medium (say earth), the free\r\nboundary separates the wet part from the dry part. The problem of\r\ncharacterizing the regularity of the free boundary has been studied by\r\nmany authors, among others Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman. In this proposal\r\nthe investigator addresses this question under very weak free boundary\r\nassumptions. By relaxing the regularity hypothesis a broader spectrum of\r\nphysical problems can be covered.  The investigator also proposes to study\r\nthe structure of sets supporting measures that behave like Lesbegue\r\nmeasure on an affine space. In the context of weak notions of regularity,\r\nthese sets play the role of tangent planes.  In particular the problem of\r\nclassifying these sets is of primary importance. The ideas discussed here\r\nbelong to a larger project that intends to establish that weak notions of\r\nregularity are for many purposes sufficient to answer basic questions in\r\nanalysis and geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
