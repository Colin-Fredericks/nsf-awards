 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Northern California Rural Systemic Initiative (NCRSI) is a systemic change\r\neffort undertaken by a consortium of universities, school districts, parents, students,\r\nnonprofit organizations, government agencies and businesses that addresses the\r\nbarriers to adequate science, mathematics and technology education in rural Northern\r\nCalifornia. Grounded in the belief that effective uses of new technologies to enhance\r\nstudent learning require new pedagogical skills and curricular content, the consortium\r\nseeks to transform mathematics and science education by introducing comprehensive\r\nchanges in pedagogy including instruction and curriculum. NCRSI consists of the\r\nfollowing three core elements:\r\n\r\n1. An in-depth self-study of Modoc and Siskiyou counties including the collection of\r\nbase-line data on mathematics, science and technology instruction;\r\n\r\n2. An innovative preservice and inservice teacher and administrator preparation\r\nmodel, Guiding Partners, which incorporates mathematics, science, technology\r\nTraining and development of constructivist based pedagogy skills centered\r\nAround a concept of project facilitation - the pedagogy will be modeled by\r\nConsortium staff developers and university faculty as they teach it to classroom\r\nTeachers who will practice it with students in K-12 fieldwork;\r\n\r\n3. Development of a five year implementation plan based upon the in-depth study of\r\nMathematics, science and technology instruction - the plan will include specific,\r\nMeasurable outcomes, timelines, and designate responsibilities.\r\n\r\n",
