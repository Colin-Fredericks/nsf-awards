 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves conventional endoscopes that have limited field-of-view (FOV). They observe objects through a relatively small solid angle subtended in front of the distal end of the scope.  Although various prisms can be used in the optical design to change the viewing direction, a wide FOV observation can not be achieved without adjusting the optical system, employing moving parts, or turning the endoscope itself.  Furthermore, the panoramic view can not be acquired simultaneously. \r\nFor many medical diagnosis instrument (gastroscope, cystoscope, colonscope,etc.) and industrial inspections (pipe inspection, turbine engine diagnosis, surveillance, autonomous navigation, security, robotics, video conferencing, etc), simultaneously acquired image in all directions around the sensor system can provide invaluable visual information and a leapfrog advance in the performance of these systems.  The primary \r\nobjective of the SBIR effort proposed herein is to investigate the feasibility of a novel endoscope design, dubbed as the 'Omniscope', based on the omnidirectional imaging technique recently developed by Genex Technologies, Inc.  The proposed design allows an ultra wide viewing angle (360 degree) and simultaneous observing capability, therefore can greatly increase the efficiency, accuracy, and patient's comfort in diagnosis and treatment.  The Omniscope technique will also provide a unique tool for documentation, \r\nsurgery planning, and training.  Due to its simple structural and optical design, the Omniscope can be fabricated inexpensively and will be reliable in practical field usage environment.\r\n",
