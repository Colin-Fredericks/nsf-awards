 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses devices that have become sufficiently small that they approach the scale at which their dynamics must be described by quantum mechanics. The quantum-mechanical nature of nanoscale systems brings both problems in the form of quantum noise and fluctuations, and opportunities in the form of novel methods for control and information processing. This proposal focuses on one of the most promising of opportunities for nanoscale modeling and simulation: quantum simulation by quantum computers. Quantum computers are devices that process information in a way that preserves quantum coherence. Prototype quantum computers have been realized experimentally and larger `second-generation' quantum computers are currently being constructed. Quantum computers are uniquely suited for performing nanoscale simulations.\r\n\r\nNanoscale systems, though small, consist of many parts. The interaction between those parts is governed by quantum mechanics. The difficulty of simulating such systems on a classical computer increases exponentially with the number of parts. In 1982, however, Feynman noted that a quantum computer might be able to perform quantum simulations much more efficiently, so that the difficulty of simulation increases only linearly with the number of parts. In 1996, the PI of this proposal showed how Feynman's proposal could be put into practice. In 1998, the co-PI demonstrated the power of quantum simulation experimentally by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to construct a special-purpose quantum simulator capable of performing simulations far too difficult for any classical computer.\r\n\r\nThe proposed NSF research program will construct, program, and operate quantum simulators. Quantum simulators are essentially `analog' quantum computers that are programmed to mimic the behavior of another quantum system. In the first stage of the research program, quantum simulations will be performed on existing liquid-state NMR quantum computers and on special purpose solid-state devices. In the second stage, general-purpose, large-scale simulations will be performed on the large-scale, solid-state,\r\nNMR quantum computers being constructed at MIT with separate (non-NSF) funding. These simulations will investigate the properties of chemical and physical systems, ranging from molecules to bulk spin systems, concentrating on issues of information propagation and processing, including examining quantum mechanisms for entropy production, decoherence, and chaos. In addition to generating algorithms for simulating such phenomena, the program will develop methods for using dynamic quantum models\r\nto manipulate and control nanoscale quantum systems.\r\n",
