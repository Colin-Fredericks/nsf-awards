The problem is how to organize the\r\npages in a broadcast from a server to a large client population in the\r\ndissemination of information.  A strongly related problem is how to\r\nreplicate (or cache) the broadcast data in the mobile units that receive\r\nthe broadcast.  Our research involves the study of the problems of\r\nbroadcast and replication in a peer-to-peer rather than client-server\r\narchitectures.  These architectures are motivated by new types of emerging\r\nwireless broadcast networks where receiving nodes may be disconnected,\r\nturned off or out of power, and messages may be corrupted.  Further,\r\nreliable broadcasting by acknowledgment and retransmission may not be\r\njustified due to increases in communication costs.  The postdoctoral\r\nassociate will explore fundamental principles of peer-to-peer broadcast\r\nreplication: when to broadcast, what to broadcast, and the cost functions\r\nto measure the efficiency of a given replication approach.  Various\r\nbroadcast replication algorithms will be compared analytically and\r\nexperimentally and the associate will 1) design and analyze various\r\nbroadcast replication algorithms, and 2) design and conduct experiments to\r\ncompare these algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
