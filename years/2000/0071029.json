 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments will be conducted to test Newtons law of gravitation at\r\ninter-mass separations of less than one centimeter.  For separations\r\nbetween one centimeter and one tenth of a millimeter, the experiments\r\nwill be sensitive enough to detect gravity and to test for deviations\r\nfrom Newtons inverse-square law.  For smaller separations the\r\nexperiments could detect proposed new short-range forces stronger than\r\ngravity but still many orders of magnitude weaker than other known\r\nforces. The investigators will first complete on-going experiments with\r\nan existing room temperature apparatus, and then construct a new\r\ncryogenic instrument with greater sensitivity.  A planar tungsten\r\ntorsional oscillator is used as the sensitive force detector.  There is\r\ncurrently intense interest among theoretical physicists in the\r\npossibility that there may exist new feeble forces at length scales\r\nbelow one centimeter.  String theory, which seeks to encompass all\r\nknown physics including gravitation, generally predicts light fields\r\ncalled moduli.  When these acquire mass through certain mechanisms,\r\nthey may mediate forces with a range of about one millimeter.\r\nDetecting such forces would provide dramatic evidence for string\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nTheorists have also proposed that there may exist several new compact\r\nspatial dimensions beyond the usual three, and that gravity is weak\r\nbecause it is able to spread out in the extra dimensions.  When the\r\nnumber of extra dimensions is two, this view leads to large deviations\r\nfrom Newtons law of gravitation at about one millimeter.  Experimental\r\nevidence of the predicted deviations would be a dramatic step forward\r\nfor our understanding of fundamental physics.\r\n",
