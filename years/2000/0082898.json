 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last decade, researchers in our Scientific Visualization Group at Stanfor University\r\nhave been developing general data analysis techniques for vector and tensor fields\r\nbased on rigorous mathematical approaches. The work has systematically explored direct\r\nvisualizations and feature extractions of both vector and tensor fields in two and three\r\ndimensions using computers. Recently, we have been developing the next stage of our\r\nvisualization efforts: automated atad comparisons.\r\n\r\nTraditional techniques for vector field comparison fall into three basic categories: image,\r\ndata, and feature based comparison. In most instances, comparisons are made visually,\r\nnot automatically. In addition, there are fundamental limitations with these existing comparison\r\ntechniques. Image base comparisons suffer from difficulty in representing datasets\r\nbeyond two-dimensional vector fields, data based comparisons suffer from grid alignment\r\nproblems, and feature base comparisons, while providing excellent location of specific features,\r\nmay not show all the global information in the field.\r\n\r\nOur new approach to this problem is essentially a feature-based comparison technique,\r\nwith the important stipulation that our features attempt to represent the topological structure\r\nof the field. This ensures that we do not overlook any important structures in the\r\nfield. Our paradigm is to analytically study vector and tensor fields to extract topologically\r\ncritical information, transfer this knowledge into effective computer programs, and then to\r\nvisualize the fields using the results of our analysis.\r\n\r\nWe have successfully implemented our ideas for two-dimensional vector fields and for\r\nthree-dimensional vector fields. We now intend to study tensor fields associated with white\r\nmatter brain functions.\r\n\r\nOur fundamental technique for the comparison of vector and tensord ata would be\r\napplicable to almost every field of science and engineering, ranging from the magnetic field of\r\nthe sun to airflow over a wing. In addition, time varying fields can be studied by comparing\r\na field at a fixed time with its state at later times. Our approach is unique in the field of\r\nscientific visualization because it is based on rigorous mathematical analysis, and it is the\r\nonly approach available to quantitatively study NMR tensor brain data. Our methodology\r\nin the analysis of tensor and vector datasets allows better design of air vehicles, better\r\nunderstanding of electromagnetic problems, and provides substantial time savings when\r\ndealing with large experimental datasets. Quantitative understanding of white matter brain\r\nfunctions has the potential to open up a whole new area of medical research.",
