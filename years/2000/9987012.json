 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is designed to increase the number of students, especially women and minorities, who successfully graduate from engineering or computer technology associate degree programs at these two partnering institutions. The two colleges are partnering to provide scholarship assistance and other support services to students who have the academic and professional abilities to successfully complete an associate degree program, but who lack the financial resources to enroll full time. This project addresses the local and state-wise need for more engineering and computer technology graduates to support manufacturing industries in remaining competitive in the global marketplace. The primary target audience of the Scholars' Initiative is the pool of Pell-eligible students who are currently enrolled part time in degree programs but who lack the financial resources to enroll full time. A marketing campaign will also promote the scholarship program to local industries and to all incoming students at the partner colleges. An interview component of the evaluation process will provide important information regarding the effectiveness of scholarship programs in increasing retention and degree completion rates among low-income students.",
