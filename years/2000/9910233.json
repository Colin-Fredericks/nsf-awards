 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John Ellis, Chemistry Department, University of Minnesota, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for research into highly reduced complexes of the early transition metals and the lanthanides. The goal of the project is to develop reagents that function as storable sources of \"naked\" metal atoms or highly unsaturated organometallic groups. Prior results demonstrate that bis- and tris(polyarene) metal species can be conveniently produced by reactions of naphthalene and anthracene radical anions with early transition metal halides. These complexes are of special interest since they provide the first available \"naked\" metal anion reagents of the early transition metals. In this research the scope of early transition and lanthanide metal polyarene chemistry will be assessed. Special interest will be paid to the development of distinctly new isocyanide, nitrosyl, carbonyl, and dinitrogen metal chemistry. The project will contribute to the training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates in very demanding experimental chemistry.\r\n\r\nTransition metals and their compounds are often unique mediators or catalysts in many significant chemical reactions. This project will develop new strategies for the synthesis of compounds containing transition and lanthanide metals in unusual or unprecedented environments that resemble those that are present in effective mediators and catalysts. One specific objective will be compounds that can provide highly reactive metal atoms. These \"naked\" metal atom reagents will be examined as catalysts and reactants with industrially important feedstocks such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen, hydrogen, and a variety of related substances. New, novel transformations that may contribute to the improvement of industrial processes are anticipated.  \r\n",
