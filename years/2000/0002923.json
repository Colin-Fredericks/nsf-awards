This investigation includes experimental and analytical work. The funds requested are to purchase a 110-k actuator needed to perform the experimental work. The Structural-testing laboratory at Drexel University houses a newly built test bed and reaction wall, which was built from funds, provided by NSF in 1992. A two channel static and dynamic MTS loading system is available in the laboratory, which was partially funded by NSF in 1984. For efficient testing, an 110,000 lbs. Actuator is needed. It is to be noted that acquiring this medium load actuator will significantly improve our ability to perform static and dynamic testing.",
