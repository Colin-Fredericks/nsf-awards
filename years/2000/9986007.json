 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental problem in developmental biology concerns the mechanism by which\r\nthe maternal program regulates early embryogenesis.  Recent studies have\r\ndemonstrated that several maternal factors such as Tcf-3, VegT, and Xenopus\r\nnuclear factor 7 (xnf7), a gene that we are studying, play important roles in\r\nthe specification, patterning,  and differentiation of the embryonic germ\r\nlayers.  The effect of these maternal factors is evident at the late\r\nblastula-early gastrula stage by the region specific activation of zygotic gene\r\nexpression such that the embryo is divided into a variety of subdomains.  The\r\nmost dorsal region forms the Spemann organizer which expresses a large variety\r\nof transcription and secreted factors. These are expressed in overlapping\r\ndomains that  divide the organizer into the head and trunk organizer regions. In\r\naddition specific groups of genes are expressed in the ventral region.  One of\r\nthe key problems is to understand the mechanism by which the maternal genetic\r\nprogram regulates the pattern of expression of both the organizer and ventral\r\nspecific genes.  Based on our recent data from this laboratory we hypothesize\r\nthat xnf7 is one of several important maternal factors responsible for the\r\nglobal patterning of the embryo into dorsal/ventral domains and for patterning\r\nof the organizer in the dorsal most aspect.  Our goal during this next grant\r\nperiod is to further define the precise mechanisms and molecular pathway through\r\nwhich xnf7 functions and to use xnf7 as a tool to gain insights into the general\r\nmechanisms of embryonic patterning and the specifics of how the organizer forms\r\nand is patterned. This will be accomplished by identifying potential xnf7 target\r\ngenes;  identifying nuclear partners of xnf7; and determining the role of xnf7\r\nin patterning endoderm and ectoderm.\r\n\r\n",
