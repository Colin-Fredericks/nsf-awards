The emphasis will be on the dsDNA tailed bacterial phages phi29 and T4 and the ssDNA icosahedral bacterial Microviridae phiX174 and alpha3.  The objectives will be to determine not only the structures, but also the molecular mechanisms by which the assembly intermediates, including the DNA packaging process, are stabilized and then triggered for the subsequent steps in the viral morphogenesis. Similarly, the structural intermediates of viral disassembly during cellular infection will be examined.  Cryo-EM will be used to determine the low resolution structures of the major assembly intermediates, the mature virus, and the DNA-emptied virus of phi29. \r\nX-ray crystallography will be used to determine the structures of most, if not all, of the 9 gene products that are required for the formation of the mature virus. This will allow the fitting of individual atomic resolution structures into the lower resolution EM densities.  X-ray diffraction is being used to study components of the T4 phage baseplate.  This baseplate, to which both the long and short tail fibers are attached, undergoes major conformational changes that initiate the recognition of cell surface receptors, the tail contraction, and the expulsion of the DNA from the viral head into the host cell.  The available knowledge of the overall structure of this phage and its baseplate will be extended by cryo-EM.  X-ray diffraction had been used earlier to study the mature phiX174 particle and an empty procapsid assembly byproduct.  However, cryo-EM had to be used to capture the unstable, true procapsid assembly precursor. Currently, these studies are being repeated with the homologous phage alpha3.  It is suspected that chimeric viruses of phiX174 and alpha3 may stabilize some of the assembly intermediates to permit crystallographic studies.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the structural studies of viruses is to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral assembly and disassembly on cell infection.  The assembly of a macromolecular structure proceeds along an ordered pathway and is accomplished by the switching of proteins between discrete conformations as they are added to the nascent assembly.  Scaffolding proteins often play a catalytic role in the assembly process, rather like molecular chaperones. X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy techniques will be used to analyze the assembly and disassembly processes.\r\n",
