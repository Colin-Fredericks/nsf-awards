 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Dr. Software, LLC, will prototype a next- generation structural simulation environment, providing an advance in the way that concepts are taught and learned in undergraduate and graduate-level structural engineering and architectural education.  Real-time analysis and visualization will be seamlessly integrated with multimedia content to provide a rich environment for presenting and exploring concepts of structural behavior.  In terms of existing technologies, this project will bridge the gap between advanced analysis tools, which are designed to provide numerical/ visual results but limited educational content and context, and multimedia environments, which typically are designed to provide rich context but generally offer limited analysis capabilities.  The research will build on an existing simulation environment in which users can manipulate and modify models and simultaneously visualize behavior in real-time.  One portion of the proposed research will produce an appealing 3D simulation environment.  Based on Dr. Software's experience with developing and using multimedia-based instructional tools, a second aspect of the research will implement capabilities for scripting model manipulations in conjunction with embedded text, images, and time-based media to provide context for the modeling.  The total result will be an environment in which structural concepts can be presented in a 'live' context, allowing a rich combination of open-ended exploration and guided study and presentation.\r\n\r\nDr. Software proffers technology that will be useful beyond the targeted audience. The user interface and embedded multimedia content can be modified to target other, larger audiences, including professional engineers (civil, aerospace, and mechanical) and architects. Indeed, it is also an appropriate vehicle for introducing engineering concepts to the general public.",
