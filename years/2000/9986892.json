 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis institution's Divisions of Student Affairs, Mathematics and Technologies, and Student Financial Assistance have joined together to enhance educational opportunities for low-income, academically talented students. College faculty and Alumni Relations Office will work with local high school counselors to identify potential candidates who are incoming students and full-time students attending computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology or mathematics courses (CSEMS). Candidates will be drawn from among the incoming freshman, currently enrolled students, and graduates from certificate programs. Outreach, recruitment, and selection activities will be timed so that students receive announcements of their financial award prior to the start of the semester. The Office of Student Financial Assistance with work with the Office of Enrollment Management to develop a candidate pool of potential scholarship recipients. A team composed of the Dean of Mathematics and Technologies (PI), the Dean of Students (co-PI) and three faculty chairs from CSEMS disciplines will form the Selection Committee and will interview the candidates from the recommended list. Final selection will be based on a consensus of the 30 candidates who can receive maximum benefit from an NSF scholarship award. The Selection Committee will consider such factors as commitment to a career in the CSEMS field, academic ability, barriers affecting educational progress, and the potential to enhance diversity (to the extent permitted by law) within the CSEMS field.\r\n\r\nInstitutional cooperation will help to promote student satisfaction and foster academic excellence and retention. Student development faculty will work closely with students to help with educational and career planning, and other issues affecting personal and academic goals. In addition to making full use of the College's programs, services and personnel, students will benefit from participation in a \"Student Success Club,\" on-campus work experience as tutors of other CSEMS students, transfer assistance, and the close ties the College has with local business and industry. CSEMS faculty will help students learn to apply classroom knowledge in the workplace setting through internship opportunities..\r\n\r\nThis project, entitled NSF Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Related Technologies Scholarship Program, will enhance institutional efforts to make higher education accessible to all. Because nearly half of the nation's college students are enrolled in community colleges, and many attend part-time so that they can work to pay for their education, the financial assistance available through this project can have a significant effect on student retention, graduation and transfer rates.\r\n\r\n",
