This proposal specifically addresses the logistics and arrangements for a NEON management planning workshop that will be 2-4 May 2000 at the Santa Fe Institute. Participants will review how the NEON observatories will provide a state-of-the-art infrastructure to support interdisciplinary, integrated research and allow scientist to conduct comprehensive, continental-scale experiments on ecological systems. Specific components of management of individual observatories, network-level management needs, and interactions between the network and NSF will be discussed. In addition, the group will discuss evaluation of the NEON by NSF and external sources. This proposal outlines the details of the workshop program, travel arrangements for participants, food services, and lodging. A workshop report will be posted on the NEON website (http://www.sdsc.edu/NEON) maintained by the San Diego Supercomputer Center within two months of the workshop.\r\n",
