 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle goal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Mathematics program at California State University San Bernardino is to provide promising undergraduate math majors with a meaningful, exciting and challenging experience in mathematical research.  Eight undergraduate mathematics students will be recruited from universities and colleges within the Southeren California region, with special emphasis on students from groups that are underrepresented in mathematics.  During the eight-week residential program students will carry out guided independent and collaborative research.  Participants will first study background material as a large group and then break into two groups of four, for further study in either combinatorics or not theory.  Each participant will choose, in consultation with one of the directors of the program, a problem withing their focus area to investigate.  At the end of the program, students will submit research papers based on their work, and will present their results at a program closing seminar.",
