 "awd_abstract_narration": "0001354   Watts  The objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms of manganese oxide-catalyzed Fenton-like reactions and the conditions under which these reactions occur.  Preliminary results have shown that manganese oxide catalysts may produce reductants with as low as 0.0006 M (20 mg/L) hydrogen peroxide, one thousand times less than the concentration required in iron-catalyzed systems, potentially providing a more stoichiometrically efficient and economical system for the enhanced desorption and transformation of organic contaminants generated by industry and present at contaminated sites.  Specific objectives of the research include investigating process conditions that promote the generation of reductants in manganese oxide-catalyzed Fenton-like reactions; identifying the reductant species; investigating contaminant transformation pathways and potential for mineralization; and evaluating the generation of transient oxygen species from soil-catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and their ability to desorb contaminants from soils and sludges.  The results of this research are expected to provide more effective and economical processes for the displacement and treatment of industrial contaminants from sludges and soils, promoting effective pollution prevention through volume reduction of process water and sludges and cleanup of source areas at contaminated sites.***",
