 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues organize a workshop to\r\nexplore opportunities in robotics for synergistic collaborations\r\namong engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians.  The\r\nworkshop brings together engineers, computer scientists, and\r\nmathematicians to discuss examples of research needs in robotics,\r\nto look for common themes, and to explore new ideas, rooted in\r\nmathematics, that could advance this area.  A major product of the\r\nworkshop is a report that summarizes the present state of the art\r\nand that lays out future opportunities for collaborative\r\nresearch.\r\n     Robotics is concerned with the design of mechanical\r\nmanipulators, the systems needed to control them, and various\r\napplications such as materials handling, assembly, exploration in\r\nextreme environments, prosthetics, and minimally invasive\r\nsurgery.  For their solution, problems in robotics have drawn\r\nheavily on techniques and ideas from engineering and computer\r\nscience.  It is becoming apparent that progress on significant\r\nopen problems requires greater involvement of modern mathematics.\r\nThis workshop combines engineers, computer scientists, and\r\nmathematicians in a joint exploration of needs and opportunities\r\nin robotics.  The workshop report is expected to stimulate both\r\nnew interactions among researchers and new insights and\r\napproaches to this important class of problems.",
