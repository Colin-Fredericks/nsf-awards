 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with quantum mechanical properties of condensed matter as exhibited by two-dimensional electron gas systems in compound semiconductor materials. Two- and the lower-dimensional electron systems manifest some of the most fundamental many-body quantum physics of strongly correlated electrons, such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects and the associated one-dimensional edge states, Wigner crystallization, and the single particle tunneling phenomena in quantum dots and antidots. The properties of the collective ground states of  two-dimensional electrons and the size-quantized systems of few electrons, their excitations, chiral edge state dynamics, and the quantum phase transitions will be studied experimentally at very low temperatures and very high magnetic fields via the techniques of magnetotransport, thermal activation, nonlinear transport, tunneling, resonant and single particle tunneling. The results will be of great interest in the formulation and confirmation of advanced many-body quantum theory. The experimental techniques developed in the study of the semiconductor heterostructure samples have an impact on technology via realization of new electronic devices whose fabrication and operation is based on similar materials and techniques. This research project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students who will be excellently trained to enter positions in industry, government and education.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research project is concerned with the quantum mechanical properties of condensed matter probed via the simple and well characterized system of two-dimensional (2D) electrons.  One- and zero-D samples are made using modern semiconductor fabrication techniques.  Two- and the lower-D electron systems exhibit behavior such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects and the associated 1D edge states, and the single particle quantum tunneling in 0D quantum dots and antidots. The properties of these electron systems and their dynamics will be studied experimentally at very low temperatures and very high magnetic fields.
