The WAIS program has successfully focused a broad cross-section of the Antarctic research community on two urgent global issues: future sea level and rapid climate changes.  WAIS is multidisciplinary and the requested support is to foster continued cross-disciplinary interaction.  WAIS workshops began in 1990-first to formulate the objectives of WAIS and, beginning in 1992, to exchange and present scientific findings in a forum where cross-disciplinary scientific discourse was promoted and progress toward WAIS goals could be annually assessed.  The funds provided here are to support future WAIS workshops by assisting in the notification, organization and execution of the annual WAIS workshops for the next three years.  In addition, the funds will be used to further enhance these workshops by offering travel stipends to attract new participants deemed by the WAIS working group to be key persons in further enhancing the WAIS program.\r\n",
