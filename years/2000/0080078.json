During the two summers, students will conduct both independent and collaborative research in conservation biology with an organization or agency. Student research activities will be complemented by academic year seminar courses in conservation biology and scientific methodology, and workshops in academic and professional development. The program will encourage students to publish their results in scholarly journals and to present their research at professional meetings. The program will focus on recruiting, training, and supporting students traditionally underrepresented in conservation biology.\r\n\r\nConservation biology is a mixture of basic and applied research. The next generation of conservation biologists must be trained to bridge the gap between academics and real world application. This program will provide students such valuable training and experience while advancing the discipline, allowing scientists to make informed decisions regarding the management of organisms and landscapes. By immersing students in a community of peers, academicians, and practitioners of conservation biology; by supporting their personal and professional development; and by creating a culturally sensitive context for their experience; the program will strive to increase student chances of success in pursuit of advanced education and careers in conservation biology.\r\n",
