 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software Engineering (34)  This project adapts materials from six exemplary university programs along with an integrated suite of CASE and collaboration tools to the Hiram College environment. At Hiram College software engineering is distributed over several courses taken by both traditional computer science majors and weekend college computer systems management majors and minors (adult learners). It will directly affect approximately 50 undergraduate students per year.\r\n\r\nThe project creates a software engineering laboratory, consisting of PCs outfitted with state-of-the-art CASE and implementation software, along with collaboration tools, an instructors' station and server containing projects at various stages of their life cycle, and projection and collaboration tools to allow both local and remote group work. With the laboratory configuration, the lifetime of a single project, as in the real world, extends beyond the boundaries of a single course, or even an academic year.\r\n\r\nAfter two years, Hiram College has committed to maintaining the laboratory and sustaining the project. With growing interest in both traditional and weekend programs offered by the computer science department, they expect 75 - 100 students per year to benefit from the facility in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
