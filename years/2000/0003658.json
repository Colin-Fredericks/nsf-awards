At least four distinct stocks have been identified by genetic analysis, and satellite tagging has shown that the migratory paths of some stocks link Canadian, American, and Russian waters. Belugas are an important subsistence species for many communities in Alaska and Canada, and are taken opportunistically in Chukotka. While recent studies have expanded our understanding of beluga ecology, many questions remain. For example, are there separate stocks of belugas that remain in Russian waters? Which North American stocks migrate to Russian waters and when? To answer these questions and to promote scientific cooperation throughout the region, especially with Russia, a workshop will be held in November 2000 with participants from Russia, Canada, and the United States. This effort is expected to lead to greater interaction among beluga scientists and indigenous experts in the region, and to a better understanding of the ecology of this important arctic species.\r\n",
