The study  of such operators has a long history and has led to much progress  in operator theory and complex analysis. For instance the  unilateral shift, which is modelled by multiplication by z on the  Hardy space of the unit disc, has been used to enhance our  knowledge of contraction operators. Other classes of operators  characterized by operator inequalities may be studied using  operators modelled by multiplication by z on other Hilbert spaces  of analytic functions. Such spaces have associated with them  evaluation functionals called reproducing kernels, and there is an  intimate connection between properties of such a kernel and  properties of the multiplication operators on the corresponding  space. An important classical example where this correspondence  has been exploited is Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation. Recent work of  several researchers has extended the applicability of the ideas  behind Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation and introduced other types of  inequalities on operators and reproducing kernels that seem to be  very fruitful. Richter and Sundberg will investigate the connection  between operator inequalities, reproducing kernels, and the  structure of the lattice of invariant subspaces of multiplication  operators.   \r\n\r\nThe proposed work involves ideas and problems from several areas  of pure and applied mathematics. Operator Theory, which may be  thought of as an infinite dimensional version of linear algebra, grew  out of ideas used to study certain partial differential equations  arising in physics in the 1800's, and became increasingly important  with the advent of Quantum Mechanics in the twentieth century.  Complex Analysis is a subject with a long and distinguished  history, and remains a very active and broad area of research.  These two areas have had a very fruitful interaction throughout this  century, owing to the fact that some interesting and useful  operators can be modelled by natural operations on spaces of  analytic functions. At least since the 1960's it has been realized  that a series of related results concerning certain of these  operators are of importance in the study of Control Theory, an area  of importance in electrical engineering and other practical  applications. Among these results are the Beurling-Lax Theorem   on invariant subspaces, the Nevanlinna-Pick Interpolation Theorem,  and its close relative the Commutant Lifting Theorem. Work by a  number of researchers since the 1980's has shown that the circle  of ideas concerned with these results are applicable to a much  wider class of objects than had previously been realized. This has  resulted in a much improved understanding of the underlying  mathematical systems   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
