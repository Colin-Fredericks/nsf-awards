 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strategic Control of Time-Sharing Performance\r\n\r\nTime-sharing or dividing attention among multiple tasks is an\r\nimportant component of many activities such as driving and\r\npiloting.  But time-sharing performance is often observed to\r\ndegrade from single-task performance level.  A better\r\nunderstanding of the capability and limitations of time-sharing\r\nis germane to the understanding of the nature of attention.  It\r\nis also most useful for designing and evaluating many daily\r\nactivities and many occupational tasks such as maintaining\r\naircraft stability while navigating in the cockpit.  For example,\r\nthe risk of motor vehicle collision was found to be four times\r\nhigher when using a cellular telephone than when not regardless\r\nof whether hand operations were involved.  This implicated a\r\ncentral limitation.  The proposed research aims at a better\r\nunderstanding of the strategic control of time-sharing.\r\n\r\nTwo major theoretical views on the nature of the limitations of\r\ntime-sharing are examined.  Bottleneck theory hypothesizes that\r\nattention acts as a bottleneck along the information processing\r\nsystem, necessitating multiple tasks to be processed\r\nsequentially.  Resource theory hypothesizes a finite amount of\r\nattention that is allocated among the time-shared tasks such that\r\nwhen performance of one task improves due to increased priority,\r\nthe other is likely to degrade.  Traditionally, the psychological\r\nrefractory period (PRP) paradigm has been used almost exclusively\r\nto test bottleneck theory and the relative-priority manipulation\r\nhas been used to test resource theory.  The proposed research\r\nwill examine the extent to which the divergent conclusions drawn\r\nfrom these tests are constrained by the methodologies used.\r\nConverging evidence from a combination of the two paradigms\r\nshould lead to a deeper understanding of the nature of attention\r\nand its effects on performance.  The results should add to an\r\nalready rather rich dual-task database.  The proposed converging\r\noperations and methodological refinements should provide a new\r\nand powerful arena for further understanding of the attentional\r\nmechanism.  This understanding has profound implications on\r\nactivities that are as mundane as calling home while driving or\r\nas complex as landing a packed 747 in severe weather.\r\n\r\n",
