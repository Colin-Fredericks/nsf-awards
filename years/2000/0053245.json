The ATEEC project is structured around the following goals and objectives:\r\n\r\n Goal 1: Strengthen science, math and technical curriculum, and instructional materials supporting advanced technology environmental education. Objectives include producing, updating, and revising environmental technology resources, assessment instruments, a \"best practices\" manual, training and curriculum models, and environmental technology core knowledge and skill list; identifying secondary and community college faculty support needs; and conducting the annual Fellows Institute for secondary and community college teachers.\r\n\r\n Goal 2: Strengthen the nation's environmental technician programs through professional development opportunities. Objectives include participating in or conducting annual professional development instructor conferences, a national conference with a \r\nprofessional association of environmental technology practitioners, a national \"Defining Environmental Technology Forum\", and a national satellite/on-line teleconference; and developing a national model for business/industry/education faculty internships. \r\n \r\n Goal 3: Strengthen education through support services for program improvement.\r\nObjectives include acting as a clearinghouse and resource center to evaluate and disseminate \"best practice\" instructional materials, activities, and products; updating and revising the environmental technology defining chart and report; and expanding the use of the national electronic job database. This project is directly impacting hundreds of environmental educators and improving the education of thousands of students throughout the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
