The PI recently reported that\r\nbasidiomes (mushrooms) of this fungus can be a genetic mosaic (Fungal\r\nGenetics and Biology, 2000, vol. 29).  This was demonstrated by isolating\r\nten cells from a single basidiome and genotyping each for six different\r\nnuclear loci.  Nine different genotypes were recovered for the ten cells\r\nthat were assayed, indicating that this basidiome was a genetic mosaic.\r\nFifteen cells isolated from another basidiome of the same species produced\r\nonly one genotype when analyzed for the same six loci, indicating that this\r\nbasidiome was not a genetic mosaic, at least for these six loci.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this NSF POWRE-supported study is to better understand the\r\nphenomenon of genetic mosaicism in A. gallica's life cycle and the\r\ncontribution mosaicism makes to this species' ability to function\r\nsuccessfully in forest soils.  To accomplish this, the PI will investigate\r\n(1) How common and geographically widespread genetic mosaicism is, (2) How\r\nthe mosaic condition develops, and (3) How mosaicism affects the ability of\r\nA. gallica to infect plant hosts and to grow under ecologically variable\r\nconditions. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
