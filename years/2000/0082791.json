The proposed system\r\nuses advanced simulation and information technology methods to create an\r\ninquiry environment, fostering cooperative interactions and knowledge\r\nco-creation while students work together to solve curriculum-based problems\r\nand challenges.  The technical basis of such an inquiry environment is a\r\nmetacomputing system combining distributed discrete event simulations,\r\ninformation and operational databases, graphical control interfaces, and\r\nvisualization.  While much of the system can be built from familiar pieces,\r\nthe focus on education provides a number of interesting opportunities for\r\nnew research in computing and metacomputing strategies.\r\n\r\nThe general area of user-directed simulations is viewed as a particular\r\narea in which High Performance Computing (HPC) can become a true enabling\r\ntechnology for substantive educational reform.  The proposed work will plan\r\nthe exploration, development, and extension of HPC technologies for K-12\r\neducation.  This work relies on strong partnerships in cognitive science\r\nand education to ensure that the technology features and capabilities are\r\nmatched to objectives within progressive models of knowledge and learning.\r\nThe K-12 simulation framework that could result from this work may be\r\nregarded as a first step in the larger task of matching HPC capabilities to\r\ncontemporary cognitive science and educational research, enabling\r\nsubstantive advances in learning.\r\n",
