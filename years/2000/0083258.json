The resulting optical force microscope will be used to study polymer-induced forces at solid-liquid interfaces and to develop techniques for measuring dynamic compliance of polymer layers. The requested additions will enhance the capability of the basic instrument so that a number of related problems, such as mechanical response of oil-surfactant-water interfaces and fluorescent microscopy on single polymer chains, can be studied.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this grant is to incorporate a device for \"optical manipulation\" of small particles in a microscope. A tightly focused laser beam trained on a small particle allows one to manipulate and move the particle using the forces generated by the light beam. The combination of such a \"laser tweezer\" with a scanning optical microscope allows one to use the optically held particle as a \"probe\" to study local interactions on a surface. The laser beam holding the particle behaves like an invisible spring on the particle, and the stiffness of this \"spring\" can be changed easily by adjusting the laser power. Therefore, the optically held probe allows one to study very soft surfaces such as polymer chains on a surface or a liquid/liquid interface. This opens up new ways to study the mechanical and dynamic properties of polymer layers, single polymer chains, surfactants at interfaces, and the like. The implications of such phenomena extend to a number of important problems in engineering and the sciences, such as stability of biological and pharmaceutical dispersions, polymer compatibility with biomedical surfaces, and environmental separation processes involving particulates.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
