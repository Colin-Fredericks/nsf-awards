 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Satellite Communications for LeArning (SCOLA) is a Nebraska non-profit organization, which provides real-time foreign news, cultural, and video language programs via satellite to the United States federal government and many teaching institutions (SCOLA viewership was estimated at 15 million in 1999). This project will build on the existing success of SCOLA programs by establishing an advanced multimedia platform to broadcast real-time learning and cultural video materials over Internet2.  A superior test-bed to research video transmissions over next generation Internet, will be provided by:  (1) creating a leading national center; (2) developing useful practical applications; (3) expanding research, teaching, and outreach opportunities state-wide and nationally; (4) developing unique multimedia courses and laboratory experiences; (5) supporting and enhancing the work of SCOLA, and (6) fostering rapid dissemination of information for learning, collaboration, and research.  The research problems are well defined and include:  multicast routing and quality of service (QoS), transport protocol needed for reliable multicasting, and potential scalability of reliable multicasting.  The project provides for the creation of video databases.  Multicast routing and its QoS extension will be studied, as well as, reliable multicast transport protocols, scalable fair reliable multicast, and security in multicast.  The research aspect focuses on finding a good solution to the integration of routing and resource reservation.  Its success will further the understanding in the field.  The move towards an Internet2-based SCOLA system offers an advanced, real-time multimedia delivery, and the potential to integrate a variety of data types, and support many audiences; while the Internet2-based SCOLA and its connectivity to the Tel Laboratory will advance research in multicast protocol definition, security, and reliability uses. \r\n",
