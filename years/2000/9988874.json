 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is in algebraic geometry, covering basic questions in birational geometry related to the areas of Mori theory, moduli of curves, geometric invariant theory, and toric geometry.  The first main question is the classical problem of whether or not the moduli space of curves is uniruled.  This is a very natural question for Mori theory, which was indeed invented to study uniruledness questions, but somewhat surprisingly no serious attempt from this direction has yet been made --perhaps because the main work in the area was done before the invention of Mori theory.  The applicant believes Mori theory gives important new insights, and supports this with many concrete examples.  The second proposed direction is on foundational work in birational geometry. The applicant, together with Yi Hu, has observed a foundational connection between Mori theory and geometric invariant theory.  They define Mori Dream Spaces abstractly as spaces with the best possible Mori theoretic properties.  There turn out to be many examples. They associate to any variety a natural ring, which they call the Cox ring, and show that Mori dream spaces are characterized by the finite generation of this ring, and moreover, are in a natural way a quotient of the associated affine variety in a way generalizing Cox's construction of toric varietie`s as quotients of affine space. There are two main proposed directions for further research.  One is to study the expected interplay between commutative algebraic properties of the Cox ring and the geometry of the variety.  The other is a foundational factorization problem for birational maps between smooth toric varieties, which would significantly strengthen Morelli's factorization theorem.  The final proposed direction is on Mori theory in positive characteristic.  The vast majority of work in Mori theory is based on vanishing theorems which restrict it to characteristic zero.  The theory would have myriad arithmetic applications (e.g. the construction of higher dimensional Neron models) if it could be extended to positive characteristic.  The applicant has a significant result in this direction (by methods entirely different from preceding work).  There is a natural way in which this result might vastly generalize, and the applicant has a partial result in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe main questions the investigator considers are among the oldest problems in algebraic geometry, each actively studied at least since the twenties.  As the investigator indicates, new ideas from Mori theory (named after its Field's medal winning inventor) suggest new and promising approaches to these problems.  This is particularly true of several foundational questions about the moduli space of curves, one of the most studied objects in mathematics and, more recently, theoretical physics. \r\n\r\n",
