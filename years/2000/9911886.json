To accomplish this task a twelve-module instructional development manual based upon exemplary materials will be developed.  This manual would then be used as the basis for providing content and pedagogical enhancement for 130 teachers of exemplary status and one faculty member drawn from the two- and four-year colleges across the state.  The first five teams would use the first three modules to the same five groups of 26 persons.  The next summer would be a repeat using modules 7-9 for the first session and 10-12 for the second so that the 130 teachers would have all twelve modules in hand.  The final project year would have the ten three-person teams at ten sites each providing the professional development to 26 new teachers for a total of 260 in year three.  The total number of teachers directly affected by the project becomes 410 high school teachers and 10 college faculty.  Each two teams would operate in one of the five (5) congressional districts and be coordinated by the five Intermediate Service Districts of the Mississippi Department of Education.",
