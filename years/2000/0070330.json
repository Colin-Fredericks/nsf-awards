Strassmann\r\nRice University\r\nAn Automated DNA Sequencer for Microsatellite Genotyping of Social Insects and Sequencing in Molecular Biology\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSocial insects like the bee or the ant provide one of the chief model systems for studying the evolution of cooperation and conflict.  Understanding the evolution of such traits requires estimates of relatedness between individuals and estimates of who reproduces how much.  The ideal tool for making these estimates is an automated DNA sequencer.  An automated sequencer makes it possible to study new mutations in genes and to characterize those genes.  In addition, genotyping individuals in the society makes it possible to understand the dynamics of genes in families and in populations.   Automated approaches to sequencing and genotyping are much faster and more accurate than the manual methods they replace.\r\n\r\n\tWith support from the National Science Foundation, an ABI 377 automated DNA sequencer with upgrades and software will be purchased.  Peripheral equipment essential to the efficient operation of the sequencer including a spectrophotometer, a centrifuge, and a gel loader will also be purchased.\r\n\r\n\tThe acquisition of an automated sequencer will be beneficial at a number of levels.  It will give students at Rice hands-on training on an important piece of equipment for understanding genetics and its applications.  Students will more easily enter advanced programs and positions in genetics from biotechnology companies to basic research institutions.  In addition, the sequencer will be used to understanding what makes a better artificial hemoglobin, the key component in artificial blood.  Finally, the sequencer will be used to understanding the dynamics of DNA microsatellites that are implicated in an important class of neurological diseases.  \r\n\r\n",
