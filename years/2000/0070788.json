 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is for a 3-day conference at the Royal Academy of Sciences, Amsterdam in September, 2000 on the topic of \"Eye movements and vision in natural tasks\". The findings of research over the past few years have shown that even apparently simple behaviors, such as looking, reaching, or remembering the contents of a visual scene, are done differently and often better when performed under conditions designed to re-create the demands of natural tasks. The goal of this conference is to bring together researchers who are doing the most innovative work in understanding eye movements and vision under demanding, natural conditions. Natural conditions can be established by allowing freedom of head motion, by providing richly-structured 3-dimensional visual scenes, and by studying eye movements used to accomplish purposeful cognitive or motor tasks. The participants will be charged with the task of both presenting their latest original findings and outlining a vision for the future in a forum that will promote discussion and debate.",
