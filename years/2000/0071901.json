 "awd_abstract_narration": "The optical characteristics of fractal/microcavity composites will be investigated in this project.  The composites are formed from nanometer-size metal fractal aggregates of approximate size 1.8 micrometers, embedded in a dielectric cavity of characteristic size several hundred micrometers  in diameter. A variety of nonlinear emissions from the composites will be investigated including lasing, multiphoton absorption, and hyper-Raman scattering.  Previous experiments have shown that the spectral emissions from these systems exhibit enormous enhancement factors (defined as the ratio of the optical intensity with and without the presence of the composite), which can be greater than 10*15 and, for certain special cases, greater than 10*21. Students will participate in this research.  They will thereby acquire skills and knowledge that prepares them for future employment in industry, government or academe.\r\n%%%\r\nA device capable of increasing the intensity of a light signal, i.e., an optical amplifier, will have many uses in science and technology. This project concerns the study of the optical properties of a remarkable class of optical materials, so-called fractal/microcavity composites, which amplify light by enormous factors. Each of the two components contributes to the amplification. In the composite these contributions combine multiplicatively so that the resulting amplification can be truly enormous.  In previous experiments amplification factors in excess of 1 quadrillion (1 followed by 15 zeroes) were observed. The ultimate amplification of light signals is expected to be even greater and it is towards this end that the studies supported by this grant are undertaken.  This research will engage the participation of students who will thereby acquire skills and knowledge in preparation for advanced studies and employment in industry, government laboratories, and academe.\r\n***\r\n",
