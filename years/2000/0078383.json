 "awd_abstract_narration": "0078383\r\nGopal\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will investigate the use of\r\nredox catalyst electrodes for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide through electrochemical\r\nregeneration of the redox catalyst.  In the Phase I research, catalysts were developed and\r\ntheir short-term stability for peroxide synthesis was successfully demonstrated. Flow cell\r\noperation with 10 cm2 electrode cells showed the preparation of hydrogen peroxide in\r\nacidic condition (1N H2SO4) at 60% current efficiency and up to 2% in peroxide\r\nconcentration.  However, Phase I work indicated poor catalytic current with oxygen for\r\nthese redox systems, as well as an upper limit for hydrogen peroxide concentration (2%).\r\nPhase II research effort will be directed towards improving the catalytic effect of these\r\nredox catalysts through changes in preparative procedures, electrode structure, and\r\nfabrication technique. The electrodes will be tested and optimized for peroxide synthesis\r\nusing oxygen/air and almost pure water (pH adjusted, if necessary) using flow cell\r\nexperiments.  The electrodes will be tested for long-tem stability (500 hours).  Larger\r\nelectrodes (100cm2 ) will be fabricated using the best composite electrode for long-term\r\nstability testing and process optimization. Commercialization of the process will be\r\ncarried out with a Phase III partner upon the successful completion of Phase II work.\r\nPotential Commercial Application of the Research \r\n     Hydrogen peroxide is a clean oxidant, which reacts to form water as its reaction product.\r\nIt is therefore environmentally acceptable in many industries.  The market for hydrogen\r\nperoxide is expected to grow by almost 10% for the next few years.  New technology\r\n(synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from water and air) described in this Phase II proposal\r\ncould be implemented for various applications.  These areas include wastewater treatment, on-site generation (for industrial and consumer application such laundry bleach etc.), as well as commercial peroxide production.\r\n",
