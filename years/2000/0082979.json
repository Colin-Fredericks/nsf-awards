 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an inter-disciplinary research team in bio-molecular data management and computing to develop database support and numerical algorithms for bioscientists to retrieve and interpret data efficiently and to simulate important biological processes on high performance parallel computers.  It will create a database query system, a Genetic Query language, which will allow biological researchers to successfully extract individually formatted information from multiple disparate databases in which bio and genomic information is currently located.  The work will incorporate bioscientists, computer scientists, and mathematicians to accomplish the following goals.\r\n Identify genome-centric database research issues and develop database support in the form of interconnecting disparate genomic databases on the Internet and facilitate intelligent retrieval of data using novel query languages.\r\nDevelop an easy-to-use one-step query browser, which will provide a unified view of various genomic databases on the World Wide Web.\r\nDevelop efficient and scalable solution algorithms based on multiscale analysis and domain decomposition for modeling and simulating important biological processes described by systems of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, and implement these algorithms on multiprocessor parallel computers using novel dynamic scheduling and load balancing strategies for large scale computations.\r\nThe project also suggests a mechanism for allowing researchers to query heterogeneous distributed databases for genetic information without many of the current impediments and develops scalable methods for domain decomposition that would allow efficient use of multiprocessor computer systems for modeling large-scale biological processes.  In addition, educational activities in computational biology would be enhanced through development of new course materials, involvement of undergraduate students in research projects, and the conduct of summer student workshops.  Participation of members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering will be encouraged and facilitated in each of these activities. \r\n",
