The Ewing is a 230 ft. vessel, constructed in 1983 and was modified in 1990, and is owned by NSF and operated by CU-LDEO.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 267 operational days during 2000, of which all days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The projects scheduled on the Ewing represent several oceanographic disciplines, mainly MG&G, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel.  Operations will begin in the Pacific:  Lyttelton, New Zealand; Papua, New Guinea; and then the Pacific Coast off of Central America.  The Ewing will then transit through the Panama Canal to New Foundland to conduct a two ship operation with the R/V Oceanus, and to the Florida coast.  During the period from October-December, the vessel will be in lay-up to commence Phase I of a mid-life refit.\r\n\r\nThe Ewing is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
