Hong, Pusan University, Korea.  The proposed research aims to collaborate in the study of theoretical issues related to nuclear matter at extremely high density.  \r\n\r\nThis area of research is relevant to neutron star physics as well as the experimental program at heavy ion colliders such as RHIC (Brookhaven National Lab) and LHC (CERN).  Their expertise is in the application of theoretical tools such as the renormalization group, effective field theory and Schwinger-Dyson equations to problems in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  One of the primary interests is the phenomenon of color superconductivity in quark matter, which is similar in some aspects to ordinary superconductivity in metals.\r\n\r\nThis project will be performed in conjunction with Professor Hong at Pusan University, Korea under the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program.   This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\r\n",
