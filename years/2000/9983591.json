 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a series of low-temperature topotactic synthetic strategies.  It will focus on (1) topotactic strategies to induce mixed valency in a variety of compounds, such as the perovskites, with ion exchangeable cations that can be made mixed valent or have their valency further manipulated by topotactic methods; (2) the assembly of known compounds of metal-anion arrays within perovskite hosts; (3) the synthesis of new host materials such as layered perovskites designed to exploit the proposed strategies; and (4) the development of new synthetic strategies.\r\n%%%\r\nThe development of novel synthetic routes is important to the discovery of new classes of layered materials with superior properties that have impact on everyday activities in diverse areas such as health, energy, environment, and electronic and communications.  Furthermore, this area of fundamental science is an ideal training ground for educating future scientists and engineers.\r\n***\t\t\r\n",
