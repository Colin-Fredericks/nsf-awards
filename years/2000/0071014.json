 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project is developing and testing a virtual laboratory via the Internet to enhance the comprehension of the interdisciplinary nature of machine tool building and maintenance technology, to reduce costs by maximizing the adaptiveness of the curriculum, to enhance learning efficiency in a multimedia and multi-intelligence approach (Gardner,1993), and to improve laboratory safety with minimized environmental hazards. A coalition of a two-year college, a four-year university, a community-based technology center, professional associations, and partners from the multimedia software and machine tool industry are working together on the project. The expected outcomes are three simulation modules, each targeting a particular aspect of machine tool building and maintenance technologies that will supplement and complement the existing machine technology curriculum in the nation's two-year associate degree programs. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive and independent evaluation is being conducted prior to national dissemination via both the Internet and CD-ROM to two-year colleges, high schools and other community based training centers throughout the nation. Pre- and post-tests are being used to evaluate the effect of the proposed multimedia modules on students' attitudes and learning. A diverse cohort of two-year college students, including women and minorities, are participating in the field tests as control and test groups. \r\n\r\nA national workshop is being developed to help faculty members learn how to use the modules and to develop \"customized\" modules for themselves. \r\n",
