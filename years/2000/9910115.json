The researchers will be undertaking a study on the control and actions of prolactin in teleost fishes.  Prolactin (PRL) is known to have effects on electrolyte balance, growth and development, reproduction, metabolism, behavior, and the immune system.  Fish present excellent models for the study of action of PRL and the control of PRL release.  Identifying and characterizing prolactin-releasing peptides (PRPs) from four phylogenetically diverse fish species are the scientific goals of this proposal.  This will involve:  1) the effect of PRPs on salinity adaptation;  2) the effect of environmental salinity on the expression of PRP mRNA and on circulating PRP and PRL levels;  3) the interaction of PRPs with other factors that influence PRO release; and  4) the mechanism(s) through which PRPs stimulate PRL release.  The four fish to be studied are the tilapia, carp, eel and mudskipper.\r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  The results of the experiments should significantly advance the understanding of PRL release in fish and provide insights into PRL release in vertebrate species in general.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of postdoc and graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals\r\n",
