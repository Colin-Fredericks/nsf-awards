 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years it has become clear that all animals share common molecular mechanisms by which they are able to detect chemicals in their environment.  Insects, like many animals, use olfaction (smell) to sense changes in their surroundings which in turn influence several characteristic behaviors.  One important example of an insect behavior that is largely controlled by olfaction is the preference for human blood meals displayed by several species of mosquitoes some of which are responsible for the transmission of diseases such as encephalitis and malaria.   \r\nOur work is concerned with the study of the genetic basis for this olfactory driven preference in mosquitoes.  To carry out this project we propose to identify and characterize a set of genes from the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae that encode proteins that act as odorant receptors.  Such receptors act to recognize and specifically bind particular olfactory cues as a necessary first step in the mosquito's ability to sense and respond to these chemicals.  We will use molecular techniques to look for mosquito genes that are closely related to previously identified odorant receptors that have recently been identified in a highly studied model insect, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster.  Once candidate genes for these receptors have been isolated they will be tested to see if they are expressed in correct antennal cells of the mosquito that are known to be responsible for olfaction in this insect. \r\nBy successfully identifying odorant receptors from mosquitoes we hope to be able to better understand the processes by which this insect is able to sense its surroundings initiate the behaviors that ultimately results in the choice of what type of animal to bite.  We also expect that these studies will eventually lead to a better understanding of what signals these insects respond to (which may lead to the development of new and powerful insect repellents) as well as a better appreciation of the events that have lead to the evolution of blood feeding preference among insects in general. \r\n\r\n",
