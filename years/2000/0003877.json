 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tAs the fifth in a series of symposia focusing on the relationship between learning and brain function, this symposium will now focus on the myths and realities which have emerged from recent research data.  \r\n\r\n\tDuring the Decade of the Brain, researchers produced significant amounts of new information about the practical application of findings in neuroscience, as reported in newspapers, magazines, and books by a variety of authors.  The question is, How much of this information is accurate:  Who is interpreting it?  Why?  We have learned more about the brain during the last 20-30 years than in all of human history.  It is now time for the experts to debate the myths and realities associated with learning and the brain research findings.  The purpose of this symposium is to present a program in which learning will occur in a public forum among educators, scientists, parents, artists, health professionals, cultural anthropologists, students, and the general public.  Through the exploration of the many related issues, the audience will have the opportunity to consider and integrate the material for practical use in daily life and, particularly for the education of children.  Lectures and panel discussions will be designed for specialists and students alike.  A post-symposium publicaton is planned, as are additional outcome-related news media stories.\r\n",
