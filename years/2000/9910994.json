Broman (University of Wisconsin) \r\n\"Science and Civil Society:  Historical Perspectives\"\r\n\r\nThis award supports a two-day, workshop-style conference devoted to \"Science and Civil Society: Historical Perspectives,\" to be held April 14-15, 2000, at the University of Wisconsin Madison. The aim of this conference is to explore the varieties of relationships formed between science and civil society, at both the conceptual and institutional levels, since the late seventeenth century. By bringing together scholars with different national perspectives and historiographic traditions to confront what we mean by \"science\" and \"civil society,\" and to examine how these entities have interacted in historically specific cases, we expect this conference to move us toward a broader understanding of the place of science in the construction of the modern world. The conference will serve as the basis for the 2002 issue of the History of Science Society's annual volume Osiris, the proposal for which has already been accepted.\r\n",
