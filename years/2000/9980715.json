 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99); Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\nUndergraduates do not have a course supported by electronic curricula materials that: teaches the concepts of mathematics, what mathematics is really about, rather than the technical skills in manipulating equations, and shows its relationship to scientific applications. The objective of this project is to develop such a course and electronic curricula that support a diversity of learning and teaching methods and styles. The electronic materials include: videotapes, HTML lecture notes, hypertext textbook and discovery interactive Java applets and spreadsheet exercises. These materials are making it possible for other instructors to teach this new interdisciplinary course, and units from the course are being used as supplements to existing mathematics and science courses. Student learning is being evaluated by the use of homework assignments, questionnaires, group interviews, concept mapping, and student journals. Activities: Preliminary versions of the course and electronic materials have been developed. The electronic materials are being further developed, refined, and fully integrated into a teacher-friendly package for dissemination. Some units are being developed into stand alone units for other courses. These materials are being used in courses at 2-year and 4-year colleges. A faculty advisory committee is reviewing the student assessments of the course and materials and suggesting modifications of the materials. Special Audiences: This project targets students studying to be pre-college teachers and non-science majors who do have not an appreciation of the substance or role of mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
