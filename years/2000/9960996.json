 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research project will test the feasibility of a stand-alone computer device for use by students and others who are blind or visually impaired.  This device will incorporate a 'single board computer' that consists of a Pentium-class microprocessor, audio system and connectors for all standard computer peripherals, an internal hard disk drive and a rechargeable battery.  The operating system will be Windows 98.  Instead of a video display and a mouse, this Talking Tactile Computer will rely on a built in touch-sensitive surface to which a variety of vacuum-thermoformed raised-line and textured tactile graphic overlays will be mounted.  All of this apparatus will be housed in a single compact and portable enclosure.  No additional equipment or external wiring will be required.  It is expected that the device will be competitively priced as compared with standard notebook computers, because it does not include a video display.  A blind or visually impaired student will use the device, accompanying tactile materials and associated programs to run interactive, multimedia computer applications.  The system is being developed in tandem with a proposed research project to create a semester-long curriculum for College Calculus by Drs. Albert Blank and Michael Kress of the College of Staten Island.  For the purpose of the Phase I SBIR test-of-concept, Touch Graphics will adapt a series of tactile plates, from a unit on coordinate geometry already created by Dr. Blank, to the new device described above.\r\n\r\nThe device and accompanying tactile graphic materials and CD ROM-based programs will be marketed to schools, libraries, community and residential centers, businesses with visually impaired employees, and to individuals.  This single product is intended to be adaptable, through the publication of additional software titles by Touch Graphics, to a broad range of user groups, including students; technical, professional and office workers; senior citizens with declining visual acuity; and others.  With minor modifications, the device could be adapted for fixed-position kiosk applications in public places, like shopping malls and transit hubs.\r\n",
