 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with methods to prepare longer peptides and small proteins, where a major deficiency appears in the application of current methods to the coupling steps.  An ancillary concern are protective groups for such amino acid residues as histidine and arginine, particularly where shelf-stability is concerned.  Attention will be directed toward new arginine protective groups that do not release cationic species during acidic deprotection steps.  Coupling strategies include the discovery of reagents that are compatible with solution as well as solid phase peptide synthesis.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Synthesis Program supports the research of Professor Louis A. Carpino of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  Professor Carpino explores ways to combine relatively small groups of amino acids into larger assemblages known as peptides and proteins.  These have profound implications in the area of biotechnology, but their synthesis is often quite difficult.  With the continued growth in the demand for peptides to probe biological research questions, these studies are of practical significance.\r\n",
