 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key aspect of biochemical research involves the definition of the interactions of complex biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, in solutions that represent their native environments in living cells.  To this end, this award will establish a multi-user facility with state-of-the-art instrumentation for the study of complex macromolecular biological systems.  Researchers who will use this facility are working at the interface between chemistry and biology at MIT.  The new instrumentation will afford powerful new capabilities to probe the structure, dynamics, and interactions of complex biomolecules and therefore to derive valuable information concerning complex biological systems.  This information will then form the foundation for working hypotheses for understanding the function of these systems at the molecular level.\r\n\r\n     The specific instrumentation that will be purchased includes a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and MicroCal Inc. VP isothermal and differential scanning calorimeters.   The analytical ultracentrifuge provides a powerful method for the rapid and accurate determination of association behavior of complex macromolecules and the determination of molecular weight and shape. The acquisition of an XL-I instrument with UV and RI detection capabilities allows the study of diverse macromolecules over a broad concentration range.  The calorimeters are exceptionally sensitive and powerful tools for studying the heat generated or absorbed in diverse biochemical processes.  Calorimetry is particularly valuable in the study of complex biomolecules because it permits the assessment of molecular interactions and conformational energetics using native materials.\r\n\r\n     The new instrumentation will greatly advance the training and scientific development of the many researchers in the groups of five primary and nine secondary users.  These groups are involved in the training of approximately 90 graduate students and 55 postdoctoral associates.   The researchers in these groups work in a variety of disciplines at the interface of chemistry and biology. Seven visiting scientists are associated with the groups of the users and there is excellent synergy amongst many of the groups.   The facility will be housed in newly renovated space on the MIT campus and will be strategically placed to best serve the groups with research interests at the chemistry/biology interface.  The facility is part of a major renovation project that will have a significant impact on interdisciplinary research at MIT.\r\n",
