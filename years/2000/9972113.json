There are strong interactions with theoretical groups. This provides a means of testing theoretical models and numerical simulations specific to the thin film magnetics area. Phenomena of interest include novel magnetic anisotropy mechanisms resulting from low dimensionally, epitaxy-related films stress and broken transnational symmetry, oscillatory interlayer magnetic couplings, interactions between magnetic structures and flux vortices in magnet/superconductor thin film interfaces. The research involves photoelectron spectroscopy, high-speed Kerr polarimetry, and a range of characterization methods. A particular strength of the project is the ability to study the speed with which magnetic domains relax, or change their state of polarization. This provides fundamental information about magnetic switching times, an area of great technological as well as fundamental interest. The program contributes to regional scientific/technological infrastructure through training of students and through significant additions to the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD). \r\n%%%\r\nThis is an experimental solid state physics project dealing with thin film magnetism. The research involves (1) static magnetic phenomena, (2) dynamic magnetic phenomena, and (3) coupled topological defects in magnetic/superconducting films. The thin film structures and magnetic phenomena in this project are echoed in magnetic structures found in computer hard discs, read heads, and other magnetic structures. The interest in this work is on fundamental parameters that can be experimentally obtained and compared with theoretical models and simulations.
