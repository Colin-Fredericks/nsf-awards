 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThere has not been widespread development and implementation of interdisciplinary programs for non-science majors.  The central goal of this project is to promote collaboration between teachers of mathematics and earth and environmental science, and encourage partial or comprehensive curricular revision linking these disciplines.  One reason for the absence of such course materials in colleges and high schools is that few appropriate classroom-ready resources have been available, particularly in environmental mathematics.  This project is addressing this need by generating resources that are modular, flexible, and easy to implement in diverse educational settings.  \r\n\r\nThis project is creating a series of classroom exercises designed to investigate topics in environmental and earth science using introductory college mathematics.  These educational materials draw heavily on real world data, promote student investigation and collaboration, and make use of existing classroom technologies.  The project is designing a website with links to data sets for approximately 15 environmental science and 15 mathematics topics.  Each data set is packaged with background information and a short description of its utility for classroom use.  Each data set will be made available in a variety of formats to promote maximum accessibility by the community of users through different technologies.  The website also offers a \"forum\" devoted to sharing ideas and teaching methods related to these resources.  \r\n\r\nThe materials are being assessed by site testers in community colleges, high schools, and four-year colleges.  The project will be evaluated based on student learning gains.  In particular, the project will assess the impact on female students.  The project will conclude with a workshop for the site testers.  The workshop will focus on developing strategies for broad scale dissemination and implementation of these learning resources.",
