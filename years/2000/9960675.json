 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the concentration of aqueous process streams that is common in the food and pharmaceutical industry.  When the product activity is sensitive to temperatures above room temperature, process such as freeze-drying are employed.  Osmotic Distillation (OD) is a candidate for a lower cost method for concentration of a higher quality product, but has not been developed for the application partly because of potential failure due to penetration of the microporous membrane structure by the solution to be concentrated. The suitability of a new porous/nonporous membrane will be demonstrated for use of OD in fruit juice concentration.  The nonporous nature will avoid the failure mode described above.  The membrane is based on novel high water permeability polymers.  The high chemical and thermal resistance of this polymer will allow common sterilization methods to be used. This study will produce suitable modules of nonporous and porous membranes, investigate the relative efficiency of each in concentrating a model solution, and demonstrate their relative tendencies to 'wet out', or fail due to fouling of the membrane by process streams.\r\n\r\nThis lower cost process, if successful, can have an immediate impact in the preparation of fruit juice concentrate and pharmaceutical products without activity loss.\r\n",
