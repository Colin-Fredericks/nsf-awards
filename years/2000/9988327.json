 "awd_abstract_narration": "As real-time computer application systems become larger and more complex, it is becoming imperative that such applications be implemented on multi-processor platforms rather than on uniprocessor ones.  Furthermore it is often the case that the implementation platforms are not completely homogeneous, but are comprised of several different kinds of processors and other resources.  This project will different kinds of processors and other resources.  This project will study both the fundamental scheduling-theoretic questions, and the pragmatic implementation issues, that arise when periodic task systems are to be implemented on such heterogeneous multi-resource platforms.  This research will build upon previous research, performed by both investigators, on fair scheduling in real-time system.  The theoretical findings resulting from this research will be validated by applying them to some implementation projects currently under development at the University of North Carolina.",
