 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to conduct a study of wavelet\r\nrepresentations for complex surfaces and volumes with the goal of\r\ndemonstrating their potential for 3D scientific and engineering computing\r\napplications.  Multiresolution techniques recently described in the computer\r\ngraphics literature will be extended to develop high performance algorithms\r\nand implementations for simulating the partial differential equations of\r\ncommon physical processes on general three-dimensional domains, including\r\npotential problems, scattering problems and problems in elasticity.\r\nEmphasis is placed on unifying the mathematical analysis and\r\nsignal-processing perspectives of wavelets, as this provides new insights\r\nfor the large-scale simulation of a wide range of problems.\r\n\r\nThe research consists of two interrelated thrusts.  The first develops the\r\nmathematical foundations, including surface and volume wavelet constructions\r\nfor PDEs, practical discretization strategies for linear and nonlinear PDEs,\r\nmatrix compression, preconditioner design, adaptive refinement, accuracy\r\nestimates and error control strategies.  The second thrust focuses on the\r\npractical issues of algorithm and data structure design, robust\r\nimplementation for large-scale problems involving complex geometry,\r\nparallelization, and the interpretation and visualization of output aided by\r\nthe multiresolution representation.  This will result in a suite of\r\nmultiresolution techniques and tools that provide (i) researchers with a\r\ncontext for conducting domain-specific studies (ii) engineers with\r\napplication libraries for simulating large-scale real world problems and\r\n(iii) students and professionals with an environment for learning about\r\nwavelet theory and applications.\r\n\r\nThe educational objectives of this project are closely linked to the\r\nresearch program.  The continuing development of a course on wavelets and\r\nfilter banks will enable the dissemination of fundamental knowledge on\r\nmultiresolution techniques and it will serve as a conduit for the\r\nintegration of research experience into the curriculum.  Additional courses\r\nare oriented toward issues of computation and information technology more\r\ngenerally within the graduate and undergraduate engineering curriculum.  The\r\nintegration of educational and research activities will be facilitated by\r\nseminars, short courses, and new and continuing collaborations with industry\r\nand other institutions.\r\n",
