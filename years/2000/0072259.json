 "awd_abstract_narration": "An International Conference, \"Homogenization and Materials Science\", in\r\nhonor of the late Professor Ulrich Hornung of Bundeswehr University Munich,\r\nGermany, will take place at the University of Akron, Akron, Ohio, during\r\nSeptember 15 - 17, 2000.  The purpose of this interdisciplinary conference\r\nis to bring together researchers from interacting areas of Materials\r\nScience.  In particular special focus will be paid to the latest scientific\r\nand industrial developments concerning homogenization theory and methods.\r\nHomogenization is a powerful mathematical tool for solving, both static (effective\r\nproperties) and dynamic (wave propagation, transport equations) problems in\r\ninhomogeneous materials with periodic and random microstructure. This\r\nincludes prediction of mechanical and dielectrical properties of\r\ncomposites, shape memory materials,  materials undergoing phase\r\ntransitions, and polymeric composites. Solutions of these problems provide\r\nguidance in the design of new materials possessing the specific properties \r\nrequired by modern technological needs. The conference shall address both \r\nmodeling and computational aspects of these problems. This conference will bring\r\ntogether the leading scientists from Europe and the U.S. who are working on\r\nhomogenization problems and applications in materials science.\r\n\r\nModern electronic and mechanical devices require materials with specific\r\nproperties in their design.  For example, the automotive industry seeks\r\nlightweight yet very strong materials.  Such materials do not necessarily\r\noccur naturally.  Hence, these materials must be engineered from existing\r\nresources.  One approach is to form a composite material.  A composite\r\nmaterial is made from a blend of other materials.  Fundamental questions in\r\nthe design of composites are (1) what materials should be used to form the\r\ncomposite, (2) how much of each material should be used in the composite,\r\nand (3) how should the materials be combined to form the composite?  In the\r\nlatter case the geometric patterns of the combined materials (think of\r\nplywood) play an important role.  Materials scientists and engineers try to\r\nanswer the above keeping in mind the specific properties required from the\r\nresulting composite.  Practical experience and trial and error approaches\r\nare common means of obtaining answers.  Within the past two decades many\r\nnew tools have been developed by the applied mathematics community to help\r\nanswer these questions.  These tools fall under the heading of what is\r\ncalled homogenization theory.   One reason for holding this conference will\r\nbe to highlight the use of these new tools.  A second purpose of the\r\nproposed conference will be to highlight the formulation and solution of\r\nnew homogenization problems arising in materials design.  For example, one\r\narea that may further benefit from the utilization of homogenization tools\r\nis polymer-based composites.  Hence, the conference should help answer two\r\nquestions: (1) what should be the future directions in homogenization\r\ntheory based upon the current needs of modern technology (in short, which\r\nproblems should be solved), and (2) what is the best way of utilizing newly\r\ndeveloped mathematical tools to solve these problems in order to enhance\r\nthe use of homogenization methods in materials design?  These questions\r\nwill be answered through both speaker presentations and a panel discussion,\r\nwhich will summarize the current state of the subject and future trends.\r\n\r\n",
