 "awd_abstract_narration": "0078132 Laughon\r\nThe project will investigate the mechanism by which the Drosophila Smad proteins Mad and Medea override transcriptional repression by brinker (brk).  In response to Dpp signaling, Mad/Med repress brk expression, but also directly activate target genes such as vestigial, apparently in parallel to repression by Brk protein.  Band shift and Dnase I footprinting experiments will be used to identify Brk binding sites within Dpp response elements and to determine how these are positioned with respect to previously characterized Mad/Med binding sites.  Brk binding affinity and reporter analyses will be used to compare short- and long-range Dpp response elements and to determine how Brk contributes to the varying response thresholds of Dpp targets.  Gel shift experiments with extracts from transfected S2 cells will be used to determine whether Mad/Med complexes compete with Brk for binding to DNA.  Mad-Brk interaction will be investigated by means of co-immunoprecipitation and 2-hybrid analysis to determine whether direct contact with Brk protein is required for activated Smad complexes to override repression by Brk.  Similar experiments will be performed to investigate the role of Schnurri as a Mad cofactor in the repression of brk, wingless and other genes that respond negatively to Dpp signaling.\r\n",
