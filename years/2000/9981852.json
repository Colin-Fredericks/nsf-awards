 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a novel, compact, low-cost\r\nadaptive neuroprocessor chip for advanced diagnostics and control in the next generation of low emission\r\n\"environmentally friendly\" vehicles.  This digital CMOS VLSI electronic neural network device combines on-chip integration of a fully reconfigurable feed-forward/time-lagged recurrent neuroprocessor module with backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) weight training module.  Specifically, the technical objectives are to develop a neuroprocessor chip suitable for direct insertion into an automobile's electronic engine computer (EEC).  This stand-alone electronic neural network will function as a co-processor to the EEC's central processing unit (CPU), off-loading it of computationally intensive neural based tasks and enabling event rate automotive diagnostics and control.  The neuroprocesor is programmable, allowing it to execute multiple neural network applications on-the-fly; is capable of event rate computational throughput (<<50 microseconds) per appli-cation; is a system-on-a-chip (SOAC) design (stand-alone neuroprocessor with on-chip weight training); and cost effective (<$5/chip).  On-chip adaptation will not only enable adaptive control, but will address the problem of fixed weight networks - namely that of enabling on-board self-calibration of electronic and mechanical systems for optimal performance.\r\n\r\nApplications areas of the proposed neural network formalism cover the following industry sectors: (1) ad-vanced diagnostic and control strategies for low emision vehicles & hybrid electric vehicles in the automotive industry; (2) prognostics and diagnostics of jet engines for the aerospace industry; (3) and adaptive equaliza-tion of cell phones for superior noise rejection in the communication industry.\r\n",
