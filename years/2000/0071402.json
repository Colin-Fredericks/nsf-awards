The first is motivated by the observation\r\nthat the classes of groups for which the Novikov and exactness\r\nconjectures are known coincide to a large degree; both classes contain\r\namenable groups, hyperbolic groups and Coxeter groups, for example.\r\nThis project is joint with J. Kaminker.  The second is based on the\r\nidea that the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization can be analyzed using\r\nspectral properties of family of Dirac-type operators.  This project\r\nis joint with J. Trout.\r\n\r\nThe Novikov conjecture, one of the most important problems in\r\ntopology, has stimulated a tremendous amount of mathematical research\r\nover the last thirty years.  The exactness conjecture is purely\r\nanalytic.  That there could exist a connection between these two\r\nconjectures from entirely different branches of mathematics is\r\nsomewhat surprising, but nevertheless is supported by empirical\r\nevidence.  We plan to develop more fully the relationship between\r\nthese conjectures.  This research has bearing on a number of important\r\noutstanding problems including the Baum-Connes Conjecture.  At the\r\nheart of the connection between mathematics and physics is the theory\r\nof quantum mechanics.  We propose a new method to analyze quantum\r\nmechanical systems based on geometric properties of certain systems of\r\ndifferential equations.  This work should lead to a better\r\nunderstanding of a number of quantum mechanical systems from\r\nmathematical physics.\r\n\r\n",
