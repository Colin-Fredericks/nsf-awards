The survey consists of a questionnaire and a set of metrics developed by a focus group representing a cross-section of four-year undergraduate mechanical engineering programs evaluated under ABET EC2000. Site visits to participating institutions are also being conducted. Survey results from ME programs across the nation are being collected and analyzed. Findings are being disseminated to all mechanical engineering programs and to academic committees of other engineering disciplines.",
