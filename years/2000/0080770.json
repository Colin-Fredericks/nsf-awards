Two earlier THERMEC conferences were held in Japan (1988) and Australia (1997). It was decided to hold this conference in the US because of the cutting-edge materials research that is being carried out in different academic, government, and industrial laboratories in the US. THERMEC 2000 Conference topics include materials advancements in light metal alloys (aluminum, magnesium, and titanium), steels, composites, superalloys, coatings, and superconductors and related materials processing and fabrication techniques. The NSF support is directed toward assisting graduate students in attending the meeting.\r\n%%%\r\nThe scientific knowledge of materials has reached a level that permits the development of advanced materials by innovative, closely-controlled processing and fabrication techniques.  This conference examines recent progress in this field.\r\n*** \r\n",
