 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Texas Institute of Anthropology will provide summer research experiences for junior college and University of North Texas minority and non-minority students who will be rising sophomores and juniors.  The program will take place over ten weeks, with the first five weeks consisting of instruction on anthropological research techniques and the second five weeks consisting of research experience.  The students will be trained in four major research areas in anthropology, historical and testimonios case studies, participant observation, conducting focus group studies, and data analysis on text-interview material.  In addition, students will be taught the techniques for conducting resource material location, library research, and the use of the Internet for research purposes.  Through the ten-week program, students will be exposed to such topics as writing research results, stages of research, critical thinking, note taking during research, getting published, and presenting at conferences.  All students will be followed to determine their college progress and to encourage their participation in the Undergraduate Scholars Program called McNair.  The McNair Program allows students to work closely with a mentor at the University of North Texas over a one- or two-year period.  This project will feed students into the McNair Scholars program.",
