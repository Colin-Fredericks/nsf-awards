 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop nano-engineered biosensors for detection of organophosphorus (OP) compounds. The growing public concern about chemical warfare agents and the widespread use of the acutely toxic compounds in modern agriculture has required analytical tools for in-field and on-line monitoring of OP compounds. The existing sensor technologies have inherent limitations that are unsuitable for such applications. This program seeks to develop high performance biosensors with an\r\ninnovation that focuses on nano-engineering of the sensor structure that combines the advantages of nano-ring electrode transducers and enzyme micro- reactors. The proposed sensors are expected to have fast response, high selectivity, high sensitivity, and low detection limits. The research objectives of the phase I will include synthesis, processing, and characterization of nano-ring electrode ensembles; fabricating nano-engineered electrochemical biosensors; and testing the sensor performance. During Phase I, AMSEN Technologies will demonstrate the proof-of-concept of such a sensor. Phase II will build on Phase I success, optimize, build prototypes and field test the technology. Phase III will commercialize the technology and anticipated spin-off.\r\n\r\nThis program will result in miniaturized biosensor devices for in-field and on-line detection of OP compounds that is of importance to the nation for both civil and military applications. The general principles of the sensors would also have widespread applications in environmental programs, control and detoxification of pesticides and insecticides, and chemical manufacturing facilities.\r\n\r\n",
