Genetic analysis is a powerful tool for identifying the roles a gene plays in complex developmental processes, but if the loss of a gene's activity can be partially or fully compensated for by the activity of another gene, or if the effects of a gene's loss in one developmental process overshadows the effects on other processes, then a loss-of-function approach may not help reveal the gene's function. A dominant misexpression approach, in which random insertions of a mobile regulatory region activates genes, can overcome some of these limitations. A screen to disrupt the development of external sense organs in Drosophila was used as a candidate system to successfully test the approach. Eight independent insertions that resulted in dominant cell fate changes in the sense organ development pathway or changes in bristle cell shape were isolated. \r\nThe objectives of this of this proposal are to identify the adjacent genes whose misexpression results in changes in sense organ cell fate or bristle morphology. Once identified, the roles the genes play in normal development will be determined, with the goal of understanding how misexpression of the genes results in specific cell fate changes or altered morphology. Inverse PCR will be used to obtain the sequence flanking the insertion site, and comparison with the Drosophila genome project sequence will identify the affected gene. RT-PCR will be used to test whether a transcript originating in the insert is induced under misexpression conditions. For some of the insertions that change the fate of cells in the sense organ lineage, markers that are expressed in subsets of cells in the sense organ lineage will be used to identify whether under dominant misexpression conditions sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells arise normally in each line and divide properly to produce the cells that make up a sense organ. The roles the most interesting genes normally play in development will be assessed by determining their RNA and protein expression domains and their loss-of-function phenotypes. \r\nThe proposed work will make a specific contribution to elucidating the mechanisms of how networks of genes assign specific cell fates during sense organ development and how gene activities contribute to cell morphology. The work also has general significance, since as genome projects continue to identify genes, the problems caused by redundancy and complex expression will grow. The analysis of genes identified by dominant misexpression screens should provide an alternative means of assigning functions to genes.\r\n",
