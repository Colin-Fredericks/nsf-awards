 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\nThe project concentrates on multiple recurrence and convergence in\r\ndynamical systems with a focus on polynomial actions of abelian and\r\nnilpotent groups. The problems considered lead to diverse applications of\r\nergodic theory to combinatorics, number theory and algebra which are\r\ninaccessible so far by conventional methods. The polynomial Szemeredi and\r\nHales-Jewett theorems proved by the proposers in the recent years have\r\nsince been extended by the proposers and their colleagues in different\r\ndirections, each providing a better understanding of the phenomenon of\r\nmultiple recurrence along polynomials and offering new vistas of research.\r\nThe directions of study touched upon in this proposal include\r\n(but are not limited to) the deeper study of multiple recurrence for\r\nnilpotent group actions and the investigation of polynomial multiple\r\nrecurrence in the framework of IP-systems. Another interesting area\r\nconsidered in this proposal has to do with convergence of ergodic averages\r\nnaturally appearing in the theory of multiple recurrence and its\r\napplications. The results recently obtained by the proposers indicate a\r\ndichotomy between the behavior of ergodic averages depending on whether\r\nthe acting groups have polynomial or exponential growth. The\r\nrelated conjectures formulated in the last section of the proposal are\r\nshedding new light on these questions.\r\n \r\n The theory of multiple recurrence that we focus on in this project uses\r\nthe ideas from several diverse areas of mathematics and aims to advance\r\nour knowledge about the intrinsic properties of dynamical systems which\r\nare related to their long range behavior. An example of a highly\r\nnontrivial fact stemming from our investigations is the regularity of the\r\nbehavior of dynamical systems along polynomial time measurements. This\r\nfact, in its turn, has strong applications to seemingly distant areas of\r\nnumber theory and combinatorics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
