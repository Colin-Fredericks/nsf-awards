 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThe investigator wants to study two topics in Several Complex Variables.\r\nThe first is on holomorphic embeddings. By constructing holomorphic functions,one seeks to embed complex manifolds as closed submanifolds of some complex Euclidean space of as low dimension as possible.\r\nThe second is on envelopes of holomorphy.\r\nIn constructions of holomorphic functions, one is faced with the\r\nrestriction that sometimes they all extend past certain boundary points,\r\nfor example, in higher dimensions no holomorphic function can have an\r\nisolated singularity. Isolated boundary points belong to the envelope of\r\nholomorphy.The investigator will study, more generally, envelopes of\r\nholomorphy. In particular, there is a great need for investigation of a\r\nlarge variety of examples.\r\n\r\nComplex analysis is a basic tool in many fields of mathematics and in other sciences. Even problems described with real numbers are often dealt with more naturally after extending into the\r\ncomplex domain. A foundational problem of the subject is how to construct holomorphic\r\nfunctions with required properties. This basic problem has motivated much\r\nof the work of the proposer in the past and is also the motivation for\r\nthis proposal. For example how can one find a holomorphic function tending\r\nto infinity at a certain boundary point, or has some other singularity\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
