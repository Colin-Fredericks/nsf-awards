 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a group at the University of Cincinnati to participate in two neutrino experiments at Fermilab:  NuTeV,where data taking was recently completed in the high energy neutrino line, and BooNe, the new booster neutrino experiment currently under construction.\r\n\r\nNuTeV was designed to measure sin2qW and r, two essential parameters of the Standard Model of electroweak interactions, whereqW  is the weak mixing angle and r is related to the ratio of neutrino to anti-neutrino interactions.   This group developed a sign-selected quadrupole train to eliminate neutrinos from wrong-sign or neutral parents.  NuTeV exceeded its goal of recording 1.5 million neutrino interaction events.  During the period of this award, analysis of the data will continue and results will be published.\r\n\r\nBooNe is a new experiment designed to study neutrino oscillations.  Recent results from the LSND experiment at Los Alamos suggested that nm 's could oscillate into ne's.  BooNe is designed to either confirm or refute this result at the ten standard deviation level, and at an energy ten times higher than at Los Alamos.  During the period of this award, design and construction of the experiment will be done.\r\n",
