 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, which is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program, continues research that focuses on developing a thorough understanding of multi-electron reactions with emphasis on the energetics and kinetics of the processes.  Conducted by Dr. Dennis Evans and his group at the University of Delaware, the project includes several parts.  One part uses the behavior of certain molecules to study potential inversion, the phenomenon where the insertion or removal of the second electron in a two electron process occurs more easily than does removal of the first electron.  Fast scan cyclic voltammetry is then used to identify the point at which the structural changes associated with potential inversion occurs.  Another part of the project develops an improved fundamental understanding of the mechanism of electrode reactions.  This improved understanding is used to investigate and improve procedures for the electrochemical generation of acids.  Using a novel electric-field promoted hydrolysis, protic acids are produced by oxidation of hydrogen and a palladium membrane-based cell for acid generation is constructed and tested.  \r\n\r\nThe fundamental understanding of multi-electron-transfer  reactions that this research develops will help demonstrate the efficacy of electrochemical synthesis, which in turn could lead to more environmentally friendly processes in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.",
