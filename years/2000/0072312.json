This merging of sub-areas\r\nmakes sense because their methods are showing more overlap than ever.  \r\nThe project suggests a variety of goals. The first is the study of\r\nboundaries of connectedness loci for families of polynomials. This\r\ngeneralizes the study of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. Problems\r\ninclude the metric structure of the boundary, including the boundary\r\nbehavior of the Riemann map of the complement and the distribution of\r\nthe harmonic measure. This part of the problem continues the on-going\r\nwork by J. Graczyk and the proposer. The second goal is the study of\r\nboundaries of Siegel disks. The main problem in this area is deciding\r\nwhether such boundaries are Jordan curves. The proposed approach is\r\nbased on gaining information on the Riemann map of the Siegel disk by\r\nmeans of a cohomological equation. The third problem is in real\r\ndynamics and concerns the existence of wild attractors with additional\r\nproperties. The forth goal is to estimate the measure and Hausdorff\r\ndimension of sets invariant under certain iterated function systems. \r\n\r\nTo understand the meaning of this research in the broad perspective of\r\nscience, one has first to realize the role played by one-dimensional,\r\nor conformal, dynamics. Systems which appear as models in natural\r\nsciences, such as physics, astronomy, meteorology, economics or\r\necology, involve multiple parameters.  However, \r\nfrequently one dominant parameter emerges\r\nwhich controls long time-behavior of the system. In such a way the\r\nlogistic family appears in the study of many complicated systems. The\r\nlogistic maps are quadratic polynomials. It is useful to study them on\r\nthe complex plane, and thus complex quadratic polynomials enter the\r\npicture. This is the first object of our study. \r\nIn other situations the system begins to show quasi-periodic\r\nor ``rotational'' behavior. This is situation is modeled by Siegel\r\ndisks which are another subject of our proposed study. Wild\r\nattractors, which are our third subject, refer to a very unusual\r\nchaotic regime for a system in which two completely different limiting\r\nmodes of long-term behavior co-exist side by side.   The attractor\r\nfor an iterated function system which we will also investigate appears\r\nas a projection of a certain fractal set. This kind of problem appears\r\nin applications where one often has a multi-dimensional fractal set\r\nwhich can be studied by projections onto lower-dimensional spaces.   \r\n",
