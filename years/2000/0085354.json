 "awd_abstract_narration": "0085354  Pagilla  The objective of this research is to explore the genetic engineering of Burkholderia sp. with Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) gene (vgb) to enhance its ability to degrade 2,4-dinitrotoluene in soil and groundwater.  Burkholderia strain R34 is known to degrade DNT by oxidative pathway, and Vitreoscilla, although a strict aerobe, grows in oxygen-limiting environments due to its ability to synthesize hemoglobin.  The broad focus of the proposed research is to incorporate vgb from Vitreoscilla into Burkholderia and other organisms to improve bioremediation of contaminated soils and groundwater under oxygen limiting conditions.  The specific objectives of the proposed research are to 1) investigate the transformation of Burkholderia DNT R34 strain with vgb (encoding Vitreoscilla hemoglobin VHb) to create Burkholderia strain YV1, 2) determine the influence of vgb/VHb on the growth, oxygen uptake and DNT degradation behavior of Burkholderia, 3) investigate DNT degradation by R34 and YV1 strains under oxygen limiting conditions such as in soil and groundwater and 4) integrate vgb into the chromosome of Burkholderia for enhanced DNT degradation under oxygen limiting conditions.  If successful, this project will provide a way to overcome the difficulty of sufficient oxygen supply to bacteria in aerobic bioremediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. ***",
