 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this POWRE award is for McDermott to become fully proficient in the latest functional neuroimaging methodology, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  That complete proficiency should then allow her to become competitive in that research environment and put her in a position to apply independently for major federal funding for future studies involving the functional neuroimaging of human cognition.\r\n\r\nThe specific research goal for this award is to understand the role of right inferior frontal gyrus in the encoding of nonverbal information.  Thus far, most neuroimaging studies examining frontal cortex have focused upon verbal processing and have neglected nonverbal processing.  Further, most studies focusing on nonverbal processing have targeted regions in the posterior aspects of the brain.  This study will target a specific region of frontal cortex, the right inferior frontal gyrus, which has been shown to be important in the processing of nonverbal information.  There is still a great deal to be learned about the types of neural computations performed by this brain region.  These experiments will focus on its contribution to the encoding of new information into memory.\r\n\r\nResults from these experiments will have the potential to inform educational practice.  That is, by enhancing understanding of brain regions involved in encoding information into memory, we will better understand how people learn new information.  In addition to enhancing basic understanding of human cognition, this information may have implications for enhancing performance in the classroom.\r\n",
