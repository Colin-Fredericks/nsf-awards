 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to improve science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) education through the creation of Learning Communities (LCs) for students and faculty. The goals of the SMET learning communities are: first, to attract more students, especially women, into SMET majors and courses; second, to increase retention of students, especially women in SMET majors; third, to foster confidence among students, especially women in SMET majors and courses; fourth, to connect women SMET majors to support networks of interdisciplinary faculty and peers; fifth, to aid faculty to increase student learning by training them to use of innovative, research-based teaching strategies; and finally, to increase faculty understanding of innovative pedagogy to facilitate student learning in highly technical SMET courses. The project is adapting and implementing similar LC efforts underway at the University of Washington, California State University at Sacremento, Illinois State University, and the University of Texas at El Paso (this last project has received funding from NSF for some of its work). Resources and expertise from other projects described in the FIPSE National Learning Communities Dissemination Project are also being used. The first LC, Computer Science Recruitment, involves 3 courses taken simultaneously by 25 freshman women interested in computers. The second LC, Quantitative and Research Psychology, brings 25 students together in a sequence of 3 courses to increase interest and understanding in methodological aspects of psychology. In the third LC, Writing and Natural Sciences, 25 non-science students are taking 3 courses simultaneously each aimed at developing knowledge and confidence in science skills. The fourth LC, First Year Engineering, provides 2 bridge programs for 20 women between high school and college. Faculty involved in the LC program are being mentored in 2 year-long Faculty LCs, sharing strategies and support for SMET teaching. In all LCs, students and faculty connect with others across SMET disciplines. Results are being widely disseminated in 2 regional conferences, as well as academic conferences and journal articles in several disciplines. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
