Pindzola, Department of Physics, Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, Dr. Thomas W. Gorczyca, Department of Physics, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan and Dr. Zikry Altun, Department of Physics at Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey. This project represents a continuing effort in the development and application of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) to the study of atomic photoionization.  These investigators plan to develop a theoretical methodology to treat many-body dynamics in the photoionization of open- shell atoms and ions, which is ab-initio, assessable and accurate.  Through the inclusion of discrete-state correlations, interchannel coupling and spin-orbit interactions, a theoretical construct will be formulated based upon many-body perturbation theory.  The methodology will be used to investigate (i) the photoionization of transition metal atoms and ions, (ii) the photoionizaion plus excitation of ground and excited open-shell atoms and ions, and (iii) the photorecombination of open-shell atoms and ions. \r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between Turkish and US scientists who have complementary capabilities and experience.  The Turkish investigator and Dr. Pindzola are experts on the application of many-body perturbation theory methods in atomic physics. Dr. Gorczyca is knowledgeable in the close coupling approach to treating atomic photoionization and electron scattering processes.  The proposed work is at the frontier of the capabilities of computational physics: the systems proposed for study are complex, electron correlations are significant, and relativistic effects may prove to be important. This theoretical work will support experimental efforts at measuring photoprocesses for complex systems, particularly at photon energies high enough to excite core ions. The project is timely as experimentalists using third generation light sources are capable of measuring some of the processes proposed, thus allowing theory and experiment the possibility of progressing hand in hand, with each checking and stimulating the other.  The authors propose to check their results using a Dirac-Fock calculation, which would not have the problems that may arise in other methods.  This project meets INT objectives of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.",
