 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fort Belknap College Initiative (FBCRSI) will expand the efforts that were begun during the past five years of work with the Tribal College RSI.  First, Standards-Based Curriculum and Assessment Training will be offered at least twice per year to orient new-hires and to provide ongoing training in current developments in standards based curriculum and assessment for all teachers. For the last two years the target\r\nschools have synchronized their academic calendars to facilitate these professional development sessions and currently the schools are working on synchronizing the next academic year's calendar as well.  Now that the Standards-Based Curricula is in place, the focus has shifted to appropriate evaluation. Training in alternative assessment will be conducted three times per year, with the goal of all math and science teachers in the\r\ntarget schools attending at least one of the sessions each year.  FBCRSI will coordinate the development of a Summer Institute for Math and Science teachers.  Second, since the bulk of accomplishments over the first five years has been at the elementary level, it is now time to focus on the secondary level and on the pre-service teacher program at Fort Belknap College. This slight shift in focus will insure that the\r\nFBCRSI is providing services to the entire target population on the Fort Belknap Reservation at grades K-14. This will not only increase student achievement in math and science at the secondary level, but will also increase the number of Native Americans who choose math or science teaching as a career.  Third, the FBCRSI will expand its efforts in student achievement by coordinating and facilitating enrichment activities that include: Standards-Based After School Programs, Saturday Academies, and Summer School Programs. These programs will be customized for each target school student population to assist the students with remediation and/or enrichment activities to help all students achieve at high levels.  Fourth, the now-established FBCRSI program will continue with its successful RSI Steering Committee, which represents all targeted school populations in math and science.  Program personnel will expand efforts to provide leadership for the various\r\nprograms and departments within the reservation that will lead to more cooperation and less duplication of efforts.  FBCRSI will work collaboratively with all other RSI programs in Montana and statewide educational agencies/programs to coordinate shared activities, leverage resources, and share effective practices that have optimal impact on student achievement.\r\n\r\n",
