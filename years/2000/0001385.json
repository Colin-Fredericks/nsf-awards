 "awd_abstract_narration": "0001385  Todd  The goals of this research are the development and field-testing of an innovative real-time method for measuring, visualizing and quantifying chemical air emissions and emission rates.  With the proposed method, two-dimensional pollutant concentration maps of large areas are generated using an environmental CAT (computer assisted tomography) scanning system that couples the chemical detection technology of open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy with the mapping capabilities of computer assisted tomography.  In the proposed system, several OP-FTIR spectrometers transmit beams of infrared light along open beam paths (up to one kilometer, approximately) to simultaneously measure and identify a wide range of multiple contaminants directly in the atmosphere, typically at part per billion or part per million detection levels.  The tomographic system uses a mathematical image reconstruction algorithm to process the multiple data into two-dimensional chemical maps.  If successful, this method will allow concentrations to be spatially resolved in real-time over large areas with fewer measurements than would be required with conventional point samplers to obtain the same level of detail. ***",
