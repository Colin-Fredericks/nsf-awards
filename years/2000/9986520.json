 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symposium will be held in December, 1999 on Advanced Materials and Techniques for Nanolithography at the Fall MRS meeting in Boston. The symposium focuses on the material science aspect of lithographic processes including the development of advanced resists and more generally of smart materials. Lithography optimization potential through greater materials science understanding is comparatively very high and should help in breaking the sub-100 nm critical dimension in microelectronics. This crossdisciplinary symposium is aimed at bringing together experts working in all areas of nanolithography as well as material science researchers expert in new materials design.\r\nThe symposium seeks to attract participants from industry, academia, and government laboratories, to help these communities learn from each other.  It provides a stimulating environment for students planning a career in electronic materials, a field of research that is exciting, and is important to the national economy. Support from NSF will be used to partially compensate young scientists (junior faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) for travel and accommodation expenses. The symposium is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues in advanced nanolithography.  Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established between universities, research institutions, and industry.  \r\n%%%\r\nNanolithography and electronic/photonic materials have far reaching economic potential since applications range broadly across computing, communications, and information processing. An evaluation of the progress and status of this field along with current assessments of the most important developments will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of advanced materials in applications beneficial to society. ***\r\n \r\n\r\n",
