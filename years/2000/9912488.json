S. authors of papers accepted for presentation and U. S. plenary lectures at the Third Joint USA/China Chemical Engineering Conference (CUChE-3) to be held in Beijing China on September 25-28, 2000.  The theme of the Third Conference is Chemical Engineering for the 21st Century.  The Third Joint Conference will serve as an ideal forum for U. S. Chemical Engineers to meet their counterparts in China to exchange research ideas and opportunities for cooperation.  As in the last two Conferences, the AIChE and its Chinese counterpart, Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC), will be sponsors of the Conference.  In addition, the counterpart chemical engineering societies of Germany, Japan and Korea will join in as co-sponsors, thus expanding the scope and impact of the Conference.  The Third Conference will be the largest formal international conference in Chemical Engineering.  This grant will provide for 30-35 partial travel grant awards to U. S. authors of papers and invited plenary lectures at the Conference.  Travel awards will be made based on the following considerations; (1) scientific or technological merit of the paper; (2) availability of others sources of travel funding; (3)  institutional and geographical distribution.    \r\n",
