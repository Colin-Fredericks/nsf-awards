Along with a substantial cost-sharing from various administrative units at the University of Houston, NSF funds are requested which together will support twelve undergraduate students who will have the opportunity to conduct research and participate in other science-related activities during the summers of 2000-2002.  The objectives of the Program are (1) to provide incentives for students to pursue a career in science by giving them the opportunity for a realistic and rewarding experience in a research environment, and (2) to make this opportunity accessible to a great diversity of students, in particular those from minority groups and those from Institutions with limited research resources.  Through this multi-faceted experience, students will be provided with a rigorous, but stimulating training that will convey not only excitement about science, but also expose them to the realistic aspect of conducting basic research.  Students will work closely with their mentors, who have designed realistic projects that will teach the practical and conceptual aspects of molecular and cellular Biology.  In addition, during their 10-week training, the students will also become familiar with searching and assessing scientific literature, exchange of scientific ideas, and techniques for verbal and written presentation of scientific data.  Workshops that expose students to issues such as ethics, safety, and career choices will also be organized.  The Program will end with a poster session similar to those featured at scientific meetings, to be attended by the entire faculty and students.  The participants who present the two best posters will be awarded with travel funds to attend a national meeting.  The success of the Program will be evaluated through student and faculty questionnaires, and by long-term tracking of student participants.\r\n",
