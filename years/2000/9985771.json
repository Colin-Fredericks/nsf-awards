 "awd_abstract_narration": "9985771\r\nArguello\r\nIons are transported across membranes of living organisms using metabolic energy derived from ATP.  The transport proteins are enzymes that are imbedded in the membrane and classified as P-type ATPases.  There is not a complete understanding of the processes performed by these enzymes due in part to a lack of knowledge of their atomic structures.  During the last few years, a new group of P-type ATPases (P1-type) has been identified in prokaryotes that transport heavy metals such as Cu+1, Cu+2, Zn+2, Cd+2, and others into cells. These enzymes have the same mechanistic characteristics as other P-type ATPases, but they are smaller in size.  This characteristic makes them easier to isolate, purify, crystallize and obtain their atomic structure.  The detailed structural information obtained through crystallographic analysis of this sub-class of P-type ATPases will provide information on the ion selectivity and energy transduction mechanisms of other P-type ATPases and a clearer understanding of energy coupled ion transport.  This is especially important since this knowledge may also provide a basis for the engineering of microorganisms that can be used effectively in bioremediation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
