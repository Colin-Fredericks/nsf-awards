 "awd_abstract_narration": "he focus of this research is the biomimetic diversity-based synthesis of millions of compounds that resemble benzoxanthenone class of natural products.  The project will produce some of the most complex molecules yet constructed on the solid-phase in a split-pool library format.  The resulting collections will be screened for novel biological properties such as inhibitors of the cell cycle machinery or activators of signalling pathways.  The educational component of the project focuses on outreach at the K-12 level and course development at the undergraduate and graduate level.  Course content will stress diversity-based approaches at the interface between organic chemistry and biology. \r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Matthew D. Shair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University.  Professor Shair will focus his research on the diversity-based synthesis of new molecules with novel biological properties.  The educational portion of the project focuses on the theme of chemistry and interdisciplinary research.  The project will stress the use of chemistry and organic synthesis to probe the most interesting questions in the life sciences.",
