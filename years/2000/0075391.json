 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine distributed and collaborative decision paradigms for next generation enterprise systems.  The goal for the project is to explore a scalable framework for enterprise decision-making through the development of distributed and collaborative transaction paradigms in the context of supply chain management.  The main objectives of this research will be to:   (1) develop fundamental theory for distributed enterprise transactions, (2) explore enterprise coordination issues in the context of electronic commerce and supply chain logistics, and (3) conduct field studies based on real-world industry applications.  A main thesis of this research is that the synergy between e-commerce and supply-chain logistics forms an unprecedented area of innovation and discovery, which play a pivotal role in transforming the current economy. Building on solid theory and industry realities, the research in transaction paradigms and supply-chain coordination will be crucial links in this transformation.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, the result of this research will lead to simplify information management in the new electronic business environment.  A basic paradigm in conventional Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is one that seeks \"total visibility\" of system details in a top-down, hierarchical manner.  This is accomplished by maintaining painfully detailed information of all perceivable aspects of the organization using sophisticated information and database management systems. This information must be kept up-to-date since it serves as a basis for decision making throughout the system.  For large-scale operations involving multiple facilities or firms in a supply chain, the current approach encounters major difficulties in scaling up.  The PI's will use a decentralized approach analogous to the operations of a free market:   each decision entity makes locally autonomous decisions based on privately owned information, self-interest, and locally motivated preference/constraints.  Centralized information management is drastically simplified to that of maintaining market fairness and stability.  To be implemented in the context of electronic commerce, this new paradigm facilitates a universally agreed upon domain of electronic transactions and information exchange. The grant brings together a two-institution research team.  The research will be conducted with participation from industry partners at Lehigh's Manufacturing Logistics Institute and Wharton's Fishman-Davison Center for Service and Operations Management\r\n",
