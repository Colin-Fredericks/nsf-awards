 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes the development of an efficient, fast, and cost-effective photoreactor to supply pyrogen-free water on-line in hemodialysis systems. Several risks and hazards identified for hemodialysis are associated with water quality, including pyrogenic contamination. Current practices in hemodialysis systems do not guaranty pyrogen-free water. Furthermore, several drawbacks exist in current techniques: addition of chemicals, which have to be monitored and destroyed before\r\nwater contacts the dialysis membrane; formation of toxic by-products; no on-line supply of pyrogen-free water, and cost. In the proposed system, the disinfecting agents are produced in situ, consumed inside the photoreactor, and capable of complete mineralization of organic matter. Short treatment times will be achieved by incorporating an effective photocatalyst (inorganic, non-toxic, and chemically and biologically inert material) in an efficient reactor design. The aim of this Phase I is to evaluate the technical feasibility\r\nof the novel photoreactor for on-line production of pyrogen-free water based on the construction and evaluation of a laboratory scale system. During the Phase II, an automatic system will be developed and integrated in a hemodialysis system.\r\n     The proposed system will find immediate application in many sectors of the industry.  Pyrogen-free water is required in all hemodialysis systems. In addition, large quantities of pyrogen-free water are used by the medical industry such as in intravenous infusion fluids, fluids for infection and for irrigation in operating rooms. Also, sterile water is needed in the hydroponics industry.",
