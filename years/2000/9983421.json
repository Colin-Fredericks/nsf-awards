 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will expand the Phase I study, examine the effect of high nitrate loading and demonstrate the technology at a drinking water treatment site, by treating the brine regenerant stream from an ion exchange water treatment system. This would broaden utilization base of the technology and allow increased market penetration since the technology will supplement the existing technology base and reduce the operating costs of the currently practiced technologies for NO3 removal. This will lead to both high probability of commercial success plus a large sales base to allow for lower pricing in remediation markets.\r\nAcross the United States there are a number of drinking water facilities that are wrestling with the problem of high concentrations of dissolved nitrates in their influent water streams. The present methods of removal resort to concentrating the NO3 into a small volume by means of reverse osmosis or ion exchange and then disposing off this concentrated stream, appropriately. The recovered NO3 in such a waste stream can be destroyed biologically using dissolved hydrogen gas as the electron donor. Hydrogen offers several economic and operational advantages over other organic electron donors in denitrification. The factor limiting hydrogen use is its low solubility, i.e. existing commercial gas-dissolution technologies cannot dissolve sufficient hydrogen in a safe, cost effective manner. Membrane-based gas-dissolution technologies can potentially supply the hydrogen required for these processes safely, but commercially available membrane suitable for bubble-free gas-dissolution have poor performance, biological fouling, or both.  Compact Membrane Systems, Inc., has developed a highly gas permeable perfluoropolymer coating for microporous membranes. The smooth, non-porous nature of the perfluoropolymer coating is highly resistant to biological fouling, especially compared to microporous hydrophobic membranes. This coating could remove the performance, fouling, and cost barriers that preclude the use of membrane-based gas dissolution technologies in continuous biological processes.  The Phase I study established concept feasibility and demonstrated that nitrates could effectively remediate without the formation of nitrites in a continuous mode.  \r\n\r\n",
