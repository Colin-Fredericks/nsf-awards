 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThis project is being carried out in conjunction with a major curriculum review and transformation process, major emphasis being on reform of the laboratory programs, based on the belief that the laboratory should lead the curriculum.  General chemistry, introductory organic labs, and analytical lab sequences are being reformed, with main emphasis on guided inquiry-based laboratory experiences, and with student-oriented learning being supported through information technology and advanced computer tools.  A computer center that serves lower level, introductory courses currently exists.  This project is providing initial funding for a complementary facility for use by organic chemistry students, upperclassmen, chemistry majors, and students in a new interdisciplinary program in molecular biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics.  This facility supports recently acquired advanced analytical instrumentation, designed to introduce discovery-based experiments into upper level laboratory courses.  Experiments that utilize the facility are adapted from journals such as J. Chem. Ed. and further developed for use by faculty who are being trained in the implementation of these discovery-based experiments.  Assessment of faculty experiences and student achievement provides feedback concerning the impact of the approach on upper level laboratory curriculum.\r\n",
