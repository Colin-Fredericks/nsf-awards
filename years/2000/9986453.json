 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Research project involves a content analysis of U.S. senate campaigns from a sample of states for the period 1992-1998.  The data obtained are used to investigate the influence of the political context on candidate's communication and campaign strategy.  A time series model is used to capture the dynamic nature of campaigns that results from the interaction between opponents and from candidates'sequential allocation of limited campaign resources.\r\n\r\nThirteen states from each election year during the period are included in the study and campaign content measures are derived from a content analysis of local newspaper coverage of campaigns.  All stories that cover the campaign between September 1st and election day are coded.  Local newspaper coverage of the campaigns is obtained from the full-text sources available on Lexis/Nexis.\r\n\r\nThe investigation provides a systematic study of information present in messages that candidates choose to communicate with voters.  This research promises to explicate the factors that influence the content of campaign communication.  The model outlined in the research affords the opportunity to develop a typology of campaigns that suggests when the normative expectation of issue-oriented campaigning will be fulfilled, and also identifies the conditions that produce an emphasis on partisan cues, character traits, and matters of job performance.\r\n\r\n",
