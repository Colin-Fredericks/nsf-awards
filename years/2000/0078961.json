 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Light Microscopy Facility at the University of Pittsburgh is currently used for basic biomedical research in cell, molecular, and developmental biology.  It is an indispensable tool for many users at the university.  The research programs that will use the upgraded facility include several that address the basic causes of diseases such as colon cancer, cystic fibrosis, and neurodegenerative diseases such as spinal ataxia, Alzheimers, and Huntington's chorea.  This facility is presently composed of two units, a confocal microscope and an image analysis system.  Confocal microscopes use lasers as a light source to visualize biological specimens.  This allows researchers to see individual proteins within cells of a tissue sample.  It has opened up a new way of studying biology with microscopy.  One example of its power is that in 1999, it was used to discover the existence of stem cells in the adult brain.  This discovery overturned decades of dogma and promises new methods to treat afflictions of the nervous system caused by disease or injury.\r\n\r\n     A new confocal microscope and upgraded imaging system are being purchased with the aid of this grant.  The new confocal microscope from BioRad will replace the old microscope that is no longer state of the art.  Moreover, the upgraded image analysis system will provide the ability to rapidly analyze large quantities of confocal image data. It will feature rapid data acquisition and storage, channel processing, counting and sizing, measurement, and 3D reconstruction.\r\n\r\n     Besides its use for world-class biomedical research, the upgraded facility will play a vital role in training and education.  The new microscope will be used to train Ph.D. graduate students at University of Pittsburgh and prepare them for their roles as the scientists of tomorrow.  The facility is also used to teach University of Pittsburgh undergraduate students in cell biology and developmental biology laboratory courses.  It is also used in departmental outreach programs to educate high school teachers in the Western Pennsylvania area.  As such, it allows students and teachers to experience the capabilities of light microscopy for discovery in the modern life sciences. The new system will be connected via the internet for image transmission of biological specimens to both classrooms and laboratories around the country.\r\n",
