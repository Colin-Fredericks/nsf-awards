 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Oklahoma Rural Systemic Initiative, a collaborative project of the OKRSI Leadership Consortium, is a comprehensive program leading toward systemic reform in standards-based mathematics, science and technology education. It incorporates the synergistic combination of twenty-first century teaching and learning methodology and content with Oklahoma American Indian tribal perspectives. The infusion of culturally appropriate methods and materials brings relativity and functionality to classroom interactions in Oklahoma rural schools where there is a significant number or percentage of American Indian students and limited resources.\r\n\r\nThis project in the developmental phase is organized around two major structures; The OKRSI Leadership Consortium, consisting of statewide agencies, tribes, institutions, organizations and businesses and six-to-eight Rural Regional Task Forces located throughout the state. Local school districts and tribal communities are included and interface with Consortium members to allow teacher access to meaningful and effective professional development, which in turn leads to increases in student skills and achievement. The Consortium will provide leadership in leveraging human and fiscal resources to assist local schools to improve the delivery of mathematics, science and technology education.\r\n\r\nThe first year goals of the OKRSI are:\r\n\r\nThe solidification of the OKRSI Leadership Consortium to provide overall leadership and guidance.\r\n\r\nAmerican Indian tribes, business and industry and educational agencies engaged as partners in systemic change.\r\n\r\nThe development of a comprehensive Implementation Plan and submission of a grant proposal for the ensuing five year Implementation phase which will lead to improved academic achievement in mathematics, science and technology throughout rural Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThe building of local and state fiscal capability to result in leveraging support and enhance comprehensive reform in the state and in local rural schools.\r\n\r\n",
