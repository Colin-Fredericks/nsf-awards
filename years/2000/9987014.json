 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern Mississippi is supporting scholarships for students in nine programs through the Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Scholarship (CSEMS) program. Low income, academically bright undergraduate students are being selected from computer science, mathematics, and seven engineering technology programs. Graduate students are being chosen from master's level programs in engineering technology, computer science and mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe program is partnering with three existing programs, the Alliance for Minority Participation, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and TRIO and Ronald McNair Programs sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education. The existing programs have many of the same objectives as the CSEMS Program, providing academic and financial support for different student populations. Still, there are many students who meet CSEMS Program criteria who are not eligible to participate. This program is enabling the university to include all undergraduate students in engineering technology, mathematics, and computer science who meet CSEMS criteria.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the proposed program are directly related to the CSEMS Program purpose of enabling low income students to complete baccalaureate and graduate degrees in academic areas of high priority. CSEMS Scholarship recipients are sharing facilities and participating in academic enrichment activities already in place to support the three ongoing programs. \r\n\r\n",
