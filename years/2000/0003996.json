 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Behavioral Husbandry and Research Program (BHRP) at Brookfield Zoo is currently being redeveloping.\r\nThe purpose of the BHRP is to incorporate behavioral observation, behavioral enrichment, and operant conditioning training into all aspects of captive management.  This will require extensive training of staff and a more rigorous, systematic appproach to behavioral observation than has recently been required at the zoo.  My responsibilities revolve primarliy around developing and maintaining a zoo-wide observational research program, with several goals: (1) Institute a zoo-wide program of routine behavioral monitoring of all animals in the zoo's collection; (2)  Develop training and education programs for volunteers, staff and students to enable them to participate in, or initiate, research studies; (3) Initiate long-term research on the development of reproductive and parental behavior in captive animals, and the possible effects of physical and social environments on these life history traits.  This proposal requests funding to initiate the primary components  of the BHRP, including staff, student, and volunteer training, establishment of data collection and analysis protocols, and development of the technological infrastructure necessary to make the program a success.",
