Courses developed for this project focus on ubiquitous and wireless computing. And, these same technologies are used in classrooms to deliver the curriculum as a part of the project that supports \"active learning.\" The areas of research chosen for migration into the curriculum include mobile code (placement and migration of code to adapt to rapidly changing clients, networks, and service characteristics), transcoding (transforming multimedia web content to save bandwidth and thus energy consumption at the destination device), active name architectures (where resource names are decoupled from specific hosts when resolving services), and energy aware operating systems (where the goal is to make basic interactions of hardware and software as energy efficient as possible for local computation). The project migrates research topics into advanced undergraduate courses and graduate courses, developing modules, assignments, software and curricular support that engage and educate students in the technologies of mobile and wireless information systems. The materials developed are integrated into five computer science courses. The courses apply active lectures, a form of active learning, to deliver content.\r\n",
