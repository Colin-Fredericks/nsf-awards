 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops increased instrumental and human capabilities in microwave remote sensing and related fields by making the existing Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR) and dual-wavelengths radiometers (MR) system available for development work in ground-based setting under normal operating conditions, and by using the ground installation for education and training.  Both WCR and MR were developed in collaboration with the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.  The WCR/MR system has been assembled for use in atmospheric research primarily on board of the University of Wyoming's King Air aircraft.  The radar, in operation since 1995, has proved to be a productive research tool and the current work will continue its development, including sensitivity and internal calibration capabilities.  The WCR/MR airborne system is typically used 2-3 months per year.  During those times, exclusive focus is on the collection of cloud physics data, with very limited opportunities for system development, training, and education.  When not airborne, the system will undergo minor modifications and be installed in an existing mobile laboratory.  This will provide greater access to and increased utilization of this advanced microwave remote sensing instrumentation.  In addition, these ground-based data can place air-based data into a better perspective.  Education and training will be directed toward graduate students working on theses and dissertations related to airborne remote sensing, microwave and signal processing hardware and software projects, and atmospheric sciences graduate and undergraduate courses. \r\n",
