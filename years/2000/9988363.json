Long\r\n\r\nOne of the most promising approaches to making video-on-demand services\r\nmore competitive is to continuously broadcast the most frequently requested\r\nvideos.  This research addresses three important limitations common to most\r\nexisting broadcasting protocols for video-on-demand.\r\n\r\nA first research direction is the development of broadcasting protocols\r\nthat can handle compressed videos having variable bandwidth requirements.\r\nThe performance of these new protocols will be evaluated using a\r\nrepresentative set of videos in the MPEG-2 format used by DVD. \r\n\r\nA second research direction is the efficient implementation of interactive\r\nfunctions analogous to those existing on a VCR.  These functions will allow\r\ncustomers to pause, move backward and forward as if they were watching a\r\nvideocassette.\r\n\r\nA third research direction is the design of broadcasting protocols that can\r\nadjust their broadcasting schedules to all observed changes in the request\r\narrival rate.  As a result, these dynamic broadcasting protocols will\r\nperform equally well at peak hours and at hours of lower demand.\r\n\r\nAll these broadcasting protocols will be demonstrated on a very simple\r\ntestbed consisting of a single workstation broadcasting a few specific videos.\r\n\r\n This is a collaborative research project between the University of\r\nCalifornia, Santa Cruz and the University of \r\nHouston. \r\n",
