 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) \r\nThe ICP-MS will be used, in conjunction with our existing ion chromatograph, in the chemical analyses of natural samples in both regular courses and student-research projects.  In our shared analytical facility, course-related exercises and senior research work are implemented across all four years of the curriculum in the Departments of Geology (5 courses), Chemistry (2 courses), Biology (2 courses), and Civil Engineering (4 courses).  The facility will also be utilized in the interdisciplinary Environmental Studies Program. The ICP-MS is being used as a research tool to provide experiences for all levels of students: 1) Introductory level students focus on exercises adapted from selected components of watershed investigation projects implemented elsewhere (e.g., Tonn and Whitman, 1996, Colby College).  Students collect samples that are analyzed outside of class.  In class, data are plotted and discussed in terms of conceptual models to determine how the samples attained their compositions.  2) Intermediate level students complete more advanced exercises adapted from a variety of projects elsewhere (e.g., Ousey, 1993, Pennsylvania State University; de Wet, 1994, Franklin and Marshall College; Tonn and Whitman, 1996, Colby College; Lee, 1998, Auburn University; Dunnivant et al., 1999, Hartwick College).  The students collect, prepare, and analyze samples in largely inquiry-driven, open-ended projects. The exercises allow implementation of experimental design, practical sample collection and preparation techniques, and sampling and analytical strategies.  As final products, students prepare substantial written reports that include data presentation and interpretation components. 3) Senior level students use the ICP-MS in directed research projects (theses) adapted from their research advisor's own ongoing scholarship, or in projects largely of the student's own design.  These students collect, prepare, and analyze samples, and are involved in planning and implementing analysis and sampling strategies and data interpretation.  Many theses result in formal publications and/or presentations at scientific conferences.",
