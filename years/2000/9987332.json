 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe Texas Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (TCETP) is a Texas A&M University System partnership committed to statewide reform of science and mathematics teacher preparation. The 10 TCETP universities graduate 25% of teachers certified K-8 and 9-12 in mathematics and science in Texas (3,700 teachers/year). TCETP has four connected goals: (1) course reform (integrating content, pedagogy, and classroom management); (2) recruitment to teaching; (3) support for pre-service and novice teachers (integrating early field experiences, student teaching, credentialing, induction/novice teacher support, math and science technical internships, and informal science experiences); and (4) strengthening systemic connections (Texas RSI, Texas SSI, Texas AMP). These goals are grounded on the accomplishments of development grant funding that\r\nestablished the System-wide infrastructure for reform and model course reform components requisite for systemic change in teacher preparation. The teaching of \r\nmathematics and science K-12 in Texas is significantly affected by the demographics of the state (55% of school age children are now either African American or Hispanic) unfolding within the context of national standards-based mathematics and science reform efforts statewide, including: (1) statewide adoption (1998) of the national mathematics and science standards (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills, TEKS) developed under NSF support; (2) alignment of the annual student assessment instrument (Texas Assessment of Academic Skills) in mathematics and science with the TEKS; and (3) state alignment\r\n(Texas State Board for Educator Certification) of the proficiencies required of teachers for state certification with the TEKS through the Examination for Certification of Educators in Texas (ExCET). TCETP was configured to address the critical issues of demographics, diversity, and integration within the statewide systemic reform environment.\r\n",
