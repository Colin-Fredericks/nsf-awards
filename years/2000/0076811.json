 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in genetic technology have provided tools for studying the genetics of behavior.  These techniques have been applied to studying the foraging behavior of honey bees.  Some bees specialize on collecting pollen while others collect nectar.  Variation among bees for foraging behavior has been shown to be a consequence of at least 3 major genes.  These genes affect other behavioral traits as well, such as how bees perceive the taste of sugar, the sizes of the pollen and nectar loads they collect, and the age at which they begin foraging.  The objective of this proposal is to better understand the effects and interactions of the genes that have been identified.  Genetic analyses will be performed on strains of honey bees that were selected for their differences in foraging behavior.  The genetic relationships between the different components of foraging behavior and the development of foraging behavior will be determined using DNA and behavioral analyses.\r\n\r\nThese studies will lead to a better understanding of the genetic organization of behavioral traits.  Honey bees share many neuro-physiological characteristics in common with other animals, including humans.  However, honey bees are much easier to study because they can be bred, dissected, probed.  What is learned from honey bee behavioral genetics can easily be transferred into the classroom and used as a model for a broader understanding of genetics and behavior.\r\n\r\n",
