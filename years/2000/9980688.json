 "awd_abstract_narration": "9980688\r\nClem\r\n\r\nThis award supports a three-year collaborative research project between Professor John Clem of Iowa State University and Professor Osami Tsukamoto of Yokohama University in Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking a study of AC loss measurements and analysis, and conductor development.  There currently is worldwide interest in the development of high-temperature superconducting composite conductors for various electric power applications, such as ac power transmission cable, transformers, generators, and motors.  The subject of ac losses is a matter of growing concern to those involved in R&D in electric power applications of high-temperature superconductivity.  It is important to find ways of minimizing the ac losses through good design of both the conductor and the device in which the conductor will be used.  The specific objectives of this study are:  1) to develop apparatus to measure ac losses in electromagnetic environments that simulate large-scale electrical power devices; such as power transmission cables and electrical transformers.   2) to develop analytical and numerical methods to calculate ac losses in HTS conductors and electrical power devices;  3) to study the temperature dependence of ac losses in the temperature range 27K - 90K;  4) to investigate the relationship between the ac losses and the metallurgical micro- and macrostructures in the conductors; and  5) to assist in development of conductors with reduced ac losses utilizing the knowledge from these studies.    \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. Expected future benefits of applications of high-temperature superconductors in electric power systems include:  1) increased energy efficiency;   2) improvement of atmospheric quality by reducing CO2 emission via enhanced efficiency and by eliminating the possibility of accidental toxic discharges, which can occur with present devices; and  3) reducing the size of power transmission cables, transformers, motors, and generators resulting from the greatly increased current-carrying capacity.    This research advances international human resources through the participation of postdocs and graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals.\r\n",
