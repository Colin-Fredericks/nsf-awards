 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many stochastic programming problems can be formulated as\r\nproblems of optimization of an expected value function. Quite\r\noften the corresponding  expected value function cannot be computed\r\nexactly and should be approximated, say by Monte Carlo methods.\r\nIn fact, in many interesting examples, Monte Carlo simulation is\r\nthe only  reasonable  way of estimating the expected\r\nvalue function.  It turns out that if the underline probability\r\ndistribution is discrete and the approximating problems are\r\npiecewise linear and convex, then with probability\r\napproaching one exponentially fast, with increase of the sample\r\nsize, an optimal solution of the Monte Carlo approximation problem\r\nprovides an  exact  optimal solution of the  expected\r\nvalue  problem.  This gives a theoretical justification   for\r\nthe  following approach to a numerical solution of such problems.\r\nConstruct and solve a Monte Carlo approximation problem based on a\r\nrelatively small sample. Repeat this procedure several times and validate\r\ncalculated\r\n solutions  until a stopping criterion is satisfied.     The goal of this\r\nproject is to develop this method. The method is ideally suited for\r\nparallel computations and some preliminary experiments  showed good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOptimization of real world systems almost always involves randomness which\r\ncan come in\r\nvarious conceptual forms such as uncertainty, lack of information, natural\r\nvariability of the data, etc.  One may think, for example, about optimizing\r\na manufacturing process when the demand for produced goods is uncertain. It\r\nturns out that solving stochastic  optimization problems involving\r\nrandomness is much more difficult than solving deterministic problems, both\r\nconceptually and numerically. However,  there is obvious practical need for\r\ndeveloping a methodology for dealing with stochastic problems and in recent\r\nyears this was a very active area of scientific research.  This proposal is\r\naimed at developing numerical techniques for solving a particular class of\r\nstochastic problems.  If successful, it will allow numerical solutions of\r\nconsiderably larger problems, which in turn may result in bigger variety of\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Shapiro ,\r\nTel. 404-8946544; Fax: 404-8942301,\r\nE-mail : ashapiro@isye.gatech.edu\r\nhttp://www.isye.gatech.edu/~ashapiro\r\nISyE, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA 30332-0205\r\n\r\n",
