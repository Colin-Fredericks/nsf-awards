 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ozarks RSI proposes to use an existing coalition of school districts in rural\r\nsouthwestern Missouri to initiate systemic reform of science, mathematics, engineering\r\nand technology. The target school districts evidence a desire for reform and the districts' \r\n26,090 students meet the criteria established by NSF.\r\n\r\nDuring the development year, the Southwest Center for Educational Excellence\r\nwill take a strong leadership role in the collection of data and the delivery of services.\r\nThe SCEE has strong performance capacity and has been active in professional\r\ndevelopment and curriculum training since its formation. The leadership team is headed\r\nby Dr. Arch Gordanier, Superintendent at Seneca R-1. Dr. Gordanier and the project\r\ndirector has experience with the El Paso USI and with TIMSS research. They expect to\r\nexpand their coalition of local teachers, business leaders, community members, students\r\nand university officials throughout the development year.\r\n\r\nThe Ozarks RSI's primary goal is to ensure that in international comparisons all\r\nof our students achieve exemplary levels of mathematical and scientific understanding\r\nthrough creating partnerships and networks; applying research; and designing, sharing,\r\nimplementing and disseminating exemplary programs and practices.\r\n",
