 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) Visualization at atomic and molecular levels using STM and AFM has become one of the most important advancements in science and technology in the last decade. While examples of atomic imaging techniques in new chemistry textbooks have enhanced students' visualization of atoms and molecules, the lack of laboratory experiences integrated across the curriculum has impeded the learning processes. As part of a recent campus wide emphasis on materials, we are building this important new technique into the entire undergraduate chemistry curriculum, bridging the gap between coursework and the laboratory. This is being achieved by creating three laboratory demonstration modules for lower level chemistry courses and four hands-on laboratories in upper level analytical and inorganic/materials courses based on the guided inquiry approach to education. Building on the successful experience on this campus in the inorganic/materials laboratory, this approach involves following a verification-type experience with a more open-ended question for students to explore. The types of samples used in the demonstration modules and in the hands-on experiments are designed so that students experience both the visualization of atomic arrangements of ideal solid surfaces, and also adlayer assemblies on surfaces and interfaces.  This project adapts a number of experiments primarily from the research literature to create these new demonstration modules and hands-on laboratories.  Through collaboration with Broome Community College, the applicability of the new materials to the two-year college curriculum is being assured, specifically for use as part of Instrumental Analysis in the Chemical Technology Program.    \r\n",
