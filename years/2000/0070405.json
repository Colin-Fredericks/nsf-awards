 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nDMS-0070405\r\n\r\nMuhly will study a variety of problems in operator algebra that may be\r\ndivided into three groups: General Operator Algebras, Groupoids, and\r\nToeplitz and Related Operators.  Under the first heading are found a number\r\nof problems pertaining to the structure and representation theory of\r\nnon-self-adjoint operator algebras.  The theory of these algebras has been\r\nreinvigorated in recent years through advances in what has come to be known\r\nas quantized functional analysis, i.e., the theory of operator spaces.  This\r\nsubject coupled with the recent work of Muhly and Solel that identifies the\r\nC*-envelopes of various very general operator algebras allows one to make\r\ngood progress on the program proposed more than thirty years ago by Wm.\r\nArveson as a generalization of the Sz.-Nagy - Foias model theory of\r\ncontraction operators on Hilbert space: study the representations of an\r\noperator algebra in terms of the C*-representations of its C*-envelope. In\r\nthe area of groupoids, emphasis will be placed on the study of Fell bundles\r\nover groupoids.  The impetus for this study comes from the representation\r\ntheory of groupoids and from efforts to understand co-actions of groupoids.\r\nFurther, these bundles (more accurately, generalizations of them) occur in\r\nthe theory of product systems and the structure of non-self-adjoint operator\r\nalgebras just mentioned.  Toeplitz operators have long been a subject of\r\nintense interest in operator algebra/theory.  In recent years Muhly and Xia\r\nhave identified the automorphisms of the C*-algebra generated by all\r\nToeplitz operators.  The identification is described in terms of constructs\r\nthat have played important roles in function theory and harmonic analysis on\r\nthe disc.  A particular importance is played by commutator singular\r\nintegrals.   Muhly proposes to extend these results, to the extent possible,\r\nto multivariable settings.  Again, commutator singular integrals should play\r\na decisive role, but the jump to dimensions greater than one presents\r\ndifficult challenges.\r\n\r\nMuhly's work on non-self-adjoint operator algebras, while inspired primarily\r\nby developments in pure mathematics, has connections with problems of an\r\napplied nature, most particularly, mathematical systems theory - the theory\r\nof so-called H-infinity control. This, basically, is a body of knowledge\r\ndedicated to the problem of building machines, such as cars and airplanes,\r\nso that they meet certain performance criteria.  Among these are such things\r\nas the responsiveness of the steering wheel, in the case of cars, or the\r\nrudder, in the case of airplanes.  In short, Muhly's work will contribute to\r\ntheoretical underpinnings of design problems ensuring the safety of all\r\nsorts of conveyances.  Much of Muhly's work on tensor algebras over\r\nC*-correspondences, which has been inspired by the operator theory that\r\nunderwrites this kind of control theory, seems to be usable in multivariable\r\ncontrol problems.  Indeed, quite serendipitously, it appears to be\r\nready-made for multivariable problems.  Muhly expects his research to\r\nprovide a theoretical underpinning of multivariable control problems that\r\nhere-to-fore have been handled by essentially ad hoc methods.  Muhly's work\r\nin non-self-adjoint algebras and the theory of groupoids has made unexpected\r\nconnections with quantum Markov processes - the theory of so-called open\r\nsystems that arise in a variety of places such as the theory of lasers and\r\nmaterials science devoted to super conductivity.  They also arise naturally\r\nin quantum field theory through the constructs known as sectors.  It is\r\nanticipated that Muhly's work will help to provide the mathematical\r\nunderpinnings of quantum field theory and advances in laser and materials\r\nscience.  Finally, Muhly's work on Toeplitz operators has made connections\r\nwith perturbation theories that arise in areas of relativistic quantum\r\ntheory and in quantum chemistry.  It is anticipated that his projects on\r\nhigher dimensional Toeplitz operators will have an increased impact in this\r\narena.\r\n",
