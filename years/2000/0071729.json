The work on surface theory is uncovering\r\npreviously unsuspected qualitative behavior of the principal\r\nfoliations near an isolated singularity (umbilic) in a smooth\r\nsurface in space, which strikingly distinguishes them from\r\ngeneral foliations. This behavior explains the Caratheodory\r\nconjecture and, in many cases, proves the conjecture as a mere\r\nnumerical consequence. The work on elastic membranes establishes\r\nthe equilibrium equation of the most general stretched elastic\r\nmembrane in equilibrium under an applied force field --- a\r\nfar-reaching generalization of the classical Young-Laplace\r\nequation which was only valid for isotropic membranes. The\r\ncontext for this work is the unit circle bundle of the membrane\r\nsurface equipped with the canonical lift (Sasaki metric) of the\r\ninduced metric on the membrane surface; the key idea is the\r\nconstruction of a vector-valued 1-form on this bundle which\r\ncompletely encodes the responding forces of surface tension set\r\nup within the membrane.\r\n\r\nSurfaces are mathematical entities which are fundamental to the\r\nunderstanding of the structure of matter in physics, chemistry\r\nand biology. The surface at the interface of two different types\r\nof matter is frequently modeled by an elastic membrane. An\r\nobserver of an elastic membrane in equilibrium can see the shape\r\nof the membrane, understand the forces that are being applied and\r\neven measure the average surface tension but has no idea of the\r\nresponding forces of surface tension set up within the\r\nmembrane. This work reveals the precise relationship between\r\nthese observables and the internal surface tension forces for the\r\ngeneral membrane.  It follows that the response is never entirely\r\npredictable from the observables (membrane geometry, applied\r\nforce, average surface tension) but that a certain core behavior\r\nis determined --- except for a very remarkable family of\r\nmembranes (whose exceptional nature is defined solely by their\r\ngeometry and not their physics) which live by a different set of\r\nrules. By example, it is shown that the common ad hoc assumptions\r\nof isotropy are seriously flawed. The authors' work on the\r\nprincipal foliations of surfaces has already provided a key\r\nresult which has been applied by Rozoy to settle a long-standing\r\nproblem on the symmetry of a liquid ball in general relativity,\r\nas well as relating streamlines of a plane fluid flow to surface\r\ntheory.\r\n",
