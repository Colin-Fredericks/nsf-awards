 "awd_abstract_narration": "9981501\r\nTaylor\r\n\r\nSpecies Delimitation and Phylogenetic Relationships within Isoetes Using\r\nMultiple Data Sets\r\n\r\nIsoetes are a genus of nonflowering plants which were widespread during ancient times (Paleozoic).  They have a worldwide distribution and diverse ecological adaptations.  Isoetes plants may be found in streams , lakes, and ephemeral pools.  The form of the plant is very simple, consisting of narrow, elongated leaves which produce spores at their base and a swollen root stock.  This simple form (morphology) provides few characters, making the identification of species and determination of species relationships difficult.  In addition, Isoetes species readily hybridize with each other, further confusing our understanding of species limits and relationships.\r\n\r\nThis project has three main objectives: 1) to provide an evolutionary tree\r\n(phylogeny) for the genus throughout the world, 2) to identify and delimit\r\nspecies within Isoetes, and 3) to identify the original parents involved in\r\nthe formation of hybrid species.  Since morphology provides few characters for this group, additional molecular data in the form of DNA sequences will be collected.  In the past ten years, DNA sequence data have been an invaluable tool, helping scientists understand evolutionary relationships in a wide variety\r\nof organisms.  To better understand relationships of Isoetes species worldwide, we will use two DNA regions, one located in the chloroplast genome (atpB/rbcL intergenic spacer region) and one in the nucleus (internal transcribed spacer regions - ITS).  To define species and determine the origin of hybrid species, we will use a highly variable region within a gene involved in plant reproduction (LEAFY second intron).\r\n\r\nThis work is a collaborative effort between Drs. Sara B. Hoot (University\r\nof Wisconsin-Milwaukee) and W. Carl Taylor (Milwaukee Public Museum).  S.\r\nHoot will be largely responsible for the molecular work, C. Taylor will be\r\ninvolved in plant collection (taking him to distant sites in South America,\r\nAfrica and other continents) and morphological studies of Isoetes.\r\n",
