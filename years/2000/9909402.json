These five, new, one-hour programs and feature segments will be on topics that have emerged in recent years as significant developments in the realm of genetic research such as pollution prevention and reduction and the patenting of gene sequences and related genetic information.  Specific topics tentatively planned for the new programs include:  \"The Ecology of Genetic Engineering,\" \"The Genetics of Memory and Aging,\" \"The Genetics of X and the Genetics of WHY,\" and \"Genetic Diseases of the Brain.\"  The programs and features will also introduce those products and processes that, while currently viewed as only future fantasies of the biotech industry, are likely to become real in one or another within the lifetimes of the current generation of public radio listeners.\r\n\r\nThe major outreach component of the project will be via a World Wide Web site.  This is a particularly appropriate medium for outreach for this project since demographic studies indicate that most members of the public radio audience have computers and are able to access the web.  SoundVision will upgrade the present \"The DNA Files\" web site to become a more active and integrated part of the project.  Every program will have a dedicated section on the web site that will provide expended information and resources beyond those included in the broadcast.  The web will provide a forum for public interaction with the issues by engaging the scientists, related experts, policy makers and the public.  The project also will make cassette tapes and transcripts of the programs available on request.\r\n\r\nThe PI is Bari Scott, who is the Executive Producer for the series; Jude Thilman will serve as Project Director.  The programs are hosted by NBC Dateline reporter John Hockenberry and distributed by National Public Radio.  Project advisors in the field of genetics include Elbert Branscomb, Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Troy Duster, Charles Epstein, Ted Friedman, Henry Greely, Leroy Hood, Ruth Hubbard, Sheila Jasanoff, Arthur Kaplan, Daniel Kevles, Mary Clair King, Phillip Kitcher, Julie Korenberg, Michael Malinowski, Desmond Mascarenhas, Pilar Ossario, Gerald Rubin, Lee Silver, and Sylvia Spengler.\r\n",
