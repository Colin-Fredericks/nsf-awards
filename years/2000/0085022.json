 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award provides funding for the development of a highly efficient electrolytic in-process dressing method that is inherently consistent, efficient, and cost-effective in controlling the level of super-abrasive grit protrusion during high-speed grinding.  High-speed electrolytic in-process dressing systems (HELID), an innovative high-speed in-process dressing system, will be developed to overcome the technical barrier existing in today's state-of-the-art electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) method developed in Japan.  The HELID method will be designed to work with a wheel surface speed of up to 350 m/s, while existing ELID does not function well at wheel speeds over 30 m/s.  HELID with a moving-foil electrode and HELID with a hydrodynamic electrode will be studied.    This study will include (1) modeling of the fluid dynamics of the HELID based on the moving-foil electrode and hydrodynamic electrode, (2) modeling of electrolytic process at high speeds, (3) HELID grinding and process control, and (4) simulation and experimental study. \r\n\r\nSharpening or dressing high-speed precision grinding wheels today means that machines have to be slowed down or stopped.  This interruption of high-speed grinding process, reduces productivity and results in inconsistent grinding performance.  Skilled machinists have to be used today as dressing is more an art than a science, making the costly, time-consuming grinding the least automated among machining processes.  Despite considerable research effort over the years, inconsistent and inefficient dressing of high-speed grinding wheels remains a serious problem for industry.   If successful, the results of this research are expected to significantly improve grinding productivity over the existing approaches without sacrificing accuracy and surface integrity.  The method will contribute to the development of scientific tools which can significantly enhance automation in grinding.  \r\n",
