The workshop, organized by Dr. Jaime De La Ree of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and Dr. Hector Altuve of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon in Monterrey, Mexico, will gather experts from universities, electric utilities, and research institutions to promote an exchange of ideas, experiences, and applications of new technologies to power systems.\r\n\r\nWeakly interconnected systems, systems under stress, low margin systems, and longitudinal systems are all special problems to system engineers. Reductions in power plant construction as well as continuous increases in system loads are leading to system stresses with the possibility of more system disturbances and possible brown- or blackouts. On the other hand, advances in microprocessor technology, fast and reliable communication systems, and computer-based monitoring equipment have increased the capacity to record and analyze system events, obtain important information about system behavior under transient or stressed conditions, and develop new protection and control schemes to improve existing power systems.  Experiences attained by field engineers and researchers in Mexico can be of great value to researchers and power industry engineers of the U.S., particularly since the advent of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) requires closer coordination and tie-ins among electric power utilities of both countries.\r\n",
