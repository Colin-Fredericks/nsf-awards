 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to investigate the grinding process with electroplated cubic boron nitride (CBN) wheels.  These wheels are manufactured with a single layer of CBN superabrasive grains held on the wheel hub surface by an electroplated nickel bond.  The sharp superabrasive grain tips protruding from the electroplated nickel binder at the start of grinding progressively dull down with continued use, thereby resulting in a progressive increase in the forces and a corresponding decrease in the surface roughness throughout the wheel life.  This investigation is aimed at characterizing the wheel wear and its effects on the prevailing mechanisms of the grinding process throughout the wheel life.  The research encompasses: (1) characterization of the new (unused) wheel topography; (2) experimental measurement and modeling of how the wheel topography changes due to wheel wear and its effect on the forces, power, and surface roughness during the wheel life; and (3) investigation of the energy partition for calculating grinding temperatures and predicting thermal damage.  Quantitative models will be developed to predict the wheel topography, wheel wear, grinding forces and energy, surface roughness, wheel life, grinding temperatures, and thermal damage. \r\n\r\n          Electroplated CBN abrasive wheels are becoming widely used in the production of precision metallic components especially in the aerospace and automotive industries.  While significant efforts have been directed towards making better electroplated superabrasive wheels, virtually no fundamental research has been reported concerning the grinding behavior with these wheels. The results of the present investigation will provide the analytical basis for predicting and simulating grinding behavior, design of grinding cycles, and optimal control of the process.  As such, it will support the efficient utilization of electroplated CBN wheels by providing the information needed to confidently specify the optimal process parameters for a specific production application. \r\n\r\n",
