 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nProposal: C-CR 0000988\r\nPI: Donald Yeung, University of Maryland\r\n\r\nConventional memory latency tolerance techniques are limited on pointer-intensive applications because pointer-chasing memory references must perform sequentially and prevent the overlap of multiple cache misses.  Pointer-chasing computations, however, traverse several independent pointer chains.  Such independent traversals provide a source of memory parallelism that has remained untapped by the existing latency tolerance techniques.\r\n\r\nThis research develops novel pointer prefetching techniques to exploit \"inter-chain\" memory parallelism.  Compared to existing techniques, the new techniques address more effectively the memory bottleneck for pointer-chasing computations commonly found in non-numeric applications.  The research consists of three major thrusts.  First, techniques are developed to schedule prefetches across multiple independent pointer-chain traversals simultaneously; thus overlapping cache misses from separate pointer-chasing loops or recursive function calls.  Both compile-time and run-time scheduling techniques are investigated.  Second, architectural support is developed to issue prefetch requests according to the required prefetch schedules.  Initially, a prefetch engine capable of traversing pointer-based data structures is studied. The research also investigates into lightweight microthreads to perform prefetching inside a multithreaded CPU.  Finally, compiler support is developed to automatically extract program information for computing the prefetch schedules and for generating the prefetch requests at runtime.\r\n",
