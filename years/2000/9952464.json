 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  The objective of this project is to increase student awareness and understanding of agricultural science and related issues through the production of educational materials to be used in general education undergraduate agriculture and biology courses. The materials being developed are two modules that focus on important plant diseases as models of scientific concepts and societal issues.  Selected plant diseases and epidemics are being used as case studies.  The material being developed provides scientific information and demonstrates how issues related to agricultural science directly impact society. The World Wide Web site already in existence is being redesigned to allow students to further explore topics that are introduced via newly produced film and to engage in interactive virtual laboratory exercises. The Web site and modules are being evaluated in undergraduate courses at the U. of Illinois, U. of Massachusetts, and U. of Wisconsin.  The evaluation is being formative, to guide the direction of the project, and summative, to evaluate the final products and future development of additional materials.  The web site and instructor materials are being presented and demonstrated at regional and national science education conferences. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
