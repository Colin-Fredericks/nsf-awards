The objective of this research is to study the effect of enzyme pretreatment of wood chips in the Kraft pulping process as a means of reducing pulp mill emissions and effluents.  Previous work has shown enzyme pretreatment of wood pulp to be effective and has looked at the role of chip thickness, specie and enzyme combinations.  The current work will be focused on the topological effects of enzyme pretreatment on delignification in Kraft pulping.  This planning grant will afford the PI the opportunity to obtain preliminary results on which to base a full research proposal. ***",
