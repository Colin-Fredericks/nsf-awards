 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three regional higher education organizations, the New England Board of Higher Education, Southern Regional Education Board, and Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education comprise the Compact for Faculty Diversity, an initiative launched in 1993 to address the underrepresentation of minorities in the professoriate.  The Compact formed partnerships with state higher education agencies and public and private universities, to offer minority doctoral students a package of academic and financial support that helps assure their successful completion of their doctoral degree programs and transition into faculty careers.  By the end of 1999, the Compact had served 435 scholars of which 85 had completed their degree programs and 313 remained enrolled and in process.  The Compact has a retention rate of 93%, nearly twice that of most doctoral granting science, mathematics and engineering programs.  This remarkable accomplishment is largely attributable to the quality of mentoring provided.\r\n\r\n",
