 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes a three-year study of the impact of market and regulatory changes on the organizational practices of different hospital units, seeking to understand how hospitals self-regulate to maintain their value systems as they adapt their operational practices in a changing environment. Further, it aims to develop a more refined theory of organizational change and role stress in dynamic contexts than presently exists, exploring the impact of change on organizational and employee outcomes. Finally, the study will develop a valid measure of dynamic chage and empirically investigate its impact on unit effectiveness, an area that has been neglected in past research. Qualitative research centering on interviews with both staff and executives (30-50 interviews per location), archival data review,  and quantitative analysis of a scale for measuring dynamic change as well as mail survey data addressing practices and individual attitudes and outcomes from 600 participants will be conducted at five different subunits of 2 different hospital locations.",
