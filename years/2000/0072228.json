The motion of bubbles through fluids containing \r\nsoluble surfactants is considered first. Experiments show that even trace \r\namounts of surfactants can increase the drag on moving bubbles \r\nsignificantly. Through careful modeling, asymptotic analysis and direct \r\nnumerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the \r\nsurfactant equations in the bulk and on the interface, we address both the \r\nsteady and unsteady problems and in particular evaluate the effect of \r\nsurfactants on wake size and control. Such controls are desirable in \r\nenhanced interphase mass transfer systems. In parallel, we will also study \r\na class of exact Navier-Stokes solutions which emerges in models of \r\nlubrication bearing flows. We have found that such exact solutions can \r\ndescribe the viscous flow between two plates when one or both of the \r\nplates move normal to themselves. When this boundary motion is periodic, \r\nchaotic solutions can emerge at sufficiently high but order one Reynolds \r\nnumbers. These flows are underlying flows whose stability to wavelike \r\ndisturbances is highly complicated since the baseflow is chaotic to begin \r\nwith. We consider such local flows when they are embedded into finite \r\ngeometries. Direct Navier-Stokes computations will be performed in many \r\ngeometries and high frequency limits analyzed asymptotically, in order to \r\npredict transitions to chaos.\r\n\r\nThis work studies mathematical problems in fluid dynamics leading to \r\nscientific computations and analytical problems. The models arise from \r\napplications concerned with enhancing technological processes such as \r\nmaterials processing in microgravity, environmental and chemical \r\nprocesses, biomedical applications and lubrication technologies. We use a \r\ncombination of mathematical and computational tools and intensive \r\ncomputations to elucidate and identify regimes and mechanisms that can \r\nenhance the efficiency of the applications mentioned above. For example, \r\nwe identify, using simulations, situations where flow in squeeze bearings \r\ncan stay laminar rather than become chaotic. Chaotic flows can cause the \r\nequipment to fail with disastrous effects on machinery. Modeling and \r\nsimulations have the advantage, over experiments, of allowing wide \r\nparameter studies and hence help identify critical experiments and design \r\nstrategies. The research is valuable in both benchmarking large scale \r\nsimulations as well as providing direct comparisons with experiments.\r\n",
