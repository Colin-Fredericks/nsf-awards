 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\nThrough a partnership between one of the ATE Centers of excellence and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a research university, the nation's community college and high school classrooms have access to knowledge of emerging environmental technologies and of on-going environmental research. This effort allows environmental technology education programs to not simply react to the changing demands of the workplace, but rather positions students and faculty to anticipate and prepare for emerging developments in the field. The project is defined by two broad goals: (1) to develop curriculum and educational materials that focus upon emerging knowledge and technologies in the environmental field; and (2) to establish a faculty exchange and professional development program to broaden understanding of the connectedness of research to applied education and the workplace. Outcomes of the project include: (1) the development of a series of learning modules focused upon \"Emerging Environmental Technologies\" and \"Environmental Health Impacts\"; (2) community college and high school environmental educators' involvement with MIT scientists in a variety of venues; and (3) a Critical Issues Conference and published report focused upon strengthening the linkage between environmental researchers, educators, and practitioners. \r\n",
