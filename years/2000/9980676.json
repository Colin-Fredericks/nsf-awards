 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tAccurately representing the dynamics of the springtime polar stratosphere is crucial for predicting the extent of ozone depletion and its influence over lower latitudes, yet general circulation models (GCMs) typically do not handle this aspect of the meteorology well enough to allow for a successful coupling of dynamics and chemistry.  The research under this award will explore some of the key, and as yet not well understood, dynamical processes that are involved.  The results should ultimately lead to improvement of dynamics-photochemistry coupling in GCMs. \r\n\r\n\tThe co-principal investigators plan to carry out observational and theoretical investigations of the seasonal and interannual variability of the meteorological conditions of the polar stratosphere, focusing on understanding the dynamics of the final warming over the poles.  Horizontal mixing and diffusivity and the evolution of wave activity will be examined in an application of the quasi-Lagrangian perspective originally developed by Dr. Nakamura .  The co-investigators will employ several gridded assimilated analyses as the basis for the observational studies and also conduct numerical experiments with a hierarchy of idealized models.  They also plan to compare and contrast the evolution of the warming as it occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic.\r\n",
