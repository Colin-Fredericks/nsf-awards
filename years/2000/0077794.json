Application of mathematical methods to biology is revolutionizing our understanding of subjects ranging from genomics to cancer to environmental change.  During this time of rapid growth in mathematical biology, the goal of the meeting is to highlight current top-level research, to provide a perspective on future research areas, to provide opportunities for career development to junior researchers, and to foster interactions between established researchers and junior researchers.  The meeting includes scientific sessions on epidemiology, biofluids, molecular motors, theoretical ecology, cancer dynamics, and immunology.  Beyind this, it incorporates a careers session, an education minisymposium, and a new mentoring program to nurture employment in the subject, improve the way it is taught, and provide contacts for junior researchers.\r\n\r\n     Biology is becoming a more mathematical subject.  Insights gained from applying mathematical methods to biological problems are reshaping our understanding of everything from the genome up to entire ecosystems.  This conference describes recent advances in several areas.  It also includes sessions that aim to foster both the development of junior researchers and greater interactions among biologists and mathematicians.\r\n\r\n",
