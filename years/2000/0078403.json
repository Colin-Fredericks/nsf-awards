 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project deals with the fabrication of\r\nultra high strength Polymer/Metal Multi-layers (PML) nanolaminates.  In Phase I, Sigma Technologies has demonstrated that the Aluminum/Polymer nanolaminates have distinctive advantages over Aluminum, (a) a superior tensile strength (over 3 fold in some cases), (b) and a lower density.  Furthermore, Sigma has developed, based on experimental results, a numerical model to predict the tensile strength of multilayer\r\ncomposites.  The attractive features of the PML composites have generated a significant interest in this product by a major aerospace and avionics OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer.   Additional functionality of this composite includes ultra-high gas and vapor barrier, high electrical conductivity, electromagnetic shielding, preferential heat conductivity that is useful for low observable applications, and structural self-monitoring characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn Phase II, Sigma will further optimize the properties of the PML composites and upgrade equipment that is already in place to produce 7ft x 4ft PML panels.  Parts will be tested independently by Sigma and its industrial and university partners.  Market research has shown that several applications may be served by the multifunctional structural PML composites.  Sigma will follow a systematic plan to identify niche markets and supply samples for evaluation.\r\n",
