 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)  This project establishes a model for industry/academic collaboration that is suitable for small to medium sized institutions with few local major employers. It adapts and implements the NSF-funded ISCC '99, Educating the Next Generation of Information Systems Specialists in Collaboration with Industry. It scales the new information systems centric curriculum to fit the resources of small institutions.  It focuses on the development of a sequence of experiences, including both study of theoretical foundations and practical experience, that will enable graduates to be productive members of an IT development team in the area of networking. The content of both the formal coursework and all practical experiences will be determined in collaboration with campus computing services personnel and regional industrial representatives. \r\n\r\nThe project implements a three-credit hour course covering basic concepts in networking, with hands-on laboratory work to reinforce the concepts covered in class; a campus networking internship program in computing services in which selected students will gain about 50 hours of networking experience in an environment containing over 3000 networked computers and 30 servers; a one-credit hour course covering more advanced topics in networking that will be closely coordinated with the work experiences of the campus interns; an off-campus internship program in which selected students will work at industry partners; and a formal process for evaluating the preparation and performance of the interns.  By offering students a strong combination of theoretical concepts, supervised hands-on laboratories, and work experience, selected in collaboration with practitioners, students should be able to compete effectively in the marketplace for career opportunities in networking.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
