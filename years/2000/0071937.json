 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smith\r\n0071937\r\n     The investigator studies the mechanisms responsible for the\r\ngeneration of slow, large-scale motions from fast, small-scale\r\nmotions in stratified turbulence and rotating, stratified\r\nturbulence.  Because the earth's atmosphere and oceans are\r\nstratified fluids in a rotating frame, the work is highly\r\nrelevant to geophysical applications.  Many aspects of\r\nwave-turbulence interactions are yet to be understood.  For\r\nexample, it is not clear if, when and how small-scale 3D\r\nturbulence in the presence of waves can organize into large-scale\r\ncoherent structures (as in 2D flows).  In purely rotating flow,\r\nthe investigator previously showed that white-noise forcing at\r\nsmall scales leads to the generation of slow, large-scale,\r\ncyclonic vortical columns, if the Rossby number is below a\r\ncritical value of order one.  This is surprising because recent\r\nwork using multiple scales analysis shows, at first order,\r\ndecoupling between fast, small-scale motions and slow,\r\nlarge-scale motions for a variety of wave-turbulence systems\r\nincluding rotating flow.  Several second-order mechanisms may be\r\nresponsible for the upscale energy transfer to slow modes in\r\nrotating turbulence.  This project goes a step further towards\r\nunderstanding the large-scale dynamics in geophysical flows, by\r\ninvestigation of upscale energy transfer in 3D stratified and\r\nrotating, stratified turbulence.  The investigator explores the\r\nnecessary conditions leading to such upscale transfer and seeks\r\nto identify the underlying mechanisms.  Simplified systems of\r\ndispersive wave turbulence are used to test understanding and for\r\nthe development of statistical models.  To complement numerical\r\nsimulations and analysis, she has also planned laboratory\r\nexperiments in a rotating tank, where the turbulence is driven by\r\ndifferentially-rotating, rough top and bottom plates.\r\n     Over relatively short time periods in rotating and/or\r\nstratified flows, there is both experimental evidence and\r\nmathematical support for the decoupling of slow, large-scale\r\nmotions from fast, small-scale motions.  This means that, on time\r\nscales of perhaps days in the atmosphere and weeks in the oceans,\r\nlarge-scale eddies and currents evolve independently from\r\nsmall-scale turbulence.  Another implication is that short-term\r\nclimate change is independent from rapid fluctuations of the\r\nconditions in the atmosphere and oceans.  Our numerical\r\nsimulations for longer times, however, show the generation of\r\nlarge-scale, coherent structures from small-scale turbulence, and\r\nthis coupling may be important for long-term weather prediction,\r\nocean circulaton and climate change.  In the context of the\r\natmosphere, one might ask, can small-scale cumulus convection at\r\nlength scales of about ten kilometers generate large-scale eddies\r\nof several thousand kilometers in extent?  The transfer of energy\r\nfrom fast, small-scale motions to slow, large-scale motions in\r\nthree-dimensional, wave-turbulence systems such as rotating and\r\nstratified flows has only recently been discovered, even though\r\nsuch transfer has been studied for decades in two-dimensional\r\nflows.  The present study involves numerical simulations, modeling\r\nand analysis, and laboratory experiments in a rotating tank.  The\r\ngoals are to deepen our understanding and improve our capability\r\nto predict geophysical phenomena.\r\n",
