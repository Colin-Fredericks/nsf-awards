 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a prototype instrument ready for field-testing. Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of a radically simpler infrared gas sensor based on MEMS photonic bandgap structures. This instrument will sensitive enough to compete with water vapor measurements made by much larger, more complex equipment, but cheap enough to be treated as a 'throw-away' device.  Unlike current infrared instruments, assembled from many discrete components, it features a highly integrated 'sensor-on-a-chip' employing advanced surface modification technology\r\nand semiconductor fabrication methods. This new, integrated approach replaces discrete-component instruments in much the same way integrated circuits have superseded distributed elements in electronic systems. In addition to the potential for atmospheric research applications, the proposed device is a stepping-stone to next-generation gas sensors for environmental and industrial monitoring.  The phase I project showed proof-of-concept while establishing sensitivity and signal-to-noise performance and developed drive circuits and other components to achieve necessary stability. Most important, this project achieved a breakthrough by demonstrating tunable, narrow-band, emission from a photonic bandgap surface structure.\r\n\r\nThe proposed device is a simple, low-cost, lightweight alternative to conventional infrared absorption instruments. By reducing weight, complexity, and cost, it opens applications beyond the reach of current infrared instruments. It is the first step towards next-generation gas sensors for indoor air quality, environmental research, and industrial controls.\r\n",
