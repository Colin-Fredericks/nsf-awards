 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor William Taylor of the University of Central Arkansas is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on metal ions complexed with hydrocarbons in the gas phase.  Transition metals are frequently used as catalysts for activating hydrocarbons, but it is not understood how reactivity depends on the electronic state of the metal.  This proposal seeks to study the reactivity of several late first-, second- and third-row transition metal ions with small hydrocarbons as a function of electronic excitation of the metal.  Low energy ion drift cell and electronic state chromatographic methods will be used to study reactive systems such as platinum ion and methane.  A successful outcome of this proposal would be a model of transition metal reactivity that would allow better catalysts to be designed.  Important issues in this model include considerations of electron configuration and conservation of electron spin. New results from the larger metals proposed will be interpreted in the light of the PI's previous results on first row chemistry.\r\n\r\nTransition metal ions have the ability to break sigma bonds, and this property is most useful in converting hydrocarbons to other compounds.  Understanding the mechanism of this process will allow design of new and better catalysts for use in chemical synthesis and the petroleum industry.\r\n",
