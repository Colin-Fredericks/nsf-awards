 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing with Shapes: Reconstruction and Decimation\r\nTamal Dey\r\nOhio State\r\n\r\n\r\nComputations with shapes are prevalent in a number of application areas ranging over CAD/CAM, medical imaging, physical simulations and so on. We propose studying two of these computations, namely,  reconstruction and decimation. The choice of these two operations is prompted by their imminent relevance in applications, our ongoing research on them, and their rich theoretical challenges. We focus mainly on low dimensional shapes such as curves and surfaces in two and three dimensions. These shapes are ubiquitous in applications and  their understanding is essential to move forward to higher dimensional shapes.\r\n\r\nBy reconstruction we mean computing a piecewise linear approximation of a shape from a set of sample points. Modern technology with laser scanners has made it easy to obtain a dense set of sample points from the boundary of an object. A piecewise linear approximation from these sample points help to model the object for prototyping, visual inspection, and further reengineering. The problem has been studied by graphics community who used numerical approaches to the problem. Computational geometers attacked the problem with ideas from discrete and differential geometry. Although a considerable success has been made by these approaches, there are growing demand from the industry to handle shapes with boundary, sharp features, noise which cannot be tackled robustly with the current methods. \r\n\r\nDecimation of a shape is the process of reducing the size of the data structure representing the shape. The model reconstructed from a sample may have a large number of elements such as triangles since the input sample set is typically large. Such a model with large number of elements becomes unwieldy for further processing such as graphic rendering or physical simulations. A standard strategy is to reduce the number of triangles by edge contractions. In this method selected edges are contracted to a new vertex. All incident simplices are contracted accordingly. Different kinds of demands on the geometry and topology of the shapes during decimation are put forward by multitude of applications. While some of the applications need to preserve the topology, the others want to change it in a controlled manner. The investigator with other researchers in the community studied the problem of preserving topology during edge contractions. The question of allowing topology change in a controlled manner is still largely unsolved. \r\n\r\nThe geometry of the shape depends on the location of the new vertex replacing the contracted edge. An effective numerical tool used for this purpose is the quadric error measure that tries to optimize the the sum of distances of the new vertex from the planes of the neighboring triangles. This strategy tends to produce an anisotropic mesh whose triangles are elongated according to the curvature of the shape. Although anisotropic meshes are preferred in some applications, there are others who favor isotropic meshes that have triangles with bounded aspect ratio. Can we produce an isotropic mesh after reconstruction and decimation? Instead of decimating the model after reconstruction, is it possible to decimate the sample itself? In a recent work, the investigator tries to address this issue. This work is far from complete and we propose to continue it for new results.\r\n\r\nTheoretical studies proposed for this project would require combining ideas from topology and geometry, a central issue in the emergent field of Computational Topology. New algorithms will be developed as a result of our theoretical study, but their ultimate proof of performance will be tested through implementation which is also part of our agenda. \r\n",
