Estimates of\r\nthe growth rate of penetration of the Internet among the population\r\nshows that its use is growing faster than previous innovations\r\n(telephones, radio, and television) that have already become nearly\r\nuniversal in industrialized nations.  The majority of the U.S.\r\npopulation will soon be using the Internet for communication, commercial\r\ntransactions, and entertainment. The Internet also provides an exciting\r\nnew medium for the conduct of behavioral research.  By means of Internet\r\nresearch, it is now possible to accomplish in a few weeks what used to\r\nrequire six months or a year.  Because the World Wide Web makes\r\navailable an extremely heterogeneous, international sample, it becomes\r\npossible to examine the generality of laboratory research to demographic\r\ngroups that have rarely been studied in previous research.  This allows\r\none to investigate if conclusions from laboratory research are unique to\r\ncollege sophomores tested in university labs or if they have external\r\nvalidity to a larger population tested under more naturalistic\r\nconditions.\r\n\tAre the cognitive processes used by the general population on the\r\nInternet the same as those used by students in university laboratories? \r\nThere are two aspects to this question that need to be distinguished. \r\nThe first is that the people tested are different, so any difference in\r\nresults may be due to differences in education, age, wealth, or other\r\ndemographic differences among the groups tested.  The second aspect is\r\nthat the Internet medium itself may itself induce different modes of\r\nthought, reasoning, judgment, and decision-making.  This research\r\nexplore these questions.\r\nThis is a proposal to continue and expand an on-going program of\r\nresearch on the Internet.  In addition to experiments on judgment and\r\ndecision-making on the Internet with 6,000 participants, I propose\r\nto conduct surveys of behavioral scientists about the Internet and to\r\ncreate tools that will make it easier for students and newcomers to\r\nInternet research to adapt their studies to this new medium. By\r\ncomparing lab and Web studies, the validity of both procedures can be\r\ntested.  By comparing the results for different demographic groups, it\r\nis possible to examine the linkage between such characteristics and\r\nresearch findings. If behavioral research conducted via the Internet\r\nlives up to its potential, then the process of facilitating the transfer\r\nof such research to the Internet can result in acceleration of the\r\nscientific enterprise.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
