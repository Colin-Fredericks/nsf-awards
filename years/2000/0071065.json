This, in turn, would provide a new tool for\r\nstudying the arithmetic properties of two-variable p-adic\r\nL-functions.  It would also clarify how analytic families of galois\r\nrepresentations degenerate at semistable non-crystalline points and\r\nwould describe monodromy  at such points in terms of a deformation in\r\nthe weight direction, thus enlarging the standard picture of\r\nmonodromy in potentially useful ways.  This research would also\r\ncomplement Kato's recent work on values of L-functions and K-theory of\r\nmodular curves by providing tools for deforming Kato's theory in\r\np-adic analytic families.  In related work, the PI hopes to develop\r\na p-adic Eichler-Shimura correspondence that would relate his\r\ntheory of  overconvergent modular symbols to Katz's theory of\r\noverconvergent modular forms and to construct analytic families of\r\nnon-ordinary half-integral weight modular forms by generalizing a\r\np-adic theta lifting developed in earlier work of the PI. Finally,\r\nthe PI intends to generalize these ideas to automorphic forms on\r\nother reductive algebraic groups.  This research offers promising\r\ntools for the construction of p-adic analytic families of\r\nnon-ordinary automorphic representations together with natural\r\ndeformation spaces of Galois representations, and\r\nmultivariable p-adic L-functions.   This is connected with a\r\nnumber of investigations,  including p-adic monodromy, Jochnowitz's\r\nconjectures on the square root of the theta operator,  and  the\r\np-adic deformation theory of Galois representations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigations of this proposal belong to the general\r\nmathematical area of Arithmetic Geometry.  This ultramodern research\r\narea combines two of the oldest branches of mathematics:  number\r\ntheory and geometry.   New insights arising out of this\r\ncombination are producing increasingly powerful tools to solve\r\nlongstanding problems like Fermat's Last Theorem, which have\r\nresisted the strongest efforts of over three centuries of\r\nmathematicians.  In addition, though Arithmetic Geometry is sometimes\r\nregarded as the purest of pure mathematics, it has also been\r\ndeveloping insightful new techniques  leading to dramatic progress in\r\nsuch applied areas as error-correcting codes and cryptography.\r\n",
