 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project between Michigan Technological University (MTU) and Southwest\r\nTexas State University (SWT) focuses on the fabrication and testing of photonic crystals in magnetic\r\noxides for novel integrated photonic device prototyping. The project responds to the growing interest in\r\nphotonic crystals for device applications based on their unique optical band gap properties. While various\r\nnovel optical band-gap structures have been fabricated in non-magnetic dielectric media for highly efficient\r\nwaveguiding, filtering and resonator applications, very little work has been done on photonic crystals in\r\nmagnetic systems. One-dimensional structures have received some attention, although this work is still\r\nvery limited and remains mostly theoretical. Higher dimensional systems have not been investigated at all.\r\nGiven the novelty of the field of magnetic systems in photonic crystal applications, the proposed project\r\nwill consist of a one-year exploratory effort to assess the applicability of magnetic materials in photonic\r\nband-gap structures.\r\n\r\nThe non-reciprocal properties of magnetic oxides, such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG), make these\r\nmaterials a unique choice for optical isolator and circulator fabrication. Optical fiber telecommunications\r\nhave developed to the point where the monolithic integration of different optical components is a serious\r\nissue to reduce costs in local area networks and long-distance data transmittal. In particular, noise\r\nsuppression at the source is an important driver for the development of on-chip optical isolators. However,\r\nconventional systems utilizing non-planar geometries are both bulky and expensive. Photonic crystal\r\nstructures provide a novel alternative to address this problem since they can significantly enhance the Kerr\r\nand Faraday response, making it possible to build smaller and cheaper isolators and circulators\r\n\r\nA program to develop photonic crystal devices based on magnetic systems is a high-risk high-\r\npayoff undertaking. It is high-risk because the use of photonic crystals in magnetic systems is a completely\r\nnew and virgin field. Most of the work developed thus far has been theoretical, although a few\r\nexperimental successes have been reported. Certain aspects of the sputtering work required for the\r\nfabrication of one-dimensional magnetic photonic crystals remain partly unexplored and may require\r\nparticularly careful fine-tuning of the sputtering conditions. In particular, special attention must be paid to\r\nthe formation of highly smooth interfaces in the magnetic photonic crystal stack given the large number of\r\nlayers that make up these structures.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the innovation presented by the use of photonic crystals in magneto-optic isolators\r\nis that of a tremendous reduction in length in the polarization rotator afforded by a corresponding\r\nenhancement in Faraday rotation. However, the impact of this program, if successful, would not be just the\r\ndevelopment of ultra-short isolators but the enabling of actual on-chip commercial integration of magneto-\r\noptic isolators. This is because the integration of these devices onto planar structures has been hindered by\r\nthe presence of linear birefringence in optical waveguides. The difficulty arises because waveguide\r\ndimensions comparable to the optical wavelength induce a phase mismatch between transverse-electric\r\n(TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes, degrading the isolation efficiency. The qualitative reduction in\r\ndevice length envisaged by the use of photonic crystal structures promises to eliminate the phase matching\r\nstumbling block to the integration of isolators into photonic circuits. In that sense, this program has the\r\npotential to revolutionize optical communications technology, by allowing the on-chip fabrication of a\r\ncritical component for communications systems.",
