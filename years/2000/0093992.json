 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solna\r\n0093992\r\n     The investigator analyzes how a propagating wave pulse\r\nbehave in a medium with rough variations.  Predicting the\r\nevolution of the wave pulse from information about the\r\n`roughness' of the medium is a problem of deep mathematical and\r\npractical interest, as is the inverse problem of deducing\r\ninformation about the medium from measurements of a transmitted\r\npulse.  Most often a detailed description of the (fine scale)\r\nvariations of the medium is not possible, only a description of\r\ntheir statistical character.  Hence, the investigator considers\r\nthe fine scale medium variations as a realization of a stochastic\r\nprocess.  This entails analysis of differential equations with\r\nrandomly varying coefficients.  The project has three specific\r\nobjectives: First, obtain a characterization of the\r\ntransformation of sound pulses propagating in a medium with a\r\ncontinuum of length scales, a medium defined in terms of a random\r\nfractal.  Second, extend and use theory about the transformation\r\nof a wave pulse in some specific inverse problems, in particular,\r\nhigh contrast seismic imaging and time reversal mirrors.  Third,\r\nderive strict bounds for how an electromagnetic pulse can be\r\naffected by the medium heterogeneity without knowing the details\r\nof these variations.\r\n     The main question the investigator addresses is: How does a\r\npropagating wave behave in a medium that varies when the\r\nvariations are not small?  For instance, when a laser beam\r\npropagates through the turbulent atmosphere how is it affected by\r\nintense, turbulent, variations in the local speed of propagation?\r\nWhen such medium variations are smooth, say with a constant\r\nspeed of propagation, the problem is well understood.  For rough\r\nmedium variations, as in the above example, the interaction of a\r\nwave pulse with the medium heterogeneities is a fundamental yet\r\nlargely open question.  This problem, predicting the evolution of\r\nsignal or wave pulse that propagates in a rough medium, is of\r\ndeep mathematical and practical interest.  In addition to wave\r\npropagation in the turbulent atmosphere there are many other\r\napplications.  In reflection seismology the earth's crust is\r\nprobed with a wave pulse and the reflected pulses are used to\r\ninfer knowledge about macroscale variations in the medium.  It is\r\nthen important to know how the rough microscale variations in the\r\nmedium affect the probing pulse.  Remote sensing, ocean acoustics,\r\nand medical imaging provide similar examples.  In communication\r\nsystems, it is important to be able to describe how medium\r\nimperfections and variations affect the propagating signal.  In\r\nthe theory of composite materials, it is important to optimally\r\nconstruct a complex material so that it has some desired\r\npropagation properties.\r\n\r\n",
