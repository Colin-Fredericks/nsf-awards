 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 600 MHz NMR will be used by many researchers at the University of Kansas and neighboring institutions for a wide variety of studies.  Researchers in the Department of Chemistry will use the instrumentation to characterize humic substances, and to analyze the speciation, metabolism, and fate of herbicides in the environment.  Structural studies of designed hemoprotein models and studies of novel transition metal catalyzed methods to complex phosphorous and sulfur compounds are also planned.  Researchers in structural biology, in the Department of Molecular Biosciences and the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, will use the instrumentation for studies of biomolecules and interactions of biomolecules.  Planned studies include the study of the structure and dynamics of proteins and protein complexes involved in transcription initiation, studies of the proteins comprising intercellular junctions, studies of the structural and functional aspects of protein oxidation, studies of proteins involved in bacterial secretory systems, and studies of ATPase protein subunits.\r\nThe instrumentation will include an actively shielded Oxford 600 MHz magnet and state-of-the-art Varian INOVA electronics console and peripherals.  This will include 4 radio frequency channels, complete waveform generation capabilities on all channels, triple axis pulsed field gradient capabilities and deuterium decoupling capability.  The shielded magnet will allow the system to be housed in newly renovated space with a new 500 MHz instrument.\r\nA major benefit of the instrumentation will be the direct enhancement of graduate and postdoctoral study in the chemical and biochemical sciences at the University of Kansas, as the research programs of many of these young scientists are dependent on such instrumentation, as does their education.  Undergraduate research and training will likewise be enhanced significantly, as many undergraduate students, including the numerous student fellows in the very active summer research programs, are involved directly in research which will utilize the instrumentation.  Furthermore, the University of Kansas is committed to fostering an environment that encourages diversity and the education of under-represented groups, particularly in the sciences, and this instrumentation will have a significant impact on this commitment.  The undergraduate teaching mission of the University will also be impacted through integration of results of research utilizing the instrumentation into classroom discussion and problem solving.  Finally, the instrumentation will have a significant impact on faculty recruitment and retention, and the ability of faculty to compete effectively for extramural support.\r\n",
