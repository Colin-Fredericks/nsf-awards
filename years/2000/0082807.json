 "awd_abstract_narration": "Application Service Providers (ASPs) - which distribute the use of software, rather than the software itself, via the Internet - are increasingly coming to be seen as one of the next major elements in the development of network services. This project will study and test the application of the ASP concept in an area where it is likely to have a particularly great influence: software for large-scale optimization. The complexity and variety of optimization software present challenging obstacles to the development of network services, but the exceptional variety and modularity of this software insure that successful efforts will have a broad impact in science, education, and business.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the project will build on previous work by the Optimization Technology Center of Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory. One subproject will investigate resource allocation for optimization requests whose needs cannot be easily forecast. Others will involve the design and testing of both client-side and server-side object class libraries that have no models in current mathematical computation. The project will also include the automation of algorithm choice and solver scheduling, through the construction and use of a database to learn from results of previous optimization requests and from human experts. The project thus brings together methods, software, and systems for computational large-scale optimization, with the aim of making the impressive technology in this area more accessible for applications, algorithm development, and education.\r\n\r\n",
