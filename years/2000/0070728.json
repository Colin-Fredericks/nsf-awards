 "awd_abstract_narration": "The (de Rham) cohomology, based on differential forms on a smooth\r\nmanifold, provides an analytic representation of singular cohomology. \r\nFor natural spaces which are not smooth, like complex algebraic\r\nvarieties, singular cohomology is available, but some of its useful \r\nproperties no longer hold and there is no good analytic representation. \r\nHowever, the de Rham cohomology of forms with moderate growth near the \r\nsingular set provides a good alternative, because it satisfies duality \r\nand (Hodge) filtration properties like those in the smooth case. \r\nThe investigator and his collaborators study this cohomology in two \r\ncases, where the variety has isolated, point singularities and where \r\nit is the minimal compactification of a locally symmetric space. In \r\nthe latter case certain natural functions are studied, with the goal \r\nof proving that they are modular forms. A second line of investigation \r\nconcerns quadratic forms defined over the ring of regular functions \r\non an algebraic variety. The investigator relates these quadratic \r\nforms to quadratic forms defined on the rational function fields \r\nof all subvarieties, in much the same way that holomorphic functions \r\nare related to meromorphic functions and their residues. The \r\nconsequent connection to certain multiplicative structures on ideals \r\nin the ring of regular functions is explored.\r\n   The first part of the project pursues a program to study \r\nwrinkles (singularities) in a space. If this space were a surface, \r\nwrinkles would typically occur near places where the degree of \r\nturning (called curvature) is very high. One part of the project \r\nis then to quantify this degree of turning, with the eventual goal \r\nof understanding what sorts of wrinkles can occur singly or in groups. \r\nSome of the problems in this project come up in physics, especially \r\nstring theory, to which the the investigator and his collaborators \r\nintend to apply the methods they develop. The second part of the \r\nproject concerns questions about abstract number systems, in particular \r\nwhether a given (abstract) number is a perfect square, or the sum of \r\ntwo or more perfect squares. Such questions have been studied for \r\ncenturies in the mathematical subfield called number theory. More \r\nrecently, the intractability of the problem of finding certain \r\nperfect squares, even with a computer, has been shown by other \r\ninvestigators to be the basis of certain protocols which guarantee \r\nthe secure and fair electronic exchange of information.",
