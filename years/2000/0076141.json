 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Professor Wayne Gladfelter of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is a renewal of an earlier award and is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division and the Electronic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research.  The focus of the research will be to study the chemical vapor deposition of mono- and multimetal oxide films from anhydrous metal nitrates.  The award also will evaluate the ligand controlled kinetics and microstructure mechanism of the deposition processes, and studies to determine relationship between the deposition mechanism.  Another component of the award is the study of atomic layer chemical vapor deposition of multicomponent oxide.  In addition, the research will provide training to students in an important interdisciplinary area of materials chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award will study the ligand controlled kinetics and microstructure mechanism of the deposition processes, and studies to determine relationship between the deposition mechanism and film composition during the chemical vapor deposition.  Various thin metal oxide films will be prepared by chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer chemical vapor deposition under this program and these amorphous high dielectric materials may be used for the fabrication of thin films with tunable electronic and photonic properties.  In addition, the research program will provide a rich multidisciplinary education and training opportunity to students in material chemistry.",
