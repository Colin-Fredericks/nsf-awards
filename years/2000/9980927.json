 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n \r\nThis project is developing a collection of demonstrations and experiments for hands-on, active learning in digital signal processing. Its goals are to enhance student learning, reform teaching methods, and improve outreach efforts to K-12 and during on-campus tours. Within the University of Rhode Island's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Experiential Signal Processing Laboratory (ESPLab) provides a centralized facility for three different undergraduate curricula: electrical, computer, and biomedical engineering. The facility is supporting in-class demonstrations, regularly scheduled laboratories, and independent student projects. \r\n\r\nThose programs whose ideas being adapted are: (1) Georgia Tech and Rose-Hulman bring DSP concepts into much of their undergraduate electrical engineering curricula. Georgia Tech's effort, called \"Technology First\", mixes the use of computer technology with the theoretical and analytical skills normally developed in undergraduate courses.  (2) The Univ. of Colorado at Boulder provides an interdisciplinary learning arena (laboratory) across all four years of their curriculum. In the sophomore and junior years, theory courses are augmented with hands-on, open-ended explorations.  Implementation involves a three-year plan to develop demonstrations and experiments in digital signal processing. These will be employed to improve student learning in nine regular courses (two engineering college wide freshmen courses and seven junior and senior level courses in the electrical, computer, and biomedical engineering curricula) and through four special open-ended undergraduate courses.\r\n\r\n Specific experiments and demonstration projects being developed include variable-rate audio sampling, real-time speech processing, digital FM radio, audio/video streaming, real-time data compression, digital position control of a laser spot, accelerated processing of angiograms and mammograms, detection of QRS waves in electrocardiogram, digital control of neuronal membrane potential, and computerized imaging of kinetic experiments. By emphasizing experiential learning, the proposed ESPLab is impacting 13 existing courses across the three curricula. The common experimental platform is also helping students reinforce their problem solving abilities and develop marketable DSP hardware skills. The effectiveness of the project is evaluated with the help of a faculty associate with expertise in education and assessment. Dissemination of results from this project is accomplished through a dedicated web site, publications in relevant conferences and journals, and faculty development workshops.\r\n",
