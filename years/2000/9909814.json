 "awd_abstract_narration": "9909814\r\nJain\r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers from the University of New Mexico (UNM) will cooperate with the University of Auckland (Auckland/New Zealand) to perform basic studies related to the quantum engineering of advance ultrafast two-photon absorption (TPA) semiconductor devices with the objectives of elucidating all the key steps leading to optimized ultrafast TPA devices for lightwave communication systems.  Specific technical objectives include the design and fabrication of new quantum-confined structures, measurement of the precise magnitudes of the TPA coefficient, demonstration of novel processingmethods that will lead to an increase in the effective bandwidth of TPA photonic devices, and detailed linear and non-linear spectroscopic studies of these devices.\r\n\r\nThe field of two photon absorption in semiconductors is of mutual interest to both countries (US/NZ), as investigations in this basic area of optics provides an excellent opportunity for the training/education of future scientists and engineers specializing in photonics, in addition to its applicability in ultrafast optical communications.  This collaborative effect will benefit the UNM researcher team through Auckland's expertise in fundamental properties of nonlinear optics in semiconductors, and in materials research & processing issues regarding growth of quantum-confined structures (quantum wells & quantum dots) and related device fabrication.\r\n",
