 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy education researchers require a validated content assessment instrument.  The Collaboration for Astronomy Education Research has designed a 21 question test (the Astronomy Diagnostic Test, ADT) for undergraduate non-science majors that covers selected astronomical topics likely to be included during undergraduate non-science instruction.  This instrument is intended to be given as a pre-test and as a post-test.  The ADT was administered to approximately 2500 students at 26 different institutions during 1999.  Approximately fifty video and audio interviews, and thirty written responses for each questions were collected during 1998 and 1999.  Preliminary statistical analysis and validation tests have been done for the ADT.  This project would complete the validation process through consultation with a psychometrician, disseminate the results, construct a dedicated web site providing access to the instrument along with databases for comparison of results with other similar institutions, and explore the needs of the community for a \"next generation ADT.\"",
