Berkeley \r\n\r\nThe investigator proposes six intertwined research projects, all on the \r\ninterface between group theory and geometry.  For the most part these \r\nproposals are geometrically motivated approaches to specific problems in \r\nmodern harmonic analysis connected to the representation theory of \r\nsemisimple Lie groups.  The first is an approach to construction and \r\nanalysis of singular unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups,\r\nin two steps: (i) geometric construction of those representations, as Frechet \r\nspace representations on cohomology of homogeneous vector bundles over \r\nflag domains, and (ii) transforming the representation space to a space of\r\nfunctions on a Stein manifold defined by a system of differential equations,\r\nby means of a double fibration transform (the complex Penrose \r\ntransform is a particular case) from the flag domain to its linear cycle \r\nspace.  The second project is an approach to construction and analysis of \r\nunitary and other representations for a class of infinite dimensional Lie \r\ngroups, the direct limits of finite dimensional Lie groups, especially strict\r\ndirect limits of finite dimensional real and complex reductive Lie groups,\r\nboth in the analytic category and in the algebraic category.  The third\r\nproject is to complete the investigator's work on the Harish-Chandra \r\nSchwartz space of a general semisimple Lie group, by synthesizing structural \r\nanalyses of the relative Schwartz spaces.  The investigator's fourth project \r\nis to complete his development of a direct reading of the character and \r\ngrowth properties (asymptotics) of admissible representations of finite \r\ndimensional real reductive Lie groups from the basic data that specify their \r\nconstruction on cohomology spaces of homogeneous vector bundles\r\nover flag domains.  One goal here is to do this in such a way that is\r\ndirectly applicable to the first and second projects.  The fifth project\r\nis to continue some earlier work on control theory and numerical analysis, \r\nespecially observation point placement problems and numerical quadrature \r\nschemes, based on structural results and a priori estimates that come out of\r\nthe representation theory of real reductive Lie groups.  The sixth \r\nproject, not directly analytic in nature, is to follow up on the investigator's\r\nrecent discovery of a strange relation between isoclinic spheres in\r\nGrassmann manifolds, composition of quadratic forms, normal forms for \r\nspaces of antisymmetric bilinear forms, and the construction of flat\r\nhomogeneous pseudo-riemannian manifolds.\r\n\r\nThese six research projects all depend on the use of symmetry to clarify\r\nanalytic (and in one case geometric) problems.  Traditionally symmetry\r\nconsiderations are used to simplify matters by decreasing the number of\r\nvariables, but here they are used to enable the use of insight, tools and\r\nresults from geometry and analysis.  The symmetries are embodied in group \r\ntheory, which in fact is the algebraic abstraction of the notion\r\nof symmetry.  But modern Lie group theory incorporates classical analysis\r\n(calculus, differential equations...) and is closely tied to the geometry\r\n(riemannian, symplectic, kaehler, ...)  of the spaces on which the groups\r\nact as symmetries.  An important aspect of this synthesis of \r\ngeometry and analysis is a geometric form of quantization that is \r\nparticularly well suited to the sorts of finite dimensional groups \r\nconsidered in several of the projects.  This geometric quantization, \r\noriginally inspired by physics and developed in some detail by mathematicians, \r\nhas in turn been very useful in a variety of settings in mathematics and \r\nphysics.  This is very much the case in five of the six projects, where the \r\ngeometric quantization is combined with modern differential geometry to\r\nunderstand various analytic problems.  This is especially evident in the first \r\nproject, whose objective can be viewed as a sort of dequantization.\r\n\r\n",
