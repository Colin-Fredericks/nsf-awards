 "awd_abstract_narration": "Avi Wigderson\r\n9987845\r\nThis project will explore the mathematical depth of the abstract notion of computation, as well as explore its connections to other sciences.  The cross-fertilization between theoretical computer science and the other sciences and the education of scientists prepared for the science of the future will be major goals of a new program of the School of mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study.  The grant mainly supports postdoctoral visitors.\r\nPostdoctoral education at the Institute for Advanced Study is unique in that the Institute's small size, coupled with the extraordinary dedication of the permanent Faculty to their roles as mentors of young scientists, creates an unusually productive atmosphere for interaction.  The research environment at the Institute is intellectually challenging because it is both deep and sustained.  The intense and extended process that occurs at the Institute cannot happen in the course of a short-term exposure of computer scientists to mathematicians and to other scientists in other situations.  What happens at the Institute is extended immersion, and we feel that there is no institution where this challenging and unusual educational process can occur as well as at the Institute.\r\n",
