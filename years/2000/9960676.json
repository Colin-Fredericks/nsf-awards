 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project significantly broadens the monitoring capability of the Brims Ness continuous on-line monitor to include harmful, water-borne organic contaminants. It combines a new technology, molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) which are selective for individual organic molecules, with the monitor's quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor device. This will expand contamination detection capacity to include dioxins, PCBs, furans and other toxic organic contaminants\r\nwhich dominate the Super Fund priorities list.  This advance builds upon the success of another recently completed Phase I project which validated the performance of a low-cost, continuous on-line monitor to detect the presence of heavy metals in an aqueous flow. That project combined two existing, mature technologies, ion \r\nexchange resins to select individual heavy metal and other selected ions, and the QCM sensor device to measure the ion selection.  The technology will allow full automation of monitoring functions at sites which must now use periodic sampling to detect contaminants. The project will lead to a broad range of commercial \r\napplications including (1) municipal water utilities, (2) wastewater treatment plants, (3) process industries, (4) food processors, and (5) entities reliant on groundwater wells.",
