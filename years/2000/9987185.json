Manifolds are geometric objects \r\nwhich locally resemble the space of Euclidean geometry; but \r\ncould be quite different globally. For example the surface of \r\nthe earth, on a small scale, can be thought of as Euclid's plane. \r\nBut on a large scale, it is more useful to model it on the\r\nsphere. One way to detect global differences is to travel \r\nlong distances, return and see if something has changed. For \r\nexample, if you walk around the surface of a Moebius band, \r\nyou'll return on the opposite side. The collection of all \r\ntravel routes (up to continuous deformation) forms an algebraic \r\nobject called the Poincare group of the manifold. A basic \r\nconjecture formulated almost 50 years ago by A. Borel is \r\nthat the Poincare group of a closed aspherical manifold \r\ndetermines this manifold up to a continuous bijective \r\ncorrespondence. Closed means without boundary but finite in \r\nextent. The Moebius band, for example, is not closed but \r\nthe sphere is. Aspherical means that any continuous image \r\nof a sphere bounds the image of a ball.  Spheres of \r\ndimension bigger than two and correspondingly higher \r\ndimensional balls must be allowed in this definition. \r\nFor example, the Borel conjecture is true for the surface \r\nof a doughnut.  However, the sphere itself is \"clearly\" \r\nnot aspherical.\r\n\r\nFarrell in collaboration with L.E. Jones have verified \r\nsome important cases of Borel's conjecture and will continue \r\nto work on it. One interesting question is whether there is \r\na \"best of all possible\" maps giving the continuous bijection. \r\nIt was once thought that the unique harmonic homotopy\r\nequivalence does this in the case both manifolds are \r\nnegatively curved.  Farrell, Jones, and P. Ontaneda have \r\nrecently shown that this is not so in general. (Farrell,\r\nOntaneda and M.S. Raghunathan extending this work have \r\njust produced such examples even with pairs of diffeomorphic \r\nmanifolds: i.e. the harmonic map homotopic to the diffeomorphism \r\nis not univalent.) But it is still open whether this harmonic \r\nmap is always cellular.  Note if so this would contradict \r\nthe Poincare Conjecture.  Another problem to be investigated \r\nis whether any finite group of symmetries of the Poincare \r\ngroup lifts to a group of symmetries of the closed aspherical \r\nmanifold provided the Poincare group has trivial center. The \r\nthrust of this problem is to find interesting cases where \r\nit is true.  The case of surfaces is, for example, the \r\nclassical Nielsen problem solved by Kerkhoff. Farrell and \r\nJones have already obtained some other positive partial \r\nresults on this problem. In their work on these geometric \r\nproblems, Farrell and Jones have formulated conjectures \r\nabout the structure of the algebraic K and L theories of \r\nan arbitrary group ring. They will continue their work on \r\nverifying these conjectures. Again the thrust of this effort \r\nis to give positive solutions for interesting groups\r\n",
