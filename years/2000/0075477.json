It will run from\r\nmid-August till mid-December 2000. The program will end with a\r\na Contact Geometry Workshop. The goal of the program is to capitalize \r\non recent progress in contact geometry. It seems that the time is ripe now\r\nfor new breakthroughs in the field, and that the concentration of both\r\nestablished and young researchers in contact and symplectic geometry and \r\nrelated areas, as well as participation of several graduate students, may \r\nhelp to produce new remarkable results.  The organizers feel that a \r\ncoherent picture of contact geometry in 3 dimensions is within reach.\r\nIn particular,  the participants will try to achieve a complete \r\nclassification of contact structures for large classes of 3-manifolds, \r\nto make further advances in the theory of Legendrian and transversal\r\nknots in contact 3-manifolds, and to establish further properties of contact\r\n3-manifolds which serve as boundaries of symplectic 4-manifolds.\r\n\r\nContact geometry was born more than two centuries ago in the work of \r\nHuygens, Hamilton, Jacobi as a geometric language for optics. It was \r\nsoon realized that it has applications in many other areas, including\r\nnon-holonomic mechanics and thermodynamics. One encounters contact geometry \r\nin everyday life when parking a car, skating, using a refrigerator, or \r\nwatching the beautiful play of light in a glass of water. Sophus Lie, \r\nElie Cartan, Darboux and many other great mathematicians devoted a lot of \r\ntheir work to this subject. However, till very recently most of the results \r\nwere of a local nature. With the birth of symplectic and contact topology \r\nin the Eighties, the subject was reborn, and  the last decade  witnessed a\r\nnumber of breakthrough discoveries. There were found new important \r\ninteractions with Hamiltonian mechanics, symplectic and sub-Riemannian \r\ngeometry, foliation theory, complex geometry and analysis, topological \r\nhydrodynamics, 3-dimensional topology, and knot theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails of the program can be found at http:/math.stanford.edu/contact.html\r\n \r\n",
