Zoological parks and museums are wonderful educational resources, but research has shown that visits to them have very limited educational value, in particular for children.  The investigators, Dawn Yonally of California State University, San Marcos, and Sue Dale Tuncliffe of Homerton College, Cambridge, propose to design a research project that addresses the response of elementary students and their accompanying adults to museum and zoological exhibits.  In order to gauge  their educational effectiveness, the investigators will use criteria developed by the Office of Standards in Education in the United Kingdom.  The ultimate aim of their long-term project will be to provide data and the complementary pedagogical expertise of the investigators.  For purpose of this study, the investigators plan to develop a project involving exhibits at the London and San Diego zoos, two of the largest and finest zoological parks in the world.\r\n\r\n",
