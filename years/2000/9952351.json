 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13)  Building on previous work by Laws and Luetzelschwab in Workshop Physics, and on previous work at Pacific University to develop lower level and advanced level participatory physics courses, this project is developing an intermediate program of physics teaching. The course, Modern Physics with Health Applications, moves the focus of teaching from a lecture-based and laboratory structure to a project-based approach. The course is being designed around four extended small group active-learning projects - Nuclear Medicine; Radiation Therapy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Neutron Activation Analysis.\r\n\r\nThe course extends the scope of inquiry-based courses in the curriculum and offers a highly relevant physics program for students planning to go into health schools and other health-related fields. By creating a classroom environment at each level of teaching that encourages inquiry, experience, and active learning about physics, the course may also have a substantial influence on how science is taught elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
