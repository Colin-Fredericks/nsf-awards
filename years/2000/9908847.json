 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trabecular bone is found primarily in the joint regions of skeletal elements and consists of an interconnected network of bony rods and plates.  It has been hypothesized for over a hundred years that trabecular bone plays an important structural role in the musculoskeletal system of animals and that it dynamically responds to applied loads through growth.  Despite this hypothesized importance, there has been very little work examining the structure and mechanics of trabecular bone.  The objectives of this study are threefold: 1) to quantify the three-dimensional structure of trabecular bone in the femoral head of lorises and galagos - small primates from Asia and Africa, 2) to determine the significance of any structural differences, and 3) to assess the utility of trabecular bone structure for the reconstruction of locomotor behavior in extinct primates.  These objectives will be addressed by quantifying the structure of trabecular bone in three-dimensions and by constructing finite element models to determine the stress distribution in the hip joint.  The determination of a relationship between trabecular bone structure and locomotor behavior will, in turn, provide insights into the anatomy, behavior, and locomotion of primates including humans.  This study will lead to a greater understanding of the importance of trabecular bone in the hip joint of primates, thereby increasing our knowledge of the relationship between behavior and bone morphology.  In addition, an understanding of bone structure will contribute to our understanding of bone development and bone loss in humans and other primates, leading to an increased awareness of the role of physical activity and behavior on the development and loss of bone in general.",
