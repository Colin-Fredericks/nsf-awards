The driving question of the proposal is: when are the\r\ngeometric genus and the Hilbert-Samuel function topological?\r\nThe proposal has three parts. The main message of the first part  is that for those Gorenstein singularities whose link is a rational homology sphere, the work of Artin and Laufer on rational, respectively  on minimally elliptic singularities can be continued.\r\nThe optimism is partly based on the author's recent work on Gorenstein elliptic singularities with rational homology sphere links. For these singularities \r\nthe author proved among  other facts that their geometric genus\r\nis topological: it is exactly the length of the elliptic\r\nsequence (in the sense of S. S.-T. Yau). \r\nThe first step in any general investigation is the testing of the \r\nconjectures in some non-trivial particular cases. In the second part of the \r\nproposal the case of suspension singularities is discussed in more details.\r\nThe third part of the proposal deals with higher dimensional \r\ngeneralizations of the Artin-Laufer program. \r\n\r\nLocal analytic spaces are defined by locally defined analytic functions,\r\nin particular they carry a lot of analytic invariants. A very important\r\nquestion in their classification is the following: can these analytic  \r\ninvariants be determined from the topological description of these spaces? \r\nIn the case of complex  surface singularities, the topological structure\r\nis determined from the link of the singularity which is an\r\noriented 3-manifold. The goal of the project is to describe some of the \r\nanalytic information of the singular space in terms of this 3-manifold\r\n(in those cases when it is possible). \r\n\r\n",
