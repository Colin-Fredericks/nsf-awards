The underlying principle of the combinatorial approach is to systematically synthesize large numbers of catalyst compounds and screen them quickly.  This approach enables researchers to make well-informed decisions in the discovery process, find unexpected trends, and gather a large amount of data about the underlying reaction mechanisms.  A novel spectral imaging system, which permits the simultaneous measurement of the IR spectra of many products, permits in situ parallel investigation of chemical reactions.  A number of preparation techniques can be used to establish proper conditions; the methodology of testing a large number of samples lends itself to combinatorial methods.  The reaction systems proposed for the study include several important surface-catalyzed processes such as NO reduction and solid-phase supported organic reactions.  The PI has developed a unique instrument for FTIR analysis of compounds immobilized on surfaces or within organic polymer matrices.  This project may establish the principles for rapid advances in the development of new heterogeneous catalysts.\r\n\r\n",
