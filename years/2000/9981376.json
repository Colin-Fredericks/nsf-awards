 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many ecosystems, the dominant habitat patches frequently change in terms of their overall quality or their resource levels. Periodically, habitat patches may be physically disrupted or destroyed. In such highly dynamic systems it often is assumed that mobile fauna will be unresponsive to the arrangement of habitat patches or to other landscape attributes. The underlying logic is that faunal responses to landscape attributes will be masked by the spatial and temporal variability of such systems. In this proposal, we argue that mobile fauna in highly dynamic systems are, in fact, responsive to landscape attributes - especially patch arrangement. Population persistence and species interactions following the disruption of patches or changes in resources may be influenced greatly by the quality and arrangement of patches. In prior NSF-funded research, we found that stream-dwelling chironomids and copepods respond to the quality and distribution of habitat (leaf) patches in laboratory and field experiments, but we did not consider how patch stability, patch resource (leaf species) composition, or predator-prey interactions influence faunal dynamics. Here, we hypothesize that invertebrate abundance in streambeds is better explained at the scale of multiple patches (the \"landscape\") than at the scale of individual patches; is directly linked to the interactive effects of patch arrangement, patch stability, and patch quality; and, that invertebrate response to these three factors is modified by the presence of fish predators.\r\n\r\nWe propose three field experiments to test the following specific hypotheses: (1) in stable landscapes (no patch movement), the abundance of stream invertebrates depends on patch arrangement and patch quality (leaf species composition); (2) when patches are not stable, the abundance of invertebrates depends on the interactive effects of patch arrangement and the level of patch stability; and (3) the response of stream invertebrates to patch arrangement, quality, & stability is influenced by the presence of predatory fish. To test the first two hypotheses, we will manipulate patch arrangement and patch stability or leaf quality using repeated measures factorial designs. For the third hypothesis, we will manipulate predator abundance and one landscape attribute at a time (patch arrangement, patch stability, or leaf quality). We will follow changes over time in the abundance of invertebrates at the level of landscapes, although we also will be able to assess variability within and among the individual patches that constitute each landscape.\r\n\r\nThis work has important implications because we are asking if and how changes in landscapes --in terms of patch types and their arrangement and their resource levels -- influence biotic assemblages. Much of the current understanding of biotic responses to spatial landscape features is based primarily on theoretical and empirical work on systems in which the landscape features are fairly stable. Since many systems are highly dynamic -- patches move and patch quality varies temporally -- the type of research proposed here is greatly needed. As in our past grant, this research will be conducted as a collaborative effort between P. Silver at Penn State Erie, an undergraduate institution, and M.A. Palmer at University of Maryland College Park, a large research institution. The PI's, undergraduates, graduate students and a post doctoral associate will collaborate in all phases of the work, thereby providing maximum opportunity for students to participate in high quality research in an atmosphere of intense teamwork and collaboration with workers at a large research campus and a small primarily teaching campus.\r\n",
