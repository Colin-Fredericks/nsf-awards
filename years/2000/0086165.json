 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wind River Rural Systemic Initiative (WRRSI) has been promoting quality\r\nRSI programs for the Wind River Indian Reservation students for the past five years.\r\nPhase II funding will allow WRRSI to expand its focal area and serve approximately\r\n2,150 students, of which 95% are Native American.\r\n\r\nThe need for science and math systemic reform on the Wind River Indian\r\nReservation is documented by test scores showing Native students still score below the\r\nstate average. WRRSI's Phase I data shows that their programs have made a difference,\r\nhowever, as Wyoming has now adopted statewide standards and has begun to require\r\nstatewide standardized tests, WRRSI must continue to work to improve these\r\ntraditionally under served students' scores.\r\n\r\nPhase II programming will include:\r\n\r\nOn-going professional development opportunities for teachers on the\r\n       Wind River Indian Reservation;\r\nSummer school and after school activities for K-8 students;\r\nSummer institute for 9-12 grade students;\r\nAn integration of culture into the curriculum; and\r\nCareer awareness and job shadowing programs.\r\n\r\nData collection over the next five years will be extensive. WRRSI will develop\r\ndatabases for both students and teachers. Teacher databases will document professional\r\ndevelopment opportunities and courses taken. The student database will document\r\nstudent achievement and participation in program offerings; track students after they\r\nleave high school; and allow WRRSI to determine program effectiveness by comparing\r\nstudents participating in programs to those not participating.\r\n\r\nWRRSI's underlying goal is to provide Native American students with a solid\r\nbase in science and mathematics to provide opportunities and choices to compete \r\nat the college level. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
