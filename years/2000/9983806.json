The development of digital technology is facilitating advances in virtually every area of science.  Further advances will surely accrue as the technology improves. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this award is to build an education and a research program in digital image processing. The development of digital technology is facilitating advances in virtually every area of science.  Further advances will surely accrue as the technology improves. \r\n\r\nThe rapid development of digital technology is due to work that spans several disciplines. As a result, students interested in this area must cobble together courses from a range of departments.  Even if students are able to take all of the necessary courses, the material is certainly not presented to them within a cohesive framework.  One objective of this award is the creation of a curriculum for the study of digital image processing. This curriculum will draw from topics in computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, optics, and psychology.\r\n\r\nThe second objective of this award is the creation of a research group dedicated to topics in digital image processing and computer vision. My group will undoubtedly be involved in a variety of research projects, but the emphasis will be on studying the mixing process that typifies the formation of digital images.  This research will have a dual focus: (1) the first focus will be in separating the various components that contribute to the appearance of an image (e.g., lighting, reflectance, and shape); (2) the second focus will be in understanding how these image components are mixed to form natural images, and in characterizing the statistics of natural images.\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of digital technology is due to work that spans several disciplines.
