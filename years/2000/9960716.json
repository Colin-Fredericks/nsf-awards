 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop instrument control interfaces such as knobs and sliders with force feedback to create input-output devices capable of displaying feel to human operators. Flat-screen displays have significantly advanced the visual display of information in aircraft, automobile, and equipment interfaces. Similar advances for the sense of touch have not occurred - interfaces still use the same inflexible types of instrument controls (knobs, sliders, buttons, etc.) available decades ago. Exploration by the company suggests the potential for human factors benefits from advancing the state of the art in instrument controls by giving them programmable feels. Performance will benefit through the provision of meaningful, intuitive information to the underutilized sense of touch. These systems also could simplify interfaces by reducing the number of separate controls. One control could operate two or more carefully chosen functions, each function having a distinctly separate 'feel'. Instrument controls with programmable feels have the potential to revolutionize operator interfaces for all types of equipment and vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will leverage technologies proven in the company's other touch display products. Further development will create cost-effective, manufacturable instrument controls with feel display. A huge potential market exists for vehicle interfaces, professional equipment, and consumer electronics.",
