 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering -Technology (58).\r\n\r\nThis project is addressing three areas in the field of electronics-manufacturing technology known as Surface Mount Technology (SMT): 1)Implementation of SMT as a replacement technology for older component technologies; 2)Education of other faculty members on SMT concepts, since they must now be able to utilize SMT-type components in their courses; 3)Quantitative analyses of SMT-implementation processes.\r\n\r\nThese areas must be addressed not only at Purdue, but at all institutions which use older-style \"through-hole technology\" (THT) components. These components are widely used in Electrical Engineering and Electrical Engineering Technology programs because their lead configuration allows easy use of temporary connection systems known as breadboards. However SMT components do not lend themselves for easy use of breadboards. The second issue follows the first, since faculty must also understand SMT as many of the integrated circuits used in their courses are now only available in SMT packages. In addition, quantitative analysis is a cornerstone of any SMET curriculum. Currently many of the process steps in SMT are taught using qualitative analysis of results. \r\n\r\nThe ideas for this project are adapted from the NSF-sponsored, \"Faculty Enhancement Workshop on Assembly and Packaging of Microelectronic Devices\". The equipment is being used to implement ideas in the area of absorption of moisture by IC packages, opening and inspection of microelectronic packages, and laboratory on board level packing. In addition, the implementation of these topics at Purdue will add quantitative measurements of the microelectronic and board level packages.\r\n",
