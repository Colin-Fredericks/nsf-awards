Both labs contribute expertise in ab initio MO calculations. Together, their objective is to measure the bond and ionization energies of gaseous organometallic complexes.  To do this, a number of cyclopentadienyl- and carbonyl-containing cobalt and manganese complexes will be used.  Specifically, the researchers expect to derive information concerning: 1) the adiabatic and vertical ionization energies of the stable organometallic molecules; 2) the photoelectron spectrum of the stable organometallic molecule; and 3) the bond energies of the organometallic ion not only as found in the organometallic species produced by thermolysis but also the lignad itself.  If successful, results should improve our understanding of metal-organic lignad interactions and may contribute to the future design of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.   \r\n\r\nThis international project in experimental physical chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. \r\n",
