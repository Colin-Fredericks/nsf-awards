 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major emphasis of this research project is the solid state chemistry of new classes of extended solids that are of electronic, magnetic, and/or catalytic importance.  The purpose of this interdisciplinary research program is to provide means for student education through synthesis, characterization, and correlation studies of novel solids.  The aim of the proposed research aligns with the goals set forth in the 1998 NSF Workshop Report on the Current Status and Future Developments in Solid State and Materials Chemistry.  The scope of the proposal is two-fold: 1) mixed-framework compounds containing structurally confined transition-metal-oxide lattices, and 2) open-framework solids via salt-inclusion reactions.  The project covers a broad range of fundamental inorganic chemistry, including synthesis, structure, bonding, electronic structure, magnetochemistry, and materials chemistry.  Compound characterization will be directed toward revealing and understanding the bond strength, spin-spin and spin-lattice interactions, band structures, the onset of metallic properties associated with finite transition metal oxide structures, and the formation of metal-containing-microporous and mesoporous frameworks exhibiting superior structural and physical properties\r\n\r\nThis study will contribute valuable knowledge needed to achieve state materials synthesis by design.  This well integrated research and education project will generate scientifically skilled students and postdoctoral fellows able to make a timely impact on the advancement of materials research.\r\n",
