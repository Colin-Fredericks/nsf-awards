 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n0076486\r\nAtwater\r\n\r\nThis grant will help develop quantitative electrostatic force scanning probe \r\nmicroscopy.  The project includes modification of a commercial ultrahigh \r\nvacuum scanning probe microscope and development of new electrostatic force \r\nmicroscopy simulation software.  The program comprised both ultrahigh \r\nvacuum electrostatic force microscopy measurements and development and \r\ntesting of finite element electrostatic simulation software describing \r\ntip-sample interactions, including van der Waals and electrostatic force \r\ncontributions .  This will enable more quantitative understanding of \r\nnanometer-scale charge distributions and low mobility electronic \r\ntransport.  The immediate scientific use for the instrument will be in a \r\ncollaborative Caltech/Bell Labs/NASA-JPL multi-investigator research \r\nprogram aimed at probing charge injection and storage in silicon \r\nnanoparticle structures for nonvolatile memory applications.  Information \r\nand software needed to perform quantitative EFM will be disseminated to the \r\nmaterials research community.\r\n\r\nElectrically insulating thin films are critical and ubiquitous components \r\nof electronic devices such as integrated circuits and micromechanical \r\ndevices.  Trapping of electronic charge, whether by design or as an \r\nunintended effect, is a common characteristic of insulating thin films.  It \r\nis desirable to be able to quantitatively measure the extent of and \r\nmechanisms for charge trapping in order to better understand the \r\nperformance and reliability of insulating thin films.  Scanning probe \r\nmicroscope techniques such as electrostatic force microscopy have opened a \r\nnew vista in the understanding charge trapping in insulators because they \r\nenable measurement at nanometer-scale spatial resolution and total charge \r\nsensitivity down to the single electron level.  To date, such electrostatic \r\nforce microscopy measurements have been used as a qualitative but not a \r\nquantitative tool for understanding charge trapping in insulators.  This \r\nproject aims to put the electrostatic force microscopy method on a firm \r\nquantitative foundation, through a combination of measurements and \r\ndevelopment of simulation software needed for quantitative \r\nunderstanding.  The results will be applied to characterize charge trapping \r\nin nonvolatile floating gate memory device materials containing \r\nsemiconductor nanocrystals.  These materials and the devices made with them \r\nare very promising candidates for the next-generation of ultradense, \r\nlow-power nonvolatile \"flash\" memory chips like those now used widely in \r\nportable electronic devices such as wireless telephones, pagers, electronic \r\ncameras and personal digital assistants.\r\n",
