Schur-class functions arise as the characteristic function for a \r\ncontraction operator in the operator-model theory of Livsic-Brodskii, Sz.-\r\nNagy-Foias and de Branges-Rovnyak, as the transfer function of a unitary \r\ncolligation (or energy-conserving discrete-time, input-state-output linear \r\nsystem), and as the scattering function of a discrete-time scattering system \r\nin the sense of Lax-Phillips and Adamjan-Arov.  A major theme of the \r\nproject is to develop this same confluence of ideas for various \r\nmultivariable systems.  In the first such multivariable setting, the \r\ngeneralized Schur-class function is analytic and contractive on the unit \r\npolydisk in multidimensional complex Euclidean space, and is the transfer \r\nfunction of an energy-conserving multidimensional system of the type \r\nconsidered by Roesser.  The geometry of which scattering systems \r\nactually arise from a conservative Roesser input-state-output system lends \r\ninsight into which contractive functions on the polydisk satisfy a von \r\nNeumann inequality (i.e., induce a functional calculus which maps tuples \r\nof commuting contraction operators to another contraction operator).  In \r\nthe second incarnation, the generalized Schur-class function is a power \r\nseries in finitely many noncommuting variables, and is the transfer \r\nfunction for a system with time parameter taken to lie in a free semigroup \r\nwith finitely many noncommuting generators.  This analysis will give \r\nadditional insight (on the system and scattering theory side) to recent work \r\non model theory for row contractions and function theory on the ball in \r\nmultidimensional complex Euclidean space.  In the third incarnation, the \r\ngeneralized Schur-class function is actually a contractive bundle map \r\nbetween two parahermitian bundles defined over an algebraic curve \r\nembedded in complex Euclidean space.  This analysis will lead to a \r\ndiscrete-time version of the Livsic multivariable system theory and a \r\nmodel theory for commuting tuples of nonunitary operators, as well as \r\nanother multivariable scattering theory.  Finally, the project includes an \r\napplication of some of these ideas to nonlinear settings, specifically, the \r\ndevelopment of a nonlinear H-infinity control theory for nonlinear systems \r\nwith stopping cost, switching cost, and/or boundary state-space \r\nconstraints.\r\n\r\nThe notion of an energy-conserving (or more generally, dissipative) \r\nsystem has long been a fundamental notion in a number of disciplines \r\n(e.g., classical and quantum mechanics and circuit theory).  A more recent \r\ngeneralization of this notion allows interaction of the system with an \r\noutside environment through input and output signals, and the enlargement \r\nof the energy bookkeeping to take into account energy exchange with the \r\noutside environment.  This notion in turn, together with the function and \r\noperator theory associated with it, has been fundamental in recent \r\nadvances in the theory of robust control, where the engineer seeks to \r\ndesign a feedback control to guarantee satisfactory performance of a \r\nsystem even in the presence of unmodeled disturbances in the outside \r\nenvironment and/or modeling errors in the mathematical description of the \r\nsystem.  The goal of this project is to push these ideas in fundamental, new \r\ndirections, namely: (1) new types of multidimensional systems and \r\nscattering, and (2) nonlinear systems with discontinuities arising from (a) \r\ninstantaneous switching of the control setting, or (b) instantaneous jumps \r\nin the state dynamics caused by boundary reflections. The first direction \r\nhas direct application to systems that evolve in both time and in a spatial \r\ndimension, as well as to uncertain systems with a modeled parameter-\r\nvariation uncertainty and certain types of nonlinear systems.  The second \r\ndirection is relevant to physical systems where instantaneous jumps occur \r\nbetween two or more continuous-model descriptions (hybrid systems) \r\n(such as in the setting of a traffic signal at a highway intersection), as well \r\nas to systems where the set of admissible values for some physical \r\nquantity has a boundary which leads to a boundary reflection in the system \r\ndescription (such as the constraint that the queue lengths be nonnegative in \r\na queueing network).\r\n",
