 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposer plans to continue his work on inverse boundary problems. For\r\nthe case of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) he plans to consider the\r\nproblem in which one makes electrical measurements only on part of the\r\nboundary. In EIT he also plans to consider the case of conductivities\r\nhaving jump type singularities as well as the identifiability problem for\r\nanisotropic conductors. Another inverse boundary problem that the proposer\r\nplans to consider is whether the geodesic distance (travel times) between\r\npoints on the boundary of a domain or Riemannian manifold with boundary,\r\nsatisfying certain conditions, determines uniquely the metric in the\r\ninterior up to an isometry which is the identity on the boundary. The\r\nthird inverse problem is the problem of Reflection Seismology. In\r\nparticular the proposer plans to consider the problem of seismic migration\r\nwhen caustics are present and the case in which the Earth is modeled as an\r\nanisotropic elastic medium instead of an acoustic medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInverse boundary problems are a class of problems in which one seeks to\r\ndetermine the internal properties of a medium by performing measurements\r\nalong the boundary of the medium. These inverse problems arise in many\r\nimportant physical situations, ranging from geophysics to medical imaging\r\nto the non-destructive evaluation of materials. The proposer plans to\r\nconsider the case of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). The\r\nmeasurements in this case are voltage and current measurements from which\r\none attempts to infer the internal conductivity of the medium. EIT has\r\nbeen proposed as a diagnostic tool in medicine since organs and tissues\r\nhave quite different conductivities. Another important inverse boundary\r\nvalue problem arising in geophysics that the proposer plans to consider is\r\nReflection Seismology. In this case one attempts to determine the\r\nsubstructure of the Earth by measuring the response at the surface\r\nproduced by impulses located also on the surface. One of the main\r\napplications of this inverse problem is in locating hydrocarbons.Other\r\npotential applications are to improving ultrasound and sonar.\r\n\r\n",
