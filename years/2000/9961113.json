 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scientific Data Management (SDM) project from Psychology Software (PST) Tools Inc. addresses the critical need for safe and secure scientific data retention and management with current distributed computing technology.  Experimental behavioral testing of the user interface drives the design of the proposed system.  PST will investigate SDM in behavioral, economic, biological, and social sciences.  Currently, there are few options to meet government requirements for the retention and use of scientific data.  Existing options are expensive, complex, and difficult to use, and designed for other organizational environments.  As a result, most academic scientists are not meeting government retention and scientific ethics guidelines.  The proposed technology uses a scalable distributed computing architecture, suitable for a single laboratory or many investigators spread across an institution.  PSI proposes to study how scientists, data entry, and data administrators manage data, as well as develop a user interface that makes the system a scientific data management 'appliance'.  Java technology will be used to create clients for use in WWW browsers and servers for retrieval and report generation.  The system provides long life expectancies for data, beyond the useful life of the applications that create them.  Data submitted to the system are timestamped and catalogued, providing important information for assuring data quality.\r\nPsychology Software Tools proffers a user-centered design of an entire suite of data management tools that are customized to meet the particular needs of research scientists.  The technology is of potential value to the National Science Foundation in its concern for the accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of research results as well as to the scientific community.  Significant progress in the area of data management along with progress in processing and storage power and in expressive power are important to advancing Information Technology.\r\n\r\n",
