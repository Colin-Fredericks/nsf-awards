She will test two potential mechanisms of soil community dynamics that may influence establishment of exotics. The first mechanism, the degradation of mutualists hypothesis postulates that exotic species have reduced dependence on soil mutualists and therefore do better in the face of disturbance.  The second mechanism, the escape from pathogens hypothesis suggests that exotic species are freed of their native soil pathogens, thereby facilitating their establishment.  The PI and collaborator Bever will conduct green house experiments in which they will monitor the growth of plant species in pots inoculated with a range of soil communities.  As a POWRE awardee, the PI will continue outreach activities to undergraduate students as part of her effort to enhance the number of young women scientists and to enhance the scientific knowledge of Women's Studies students.  This will advance the PI's career by allowing her unique exposure to new tools and allow her to return to field biology after some time away.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
