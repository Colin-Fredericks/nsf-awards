The course will be held in Alajueata, Costa Rica June 21-30, 2001.  Lecturers for the PASI will be selected from an international advisory committee consisting of top researchers in the area and will come from a broad selection of countries and institutions in the continent.  Because most of the research at the nanoscale crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries, the organizers have chosen to cover topics in five major areas: self-organized semiconductor nanostructures; carbon nanotubes, buckyballs, and molecules, materials and electronic transport; magnetic nanostructures; structure and epitaxy of low-dimensional systems; and theory of low-dimensional systems: transport, optical properties, and correlation/interaction effects.  The course will combine lectures with poster sessions for the presentation of research studies and results by junior and other participants in order to foster content-specific interactions.  These interactions should be helpful in laying the groundwork for future collaborations.\r\n",
