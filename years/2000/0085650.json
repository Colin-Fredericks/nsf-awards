 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States' global positioning system (GPS), NAVSTAR, consists of a\r\nconstellation of 24 satellites orbiting in high altitude. GPS receivers\r\nthat can be placed in any type of vehicle, including automobiles, trucks,\r\nbuses, airplanes, trains and ships, calculate their position on the earth\r\nbased on their distance from four or more of these satellites. This ability\r\nto determine the location of vehicles in time has many useful applications\r\nin transportation including tracking vehicles on networks for navigation or\r\ntravel surveys, as well as collecting and storing data about the networks\r\nof roads, waterways or even pipelines for facility inventories. Although\r\ndevelopment of a technique such as that proposed here to map GPS point data\r\nto linear network configurations has many applications, it is routing\r\nbehavior and route choice as an improvement to traffic assignment models in\r\nurban planning that are specifically of interest to this researcher.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a mathematical model to\r\ndetermine routes on networks from GPS point data in order to automate the\r\nroute data collection process such that the recording of routes can become\r\nroutine and widespread.  The data points collected by GPS receivers for the\r\nroute of a vehicle travelling in a transportation system are recorded as\r\nsingle points in space.  Network segments such as roads, even though they\r\nhave two dimensions including width, are represented as one dimensional\r\nlines in a GIS or other network database.  Even if there were not errors in\r\nboth the GPS points and the network data it would be necessary for the GPS\r\npoints to be translated to links in order to consider the route behavior or\r\noptimize it in the network system. Currently, errors that can not be\r\ncompletely eliminated in both the GPS collected points as well as the base\r\nlinear networks make the process of matching the GPS data onto the network\r\ncomplicated.  In many cases, humans are needed to directly transform the\r\nGPS point data into a representation consisting of network line segments\r\nfor analysis.  This is not practical on a large scale for full\r\ntransportation networks where a large number of vehicles are being tracked.\r\n\r\nIn this project GPS point data for automobiles traveling on an urban road\r\nnetwork will be collected (urban roads will be used because their close\r\nspacing as well as the interference from buildings challenges the\r\nmethodology). Data will be collected during various weather conditions as\r\nwell as at different times of the day when satellite configuration varies\r\nand affects measurement quality.   The known actual routes will be manually\r\nentered into the road network database and a mathematical model will be\r\ndeveloped to transform the GPS points into complete routes in link by link\r\nnetwork (line) nomenclature.  The model will make use of a minimum path\r\nalgorithm and link impedances defined based on GPS point density, velocity\r\nand bearings. Goodness of fit measures that determine the extent of match\r\nbetween the actual and modeled routes will be used to evaluate alternative\r\nmodel specifications.\r\n\r\nThis award is made under the Exploratory Research on Engineering the\r\nTransport Industries (ETI) program solicitation.\r\n",
