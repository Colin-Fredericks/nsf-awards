 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental scientists who develop policies for the effective management of human activity are\r\noften thwarted by a lack of accurate information about the state of the environment. In some\r\ncases, the correct policy is not clear because the relationship between human activity and the\r\nenvironment is not well understood. Additional environmental data could improve such under-standing\r\nand provide the means to develop effective policies. In other cases effective policies\r\nhave been proposed but additional data is required to justify the political and economic costs of\r\nimplementation. However, more data by itself is not the solution. The human resources neces-sary\r\nto parse and analyze the data are scarcer than available data. What is necessary is intelli-gence\r\nto actively sample in such a way as to maximize the useful content in the data.\r\nThe proposed inter-disciplinary program will investigate means of extended-term environmental\r\nmonitoring. Specifically, this project seeks to endow a solar-powered airship with the intelligence\r\nto conduct extended-duration, autonomous environmental sampling. We will explore issues of\r\nconfiguration and design, path planning and control in the presence of weather patterns, and\r\nalgorithms necessary for intelligent environmental monitoring. The intended result is an instru-mented\r\nplatform for efficiently gathering accurately tagged environmental data that can stay aloft\r\nindefinitely.\r\nAirships are well suited for environmental monitoring tasks, however their potential in this capac-ity\r\nremains unfulfilled. As aerial monitoring platforms, they exhibit numerous advantages over\r\nfixed wing aircraft and helicopters. They are safer, more stable, and less expensive. They con-sume\r\nless power and are capable of extended operation. Given the intelligence to operate auton-omously\r\nand the proper sensing hardware, an airship provides a sensing platform that would be\r\nan asset to a diverse range of environmental scientists who seek to understand, remediate, and\r\nmanage the environment. Potential applications of this technology include forest and crop man-agement,\r\nwetland surveys, land use assessment, monitoring of hazardous waste sites, and ero-sion\r\nquantification.\r\nThrough a cost-sharing provision with Carnegie Mellon University, we will demonstrate our\r\nresults on a prototype, instrumented airship to generate a characterization of air pollution. Work-ing\r\ntogether with a recently funded EPA Supersite in Pittsburgh, this project will employ an airship\r\nto generate 3-D profiles of air pollution and ambient particulate matter. The resulting data set will\r\nprovide new insights into the vertical distribution and transport mechanisms of air pollution.\r\nNew technologies cannot turn back the ecological clock but they can help environmental scien-tists\r\npush back the frontiers of knowledge and help ordinary citizens grasp the urgency of pre-serving\r\nour natural world. It is now possible to use previously classified images from spy\r\nsatellites that show the extent of environmental degradation at a macro scale. This proposal will\r\ncreate a means of gathering dense environmental data at a much finer resolution, in a more effi-cient\r\nmanner.",
