 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nEnvironmental observation and forecasting systems (EOFS) are emerging new technologies with unparalleled\r\npotential to impact sustainable development. EOFS are expected to foster and support new paradigms for\r\ngeneration, transfer and social application of knowledge in domains that range from the global earth to its\r\nregional and local sub-systems.\r\nAt the core of EOFS is the timely and customized acquisition, generation, processing and delivery of reliable,\r\nrelevant information to many and very diverse audiences. Multiple challenges need to be met to implement\r\nthis concept.\r\nA critical challenge is the development of automated procedures to verify the quality of the huge amounts\r\nof observational and simulation data that are generated by EOFS both in real-time and off-line. Process-\r\nbased strategies for quality control of scientific data, while effective for moderate-size archival data are too\r\nlabor-intensive to map well into EOFS-scale data sets. Strategies based on pattern recognition and machine\r\nlearning hold significant promise as an alternative or complement.\r\nUnder the proposed project, we will develop approaches based in statistical pattern recognition and signal\r\nprocessing, on-line adaptive systems, datamining, and advanced search to address critical quality control\r\nissues including: 1) Detecting sensor corruption in non-stationary, spatial-temporal systems, 2) Estimating\r\ntrue signals from corrupted sensor data, and 3) Detecting and characterizing regimes where model anomalies\r\nare likely.\r\nThese quality control techniques will be developed and exercised on CORIE, a pilot EOFS for the COlumbia\r\nRIver Estuary and adjacent coastal waters (http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/CORIE)\r\nThe project will have strong social impact, through the role of EOFS (and, specifically, CORIE) on regional\r\nand national sustainable development issues. The project will also include cross-disciplinary educational\r\nopportunities at multiple levels.",
