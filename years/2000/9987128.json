 "awd_abstract_narration": "Old Dominion University has developed a scholarship program that is providing aid to capable, financially-disadvantaged students to complete the last two years of a Bachelor of Science program in Computer Science, Engineering, Engineering Technology, or Mathematics (NSF designated CSEM areas). Old Dominion University is an ideal candidate for such a program. The institution already has strong, active, and collaborative academic programs in each of the CSEM areas. The university has a diverse body of students, including a large percentage of women and minorities, and a large percentage of Pell eligible students. The university also has very active interactions with community colleges in the state, and high transfer enrollments from these schools. Candidate students in the CSEM areas are identified for scholarship consideration both from existing students and from community college students. The applications of these students, include not only prior academic performance, but also an essay describing career goals and letters of reference, are evaluated by a scholarship committee. The final step in the selection process is a formal interview of each candidate on campus. The scholarship awardees are then mentored and helped by faculty at Old Dominion University, further increasing the likelihood of successful graduation within two years. The CSEM scholarship has the immediate effect of improving the nation's technology workforce.\r\n",
