 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project will conduct research to develop a new class of cutting tools for high rate/high precision machining of Al-Si alloys, composites, and ceramics.  Advanced cutting tools will improve machining economics in the automotive, aerospace and related industries.  The new cutters will be made from a patent pending Tricontinuous Diamond/Carbide/Metal Composite (TDCC) material formed using high pressure/high temperature sintering technology.  The potential of this TDCC technology was demonstrated in Phase I, wherein proof-of-principle TDCC cutters outperformed conventional PCD cutters and showed up to two times longer tool life in Al-Si alloy machining tests.  In Phase II development of the TDCC sintering process will be carried out, with emphasis on demonstrating TDCC tool performance improvement, cost reduction, and quality control applicable for mass production. In addition development and performance demonstration of prototype cutting tools that use TDCC inserts are planned. The primary objective of Phase II research will be to demonstrate the commercial feasibility of making machining tools using TDCC material.  Collaboration with a leading automotive parts manufacturer, that will provide facilities and equipment for testing of the TDCC tools, has been arranged. This will help insure that the successful completion of the Phase II effort will lead to Phase III commercialization in the area of high rate / high precision tool manufacturing for automotive and other markets.\r\n\r\nUse of low wear high impact resistance TDCC tools will significantly impact the automotive and aerospace parts manufacturing industry allowing high transfer line speeds, lower operation count, and better surface finish which in turn will lead to improved production efficiency and lower product cost.\r\n",
