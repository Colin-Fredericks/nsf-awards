Recent research in the\r\narea known as ecological stoichiometry has highlighted the\r\necological importance of the relative abundance of chemical\r\nconstituents, known to vary considerably among species and across\r\ntrophic levels.  However, most theoeretical studies in ecology\r\nhave until very recently ignored the sources and consequences of\r\nthis chemical heterogeneity.  The investigator and his colleagues\r\nundertake theoretical investigations of ecological stoichiometry.\r\nThey develop a relatively new theoretical framework for\r\necological dynamics that explicitly incorporates stoichiometric\r\nconstraints.  This base model involves a stoichiometric\r\ncounterpart of the familiar Rosenzweig-MacArthur equations in\r\nwhich the effective carrying capacity of the resource species and\r\nthe transfer efficiency of the consumer species are constrained\r\nby stoichiometric principles.  Introduction of stoichiometric\r\nconsiderations in these equations (here, akin to \"food quality\")\r\nallows for a rich array of ecologically realistic dynamics,\r\nincluding deterministic extinction of the consumer species when\r\nresources are abundant but of poor quality.  They expand this\r\nmodel in five different directions, to explore ecological\r\nrealities (i.e., complications) whose consideration has proved\r\nilluminating in other, non-stoichiometric settings.  Specifically,\r\nthey analyze the dynamics of 1) a multi-nutrient model; 2)\r\ntrophically complex models in which multiple consumer species\r\nshare a resource; 3) time delays in nutrient recycling that are a\r\nrealistic component of terrestrial ecosystems; 4) two patch\r\nmodels featuring habitat heterogeneity and dispersal of the\r\nconsumer; and 5) age structured models in which juvenile and\r\nadult consumers differ in their nutrient requirements.  The\r\nproject aims to provide an analytically rigorous foundation for\r\nburgeoning empirical research into ecological stoichiometry.\r\n     All living things, including humans, are constructed of\r\napproximately the same set of basic building blocks, chemical\r\nelements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and\r\nseveral dozen more in smaller amounts.  However, different\r\norganisms contain different proportions of these key elements in\r\ntheir biomass and thus must extract these elements from their\r\nenvironment to differing degrees.  In many situations, the\r\nenvironment does not provide these key nutrient elements in the\r\nabundance and proportions that are optimal for organism growth\r\nand reproduction.  Thus, the chemical environment of life may set\r\nlimits on the success of organisms in various situations.  In this\r\nproject the investigators use mathematical models to simulate the\r\nflow of multiple chemical elements in natural food webs to better\r\nunderstand how the requirements of living things for multiple\r\nchemical elements establish key feedbacks between the living and\r\nnon-living world.  This work is important for two reasons.  First,\r\nit may provide a better fundamental understanding of how chemical\r\nelements move through food webs.  Second, improved fundamental\r\nknowledge of how nutrients move in the environment and how to\r\nsimulate those movements with mathematical tools may help predict\r\nand manage natural and human-dominated ecosystems, including\r\nthose affected by nutrient inputs from human activities (e.g.  N\r\nand P inputs from fertilizer, sewage) or by global change (e.g.\r\neffects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide on C and nutrient\r\nflow in the environment).\r\n",
