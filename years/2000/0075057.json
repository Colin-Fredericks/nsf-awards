 "awd_abstract_narration": "This POWRE award supports a Visiting  Professorship at the Department of Mathematics at Northeastern University to study differentials  of isolated hypersurface singularities.  This award will allow the PI\r\nto interact with several leading researchers in her field.  As part of the human resource development activities she will also sponsor the local graduate student seminar at Northeastern.\r\n\r\nThis research project combines theoretical expertise from cyclic homology  and K-theory and computer algebra techniques to  gather  information about invariants of isolated hypersurface singularities.  The most salient invariant of isolated hypersurface singularities is the so-called Tjurina number, or the dimension of the torsion module of differentials. She has identified the torsion module of differentials both as a Hodge-component of cyclic homology and as an ideal quotient. The latter identification has led to an efficient algorithm for computation of the number of generators exploiting Matlis duality in Gorenstein Artin Algebras. \r\n\r\nAs part of her research activities the PI will  undertake the following  three-part project:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The structure of isolated singularities:\r\nThe anticipated outcome of this research will be  an  upper bound for the number of generators and the length of  the module of differentials for 3 dimensional hypersurface singularities. \r\n\r\n2.  Residues and Duality for isolated hypersurface singularities:\r\nThe goal will be an explicit description of residues and an investigation of the connection with inverse systems.\r\n\r\n3.  Description of the module of logarithmic differentials and  connection with hyperplane/surface arrangements:\r\nThis part of the project will be  computational in nature and will focus on the use and development of algorithms for Groebner basis computations in exterior algebras.\r\n\r\nThis POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS). \r\n",
