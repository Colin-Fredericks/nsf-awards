Rieger\r\nInstitution: University of Oklahoma\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to fabricate high density microchannels by using a novel air-gap technology.  By incorporating a polymeric material in silicon, the PI plans to form microchannels by thermally decomposing the polymeric material.  The channels could be used as microfluidic devices, microreactors or sites for microcatalyst deposition.  As a site for catalyst deposition, the fabrication of a chip for combinatorial catalysis should be possible.  By premixing catalyst particles in the polymer, catalyst composition can be controlled so that varied catalyst compositions can be deposited as part of a large library.  Several in-situ methods for controlling the catalyst composition will be tested.  If in situ techniques prove unworkable, the deposition of varied catalysts can be accomplished through evaporation of water from salt solutions in the formed channels.  Chemical composition of the resulting catalysts will be determined through XPS and FTIR analysis. This work may lead to new fabrication techniques for the production of structures useful in engineered microdevices.\r\n\r\n",
