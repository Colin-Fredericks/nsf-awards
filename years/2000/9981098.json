 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric Sciences (41) To address issues surrounding tornadoes that each year, in every state, cause deaths, injuries, and extensive damage, an easy-to-use, high-tech, data-rich educational tornado module is being developed.  The module utilizes the Oklahoma Climatological Survey developed web browser plug-in software (WxScope) in an inquiry-based, web-constructivist learning format to harness the internet, bringing the current knowledge of tornado development, structure, and awareness to the student-user in a way that achieves curriculum goals in entry-level undergraduate meteorology courses.  The OCS web browser plug-in approach places the students at the cutting edge of both historical and national tornado data, and the latest research-quality data gathered by the nation's premier severe storms research unit, the Oklahoma Weather Center. This one-year proof-of-concept project focuses on the development of (1) interactive tornado data analysis software for use inside a web-browser environment, (2) a self-contained web-based module for the study of tornadoes and their effects, and (3) a series of tornado simulations using data from the May 3rd tornado event to assess student learning in the areas of tornado prediction, warning, and disaster mitigation while a tornado is in progress.  Each activity also contains information on how its implementation meets current national K-12 science and math standards and NSTA guidelines.  This module utilizes the tornado as a centerpiece in developing mathematical (graphing, frequency distributions, probability, etc.) and scientific (atmospheric dynamics, thermodynamics and physics) topics, and how these relate to societal (actuarial statistics, insurance rating structures, public safety, etc.) and governmental policy (federal funding, disaster declarations, etc.) issues.  The tornado module provides opportunities to study multi-disciplinary topics throughout a semester, improving the learner's appreciation for the critical relationship between scientific and non-scientific disciplines. This success of this module' development provides a model for the creation of future weather awareness modules (hurricanes, floods, etc.)  and will help reform the way in which meteorology is studied in undergraduate courses across the nation.  The web-based nature of the module will also allow students to continue learning long after the semester ends, creating life-long learners, and ultimately, educated science policy makers.",
