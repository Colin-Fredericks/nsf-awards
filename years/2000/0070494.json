 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the related areas of real and effective algebraic\r\ngeometry, particularly enumerative problems, and combinatorial problems\r\narising from enumerative algebraic geometry.  A focus is the real number\r\nsolutions to classical geometric problems arising from the Schubert\r\ncalculus, work that is informed by substantial computer experimentation.\r\nThese effective and computational techniques rely upon the combinatorics of\r\nSchubert varieties, Bruhat orders, and the cohomology rings of flag\r\nvarieties, which Sottile also studies.  An important part of this\r\nproject is to write a book, \"Applicable Algebraic Geometry\" jointly with\r\nJaochim Rosenthal and Alex Wang, on application-driven uses of algebraic\r\ngeometry, providing a useful and motivated introduction to algebraic\r\ngeometry for applied scientists.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry, which is the study of solutions to systems of\r\npolynomial equations, is important for its potential applications--\r\npolynomial equations are ubiquitous in mathematics and the applied sciences.\r\nComputational and real aspects of algebraic geometry are of particular \r\ninterest, as applications often demand explicit, real-number answers to\r\nmathematical questions.   Techniques to obtain such explicit answers\r\noften exploit special combinatorial structures of particular problems, \r\nand hence rely upon a good understanding of these structures.  This project \r\nincreases the applicability of algebraic geometry by studying computational \r\nand real aspects of algebraic geometry, by deepening the understanding \r\nof related combinatorial structures, and lastly by Sottile writing an\r\napplication-driven algebraic geometry text for applied scientists with \r\nRosenthal and Wang.",
