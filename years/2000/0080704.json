 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tThis project proposes to investigate organizational change and innovation in higher education, particularly as regards applications of technology. More specifically, the study focuses attention on: 1) how organizational culture supports institutional innovation; 2) curriculum innovation; 3) the impact of information technology on the educational processes; 4) strategic partnerships in higher education; and 5) applications and relevance in research in educational institutions.\r\n     The investigation will be undertaken in a collaborative network that includes nine partnering institutions. Comparisons will be made between three categories of institutions (three in each category): established universities that are aiming to transform themselves in light of new technology; start-up universities that have flexibility to operate differently from inception; and corporate/new learning institutions that are supported by corporate funds and methodologies. \r\n     Data will be collected on-site at each institution via interviews, surveys and archival information. The multi-institution, comparative nature of this collaborative inquiry is expected to enable participating institutions to form a much broader and deeper perspective on the impacts of technology and the ranges of organizational response, while providing the opportunity for partners both to learn from one another, and to develop an ongoing network for information exchange. In addition, the study will provide information on how various groups, including governments (Canadian and US), private industry and universities can partner together around innovation. As relatively little empirical research on IT impacts on higher education institutional change has been performed, this study is particularly interesting, and offers a broad perspective on technology's potential and impact in higher education. This preliminary study is expected to provide the groundwork for subsequent further and more detailed study.\r\n",
