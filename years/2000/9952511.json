 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  At UCLA and other urban institutions, large classes and long distances to appropriate field sites make first-hand investigations of ecosystems extremely difficult.  Building on a prototype in development for the Santa Monica Bay (funded in part by a grant from NSF), this project uses computer technology to involve students in meaningful explorations of biodiversity in a second ecosystem, the deserts of the United States.  This Virtual Environment module includes: 1) a visually-rich tour of the ecosystem, including the major desert areas, comparisons and contrasts; 2) a substantial database of organisms and habitats enhanced by photographs and video; 3) a set of GIS habitat maps with information from management and conservation agencies; 4) information about desert areas and their management; and 5) a gateway to additional information through library resources and the Internet.  The program also incorporates problems that require students to use these rich, complex databases as they construct phylogenies and investigate and write about ecological relationships.  Moreover, each year, through an upper division course at UCLA, the issues and problems presented, as well as the databases, will be revised and expanded.  The program is designed primarily for the university level, but the tour and habitat information are useful in biology and life science classes at the middle and high school level, and the databases provide information for students, research scientists, and resource managers.  The program provides both a model of active, inquiry-based learning and a useful resource for preservice and inservice teachers.  As the module deals with the major arid lands of the United States, it is exportable to and usable by universities throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
