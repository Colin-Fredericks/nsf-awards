Liou of the Department of Geological and Environmental Science at the Stanford University and Dr. Shige Maruyama, Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology (TIT), and Dr. Yoshi Ogasawara, Institute of Earth Science, Waseda University, Japan.   Dr. Liou will be supported for a five months sabbatical stay at TIT in order to continue a well established U.S.-Japan cooperative Project entitled \"Ultrahigh-Pressure Metamorphic Rocks and the Geodynamics Collision-subduction\" with Professors Shige Maruyama and Yoshi Ogasawara.  Major research goals during Dr. Liou's stay in Tokyo Institute of Technology are: (1) data collection on garnet peridotites from both China and Kazakhstan; (2) petrotectonic research on the Kokchetav Massif, northern Kazkhstan; and (3) Research Book on Blueschists and Eclogites. \r\n\r\nMajor specific tasks during Dr. Liou's sabbatical stay in Japan include the followings:\r\n(1) To complete editing several special issues resulted from the International UHP Workshop at Stanford in December 1998.  One of them is on \"Petrogenesis and Tectonics of the Kokchetav Massif\" to be published in the Island Arc, the Official Journal of the Geological Society of Japan.  (2) To complete a book on Blueschists and Eclogites with Professor Maruyama to be published by Kluwer Academic Press. This book will contain information with regard to mineralogy, petrology, age data and tectonic interpretation of all bluechist and eclogite localities in the world.  (3) To collect petrochemical data on garnet peridotites from both China and Kazkhstan using the facilities of the /center of Excellence in Japan in order to evaluate the nature of the upper mantle associated with continental collision and subduction; (4) To be involved in scientific planning and research related to the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling project, and to work on available core and surface samples with the Japanese colleagues; (5) To complete a research volume with professor Maruyama and Osgaswara on Petrotectonic Evolution of the Kokchetav Massif  as many comprehensive petrochemical data have been collected through the U.S.-Japan study group;  (6) To help supervise students and research associates of both Profs. Maruyama and Ogasawara for their data collection and manuscript preparation, and to give lectures and seminars in various Japanese universities; and (7) To encourage Japanese students to become actively involved in international meetings (e.g., the International Geologic Congress in 2000, and the International Eclogite Conference in Japan in 2001).  It is expected that the cooperation between these researchers should foster further collaborations.\r\n\r\n",
