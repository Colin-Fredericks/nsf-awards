The researchers will be undertaking a study of the physiological and cellular functions for the signalling enzyme phospholipase D (PLD).  PLD is a recently identified mammalian signal transducer that is believed to play important roles in agonist-induced cellular responses including membrane vesicular trafficking (secretion and endocytosis), proliferation, and differentiation.  Recent studies have demonstrated to some extent the mechanism through which PLD is regulated.  However, the physiological and cellular functions of PLD remain to be clarified.  The aims of this project are to determine the signaling pathway(s) in which PLD is involved and the consequence(s) of PLD activation, using biochemical, molecular biological, cell biological, and transgenic approaches.  The researchers will identify effectors downstream of PLD activation and determine how their activity changes in the absence of PLD, or when wild type, dominant negative, and constitutively active PLD mutants are over-expressed.  \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  The U.S. researchers' expertise is in the area of molecular biology and the Japanese have expertise in biochemical probes.  Results of the research will provide a greater understanding of cellular stimulus response pathways.  As these pathways are defined and their metabolic intermediates identified, therapeutic advances are being realized as specific new pharmaceutical agents are discovered.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of postdocs and graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals. \r\n",
