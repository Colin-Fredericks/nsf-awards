 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the number of fish in rivers and streams diminishes and become threatened, endangered, or extinct, we see a growing concern from the local communities that is being met with increased funding and political attention. There is a need for better fish monitoring tools for the riverine environment. Leaders in the riverine sonar community have identified several deficiencies in current systems. Scientific Fishery Systems, Inc.\r\nproposes to develop a broadband sonar fish tracking system for use in shallow water environments. The proposed system will address many of the current deficiencies, resulting in a broadband fish tracking system with 10 times better range resolution and at least 6 dB improvement in the signal to noise ratio for targets.  EPA estimates that there are 68,000 dams. The National Park Service estimates that thereare 75,000 dams. The Wall Street Journal estimates that there are 80,000 dams. The problems of tracking fish in three dimensions near dams to determine fish behavior is a major issue for many of these dams, especially those in the Columbia River Basin where the threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead have recently received the attention of the Office of the President.  Assuming only 5% of these dams require fish monitoring, and that SciFish is able to capture only 10% of that market, this conservatively represents a $34 M market.",
