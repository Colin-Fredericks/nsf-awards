 "awd_abstract_narration": "The speech synthesis systems now available can produce speech whose\r\nsegmental properties mimic human speech remarkably well. However, synthetic\r\nspeech still often sounds unnatural, primarily because of the relatively\r\nless successful modeling of the prosodic properties of speech, such as\r\nintonation and timing. This project focuses on the prosodic properties of\r\nlonger stretches of speech - sequences of sentences and paragraphs. The\r\ngoal is to explore how prosody, specifically durations, is organized over\r\nlarger units of speech.\r\n\r\nThe approach adopted here is to compare different languages, with known\r\ndifferences in timing at segmental, word or phrase level, to see how they\r\ndiffer in structuring timing over an entire discourse. The languages that\r\nwill be compared are English, French and Japanese. Improved understanding\r\nof discourse-level timing will help to explain the relation between\r\ndurational patterns and linguistic structure.\r\n\r\nThe project is organized into four phases: (1) a production study to\r\ninvestigate what factors influence durational patterns in longer stretches\r\nof speech; (2) modeling of the results of the production study; (3)\r\nanalysis-synthesis incorporating the model of durations into synthesized\r\nspeech; and (4) testing the resulting synthesis through evaluation by human\r\nlisteners. The durational properties to be examined include amount of\r\nlengthening at sentence boundaries, duration of pauses, and changes in\r\nspeech rate before and after a boundary. Comparisons among the three\r\nlanguages will identify the factors that are important in influencing\r\ndurations, and help explain how these factors relate to the different\r\nlinguistic structures of the languages.",
