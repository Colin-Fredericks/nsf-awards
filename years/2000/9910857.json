 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general aim of this research is to better understand the physical processes associated with the influence of landscape heterogeneity on the atmosphere, and, through the development of an analytic theory, to contribute to the parameterization of these effects on larger-scale models. \r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigators will focus on: the further development of an analytic theory developed under previous support; investigating the role of persistent mesoscale flows and waves generated by landscape variability in flat landscapes; the evaluation of these atmospheric flows on tropospheric structures, specifically stability and wind profiles. \r\n\r\nThe need for this study is motivated from the analysis of data from previously completed field experiments and related numerical results, which have shown that signatures in the free atmosphere may be related to mesoscale waves and mesoscale vertical transport.  The implication is that mesoscale flow, which is generated over heterogeneous flat landscapes, can influence the tropospheric stability and wind profile, when these flows persist for a few days.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigators will quantify the mesoscale imprint on the free atmosphere during clear days with light wind conditions.  In addition, when the environmental wind and stability profiles are favorable to propagating waves, the researchers will determine how deeply these perturbations penetrate into the free atmosphere.  The Principal Investigators will study how the tropospheric environment is influenced by mesoscale wave energy, and associated momentum convergence and deposition.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this research could eventually lead to better parameterizations in numerical models and better weather forecasts from these models.\r\n",
