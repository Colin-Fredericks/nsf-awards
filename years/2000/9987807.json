Gerhardt\r\nUniversity of Kentucky \r\nCeramic-Based Multisite Microelectrodes for Electrochemical and Electrophysiological Recordings\r\n\r\nThere is a great need in many areas of science for small devices that can be used to understand the chemical signaling that occurs between organisms and cells.  Such microelectrodes can be used for experiments involving chemical communication in biology, which is a fundamental process that has been poorly understood.  However, the development of microelectrodes has been hampered by the difficulty in manufacturing extremely small devices that are strong and affordable.  The goal of this award is to develop a multisite ceramic-based microelectrode that is sufficiently inexpensive to be disposable and can be applied to chemical recordings in biological systems such as plants, animals and even the ocean.\r\nThe present award has two major specific aims.  First, a series of biological recordings in the rat brain will be done using an existing microelectrode prototype. Following these initial measurements, several site mask designs will be implemented to determine the design that optimizes the recording site geometry for chemical measurements.  In addition, procedures will be investigated that allow for the formation of microelectrodes using thinner materials.  Second, a new generation of ceramic-based sensors will be developed to investigate the recording properties of platinum iridium (Pt-Ir) and carbon recording sites.  All of these will contribute to the development of a new generation of affordable microelectrodes for chemical measures in biological systems.\r\nThe ceramic-based microelectrodes that will be developed with this award have a number of potential uses in biology.  The new microelectrodes will be shared with other scientists to explore these potential uses.  In addition to collaborations with scientists, the microelectrodes will be used in numerous education programs that center on the dynamics of chemical signaling in biological systems.  These include programs to educate local businesses and high schools about the uses of rapid chemical measures in biological systems, a program for high school students to participate in summer research, and a short course, held at Woods Hole, MA, that involves the training of graduate students, postdoctoral students and faculty in the use of the microelectrodes. \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n",
