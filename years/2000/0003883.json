 "awd_abstract_narration": "DGE-0003883\r\n\r\nThe World Wide Web is increasingly becoming an integrated extension of users' computing environments, with content indexed and retrieved through Web browsers.  Web browsers are increasingly being used as a science curriculum delivery mechanism, for both books delivered as local content on CD ROMs as well as server-based material.  \r\n\r\nTraditional science curriculum has often had a static presentation due to having been delivered on printed media.  What was printed ahead of time in books or handouts could not be changed.  Any changes would have to be attached externally by way of extra handouts or explanations on the board.  The Web gives us the technological affordances to change that.  \r\n\r\nIn this work we propose implementing an architecture that allows an instructor to modify curriculum as\r\n it is presented through a web browser.  This would allow a teacher to customize web-based curriculum to\r\n fit a particular need.  \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nA list of materials could be substituted with a different list\r\nAdditional examples personalized to the students' context could be that\r\nExtra notes and explanations could be added where necessary\r\nCross-reference and supplementary bibliographic information could be added.\r\n\r\nThe original page would remain unchanged, with just the users' view of it that would change.  A working prototype of this approach has already been implemented through the support in part of PFSMETE funding. Additional work is needed to turn it into a tool that is enough to be disseminated.\r\n",
