The principal investigators are conducting four summer workshops (two each summer) for secondary and community college mathematics faculty. During these workshops faculty teams, consisting of investigators and workshop participants, are visiting industries to see first hand how graduates of two-year AAS programs are using mathematics. The graduates are interviewed and videotaped as they explain and demonstrate how mathematical concepts and methodologies are used and how problems are resolved in their jobs. Based on the visit and the mathematical topics discussed, a series of snapshots, video clips, and accompanying worksheets are being developed and packaged both on a CD and for distribution via the Internet. Information about the project is being presented at local, state and national conferences.",
