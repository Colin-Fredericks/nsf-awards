 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamic behavior of complex systems typically involves the interaction of continuous and\r\ndiscrete dynamics. The study of such hybrid dynamic processes is central in the analysis and\r\ndesign of modern engineering systems. The aim of the proposed work is to develop new method-\r\nologies and computer algorithms to solve important feedback control problems in hybrid systems.\r\nThis work is motivated by the need to address challenging problems in the control and coordi-\r\nnation of modern complex engineering applications such as multiple robotic systems mounted on\r\nspace or underwater platforms, eets of autonomous vehicles, and chemical and manufacturing\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work uses a hybrid system framework for regulatory feedback control that is based\r\non discrete abstractions and it o_ers signi_cant promise in addressing successfully a number of\r\nopen control design issues. The proposed approach utilizes discrete approximations or abstrac-\r\ntions of the continuous dynamics, which are re_ned appropriately using the concept of quasideter-\r\nminism, to provide adequate information so that a controller can be designed to meet the control\r\nspeci_cations. It is proposed to extend initial control synthesis results that use piecewise-linear\r\nmodels to more general systems, and also develop additional design methods based on Lyapunov\r\nfunctions and on Petri net supervisory control methodologies. The proposed research includes the\r\nexploration of realistic applications from the areas of manufacturing and autonomous vehicles.\r\nThe impact of this work will be in both theory and applications. In particular, it will provide\r\na theoretical design framework for regulatory feedback control of hybrid systems and will also\r\nin uence the areas of reachability analysis, hybrid automata, and veri_cation algorithms. Fur-\r\nthermore, it will provide algorithms for the control of autonomous systems which will be tested\r\non our Complex Systems Simulation Facility.\r\n",
