 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mesoscale is a term intended to convey an intermediate level description of\r\na physical system.  Its function is to capture the interactions of the\r\nsystem at finer scales with interactions or influences from larger coarser\r\nscales, and the mesoscale level itself.  Such systems, active across\r\ndisparate length and time scales, are inherently metastable.  This feature\r\nis often revealed by hysteretic behavior or by a reluctance to evolve\r\nquickly to equilibrium.  The focus in this proposal is on several\r\nprototypes of these systems that occur in materials sceince.  One is \r\nthe role of interfaces, or grain boundaries, in determining or limiting the \r\nbehavior of polycrystalline materials. The energy and mobility of grain \r\nboundaries depends on crystallography and geometry, according to \r\nestablished thermodynamic principles.  Innovative new ways to determine \r\nthese functions explicitly for important materials are the objective of the \r\nMesoscale Interface Mapping Project.  This involves developing automated \r\nmicroscopy to harvest large amounts of data from samples and then \r\nformulating and solving a complex inverse problem.  One way to approach \r\ndetermination of mobility consists in the development of large scale \r\nsimulations of grain boundary evolution.  The second focus is the \r\ncoarse grained descriptions of mesoscale systems, the functional analytic \r\nlimit processes in the microstructure of solids or the averaging to distribution \r\nfunctions in systems with stochastic behavior. The new methods allow \r\nstudy of situations where kinetics arise directly in terms of thermodynamic \r\nstate functions and naturally carry with them an appropriate topology.  \r\nThe issue of metastability has been under investigation in this context.  \r\nThere is now the opportunity to improve understanding, for example, \r\nof microstructural evolution in shape-memory materials and diffusion \r\nmediated transport in certain liquid crystal systems and in protein motors.  \r\nThis will include diagnostics for these systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe challenge of the mesoscale in materials science is to understand how \r\nit constrains finer scale systems (at the molecular scale) and determines \r\nlarger scale systems (at the scale of entire devices).  This is accomplished\r\nthrough coarse graining procedures.  For example, many technologically\r\nuseful materials are polycrystalline, or granular, in nature.  The aluminum\r\nskin of an aircraft and the copper or copper-aluminum interconnects in\r\ncomputer chips are but two examples at vastly different size scales of such\r\ngranular materials.  It is widely understood that many aspects of these\r\nmaterials depend on the interfaces they contain, or their grain boundaries.\r\nProperties of grain boundaries determine the reliability as well as the \r\nmechanical strength. This project will exploit the exciting opportunities and \r\nchallenges for mathematical science in this field and beyond.  Specifically, \r\ncoarse graining methods will be developed in order to better understand \r\nphenomena that occur in protein motors and in liquid crystals.  A related \r\nproblem of coarse graining arises when information is to be extracted from \r\nthe immense amounts of data that can be produced with simulations of\r\ncomplex systems, such as polycrystalline materials. This problem of coarse \r\ngraining at an information scale rather than a physical scale will also be addressed \r\nin this project.\r\n",
