 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to answer the question of how to measure the capacity\r\nand flexibility of a transportation system, considering uncertainty in\r\nsystem performance and traffic. The emphasis is on the term system, for\r\nmethods already exist to measure the capacity of individual links and nodes\r\nof a network in terms of volume-delay functions. But as we have learned\r\nwith the recent capacity problems of U.S. freight railroads, capacity is\r\ndependent on many other system elements, including the fleet, labor, and\r\nenergy, among others. And information technology -- vehicle and cargo\r\ntracking systems, mobile communications, real-time movement control, etc.--\r\ncan increase fleet productivity and shift link volume-delay curves. \r\n\r\nThis research will develop overall metrics for system capacity. These are\r\nintended to address questions of the maximum amount of traffic a system can\r\naccommodate, and the flexibility of the system in accommodating different\r\nmixes of traffic. Such mixes include changes in: spatial patterns resulting\r\nfrom shifts in national or international trade patterns, the mix of\r\ncommodities carried, and speed or other level of service features required\r\nby industry. We term these different quantities and mixes of commodities\r\nand related features \"traffic scenarios.\"\r\n\r\nThe methods developed are intended to address fundamental questions that\r\nface those responsible for providing transportation infrastructure,\r\nincluding: Is the system capable of accommodating an expected future\r\ntraffic scenario? If not, what are the bottlenecks? How flexible is the\r\ncurrent system in accommodating various traffic scenarios that might arise?\r\nHow adequate and flexible will the system be given planned investments and\r\nother changes? Traditional transportation models have focused on estimating\r\nthe performance-- cost and level of service--of a given system with given\r\ntraffic scenario, and generally do not consider uncertainty. This research\r\naddresses different but related questions, namely, the ability of a system\r\nto accommodate various possible traffic scenarios. Our results should\r\nprovide improved methods by which private and public sector infrastructure\r\nmangers can assess the state of their systems and also evaluate\r\nimprovements resulting from investments and operational changes.\r\n\r\nIn undertaking this research, we will build upon existing models of the\r\nsystem, but structure these into an optimization formulation that enables\r\nus to posit different measures of capacity and flexibility. One version\r\nwill be deterministic. But our goal is to develop a stochastic model that\r\nwill take into account stochastic variations in such features as link\r\nperformance and the quantity and mix of different commodities over time.\r\nThus we also intend to develop a Monte Carlo simulation version of the\r\nmodel, which will provide a basis for developing a combined optimization\r\nand stochastic approach to the problem. We expect to use current capacity\r\nproblems in the freight transportation system as examples and tests of the\r\nmethodology that we develop.\r\n\r\nThis award is made under the Exploratory Research on Engineering the\r\nTransport Industries (ETI) program solicitation.\r\n",
