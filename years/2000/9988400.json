Growth of the field of image-related computation, including especially computer vision and pattern recognition, has created a significant need for additional educational opportunities in these areas and this project provides a highly leveraged approach toward meeting a part of that need.  The workshop provides well-documented examples of courses, course modules, case studies, laboratory resources and other teaching materials to help faculty design high-quality image-related undergraduate courses.  This project is a follow-on to the successful similar workshop held in 1997.\r\n",
