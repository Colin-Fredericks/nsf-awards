 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sport Science addresses the needs of urban girls in gaining equitable access to science/mathematics education.  Through sports, girls will not only develop science/mathematics discourse, but will build rapport and trust, thus achieving both an intellectual advancement in science/mathematics and a psycho-social-emotional connection.  The overall goal of the program is to design, implement, evaluate, and disseminate a field-based program for fostering the resilience of girls in science/mathematics through the vehicle of sports.\r\n     The project is designed as a three-year intervention involving 540 girls from six middle schools over a three-year period, teachers, college students, minority athletes, and mentors.  The sport science curriculum will be standards based and have an equitable focus.  The entire curriculum will include 40 science/ mathematics standards driven activities that feature a sport as the vehicle through which the science/ mathematics is learned.  The 10 sports to be featured in the program include:  (1) five team sports - volleyball, basketball, soccer, hockey, and softball; and (2) five individual sports - fencing, golf, tennis, track (running and throwing).  The project will achieve the goals and objectives through five components:  (1) after school programs, (2) Saturday academies, (3) special sport day events, (4) academic and summer internships, and (5) career connections.\r\n",
