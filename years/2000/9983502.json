 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at developing an ultra-sensitive magnetic sensor technology that is capable of operation in an unshielded environment. These compact sensors will be based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) that are fabricated from high temperature (high-Tc ) superconducting materials. A collaborative effort between MagneSensors and U.C. Berkeley will employ novel design and materials processing solutions to produce high-Tc SQUIDs operating in ambient fields with an unprecedented level of sensitivity. The program will test the developed sensors on real-world applications at both low and high frequencies to demonstrate operation in the presence of large background magnetic field interference. This new enabling technology seeks to overcome the limitations in sensitivity, bandwidth, size, and spatial resolution, which restrict the more widespread application of present conventional magnetic field sensors. The eventual goal is the development of a low-cost, portable system with much greater sensitivity than is available with any other instrumentation. \r\n\r\nThis technology will enable the development of an entirely new generation of instrumentation that will find use in a wide variety of applications. Such applications include non-destructive evaluation of cracks and corrosion in aircraft, inspection of integrated circuits, homogeneous immunoassays and DNA probes using magnetic labels, geophysical surveying, environmental monitoring, detection of unexploded ordnance, diagnosis of intestinal ischemia, and screening for cardiac arrhythmias The potential market size for some of the applications reaches over $1 billion.\r\n",
