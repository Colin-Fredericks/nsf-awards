 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will build a new generation of numerical simulation systems by creating a feedback path between physical experiments and numerical solvers. There are a number of exciting implications of this data-adaptive simulation idea. Engineering fluid flows are inherently complex. This complexity limits measurement and precision, so engineers are forced to work with fluid flows based on very sparse information. Numerical solvers, on the other hand, can resolve tiny flow structures, but they generally run in an open-loop mode and are thus unverified. Coupling the two forms of technology offers powerful advantages to each. Comparisons against live experimental data will allow simulation algorithms to be verified quantitatively, in detail, and in-line. Once it is verified in this fashion, one can use the simulation with confidence on related problems. Once can also use the sensor information to correct the solver's data, or even to adjust the solver parameters on the fly. Moreover, once the solver is properly synchronized with the real system, one could use the former to explore the physics of the latter in more detail than sensors would allow - and still trust the results.\r\n\r\nA particularly compelling application area for data-adaptive simulation techniques is microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). This emerging technology is driving a revolution in engineering design that is placing new demands on numerical simulation. Accurate modeling of the interaction of tiny, flexible, moving structures with high-speed chaotic fluids is challenging. To resolve the fine details in this kind of simulation, computational fluid dynamics technology requires extremely fine meshes and the solution of very large systems of nonlinear equations. This makes it difficult to build production-quality computer-aided design (CAD) tools for MEMS, which in turn forces engineers to fabricate devices without testing them. Functional CAD tools would allow MEMS designers to achieve one-pass design, much as VLSI does now.\r\n",
