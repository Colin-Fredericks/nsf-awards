 "awd_abstract_narration": "0073161\r\nMotley and Conard\r\n\tThe genus Artocarpus is a member of the fig and mulberry family (Moraceae). It consists of approximately 50 tree species all native to the tropics of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Many of the species are cultivated on a local level for their timber, fruit, or seeds. Two species, breadfruit, A. altilis and jackfruit, A. heterophyllus, are important crops throughout the tropics. Despite the economic and subsistence significance of this group of plants, the evolutionary relationships among them remain unclear. Graduate student Nyree Conard, under the direction of Dr. Timothy Motley, is investigating these relationships, including morphological features as well as DNA sequences from all of the species, to create a phylogeny or\r\n\"family tree\" of the genus. The phylogeny will be useful for identifying\r\nclose relatives of the cultivated species in the genus and for setting an\r\nevolutionary framework for more detailed species level studies such as conservation and germplasm work on breadfruit.\r\nBreadfruit is a traditional staple crop in the Pacific Islands where it has been cultivated and improved upon by human selection for millennia so that today hundreds of seedless and seeded varieties exist. Although the entire tree has uses, it is primarily harvested for either its starchy fruit or proteinaceous seeds. In the late 16th century European explorers began\r\ntravelling to the Pacific Islands and wrote accounts of breadfruit. At this\r\npoint in time, it was already being widely cultivated throughout Oceania\r\n(Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia) and the Europeans soon realized how\r\nuseful the tree was and began distributing it to colonies throughout the\r\ntropics. Although its native region is known to be somewhere in Oceania, its\r\nprecise center of origin and its subsequent human-facilitated dispersal\r\nroute through the Pacific is unclear. Additionally, the taxonomy of breadfruit is controversial with one to three different species of\r\nbreadfruit being recognized and possible hybrids existing. By using DNA\r\nfingerprinting techniques, relationships among varieties from different\r\nPacific Island groups will be assessed to address the issues of origin,\r\nhuman-facilitated dispersal routes, and taxonomy. In addition to providing\r\ninsight into human migrations in the Pacific, the fingerprinting data will\r\nalso be used to help manage living breadfruit germplasm collections so that\r\ntheir genetic diversity can be most effectively utilized and conserved. \r\n\r\n",
