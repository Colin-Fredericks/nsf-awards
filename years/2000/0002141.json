Todes (Johns Hopkins University) \r\n\"Ivan Pavlov:  A Life in Russian Science\"\r\n\r\nThe Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) is an almost legendary figure. Perhaps second only to Einstein, he (and his salivating dogs) has become a popular symbol of twentieth century science. This award enables the Principal Investigator to complete research and a draft of the first scholarly biography of Pavlov.\r\n\r\nThis project draws upon the extensive archival sources that became available in the 1990s to present a dramatic life story that also illuminates Pavlov's time, place, and preoccupations: the history of Russia and Russian science from the mid-nineteenth century to Stalinist times, the rise of experimental physiology and scientific medicine, the emergence of large-scale laboratory research, and the efforts of early twentieth century scientists to explain human behavior.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the grant period, the Principal Investigator will also complete an intermediate project; entitled \"The Unknown Pavlov:  Reflexes, Revolution, and the Russian Mind,\" which will use recently discovered archival materials to explore the little-known anthropomorphic dimensions of Pavlov's ideas about higher nervous activity.\r\n\r\nIn view of Pavlov's scientific importance and iconic status in twentieth century culture, the PI hopes that this biography will find an audience, not only among historians of science and Russian historians, but also among physiologists, psychologists, and the educated reading public.\r\n",
