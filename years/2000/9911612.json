Consequently, the hydrothermal water venting from the seafloor is markedly different in composition from the seawater from which it is derived, and for some elements represents an important component of the global mass balance. To understand this process, the rock/water ratio of reactions beneath the seafloor must be understood. In this work,  Li isotope systematics in mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems will be investigated because Li has been found to be a good tool for understanding the rock/water behavior within the seafloor systems. The Li isotopic composition of previously collected hydrothermal fluids will be determined on samples that have already been analyzed for major and minor elements and for Li concentration. These samples are from four different sites along the mid-ocean ridge system. \r\n",
