 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleague study ways to break\r\nintractability of algorithms for high-dimensional problems.  They\r\nfocus on high-dimensional integration, explore  breaking\r\nintractability either by settling for a stochastic assurance of\r\nsmall error or by using additional domain knowledge, and further\r\ndevelop FinDer, a software package for high-dimensional\r\nintegration.\r\n     The computational complexity of an algorithm is a measure of\r\nthe amount of work the algorithm must perform to produce a\r\nsolution for given inputs.  Usually the complexity is measured in\r\nthe size of the problem being solved.  For example, finding the\r\nsolution of a linear matrix equation in N unknowns --- an\r\nN-dimsional problem --- generally takes on the order of N times N\r\ntimes N arithmetic operations; the computational complexity of\r\nsuch an algorithm is N cubed.  There is huge interest in solving\r\nhigh-dimensional problems.  Many applications involve functions\r\nof hundreds, thousands, and even an infinite number of variables.\r\nExamples occur in physics, chemistry, mathematical science, and\r\neconomics.  These problems must usually be solved numerically and\r\none has to settle for an approximate numerical solution to within\r\nan error epsilon.  If a worst case deterministic assurance of an\r\nepsilon approximation is desired, then the computational\r\ncomplexity usually depends exponentially on the number of\r\nvariables; the problem is said to be intractible.  The\r\ninvestigators study breaking intractability either by settling\r\nfor a stochastic assurance of small error or by using additional\r\ndomain knowledge.  The use of formalizing additional domain\r\nknowledge is a powerful new idea.  In particular, the\r\ninvestigators study under what conditions a double win is\r\nachievable for the important problem of high-dimensional\r\nintegration: when does an algorithm to compute the value of a\r\nhigh-dimensional integral both converge faster than a Monte Carlo\r\nalgorithm and do so with a worst case deterministic assurance?\r\nThey apply the theoretical results to improve the FinDer software\r\nsystem for computing high-dimensional integrals.  This new\r\nparadigm is applied to other problems of computational\r\nmathematics.",
