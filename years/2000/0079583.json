 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the development of a high resolution, high sensitivity\r\nmagnetic field imaging microscope.  This instrument will allow for the\r\nmeasurement of minute magnetic fields (10-5 G) generated by currents in\r\nmesoscopic devices, the magnetic properties of quantum structures and the\r\nspin states of electrons inside devices.  The instrument will be the first\r\nscanning Josephson junction microscope (SJM).  It will have six orders of\r\nmagnitude higher field sensitivity than conventional magnetic force\r\nmicroscopy and an order of magnitude better spatial resolution than\r\nscanning SQUID microscopy.\r\n\r\nIn order to build this tool, the expertise of several groups at MIT must be\r\nbrought together.  The Josephson junction (JJ) that forms the critical\r\nsensing element must be integrated on an atomic force microscope tip in\r\norder to be in sufficient proximity to the sample.  This process will\r\nrequire the development of a micromechanical silicon submount onto which\r\nthe JJ will be processed.   Once the sensing element has been fabricated it\r\nmust be integrated into a larger instrument composed of cryogenically\r\ncooled piezo-stages and circuits to monitor and amplify the signals from\r\nthe  JJ.  When completed, the combination of high field sensitivity and\r\nhigh spatial resolution will allow for the study of vortex states in\r\nsuperconductors, charge transport in circuits and biological systems, the\r\nmagnetic state of mesoscopic magnets, and the spin state of electrons in\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\nFinally, the development of a new scanning probe microscope offers exciting\r\nopportunities for interdisciplinary education.  Already, students working\r\non device processing, circuit design, mesoscopic device physics and\r\nmaterials science have all participated in the development of the core\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
