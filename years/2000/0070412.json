 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to describe equilibrium solutions to\r\nboundary value problems for linear and nonlinear elliptic partial\r\ndifferential equations.  The PI intends to prove existence and\r\nregularity theorems for two-phase free boundary problems.  The PI will\r\nalso describe level sets of eigenfunctions, especially nodal sets,\r\nmaxima, and minima, and find optimal bounds on the shape of level sets\r\nfor convex domains even if the domain becomes long and thin.  Another\r\ngoal is to solve a problem in mathematical economics of finding all\r\npossible functional forms of a price-independent social welfare\r\nfunction (using methods of exterior algebra and overdetermined\r\nsystems).  A third goal is to characterize the camera image of a\r\nbuilding using the Fourier transform, that is, to characterize the\r\ndistortion of the periodic pattern on the face of the building if the\r\nbuilding is not exactly parallel to the camera.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI plans to describe the equilibrium between two phases in several\r\nproblems arising in physics and engineering.  The focus will be on the\r\nboundary between two materials such as ice and water.  Other examples\r\ninclude the boundary between two liquids and the profile of the wake\r\nof a boat.  In another direction, the PI will attempt to confirm a\r\nprinciple first proposed by J. Rauch that the point of maximum\r\ntemperature in an insulated room tends towards a wall as time\r\nincreases.  More generally, the PI will examine how the geometry of a\r\nfixed boundary (as in the walls of a room) affects the shape of\r\nsurfaces of equal temperature at or near the equilibrium steady state\r\ntemperature.  In a third direction, the PI will try to find all\r\npossible price-independent social welfare functions.  This is of\r\ncurrent interest because such functions are used to compare countries\r\nand to describe the trend towards greater income inequality in the\r\n1990s in the U. S. as well as earlier trends in the opposite\r\ndirection. The problem is that prices cannot be held fixed in such\r\ncomparisons.  The PI expects that price independence puts serious\r\nlimits on the functional forms allowed, which in turn puts limits on\r\nthe way comparisons can be made.  Finally, the PI proposes a project\r\nintended to help solve the problem in computer vision of recognizing\r\nthe orientation of a building from a photograph.\r\n\r\n",
