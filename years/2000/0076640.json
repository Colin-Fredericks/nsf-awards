 "awd_abstract_narration": "George Richter-Addo of the University of Oklahoma is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for  research on the reactions of nitroso and nitrosyl groups with metalloporhyrins. The long-term goal of the research is to use spectroscopic, spectroelectrochemical, structural and electronic properties of X-N=O compounds to increase understanding of reactions of such compounds with metalloporphyrins, and of the reactions of metalloporphyrins containing X-N=O components. Chemical and spectroelectrochemical reactions of metalloporphyrin complexes of nitrosamines and nitrosoarenes  will be investigated as well as the chemistry of products that result from trans additions of alkyl nitrites and thionitrites to porphyrins. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the reaction chemistry of the target compounds.\r\n\r\nAlthough N=O is a small molecule it has a complex and important chemistry. Compounds of the X-N=O sort are of central importance in biological, industrial and ecological systems, among others. The -N=O grouping in molecules can participate in a wide variety of diverse chemical reactions, depending on the detailed nature of the molecules in which the -N=O group is bound. Following up on a successful research effort that has characterized the atomic and electronic structures of a variety of X-N=O species, including many in which X has been the biologically important porphyrin grouping, the present program focuses on the various types of chemical reactivity that are  exhibited by the N=O grouping in its compounds, and seeks to elucidate how those  reactivity-patterns are influenced by atomic and electronic structure. Progress in gaining such understanding would have important consequences for science and technology in all the many areas in which X-N=O compounds are involved.",
