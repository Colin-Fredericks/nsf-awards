 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will examine how firms are able to effectively share knowledge across diverse functions and perspectives during enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems implementation. The primary objective of the study is to provide a theoretically grounded assessment of factors that enable firms to articulate and integrate the diversity of knowledge required for effective use of ERP. This includes factors that impact how existing knowledge is shared and how new knowledge is absorbed and transferred to become part of the firm's core knowledge competency. Following a case-study protocol, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with ERP team members in participating firms by telephone and on site.Computer-aided text analysis of the corrected transcripts will be used for within-site and between-site response comparisons, addressing seven propositions in the proposal. Among other variables and issues to be addressed is whether firm cultures that emphasizes group over individual achievement are more process/outcome oriented than deadline driven (Proposition 1). The interview protocol will include questions on organization structure, organization culture, process versus deadline orientation, the incorporation of new knowledge into core knowledge competencies, and tacit knowledge sharing.",
