 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWhereas in atomic and molecular three-level systems a number of important nonlinear coherent optical effects, such as electromagnetically-induced transparency, lasing without inversion, dark states, and adiabatic population transfer are by now well established, the potential of finding  analogous effects in semiconductors has not yet been exploited. The purpose of this research is the application of these techniques of atomic/molecular physics to the study of condensed matter systems.  Specifically, experimental and theoretical studies will be performed of excitonic three-band coherences in semiconductor quantum wells. The main goal is the identification of similarities and fundamental differences between excitonic three-band systems on the one hand and their atomic three-level counterparts on the other hand. Experimentally, the work is based on femtosecond two-color laser pulses, which couple to the heavy-hole and the light-hole exciton, respectively. The theoretical analysis includes the description of radiative and non-radiative quantum coherences, bandstructure effects, and quantum mechanical many-body correlations. The nonlinear coherent effects and basic physical issues under consideration are (i) excitonic three-band Rabi oscillations, (ii) coherent dark states in semiconductors, (iii) adiabatic heavy-hole-to-light-hole population transfer, and (iv) the influence of charge-carrier correlations on these effects, for example intervalence-band charge-carrier scattering, exciton-exciton scattering, and biexcitonic effects.  This research will be conducted with graduate students who will thereby acquire research skills in a forefront area of condensed matter physics and materials science.  These skills will enable them to be productive members of the technical workforce of the 21st century.\r\n***\r\nIn atoms, laser light is usually not simply absorbed, but leads to coherent and reversible excitations of electrons. In the simplest and probably most fundamental scenario, the light induces an oscillatory behavior that consists of excitation and de-excitation of the electrons in the atom. Semiconductors, on the other hand, tend to simply absorb light, not allowing for such coherent and reversible processes. However, recent experiments have shown that, on ultrashort timescales, semiconductors do exhibit certain coherent effects, which bear some resemblance to their atomic counterparts. In this project, we try to observe and establish some of these semiconductor-atom analogies through a combination of experiments with ultrashort light pulses and a theory that allows for a quantum mechanical description of semiconductors. We focus on semiconductor systems that involve two coupled electronic transitions, because the atomic counterpart to these systems, the so-called three-level atoms, promise far-reaching applications in nonlinear optics and laser physics. The results of these investigations have great potential to advance the development and use of semiconductors in technological devices.  This research involves graduate students who will receive training in one of the forefront areas of contemporary condensed matter physics and materials science.  This training will prepare them to be productive members of the technological workforce of the 21st Century.\r\n%%% \r\n",
