 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  A guided-inquiry, collaborative physical chemistry laboratory course is being developed.  Motivated by a concern that our physical chemistry laboratories should reflect the way measurements are carried out in modern laboratories, and inspired by the successful reforms of general chemistry, we are adapting and implementing the accepted pedagogical strategies of guided-inquiry and collaborative learning in a problem based approach in a physical chemistry laboratory course.  Pedagogical strategies used in the New Traditions systemic chemistry initiative, and more generally discussed by the NSF report on Curricular Developments in the Analytical Sciences, are being adapted.\r\n\r\nOur primary goals are: 1) to develop two guided-inquiry, collaborative projects where the students learn to develop laboratory procedures, gather samples and obtain data, analyze and interpret data, and effectively communicate their results and 2) to equip our physical chemistry laboratory with instruments which allow us to develop a guided-inquiry, collaborative project which centers on a problem facing the pharmaceutical industry, polymorphism of drug substances.  The methodology of the laboratory projects themselves will be adapted from the pharmaceutical research literature and from experiments published in the chemical education literature.  New instruments include a differential scanning calorimeter and a polarized light microscope with a hot stage The projects are being developed, implemented, evaluated, and revised during a two-year time frame.\r\n\r\nChanging the way the physical chemistry laboratory is taught is having a significant impact on the entire chemistry curriculum.  Adapting and implementing a guided-inquiry approach begins a reform of the chemistry laboratory curriculum because none of our laboratory courses previously used that approach. The development and implementation of two guided-inquiry collaborative physical chemistry laboratory projects is promoting changes in the laboratory courses across the chemistry curriculum, injecting a problem based approach into our laboratory curriculum, and providing instruments which can be integrated into our courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
