However, results of recent research regarding improved mix design systems and quality control techniques have remained largely unknown to undergraduate students who will be building and maintaining the pavements in near future. At present, there is a severe lack of opportunity for the undergraduate students to gain field experience and learn application of statistical concepts in quality control in asphalt technology. The objectives of this project are to provide the undergraduate students tools for field experience in asphalt pavement construction, including quality control techniques, and to teach the concepts of statistical quality control through analysis of real time quality control test data. A thorough knowledge of all aspects of asphalt mix design and construction, and an experience of using real time data for statistical quality control is needed to understand the link between design and construction, and identify potential problems during production, construction, and life of the pavement. The equipment requested will be used with the existing equipment to provide an all around well-balanced coursework, which integrates design, production, laydown and compaction of asphalt mixtures. Three pieces of equipment will be used by the students: the pavement quality indicator for measuring in-place density during construction, the rapid triaxial device for evaluating mixes during production, and portable computers with statistical software for analyzing real time quality control data. The undergraduate students will use the in-place measurements to gain experience in operation of equipment, understand techniques of proper interpretation of test results and making decisions based on test results.\r\n",
