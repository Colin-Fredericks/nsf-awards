 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile users require a functionality similar to that provided by traditional desktop computers. This includes the ability to access distributed, heterogeneous information sources. Yet existing approaches to providing transparent access to distributed information sources are geared towards fixed networks and do not take into account specific needs of mobile users. These needs have their roots in two characteristics: mobility and poor connectivitiy. But in order to meet these needs, middleware components used to provide transparent access to information sources have to be adapted consideralby. In view of this, our research we will extend the middleware components of the most popular paradigm to providing transparent access to heterogeneous information sources, (viz., the mediator architectures) to meet the needs of mobile users.\r\n\r\nIn particular our research will focus on four main topics: (1) the introduction of a location-aware trading service that allows mobile users to find the appropriate mediator to answer a query based not only on the contents offered by the mediator but also on how easily it is accessible from the current user location, (2) the introduction of mediators capable of handling location-dependent queries, (3) the development of a management strategy for mediators that governs the generation and replication of mediators and the materialization of results, and (4) the development of an interface agent supporting location-dependent and wireless querying.\r\n\r\nWith these extensions, mediator-based systems will fully support mobile users, thus allowing them the im-portant transparent access to heterogeneous, distributed information sources. Targeted applications include traveling salespersons accessing their companies' information sources, scientists working in the field accessing internet-based databases, emergency physicians accessing patient information and the information needs of emergency personnel handling natural disasters.\r\n",
