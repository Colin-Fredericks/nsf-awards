 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference on Composite Materials is one of the few Gordon Research Conferences that address a field within the purview of materials science.  The field of composite materials is highly interdisciplinary, \r\nRequiring efforts of physicists, chemists, mechanicians, mathematicians and materials scientists.  The atmosphere of a Gordon Research Conference includes an ample time for informal discussions among participants and is renown for fostering interactions among scientists form different disciplines.  This interaction is essential for progress to be made in an interdisciplinary subject like composite materials.  One of the best conference experiences a scientist can have is to attend a Gordon Research Conference in his or her area of specialization.\r\n\r\nThe speakers invited to the 2000 Gordon Research Conference on Composite Materials will cover a range of subjects, including biomemetics, novel approaches to manufacturing of composites, nanocomposites, and interfacial issues.  Emphasis will be placed on how the composites community should handle the issues that remained unresolved as the 20th century come to a close, and on where the composites community should best place it's efforts to meet the challenges it faces at the beginning of the 21st Century.\r\n",
