A long-term objective of this work is to determine the composition and detailed structural organization of the RNPs and to obtain a mechanistic understanding of how these complexes contribute to rRNA modification and ribosome biogenesis.  The proposed work will also provide a foundation for detailed structural questions regarding the nature of the RNP interactions and the molecular basis of thermostability of RNA/protein interactions in hyperthermophilic organisms.  The findings should also provide valuable information on the extent of evolutionary conservation of the rRNA processing and modification machinery in Archaea and Eukarya.  The specific aims of this project are to identify the protein and RNA components of the modification guide RNPs, to characterize the RNA/protein and protein/protein interactions within the RNPs, and to establish a cell-free rRNA 2'-O-methylation system to study the function of the methylation guide RNPs.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nMCB-0077863\r\nMichael Terns and Rebecca Terns\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the structure and function of modification guide ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) in the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus.
