 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) The objective of this project is to develop a program in herpetology that transcends and unifies scientific disciplines and emphasizes training students to conduct original, high-quality, publishable research. Herpetology, the study of amphibians and reptiles, forms the core of a teaching/research program that is being utilized by students (including non-majors) taking a variety of courses and involved in various levels of original research. Herpetology is an ideal field for such a program because studies in herpetology can easily integrate different disciplines in biology. To develop such a program, we are working to discover and develop local study sites and long-term mark-recapture studies. We are providing training and developing courses in modern technological methods (e.g., Geographic Information Systems - GIS, Global Positioning Systems - GPS, and automated data acquisition) and developing a computerized, relational-database that provides the foundation for local studies of amphibians and reptiles. Research in herpetology is being adapted for use in a variety of established courses including introductory and molecular biology, animal physiology, animal behavior, vertebrate field zoology, and biostatistics. The immediate and long-term impact will be an exciting teaching/research program that unifies the curriculum and provides students with invaluable experience conducting high-quality, original research.",
