Dissipation in solids often describes  conversion of kinetic energy to heat as in, for example, a sound wave passing through a solid exciting its atoms, and raising their energy level. The increased kinetic energy of the oscillations of atoms define the heat capacity of a solid  with the assumption that they are in\r\nthermal equilibrium.  Simulation of dissipation in a solid involves a 3-D lattice of oscillators that represent atoms connected to each other with springs. Springs represent displacement-dependent forces that\r\nresult from the nonlinear potential between the atoms.  The specific research tasks to accomplish this goal begin with a one-dimensional array of nonlinearly connected oscillators to investigate numerically the conditions of irreversibility and equipartitioning. The simulations will then be extended to nonideal lattices that include impurities to describe real solids to investigate their role in wavenumber (and frequency)\r\nconversion. \r\n\r\nAn important aspect of this effort will  be to determine the lower limit of the size of simulations to correctly\r\ndescribe dissipation in a solid and determine means to quantify dissipation characteristics of solids. The proposed investigation will also help clarify the theoretical requirements inherent in fuzzy damping by putting them on a more fundamental footing regarding energy equipartition and irreversible absorption of energy.",
