Model single crystal oxide surfaces will be used as supports, and supported oxide will be fabricated and studied using a number of surface science tools.  In particular, vanadia supported on titania and alumina single crystal surfaces at submonolayer to monolayer coverages will be studied.  Supported vanadia will be grown using chemical vapor deposition and immersion in aqueous solution.  The growth morphology and structure of the supported oxide will be studied by scanning tunneling microscopy.  The electronic structure will be studied by photoelectron and electron energy loss spectroscopy.  Related surface reactivity will be examined by both temperature programmed methods and by steady state reaction techniques.  Methanol oxidation and butene reduction will be used as test reactions. A large number of commercial heterogeneous catalysts are based on supported vanadia species, and this work has the potential to guide the preparation and development of vanadia and other supported oxide catalysts.\r\n\r\n",
