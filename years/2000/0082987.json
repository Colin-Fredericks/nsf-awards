 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nThe channel fading and co-channel interference present in a wireless radio propagation channel presents a harsh challenge to the radio design engineer. Diversity techniques commonly used to combat the channel include the use of interleaved coded modulation and multiple antennas at the receiver end. Lately there has been a great deal of interest in the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter end, i.e., in using transmit diversity.  Researchers have shown that the capacity of multi-antenna systems significantly exceeds that of conventional single-antenna systems. Space-time codes attempt to realize the potential increase in capacity by distributing code symbols intelligently in space (across the different transmit antennas) and time.  This topic has received a great deal of attention since the BLAST space-time system was proposed and demonstrated at Bell Labs. This is because, owing to the additional dimensionality obtain by exploiting space, a spectral efficiency of 40 bits per sec per Hz at realistic signal to noise ratios was demonstrated (i.e., 20 times the spectral efficiency achieved in current cellular systems). The importance of space-time methods in communication and information theory was recently recognized by the selection of the work by Tarokh, Seshadri and Calderbank for the 1999 IEEE Information Theory Paper Prize.  The great majority of space-time coding research has been based on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\nSingle-user link or time-division multiplexed\r\n\r\nComplex Gaussian channel gains (frequency at fading) from each transmit (Tx) antenna to each receive (Rx) antenna.\r\n\r\nIndependent channels for each Tx-Rx antenna pair.\r\n\r\nEqual average energy in each Tx-Rx antenna channel.\r\n\r\nTime non-selective channels (quasi-static assumption)\r\n\r\nBased on these assumptions, effective design rules have been established by considering the probability of pairwise codeword error. These design rules aim to maximize the diversity and coding gains.  The assumptions described above best represent a system with a dense, rich scattering environment sur-rounding the Tx and Rx antenna arrays and stationary or slowly moving receivers. This model is applicable, for example, to an indoor office environment. It may also be accurate for a pedestrian cellular user in a dense urban environment, depending on the base-station antenna location. However, space-time channel measurements and models suggest that in many cases of practical interest, the above assumption of independence of channel gains is not accurate.  The lack of like-signal interference may also not be applicable to code-division multiple access (CDMA)\r\nsystems since a well-utilized CDMA system is limited by such interference. Virtually all third-generation mobile radio standards are based on CDMA systems as are the most effective wireless LAN systems. In a CDMA system, the effects of signature sequence design must also be considered together with coding and\r\nmodulation.\r\nIn this project, we have developed an expression for the pairwise error probability for a system model that is broadly applicable. Our model includes arbitrary correlation between Tx-Rx antenna channels, multiple CDMA users, and the potential for time variations in the channel gains. Based on this model we propose to develop design rules for space-time spreading and coding for CDMA systems. Our goal is to develop rules that are applicable to a variety of applications (i.e., mobile users and dense scattering, or fixed-point systems\r\nout of the scatter) and/or which are robust to uncertainties in the channel model.\r\nWe propose to generalize the methods of space-time coding so that the approach may be used in CDMA systems and/or systems without rich scattering environments. Research directions include rules for spacetime spreading and code design, investigation of receiver structures and channel estimation/tracking, code design for simplified decoding and modified design rules for non-Euclidean distance receivers. This study will be conducted under different channel model assumptions and presumed knowledge at the receiver and transmitter of channel knowledge.\r\n",
