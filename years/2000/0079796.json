Specifically, the microscope's ability to resolve individual surface\r\natoms has lead to an improved understanding of the chemistry and physics of solid\r\nsurfaces. How a chemical reaction proceeds on a surface, or how different surface atoms\r\ndiffuse, segregate, or combine can be literally watched on an atomic scale. The awarded\r\ninstrument will be used to investigate the formation of metal silicides on silicon, since\r\nmetal/semiconductor interfaces continue to impact device fabrication. At a more\r\nfundamental level, understanding the processes that lead to metal silicide formation will\r\nallow the controlled formation of nanoscale particles, particles that are driven to self-assemble\r\nby their reactivity. The instrument will also be used to investigate how reactions proceed \r\non gallium nitride (from which electro-optic devices that emit in the blue/violet can be \r\nmade). In particular, the dynamics of hydrogen on the gallium nitride surface is of \r\ntechnological interest, and can also be used as a probe of local surface reactivity. \r\nSince gallium nitride surfaces are also polar (N- vs. Ga-terminated), the impact of \r\nsurface polarity on surface reactions will also be studied.\r\n\r\nSemiconductors are widely used in electronic and electro-optic devices. Nearly all\r\ncomputer chips, for example, are fabricated from silicon. Compound semiconductors\r\n(the so-called III-V semiconductors) are often found in devices which convert electrical\r\nenergy into light, namely light-emitting diodes, found in nearly all consumer electronics,\r\nand laser diodes, which form the heart of a solid state laser, the engine in laser printers \r\nand compact disc players.  Research into semiconductors has lead to the development of \r\nfaster, smaller computer chips (and thus computers), and novel electro-optic devices. \r\nThe scanning tunneling microscope has done much to broaden our knowledge of \r\nsemiconductors and metals, providing a unique view of material surfaces unavailable by \r\nany other technique.  Specifically, this microscope is capable of attaining atomic \r\nresolution images of surfaces.  With it, surface physics and chemistry can observed on \r\nan atomic scale. In short, how atoms move and distribute themselves on a surface, or \r\nhow a chemical reaction proceeds on a surface, can be imaged directly with a scanning \r\ntunneling microscope. The awarded instrument will be used to further our understanding of \r\nhow metals interact with silicon, and to investigate the surface chemistry of novel \r\nsemiconductor materials used in electro-optic applications.\r\n",
