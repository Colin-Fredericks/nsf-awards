The Foundation Series is envisioned as a set of portable and complete laboratory modules structured upon a paradigm that incorporates several learning theories and embraces an interdisciplinary spirit. The objectives are to address the need for clear bridges between math, science and technology in the engineering curriculum and to provide a means of faculty development primarily at community colleges. As a result, the modules are designed to allow the engineering student to experience the synergy of science, math and engineering technology in a laboratory setting. Recent findings in higher-education educational research are used in the module design to develop the ability to work in a team and to communicate results as well as to reach students of diverse learning styles.  The targeted audience is sophomore engineering majors at community colleges and institutions without Materials Science and Engineering programs. The Foundation Series Team includes faculty from Mathematics, Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering from a 4-year and a 2-year institution. During the proof of concept phase, one complete laboratory module that includes the learning objectives and accompanying educational materials is being produced. The effectiveness of the prototype Foundation Series module (\"Corrosion\") are being evaluated against seven other \"traditional\" experiments by over 200 sophomore engineering students at Cal Poly (a 4-year institution) and Cuesta Community College (a 2-year institution). Development of new laboratory modules based upon the Foundation Series paradigm is planned for follow-on proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
