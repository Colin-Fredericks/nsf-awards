 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry  (12)\r\nThis project is developing an interdisciplinary, multi-week, project-based, cooperative-learning laboratory program in freshman chemistry and in two analytical chemistry courses. This project combines the disciplines of biology, environmental science and chemistry in investigating the area of phytoremediation or the use of hyperaccumulators, plants capable of accumulating metal ions to reduce levels of metal in soils.  Investigations outlined in journals such as Science, J. Environ. Qual., and J. Geochem. Explor. are being adapted for use in this project.  An objective is to guide the students away from simply memorizing scientific concepts and toward guided scientific inquiry with an emphasis on interdisciplinary work. Students  (a) learn experimental techniques, (b) learn concepts required to understand the problem they choose to investigate, (c) select the \"problem\" to investigate, (d) design the experimental methods, (e) conduct the data collection, (f) analyze the results and (g) communicate their findings to their peers in a seminar format. By working to solve open-ended problems that are of interest to them and are interdisciplinary in nature, students learn to think critically and become better problem solvers, and the learning process becomes more exciting and relevant. Early exposure to interdisciplinary problem solving encourages students to enthusiastically remain in science and to have successful undergraduate research experiences. While studies have shown that project-based, cooperative learning increases achievement for students of all ability levels from diverse academic backgrounds, this type of learning is shown to be particularly beneficial to female, minority, or handicapped students. The major instrument that is essential for the development of this project-based curriculum is a dual-channel ion chromatography system suitable for determining anions and Group I and 11 cations with electrochemical detection, or transition metal cations and organic compounds with absorption detection.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
