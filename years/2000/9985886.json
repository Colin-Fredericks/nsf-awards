Taking seriously the genealogies of French elite chemists at the Jardin du roi and the Academie royale des sciences, the P.I. seeks to configure the two major theory domains of chemistry they stabilized -- composition and affinity --- between the domains of chemical philosophy and chemical practice. It was precisely the ability of chemical teachers at the Jardin to mediate between the imperative of chemical philosophy and the requirements of chemical practice which made French chemistry successful in the second half of the eighteenth century. Lavoisier and Guyton each picked up one of these main theory-domains and pursued them systematically with new experimental techniques, forging the Chemical Revolution. Affinity, rather than composition, constituted the theoretical frontier of French chemistry during the period.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis on theoretical chemistry does not endorse a return to the history-of-ideas tradition in historiography. The P.I. intends to dissociate the domain of chemical theory from that of chemical philosophy. While chemical philosophy -- be it Aristotelian, Paracelsian, Cartesian or Newtonian -- aimed at explaining chemical phenomena as a part of the general order of the universe, chemical theories catered to the demands of chemical practice. It was the need to organize the expanding chemical territory in a meaningful way that gave rise to chemical theories. In contrast to a number of specific theories such as the phlogiston or the oxygen theory which were used to make sense of a limited range of phenomena, composition and affinity reflected more broad, yet essential practical strategies chemists relied on in their practice. Chemical philosophies, largely useless in guiding laboratory practice, nevertheless performed important functions in the social legitimation and the pedagogy of chemistry. As the analytic tools of chemistry became more and more refined and philosophical fashions kept changing, the two theory-domains of composition and affinity were reformulated at each stage to accommodate them. By configuring the domain of chemical theory, therefore, the P.I. is layering pre-Lavoisian chemistry into the three domains of philosophy, theory and practice. The stability and the vitality of French chemical tradition depended on the interactive stabilization of these three domains.\r\n\r\nTo the degree that the Chemical Revolution is perceived as a \"paradigmatic example of a revolution in science,\" this work will have an impact on the philosophical modeling of scientific revolutions. The didactic tradition of chemistry played in important function in regulating the long-term development of the discipline by nurturing stable domains of theory and by re-inventing them at each stage of analytic refinements.\r\n",
