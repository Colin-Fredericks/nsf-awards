 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe School District of Philadelphia (SDP) proposes to advance significantly the science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) education of all K-12 students through the Philadelphia Urban Systemic Program (PHUSP). The PHUSP goals parallel those of the USP that seeks: (1) to improve student achievement in science and mathematics; (2) to advance the implementation of mathematics and science education reform in the District; (3) to increase the competency and diversity of teachers and administrators; and (4) to promote collaborations with colleges and universities.\r\n\r\nThe SDP proposes to accomplish this task by building on the existing infrastructure developed by reform efforts that began in 1995 concomitantly with the awarding of the Urban Systemic Initiative.  The foundational tenets include a strong preK-12 leadership team, a standards-based curriculum for science and mathematics based on the SDP Curriculum Frameworks, Content Standards, and Benchmarks.  \r\n\r\nThe core structure is also characterized by a state-driven school accountability plan, and policy changes that increase graduation requirements for science and mathematics, recertification mandates for teachers and principals, and the teaching of SMT at grades preK-12.  The infrastructure also features converged fiscal and intellectual resources, and significant external support for the implemented curriculum from multiple institutions of higher education, business partners, and the community.\r\n\r\nState, district, and classroom data are being used extensively to inform and drive change supported by research and evaluative studies and surveys from local and national experts. \r\nAn array of instructional materials supports the implemented curricula that have embedded technology, integration of disciplines, community links, problem-based instruction, and writing across the disciplines. \r\n",
