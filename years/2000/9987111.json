 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the program is to provide educational opportunities to low-income, academically talented student through scholarships that promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement at the baccalaureate level. The program is designed to significantly increase the graduation rate of low-income students studying computer science, mathematics, and engineering by offering a comprehensive program of mentoring, advising, and financial support. Another goal of the program is to increase the graduation rate of low-income undergraduate students by at least 25% through a comprehensive program of faculty mentoring, mandatory advising, and financial support. The project directors plan to recruit at least 50% of the scholars from minority groups. The program will provide research and industrial internship opportunities to enhance the post-graduation success of low-income computer science, mathematics, and engineering undergraduates. It includes advising and job search services to CSEMS scholars in job placement after graduation, or selection of and enrollment in a graduate program. The program features the creation of an administrative structure that integrates the scholarship program and ensures that the infrastructure is in place to support the goals of the program. \r\n\r\nThe proposed program takes advantage of the urban character of the university by targeting low-income transfer students for recruitment into computer science, mathematics, and engineering. A seminar series is provided that includes invited speakers from industry. Field trips to local industrial sites are offered. A number of resources to enhance retention and ensure success are provided such as drop-in rooms for minority students, mandatory advising, assignment of a faculty mentor to each scholar, and the CSEMS seminar series.\r\n\r\n",
