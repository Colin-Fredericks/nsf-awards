 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry  (12)  The aim of this project is to revitalize and redesign the instrumental analysis laboratory course by adapting and implementing interdisciplinary experiments involving relevant biochemical, pharmaceutical, and biological samples. Literature from journals provides the source for the adapted experiments.  A capillary electrophoresis (CE) system, purchased with project funds, is used to analyze DNA, proteins, nucleotides, and chiral pharmaceutical compounds, and thus complements and promotes the interdisciplinary nature of the course.  In addition to CE, students use current chromatographic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical techniques to analyze biochemical, biological, and pharmaceutical samples.  Our goal in this course is for students to learn and understand the fundamental principles underlying chemical instrumentation and how these principles are applied to the analysis of samples in a wide variety of chemistry-related fields.  The acquisition of a CE impacts students in three other major fields of study. The CE is used in a pharmaceutical science laboratory course, an advanced biochemistry laboratory, and an advanced molecular life science course.  Undergraduate students in the advanced molecular life science course use the CE to conduct research aimed at quantifying the effects of trauma on nucleotide levels in tissue samples.  The CE is also used in undergraduate research aimed at elucidating the intermolecular interactions governing micellar electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis separations.  In the future, the instrumental analysis course may be fused with the advanced biochemistry laboratory course and used as a model in the progression of our advanced laboratory sequence toward a truly integrated and interdisciplinary format. Thus, this project represents modest, but carefully considered initial changes in the overall advanced laboratory curriculum, with the changes being aimed at offering a truly interdisciplinary and pedagogically sound laboratory experience for students.\r\n\r\n",
