The LENS process utilizes computer-aided design solid models to automatically control the manufacture of functional, near-net shape, fully dense coatings metallic parts with reasonably complex features. Moreover, the LENSTM technique is unique in its flexibility for the direct fabrication of a component over conventional processing as well as Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies, including the ability to create an \"embedded\" structure, superior material properties for a comparable wrought material, and minimum waste.   The research will establish the fundamental issues underlying the fabrication of nanostructured coatings/laminate composites based one firm and detailed understanding of the relevant fundamental phenomena.  One example is the unusual thermal stability inherent to certain types of nanostructured materials.  Critical issues in nanostructured coating and/or layered structural materials fabricated by LENSTM technology will be addressed. By varying powder mixture and using multiple powder feeders, the LENSTM facility will be used to fabricate a functionally gradient coating and laminate composites from a variety of materials.  The PI 's will fabricate functionally gradient nanostructured coatings/laminates, and investigate the related fundamental phenomena (i.e., interfacial bonding, thermal stress, and grain size and growth) as well as mechanical properties will be investigated.\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nThis is an instrument acquisition award to the University of California at Irvine.  Professor Lavernia and collaborators will purchase a LENSTM model 750 for Laser Engineered Net Shaping process, for the direct fabrication of nanostructured coatings/laminate composites. Significant interest has been generated recently in the field of nanostructured (also described as nanocrystalline, nanophase, or nanoscale) materials, in which the grain size is usually in the range of 1-100 nanometers.  More than 50 volume percent of atoms in nanocrystalline materials may be associated with grain boundaries or interfacial boundaries when the grain size is small enough.  Thus, a significant amount of interfacial component between neighboring atoms associated with grain boundaries contributes to the physical properties of nanocrystalline materials.  Interest in this class or materials is driven by their unusual physical properties, such as a very high strength and thermal stability.  In the case of nanostructured coatings, the potential applications span the entire spectrum of technology, from thermal barrier coatings for turbine blades to wear resistant rotating parts.  The new instrument will strengthen the interdiciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students at UCI.  \r\n",
