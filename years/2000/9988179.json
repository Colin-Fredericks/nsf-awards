 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing volume and evolving types of Internet applications have been\r\ndemanding enhanced service from the Internet infrastructure. A significant amount of\r\nwork is in progress on the networking aspects of the Internet. To complement these\r\nefforts, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to explore the issues at the server\r\nlevel.  Specifically, this proposal addresses the support for service differentiation and \r\noverload control in Internet servers.\r\n\r\nSupport for service differentiation at the servers is necessary because of\r\ntwo primary reasons. First, evolving applications like e-commerce and continuous media\r\ntransmission will be highly benefited by the differentiated service model. Second, the\r\nadoption (most likely) of some form of service differentiation (at the router level)\r\nin the next-generation Internet will demand the servers to reciprocate in their\r\nservices. The proposed research in this context will be approached in two steps: (a)\r\nformulation of algorithms for service differentiation, and (b) evaluation of the\r\neffectiveness and performance of service differentiating Internet servers.\r\n\r\nOverloads at the servers are unavoidable because of the bursty and\r\nunpredictable nature of the Internet traffic. Overload causes severe performance\r\ndegradation or even crashes the server. E-commerce businesses incur serious financial losses\r\nbecause of the overloaded servers. The performance degradation of overloaded servers\r\nmay be greatly reduced by incorporating overload control mechanisms at the\r\nservers. The PI proposes to address the design and implementation of overload control\r\nmechanisms at the application level.\r\n\r\nIn general, the performance and functionality of the Internet servers will\r\nbe greatly enhanced by the adoption of service differentiation and overload control\r\nmechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the proposed research will have a broader impact on the\r\nInternet infrastructure and on its users. Specifically, the proposed techniques will\r\nbe complementary to the efforts in the direction of the next-generation\r\nInternet, and will be helpful for the e-commerce industry. They will also facilitate the\r\nsupport of continuous media objects in the Internet. At the local level, the\r\nresearch will have a positive educational impact on the students of Michigan State\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
