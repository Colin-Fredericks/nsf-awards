 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nThis project addresses the need for more critical observational skills among college biology students and the need to have students see the microscope as a tool of inquiry, rather than a tool for observation only. The main objectives are to: develop and adapt inquiry-based modules using microscopy, improve students' skills of observation, encourage collaborative activities in the classroom, encourage use of electronic resources, and build a community of learners within the Biology Department and across campus.  Additionally, an opportunity for regional secondary school teachers to obtain credits for continued certification by offering an in-service institute on microscopy is being provided.  Expected outcomes are increased critical observation skills of the students, a tight-knit academic community and hence greater retention of students in the program, and an awareness by the students that they may use the microscope to ask questions and solve problems.  Five inquiry-based modules plus the in-service institute are being developed.  One module is being designed for each grade level, with exercises increasing in complexity as the students proceed to the upper division courses.  Each module is asking the students to participate in the formulation and/or testing of a hypothesis to reinforce the process of scientific investigation.  Exercises are structured so that they reflect \"real world\" problems, e.g., wood decomposition, importance of mycorrhizal fungi, bacterial contamination of work surfaces and intracellular calcium as a regulator of cellular function.  Some of the development is based on adaptation of microscopy lab teaching modules developed by faculty at Kent State U with NSF support. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
