Workshop topics include discussion of large/long-span bridge systems including financial, environmental, design, construction, and jurisdiction issues and current operational and maintenance practices.  Research and development needs to be discussed include new and emerging technologies in NDE, smart materials and structures, intelligent transportation systems and health monitoring.  Focused discussions will be held on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Technology Demonstration Project.  In particular, the workshop will permit formation of a cross-disciplinary expert panel to address critical issues associated with this opportunity for the development, integration and operation of civil infrastructure systems health monitoring in conjunction with this major transportation test-bed.\r\n",
