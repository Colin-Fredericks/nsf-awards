The equipment will become part of the Integrated Microscopy Center.  The acquisition of the requested equipment will enable investigators from the UM and surrounding institutions to carry out diverse research and training activities in materials science.  These activities include: (1) characterization of the surface of orthopedic, dental, and cardiovascular materials and correlation with biological responses to the materials (2) surface and interface investigation of magnetic thin films (3) investigation of the relationship between the surface of metallic materials and their corrosion behavior in various electrolytes.  The acquisition of the requested equipment will enhance ongoing projects and facilitate new projects and continued industrial collaborations.  Equally important, the requested equipment will be used to train and educate both undergraduate and graduate students in the area of materials science.\r\n\r\nIn the last 30 years, electron microscopy has revolutionized our understanding of the relationship between the structure of materials and their properties.  Materials scientists have a growing ability to tailor materials for specific performance properties at even the atomic level.  Modern microscopy tools are essential for today's materials research challenges.  The acquisition of an atomic force microscope (AFM) and TEM sample preparation equipment will be important additions to the Integrated Microscopy Center (IMC) at the University of Memphis.  Modern TEM instruments provide almost all the structural and crystallographic information for analysis of new materials.  AFM was developed for imaging surfaces on nearly the atomic scale and has become an established surface analysis tool in scientific and industrial labs.  AFM can also measure electrical, magnetic, mechanical and thermal properties on the micron scale.  The enhanced IMC will provide increased materials research opportunities and student training in relevant job skills critical to the materials science industry.  Through collaborations, training seminars, and community outreach, the equipment will be used as a vehicle for increased interaction with regional universities and industry.  \r\n",
