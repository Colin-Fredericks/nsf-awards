 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at West Chester University of Pennsylvania to purchase a light scattering detector and accessories.  This equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty member Felix E. Goodson, whose research focuses on polymer synthesis and characterization.  Specifically, Dr. Goodson will use the instrumentation to determine the molecular weights of the polymers synthesized, and to study the molecular weight vs. radius of gyration dependencies.   In one project, he will investigate copolymers with alternating rigid and flexible segments and their structure-properties relationships.  In another project, he will explore solid phase synthesis of novel polymers with precisely defined molecular weights.  \r\n\r\nThe light scattering instrument is a pivotal tool for determining molecular weights of polymers and the effect of molecular weight on physical and materials properties of interest.  These studies should lead to a greater understanding of factors that lead to the optimization of these properties, which will in turn improve their technological applications.  The light scattering instrumentation will also allow students to gain hands-on experience with a fundamental technique of polymer characterization.\r\n\r\n",
