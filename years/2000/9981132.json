 "awd_abstract_narration": "iological Sciences (61)  Calvin College is establishing a new four-year Biotechnology major.  To do so they are: (1) adapting laboratory curricula from existing biotechnology programs at four universities (Northeastern, SUNY-Fredonia, Ferris State and James Madison), (2) implementing the revised curriculum in three new laboratory-based courses, Introduction to Biotechnology, Cell and Tissue Culture, and DNA Technology, as well as one capstone course, Biotechnology Regulations and Ethics, and (3) introducing the use of advanced biotechnology instrumentation. This new major is firmly rooted in a strong liberal arts tradition, unique in that it includes both plant- and animal-cell culture experiences, provides hands on use of advanced equipment at the undergraduate level, and addresses the social context and responsibilities of biotechnology practitioners. Course structure reflects Calvin's focus on the liberal arts and emphasis on inquiry-based learning by including a progression of experiences from the development of basic biotechnology laboratory competencies using inquiry-based group activities to student-designed experiments and opportunities for data analysis and interpretation that extend over several laboratory periods. The culmination of the sequence of courses is a semester-long set of student-designed research projects with oral and written communication of results. \r\n\r\n",
