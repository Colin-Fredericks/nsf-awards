 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Anthony Marks and collaborators will conduct two field seasons of research at the archaeological site of Galeria Pesada, located in the Estremadura region of Portugal. The Galeria is one of a number of infilled cavities located in a fault structured southeast-facing cliff. Examination of a series of underground tunnels revealed the presence of Paleolithic artifacts and with NSF support Dr. Marks conducted trial excavations in several infilled areas in an attempt to locate in situ material. A test pit in the Galeria Pesada revealed a series of superimposed strata rich in both lithic and anthropogenically modified faunal remains. Typological analysis as well as preliminary electron spin resonance dating indicates that the site can be assigned to the late Middle Pleistocene and therefore documents the shift from Lower to Middle Paleolithic cultures. Because only a small area has been excavated and relatively few artifacts recovered, Dr. Marks will, over the course of two field seasons open a larger area. Increased lithic sample size will allow him to: provide an accurate and comprehensive description of the assemblages and their constituent parts; measure the nature and degree of technological and typological continuity and change throughout the assemblages; and test the proposition that different raw materials are responsible for differences in lithic manufacture techniques. Remains of both large and small animals are represented and through their analysis Dr. Marks will attempt to reconstruct subsistence strategies and determine the extent to which purposeful hunting, as opposed to scavenging was practiced.\r\n\r\nWestern Europe was first inhabited by hominids (early humans) ca. 500,000 years ago and although archaeologists have traced in broad outline major stages of culture change significant gaps in understanding remain. Early inhabitants produced an industry which included large bifacially worked \"hand axes\" similar to those found in other regions of the Old World. At some later date distinct flake based industries appeared and these developed into the industry associated with Neanderthal peoples. Archaeologists however do not understand how this transition took place - whether it was gradual or abrupt and whether it involved replacement or in situ development. Lively disagreement exists on the capabilities of Neanderthals and their predecessors, especially their ability to hunt large animals. The deposits at the Galeria Pesada span this crucial period and Dr. Mark's research,  has the potential to shed new light on this important period of human development.\r\n",
