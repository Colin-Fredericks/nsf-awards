The paradigm adopted is that of a newly hired engineer working in an office with access to a laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe project is: 1) Developing and integrating the components of an interactive multimedia intelligent tutoring system to supplement a two semester introductory course on electric circuits for electrical engineering undergraduates, and a two semester course in electric circuits and systems for engineering students not majoring in electrical engineering. 2) Developing a realistic laboratory that enables students to select, place and interconnect circuit elements, electronic devices, electrical systems, signal generators and measuring instruments.  3) Providing students with an intelligent laboratory assistant that acts as a laboratory technician. 4) Preparing a subset of the modules for high school mathematics and science teachers that will enable them to introduce introductory engineering concepts in their classrooms. 5) Evaluating the effectiveness of the intelligent tutoring system and describing its affect on student learning.  6) Placing the resultant SEE-IT modules on CD ROM, and making these modules completely functional on the world wide web. 7) Disseminating the results over the world wide web, in appropriate journals, and through presentations at notable conferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
