 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this program is to make measurements of small-scale gravity waves, their characteristics and seasonal variability with a view to ascertaining the momentum and energy transported into the MLT and associated chemical heating rates.  This will be achieved by operating a \"Latitudinal Chain\" of stations consisting of three all-sky CCD imagers with overlapping fields of view each capable of quantitative measurements of nightglow wave structure.  Located at three strategic mid-latitude sites in the Rocky Mountain area:  Bear Lake Observatory (BLO), UT, Grand Junction, CO and Starfire Optical Range, NM, the PIs will be able to make composite field measurements of small-scale waves over a large geographic area (>1,000,000km2) sufficient to permit frequent and meaningful comparisons with the TIMED limb viewing instruments.  Measurements will be performed on a \"continuous\" basis (15 nights/month centered on the new moon) for the 2 year duration of the TIMED mission.  During TIMED overflights TIDI will measure the mesospheric wind field above the latitudinal chain while SABER will observe the MLT temperatures and will sample the distribution of radiating species.  In this manner the PIs will obtain coordinated measurements of small-scale waves for repeated TIMED overflights covering several seasons and local times.  This chain will also \"link\" together proposed cluster measurements at Ft. Collins, BLO and Starfire thereby further enhancing the potential of coordinated measurements over this important source region.",
