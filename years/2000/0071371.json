 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mesoscale convective systems (MCS's) consist of a collection of thunderstorms that organize themselves into distinct patterns.  MCS's have been shown to be the source of both beneficial Spring-time rainfall and severe weather.  Building on previous research, the Principal Investigator will continue research directed towards improved understanding of mid-latitude MCSs with a focus on their organization, longevity, embedded mesoscale circulations (especially mesoscale convective vortices, MCV's)  and coupling with the atmospheric boundary layer.  The Principal Investigator has two objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To investigate the mechanisms for organization, growth, maintenance and dissipation of mid-latitude MCS's.\r\n2. To conduct a climatological study of  MCV's and to study how MCV's initiate convection that regenerates or sustains MCS's.\r\n\r\nMCV's are mid-level, stable, weak vortices that appear to form from the remnants of MCS's.  They are believed to be important for they often appear to be the source of initiation of new convection many hours after the demise of the original MCS.  That is, after MCS's have dissipated, they appear to spawn weak MCV's which may be the trigger for the next day's round of MCS's.  If so, a complete understanding of these phenomena holds the promise of improved predictability of thunderstorms.\r\n",
