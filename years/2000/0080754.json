The program will support three cohorts of nine students and focuses broadly on \"Human Impacts on Biodiversity\". Students will travel to Alaska or England, and Mexico during their experience. The nine students form an Integrated Research Group (IRG), which consists of three learning groups. A learning group includes three students, a graduate assistant and a faculty mentor. Each learning group's focus coincides with the research program of its mentor: Habitat Fragmentation, Biodiversity or Global Climate Change. The IRG advances as learning groups share their findings and synthesize knowledge across the research foci.\r\n\r\nThe UMEB project will help students from under-represented groups become broadly-trained and highly motivated professionals in Environmental Biology, a field currently lacking this representation. The research focus on a timely topic will teach students how science can help solve societal problems, thus encouraging them to acquire and apply a range of scientific skills. In addition, the teaching methodologies and organization of the program set a high standard in student training and will be disseminated to other educators.\r\n",
