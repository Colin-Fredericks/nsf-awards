 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University will offer a summer research \r\nprogram for six students recruited nationwide. Minority students and students from colleges and universities \r\nwithout doctoral programs are especially encouraged to apply. The program will run for eight weeks in the \r\nsummer, with each student working on an individual project tailored to his or her own mathematical background.  Students will work with a faculty adviser, but interaction with their peers is considered an important component of the program. The possible subject areas, which are to be widely interpreted, \r\nare Applied Mathematics and Combinatorics. Descriptions of projects available for the coming summer appear on the department's homepage at http://odin.math.nau.edu/REU/. As well as carrying out their research, students will participate in seminar series and will each give a fifty-minute presentation. Students will also write up their work in a form suitable for publication; these will put into a single bound volume and sent to each participant.",
