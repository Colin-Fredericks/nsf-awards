 "awd_abstract_narration": "Li\r\n0078250\r\n     The investigator develops mathematical models to investigate\r\nseveral important epidemiological and ecological factors for the\r\nemergence, re-emergence and persistence of infectious diseases.\r\nThe project has three goals: (1) to develop a new mathematical\r\nframework in epidemiological modeling that links the human\r\npopulation to its environment, (2) to introduce and develop a new\r\nmathematical approach to the analysis of epidemic models, (3) to\r\nstimulate mathematical development of more effective analytical\r\nand numerical tools for resolving important computational issues\r\narising from the model analysis.  The work is carried out along\r\ntwo main themes: Theme I.  Develop a mathematical framework in\r\nepidemiological modeling using network models that takes into\r\naccount the full cycle of a disease in nature and encompasses\r\nthree interconnected key elements: human hosts, intermediate\r\nhosts and disease vectors, and environment.  Theme II.  Develop an\r\napproach to the analysis of epidemic models using the method of\r\nsingular perturbation to further our understanding of several key\r\nbiological issues such as robust mechanisms for cyclic temporal\r\npatterns in disease incidence and the short-term evolution of\r\ndisease pathogenicity.  Computational issues arising from the\r\nlarge scale systems in network models and from the multiple time\r\nscales that are inherent in disease transmission processes are\r\nalso investigated.\r\n     The global spread of infectious diseases and the emergence\r\nof drug-resistant disease agents are causes for alarm at the end\r\nof the 20th century.  As the world population continues to\r\nexplode, the world economies continue to become globalized,\r\nindividual interactions and international travel continues to\r\nincrease, and the environment around the globe continues to be\r\ndevastated, the effective control and prevention of the global\r\nspread of infectious diseases is destined to be one of the grand\r\nchallenges facing mankind in the new millennium.  Essential to our\r\nsuccess in meeting this challenge is a renewed effort in\r\nepidemiological studies, a better understanding of the\r\ntransmission and spread mechanisms of various diseases, and more\r\neffective disease control and prevention measures based on these\r\nstudies and the new understanding.  While the nature and scale of\r\nthe problems at hand inevitably limit the effectiveness of\r\nexperimental approaches, mathematical modeling has proven to be a\r\nvaluable approach and an indispensable tool for understanding the\r\nproblems, for testing hypotheses, and for predicting effective\r\nmeasures of control and prevention.  It is expected that results\r\nfrom the project can advance our understanding of the basic\r\necological and epidemiological mechanisms for the emergence,\r\nre-emergence and persistence of infectious diseases and their\r\nassociated temporal patterns, and improve the present theoretical\r\nbasis for effective disease control and prevention strategies.\r\n\r\n",
