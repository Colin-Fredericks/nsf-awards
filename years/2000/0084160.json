 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nThe Fourth International Conference on Formal Methods for Open Object-Based\r\nDistributed Systems (FMOODS 2000) will be held at Stanford University September 6-8, 2000.  The organizing committee is chaired by Carolyn Talcott (Stanford University) with co-organizers Scott Smith (PC Chair, The Johns Hopkins University) Nalini Venkatasubramanian (University of California at Irvine), and Sriram Sankar (Metamata Inc.).\r\n\r\nThe conference series was initiated by Elie Najm and Jean-Bernard Stefani, who organised the first FMOODS in Paris in 1996. The second was held in Canterbury in 1997, and the third was held in Florence in 1999.  FMOODS 2000\r\nwill be the first time the conference is held in the US.  By bringing the conference to the US we are hoping to increase the US participation in the series, and to bring more US researchers into the FMOODS community.\r\n\r\nThe objective of FMOODS is to represent work at the convergence of three important and related fields: formal methods, distributed systems, and object-based technology. This convergence is representative of some of the latest advances in the field of distributed systems (for example, the ODP reference model and the work of the OMG) and provides links between a number of important communities (for example, FORTE/PSTV, ICODP, ECOOP, et  cetera).\r\n",
