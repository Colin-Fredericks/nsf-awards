 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (31), (21) The Department of Mathematical Sciences at the university is awarding approximately 44 scholarships each semester for four semesters to low-income academically talented students in undergraduate or graduate programs in Computer Science or Mathematics to promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement for students in these fields. 75+-5% of the scholarships will be awarded to juniors, seniors and graduate students (expected to finish their degrees within the grant period). 25+- 5% of the scholarships will be awarded to freshmen and sophomores (primarily under-represented populations), to improve retention and increase diversity in the department.\r\n\r\n The program academic support infrastructure includes: peer and faculty mentors; undergraduate research programs; three monthly meetings of scholars each semester (where students learn about careers, graduate education, resume writing and interviewing skills); a list-serve for communication among scholars; an introductory social event (funded by the department) for scholars, peer and faculty mentors, and Industrial Advisory Committee participants; announcement of scholars' names to our student e-mail mailing lists, alumni newsletter, and hometown newspaper; and award of a certificate. Scholars are referred to tutors and/or workshops on study skills if departmental tracking indicates they need these services. \r\n\r\nThe five outcomes expected from the project are: (1) improved education for scholars through activities of the academic support infrastructure; (2) increased retention of students to degree achievement; (3) improved professional development and employment or pursuit of graduate education of participants, through the activities of the academic support infrastructure and with the assistance of the department's Industrial Advisory Committee members and the university's Career Services Center; (4) strengthened relationships between the department and related employment sectors, through the assistance and cooperation of the Industrial Advisory Committee in this project; and (5) discovery of effective techniques for retaining students in computer science and mathematics, particularly under-represented populations, leading to department-wide improvement of teaching and support programs and increased diversity. \r\n\r\nFive types of data are collected to evaluate the outcomes listed above. Appropriate statistical tests for the significance of results are performed. \r\n1. Questionnaires filled out by participants evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of all academic infrastructure activities. These data allow the evaluation of improved education, increased retention, professional development, and effective intervention techniques for under-represented groups. The results are used both to improve the activities and to evaluate their effectiveness overall. \r\n2. Participation in undergraduate research programs by scholarship recipients are tracked to discern increases. These data allow the evaluation of improved education. \r\n3. Student retention in the program is measured (as drop rates) pre- and post-intervention through academic support infrastructure activities to evaluate changes in retention. \r\n4. Graduates are tracked to determine employment and/or engagement in further higher education. \r\n5. Demographic statistics on students are collected to discern increases in diversity. \r\n",
