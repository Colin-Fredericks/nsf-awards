 "awd_abstract_narration": "TAPPED IN: A Testbed for New Models of On-line Teacher Professional Development\r\n\r\ninvestigate the resources, capabilities, and technological support that TPD efforts will need to hold professionally valuable on-line activities within next-generation virtual environment platforms; (b) develop, implement, and evaluate innovative TPD implementation models that integrate face-to-face and asynchronous interaction with richly collaborative synchronous on-line activities; and (c) identify social, motivational, and technological factors that contribute to (or obstruct) the effectiveness, sustainability, and scalability of a new concept of on-line TPD community.  The project will investigate four categories of issues-Implementation Process, TPD Benefits and Outcomes, Community Building, and Technology Use and Satisfaction-using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.  SECTION A - PROJECT SUMMARY\r\n\r\nResearch on educational applications of Internet technology and research on teacher professional development (TPD) each can substantially benefit from the experience and expertise of the other.  TPD programs need mechanisms for extending their reach that computer networks can provide.  Education technology research suggests that virtual communities for TPD and socialization can help teachers learn new skills and adopt new approaches that will facilitate their transition to reform-based classroom practices.  The common ground on which the two disciplines can come together is the opportunity to jointly develop effective, scalable on-line TPD models based on the social computing affordances of a new generation of Internet technologies.\r\n\r\nMany K-12 research and teacher enhancement projects are exploring the intersection of TPD and technology by providing email, listservs, and Websites to distributed groups of teachers in the context of some pedagogical intervention.  However, we believe that most current offerings only peripherally reflect established notions of successful working communities.  They provide few of the tools, communication channels, and contextual supports needed to sustain the kinds of cognitive, collaborative, and social interactions that are characteristic of successful collaborative work or communities of practice, and therefore provide limited insights into how to achieve sustainable and scalable on-line TPD communities.  \r\n\r\nEducation technology researchers need to better understand the practices and social structures of teacher professional development communities in order to develop appropriate communication channels and collaborative tools to support those practices and structures.  For example, real-time collaboration and social interaction are central characteristics of successful professional development that serve as key mechanisms for facilitating learning of new teaching strategies and promoting success in adapting to new practices.  However, with the exception of the occasional satellite video link-up, chat, or CUSeeMe session, on-line teacher support projects have not begun to tap (much less systematically investigate) the potential benefits of real-time collaboration through the Internet, leaving an incomplete research foundation on which to base the development of on-line TPD communities.  As a consequence, efforts by school districts, TPD providers, and state and regional projects to establish and sustain on-line TPD communities too often result in a disappointing mismatch between capabilities that are expedient to implement and the expressed needs and requirements of TPD activities.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed 3-year project is to establish an on-line TPD research testbed to (a) \r\nThe research will help SME&T education reform researchers and practitioners better understand and implement next-generation Internet technologies and help inform local and state policy-makers of the cost efficiencies and benefits of investing in on-line professional development.  Participation in such communities will accelerate teacher adoption of SME&T education reform efforts by providing wider and more equitable access to high-quality TPD opportunities.  Our findings will also help NSF achieve its goal of infusing urban, rural, and state systemic initiatives with the fruits of NSF research on content and pedagogy by providing a familiar and supportive venue for introducing new ideas and technologies into a context of ongoing TPD activity.\r\n",
