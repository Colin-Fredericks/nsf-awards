 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research portion of this CAREER award addresses issues related to modeling of catalytic reactors for energy conversion, including catalytic combustors for gas turbines and catalytic fuel processors that produce hydrogen for fuel cells.  Products include a methodology combining thermogravimetric and temperature-programmed reactor studies with a 1-D transient flow model to validate multistep surface chemistry mechanisms for methane conversion; detailed surface-chemistry mechanisms for methane oxidation over zirconia-supported palladium catalysts and reforming and partial oxidation over magnesium-aluminate-supported nickel-based catalysts; and a two-dimensional transient model for flows over supported catalysts in a monolith reactor, which is validated with flat-plate reactor experiments.\r\n\r\nThis research program on catalytic reactions related to energy production is complemented with an education component involving development of internet-based workbooks to introduce high-school classes to environmental issues related to energy production and usage.  These are developed in conjunction with the Center for Energy and Environmental Engineering.\r\n",
