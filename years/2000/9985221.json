 "awd_abstract_narration": "9985221\r\nKnauss\r\n\r\nThis award will support research on the continued development of a technique for the formation of dendritically branched polymers and the characterization of the resulting products.  The technique combines living polymerization methods with a convergent synthesis approach and can be designed to produce dendritic polystyrenes, polydienes, poly(alkyl methacrylate)s, and others with relatively narrow molecular weight distributions.  The synthesis is done by first initiating and polymerizing a low molecular weight chain through living methods; the living end is then reacted with a compound having both a polymerizable group and a moiety capable of quantitatively  coupling with the growing chain end.  The slow addition of this reactant either alone or with a comonomomer results in a convergence of chains and ultimately in a dendritic polymer with a living chain end at the core.  This chain end can then be functionalized with a variety of groups or can be used to initiate an added comonomer.  The synthetic method allows for a large number of architectural variations resulting in many different dendritically branched polymers.  Main aspects to be studied include the progression of the reaction, the synthesis of different dendritic polymer backbones, the molecular weight between branch points, the morphology of architectural copolymer, and the solution, rheological, and other physical properties of these materials and their blends with linear polymers.  Characterization of these novel materials will improve the understanding of the relationship between branching structure and physical properties and direct comparison with the linear version of the polymer can be accomplished.  Because this method can be used to readily produce considerable quantities of accomplished.  Because this method can be used to readily produce considerable quantities of material, the utility of such dendrititc polymers can be determined.  The educational aspects of the project will result in an improved polymer science curriculum, with laboratory experience and the availability of new classes in the polymer area and more research experience for undergraduates.   Undergraduate seniors in the chemistry department will be required to do research in the coming academic year and students will work on meaningful research projects.  This award will in part support the undergraduate research program.  Outreach to K-12 and to professionals working in the field of polymers will be accomplished by incorporation of polymer demonstrations into the current K-12 outreach program and through the development of continuing education classes in polymers.\r\n\r\nThe research is expected to improve the understanding of the relationship between branching structure and physical properties for polymers such that new materials can be designed and produced.  This will impact society in a positive manner by improving current materials and producing new ones that can be sued in current application and in applications that will be developed for the future.  The students supported by this grant will be educated to be capable of continuing the development of new materials and new applications that will further benefit society and improve the standard of living.\r\n",
