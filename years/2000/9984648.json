Cryopreservation technology -- or the low term storage of cells, tissue, and organs -- has permitted a variety of cells and tissues to be safely stored at subzero temperatures for future use, yet has not be reported for liver replacement devices.  Development of appropriate cryopreservation protocols for these devices requires a understanding of the mechanisms by which cell survival can be enhanced after exposure to low temperatures.  The specific aims of this work are to: (1) quantify key physiochemical properties important to the successful preservation of a hepatocyte/collagen system, as a function of temperature; (2)  investigate the influence of matrix protein density on hepatocyte survival after cryopreservation; and (3) computationally predict the effects of configuration, volume, and time on the survival of hepatocytes during cryopreservation of hepatic-collagen constructs.\r\n\r\nThe educational component of this award links the research training the students receive with coursework developed expressly to encourage effective interdisciplinary and team interactions.   Education through these complementary avenues will aid the students in becoming the developers of future industry and research innovations. The three  educational objectives of this award contribute to this goal through new course development, training in interdisciplinary teamwork and problem solving, and mentorship. \r\n",
