The movement of genes from horticultural and restoration plantings into wild plant populations requires three successive stages.  First, pollinators must not discriminate against the non-local individuals and therefore move pollen from ornamental and restoration plantings into local populations.  Secondly, the pollen of non-local plants must be able to fertilize the ovules of the wild population even in the presence of local pollen.  Finally, the hybrid progeny resulting from a cross between wild and horticultural plants must establish and maintain themselves in the field.  This study investigates each of these stages using  the native cardinal flower, Lobelia cardinalis.  Experimental manipulation will measure the distance of pollen movement, the relative efficiency of local and non-local pollen at fertilization, and the performance of successive generations of hybrids.\r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation study addresses all steps of hybridization between non-local and wild populations in an experimental setting.  The results of this work have implications for conservation, specifically for the potential for interactions between restoration and horticultural plantings of native species with wild populations. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
