 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to use both experiment and theory to systematically search for new intermetallic compounds with potentially interesting physical and chemical properties.  Since subtle changes of composition can lead to drastic effects on structural and physical properties in intermetallics, theoretical calculations of electronic structure will play a significant role in a complete and systematic study of these phases.  The synthesis and detailed characterization of new multinary compounds will involve (i) an electropositive alkali, alkaline earth, or rare earth metal; (ii) a transition metal; and (iii) a group 13 element (aluminum, gallium, indium), or magnesium or manganese.  The group 13 elements are selected because their position in the periodic table of elements is at the border between metals and nonmetals.  These combinations of elements are anticipated to create beautifully complex structures involving interconnected and interpenetrating clusters of atoms that will allow a thorough investigation of the relationships among composition, structure, properties, and chemical bonding.\r\n%%%\r\nMaterials with possible applications as thermoelectrics, or as strong, high temperature conductors that are anticipated to be environmentally benign will be synthesized and characterized.  The project will involve students of chemistry, physics and materials science working through Iowa State University and the Ames Laboratory to advance these areas of materials science of significant interest to industry.  Students will learn methods in high temperature chemistry, analysis, diffraction and electronic structure theory.  Fundamental results from this research regarding the structure and bonding of solids are being incorporated into courses being offered at Iowa State University.\r\n***  \r\n",
