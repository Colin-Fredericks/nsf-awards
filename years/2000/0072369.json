 "awd_abstract_narration": "0072369\r\nKawski\r\n\r\nThis project builds on the formalism of chronological algebras to study the \r\ngeometric foundations of nonlinear control systems. Geometrically, the \r\nchronological product encodes the interaction of the components of \r\ncontrolled nonlinear dynamics.  Algebraically it is the fundamental \r\nstructure that underlies effective series expansion and formal solution \r\nalgorithms. Areas of special focus are interconnections of systems, and \r\nsystems that exhibit full nonlinear dependence on the control. In either \r\ncase, specific objectives are to develop normal forms and to find effective \r\nseries (or product) representations (using tools from algebraic \r\ncombinatorics). Possible applications include algorithms for path \r\nplanning, feedback stabilization, optimal control and even numerical \r\nintegration. A complementary second thread develops interactive \r\nvisualization tools for research (simulation and experimentation) and for \r\ncommunication. This research is motivated and driven by the desire to \r\nunderstand the fundamental, common principles that govern the \r\ninteractions of dynamical systems on any scale, from molecular levels to \r\nastronomical dimensions. The diversity of possible outcomes is a \r\nconsequence of nonlinear effects that permeate our environment: When \r\ncombining two subsystems, the result is generally different from just the \r\nsum of the parts.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on further developing the algebra which captures \r\nsuch nonlinear interaction, where the effect of a+b is more than just the \r\nsum of the effects of a and b. The chronological algebra provides the \r\nformal language to model such interactions where even the order in which \r\npieces are put together matters, where a*b is generally different from b*a. \r\nThe control perspective is distinguished from the basic study of dynamical \r\nsystems as it aims beyond just descriptive understanding: The objective of \r\ncontrol theory is to exploit the subtle nature of the interactions in order to \r\nshape complex systems -- often via only minute interference with how the \r\nparts interact. While this mathematical research applies to virtually any \r\nkind of dynamical system, including even social, medical and financial \r\nenvironments, this project will focus on mechanical systems (like large \r\nsatellites with several moving parts) in efforts to demonstrate the general \r\nprinciples. An important component of this project is the development of \r\ninteractive visualization tools. These are used for research, and for \r\ncommunicating the geometry of the nonlinear interactions, to demonstrate \r\nhow the profound understanding of the fundamental mathematical \r\nstructures leads to effective means of controlling complex systems. This \r\nvisualization effort also provides a rich environment for undergraduate \r\nstudents to connect with advanced theoretical research. It may prove to be \r\nan effective means to expand the pipeline bringing new talents into \r\nmathematical research.\r\n",
