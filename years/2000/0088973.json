 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n    The principal investigator proposes to study three problems in\r\nthe area of partial differential equations, namely the nonlinear\r\ntwo-phase elliptic free boundary problem, symmetrization for diffusion\r\nequations with bounded measurable coefficients and symmetric behavior\r\nof solutions of nonlinear parabolic equations. These problems defy \r\nthe standard treatments which succeed in solving linear problems or\r\nequations in divergence form because of their nonlinear or non-divergent\r\nstructural nature. Therefore, solution of these problems will not\r\nonly contributes knowledge about these partial differential equations,\r\nbut also inspires new ideas which will most probably prove useful \r\nin studying other nonlinear partial differential equations or\r\nequations of other types. The suggested methods in this proposal \r\neither successfully solved part of the problems or are motivated by \r\nthe ideas that are most likely to lead to the solution of these problems.\r\n\r\n    The study of the theory of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial\r\ndifferential equations and diffusion processes becomes increasingly\r\nimportant in the area of partial differential equations. The problems\r\nstudied by the principal investigator in this project motivate ideas\r\nthat lead to the creation of some methods that might succeed in \r\ntreating other partial differential equation problems as well. Solving\r\nthese problems gives affirmative answer to the question of the well-\r\nposedness of these mathematical models which originate in physics and\r\nother disciplines. In addition, the theoretical treatment of these\r\nproblems will shed light on the numerical solution of these and related\r\nproblems. Taking into account the origins of these problems, one is\r\nliable to believe applications of the theory about these problems can\r\nbe sought in disciplines other than mathematics.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n",
