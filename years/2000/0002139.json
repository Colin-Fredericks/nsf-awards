Examples of this include recent advances in wireless communications, radio-frequency micro-machining and MEMS technology, low-cost antenna arrays and re-configurable apertures and low-power and high-frequency electronics.  It seems likely that future advances in these and similar fields will be fueled if scientists are exposed to relevant work in different disciplines where their own work may be applicable.  The funding received in response to this proposal will facilitate organization of special sessions at the 2000 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting that foster this interaction.  By working with carefully selected organizers for these special sessions, the Technical Program Committee will identify leading researchers in academia, government, and industry as potential keynote speakers and use the funds to cover expenses associated with bringing them to the conference.  By providing this opportunity for interaction, researchers and practitioners will be able to better understand new directions that their work may take in order to solve many of the important technological challenges that lie in interdisciplinary research.\r\n***\r\n",
