 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the development of low loading/watt CO-tolerant precious metal catalysts for application in fuel cells operating on hydrogen from reformed hydrocarbons.  Recent research indicates that Pt:Ru, Pt:Mo and even some ternary and quartenary Pt-containing systems can achieve the power output and CO tolerance required for next generation vehicle (NGV's).  However, most catalyst layer fabrication methods are far too expensive for mass-market applications. Furthermore, existing technologies cannot provide the short development duty cycle and amenability to combinatorial methods that optimization of a composite anode catalyst layer requires.  The Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) does provide such a technology and has been demonstrated to provide a low-cost solution for catalytic coatings onto both proton exchange membranes(PEM) and carbon electrodes.  CCVD's primary advantage is the ability to deposit high quality thin films in the open atmosphere in a production friendly manner.  The process uses simple, low-cost equipment and relatively inexpensive precursors.  Development of low loading/watt, high performance CO tolerant catalysts is necessary to reduce the cost of manufacturing and enable the large volume production of fuel cell membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs), a fuel cell stack component identified as critical to the successful development of NGV's.\r\n\r\nThe Government/automotive industry Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) has identified proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology to be extremely promising for electric vehicle applications. Adoption of PEMFC power technology for automotive drive trains will enable achievement of industry goals for better automotive fuel economy and reduced emission of air pollutants in comparison with conventional internal combustion engines. This goal will be realized only if costs of PEMFC technology can be reduced further to competitive levels. Achievement of these goals will increase air quality and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies. Successful technical results arising from the proposed program of R&D will have straightforward commercialization avenue from MCT to a variety of automotive manufacturers and fuel cell producers.\r\n\r\n",
