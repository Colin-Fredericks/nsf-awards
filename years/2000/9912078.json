The project is designed to highlight meaningful, salient and useful connections between inquiry-based science teaching and literacy instruction.  The project will develop, organize and share information from both the science and literacy communities on connections between and among hands-on activity, text-based information resources, student cognition and teacher practices.  The project will also provide science educators with resources they can use to increase attention to science at both the local and national level.  It will disseminate information about when, how and under what circumstances science and literacy connections should be fostered.  Activities will include a series of conferences that address the concerns of various stakeholders in both the science and language arts communities.  By promoting those inquiry strategies advocated by science educators that can improve children's reading, writing, speaking, listening and thinking skills, the role of science instruction at the elementary school level will be reinforced and enhanced.\r\n",
