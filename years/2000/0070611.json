 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is in the realm of Number Theory. More specifically, it is in\r\nthe area of automorphic forms and representation theory.\r\nThe most ambitious enterprise in automorphic forms is the\r\nLanglands program,\r\nand, especially, the issue of functorial lifting.\r\nLoosely speaking, it postulates the formation of automorphic forms on\r\na bigger group from those on a smaller group.\r\nThis bounds together some of the most outstanding open problems in Number\r\nTheory, such as the Artin's Conjecture\r\nand the Ramanujan Hypothesis.\r\nSo far, the advance in the Langlands program was accomplished along\r\nthree major themes which are inter-related: explicit constructions of\r\nautomorphic forms\r\n(e.g. using theta-kernels or Fourier coefficients of residues of\r\nEisenstein series), the theory of L-functions combined with\r\nconverse theorems, and the trace formula in its various guises.\r\nThe focus in this project is on the trace formula approach.\r\nAll trace formulas have their origin in expressing the kernel function\r\nin two different ways -- geometrically and spectrally.\r\nThe application to functoriality comes about\r\nwhen trace formulas of two different groups are compared.\r\nThe project deals with analytical aspects of the spectral expansion\r\nof a trace formula for {\\em symmetric spaces} (also called a\r\nrelative trace formula), inaugurated by Jacquet.\r\nThis is a major step in establishing functoriality in such instances\r\nas quadratic base change, and characterizing cusp forms having\r\na non-zero period integral over certain period subgroups.\r\nThe project has 3 parts and it is a collaboration with\r\nJonathan Rogawski from UCLA (first 2 parts), and\r\nSteve Rallis and Herve Jacquet (third part).\r\n\r\nThe project is a basic research in the realm of Number Theory.\r\nThe more specific area is called\r\nautomorphic forms and representation theory.\r\nThe most ambitious enterprise in this field is the\r\nLanglands program.\r\nIn a nutshell, the goal is to establish relationships between\r\nvarious objects which \"live\" on completely different worlds,\r\nand seemingly have little in common.\r\nSuch relations are extremely deep.\r\nA spectacular and relatively recent example is a correspondence between\r\nmodular forms and elliptic curves, which was\r\na keystone in Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.\r\nRoughly speaking, an elliptic curve is a \"doughnut\"\r\nwhich is described as the locus of two equations\r\nof degree 3 in 4 variables.\r\nA modular form on the other hand can be thought of,\r\nin the simplest cases, as\r\na sequence which is obtained by assigning to each integer\r\nthe sum of all its divisors (or powers of them).\r\nBeside their inherent significance in many branches of mathematics,\r\nmodular forms and their related objects have found applications\r\nin physics, cryptography and communication systems.",
