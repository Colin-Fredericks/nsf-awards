 "awd_abstract_narration": "9900767 - Mendell\r\n\r\nTwo of the most likely detectable sources of gravity waves are\r\noscillating neutron stars and black holes orbiting around each other In\r\norder to study these waves and learn more about their sources, gravity\r\nwave observatories are currently under construction around the world\r\nThis investigation will complete theoretical studies aimed at answering\r\nthe following important questions:\r\n1. How does superfluidity and superconductivity believe to exist in\r\nneutron stars affect the stability of these stars when they emit\r\ngravity waves?\r\n2. How does the emission of gravity waves affect the rotation rates of\r\nthese stars?\r\n3. How will the theory developed here compare with neutron star rotation\r\nrates as currently observed by radio telescopes?, and\r\n4. What will new methods to be developed in this investigation tell us\r\nabout the inspiral of black hole binaries?\r\n\r\nThis work is of current interest and significance for several reasons.\r\nGravity waves carry to us the best information that can be obtained\r\nabout the strong gravitational field predictions of Einstein's General\r\nTheory of Relativity. Their detection will provide insights into the\r\ntrue nature of neutron stars and black holes. For example gravity waves\r\nwill be able to give the best direct evidence for the existence of\r\nblack holes. They should also provide key clues to determining the true\r\nnature of the matter in neutron stars. This matter which is at several\r\ntimes nuclear density cannot be studied in terrestrial laboratories.\r\nOne exciting prospect is that gravity waves might provide further\r\nevidence that neutron stars really are superfluid and superconducting\r\ninside. This would make neutron stars the highest temperature\r\nsuperconductors in the universe However in order to extract the maximum\r\npossible information from the gravity waves it will be necessary to\r\ngreatly improve the current understanding of the sources. Thus it is\r\nimperative to the success of and the other gravity wave detectors that\r\nthe theory of the sources be worked out in detail. The investigation\r\ndescribed here will make major advances towards working out those\r\ndetails.",
