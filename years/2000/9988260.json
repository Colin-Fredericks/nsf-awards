In circuit complexity theory these resources are the size, depth, and other parameters of boolean circuit families that solve the problems.  The basic results are upper bounds (algorithms solving the problem while obeying certain resource constraints) and lower bounds (proofs that no such algorithm can do so).\r\n\r\nThis project takes a qualitative approach to circuit complexity.  The basic object is a complexity class, which is the set of problems that can be solved within certain resource constraints.  For most natural and robust choices of constraints, the resulting class has complete problems --- problems whose solution requires a fundamental algorithmic technique that suffices to solve all the problems in the class.  Upper and lower bounds for the complete problems then give us results about the classes. This project studies two specific computational problems: grid graph reachability and monotone planar circuit value. Given a graph embedded on a rectangular mesh, and two nodes, is there a path from one node to the other?  What is the value computed by a given circuit of AND and OR gates, where no wires cross, and a given input? In each case recent work of the PI and others have improved upper bounds for versions of the problem.  The goal here is to improve these algorithmic results and explore the various versions, relating them to each other and to standard problems.  \r\n\r\nThis exploration will be carried out in the context of prior work by the PI and others in qualitative complexity theory.  This work has identified a set of standard complexity classes that are robust across a variety of models, and developed a single framework characterizing these classes in term of the syntactic resources needed to express their problems in first-order logic.\r\n\r\nIn addition, further work will apply the logical framework to lower bound problems in low-level complexity.  The outstanding problem in this area, open for a decade, is to prove some natural problem to be outside of a circuit class such as $ACC^0$. Here two new approaches, developed in recent work of the PI and others, offer some hope: counting circuit classes and intermediate levels of uniformity.\r\n\r\n",
