 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research on the development of a hydride donor scale scale by Professor Mary Rakowski DuBois of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Colorado-Boulder and Dr. Daniel DuBois at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, Colorado. A series of both existing and newly-synthesized isoelectronic and isostructural transition metal hydridse diphosphine complexes will be employed to determine their hydride donor strength as measured by the heterolytic bond dissociation free energies. The acidities and homolytic bond dissociation free energies will also be determined as part of the thermodynamic cycles used to obtain this substrate and solvent-independent donor strength scale. After this scale is established, a number of compounds with a range of donor abilities will be reacted with organic substrates to examine the relationship between these donor values and hydride reactivity (\"donicity\"). This thermodynamic scale will be extended to obtain relative values for the transfer of the methyl cation, anion and radical.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop a quantitative scale for the ability of metal hydride compounds to transfer hydrogen to a substrate, and to relate these numbers to their reactivity. Catalytic hydogenation of organic compounds is of great industrial importance, and metal hydrides are often intermediates in these reactions. The results of this study will support the design of more efficient catalytic processes, and some of the metal hydrides prepared in this work may  themselves have value as reactant or catalytic materials. Students involved in the project will learn a breadth of skills in both synthesis and instrumental methods, and gain experience in an effort which links fundamental chemistry with industrial catalysis.",
