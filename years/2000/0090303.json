 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will link the U.S. research assessment community to world discussions of the\r\nproblems and prospects of new ways of viewing the management of research. The\r\nindicator systems that are currently in use for research programs around the world will\r\nnot yield much useful information in the end, because they are too closely tied to current\r\nmanagement information systems and therefore to input, process, and output measures.\r\nThe next generation of assessments must get a better handle on outcomes in order to meet\r\nthe demands of legislatures for broader public accountability. This project will bring\r\ntogether those who are beginning to develop a new generation of measures and\r\napproaches. The project will first work on identifying world resources in this area and\r\nmake that information available on a Web site. The centerpiece of the project is a three-day\r\nretreat, envisioned for spring 2001, that will involve the key crafters of new\r\napproaches to research assessment, from both the U.S. and other countries. Leading up to\r\nthe workshop, the project will re-establish network connections among researchers and\r\nagency assessment staff in the United States, through a series of network meetings in\r\nWashington. The main products will be a research agenda for the area; a U.S.-based\r\nnetwork, with international connections, bringing together academic researchers from\r\ndifferent fields with agency staff; and elements of training for a new generation of\r\nassessment professionals.\r\n",
