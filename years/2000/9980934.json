Applied undergraduate laboratories have often been designed with a curriculum that supports operational health physics. In this project, environmental physics experiments involving a portable gamma-ray spectroscopy system will be integrated into a senior-level laboratory and an environmental health physics course. Experiments designed to stimulate the interest of non-science majors in applied radiation protection and introduce the scientific method will be included in introductory science courses. The portable equipment will be also be used for teaching and demonstrations at a historically black college (FVSU) that has cooperative academic agreement with UNLV. Equipment involved in this project will be used to accommodate a growing number of undergraduate research projects in environmental radiation, which increasingly involve gamma-ray spectrometry of field samples. Over the next decade, many undergraduate physics programs will begin to revise curriculums to emphasize applied options. With this in mind, the experiments adapted, developed or improved under this program will be evaluated and the successes and difficulties reported to other science programs at national meetings and through literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
