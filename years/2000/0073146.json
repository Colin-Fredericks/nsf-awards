 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bats are critical for the pollination of hundreds of different plant\r\nspecies in environments from arid deserts to tropical rainforests.  Some New\r\nWorld bats exist entirely on nectar and pollen, while others visit flowers\r\nto supplement their regular diets of fruit or insects.  The shape of the\r\nskull is associated with the relative reliance on nectar in the diet.  This\r\nstudy investigates nectar-feeding ability (performance) among six species of\r\nbats that range from occasional flower visitors to nectar specialists.\r\nFeeding performance is measured by filming captive bats feeding at\r\nartificial flowers that differ in both shape and nectar availability.  These\r\nexperiments evaluate the impact of flower shape on feeding performance, the\r\nmaximum distance bats can extend the tongue, and how well bats can extract\r\nsmall amounts of nectar.  The feeding experiments are coupled with a\r\ndetailed analysis of skull and tongue structure to establish associations\r\nbetween anatomy and feeding performance.\r\n     This research contributes to our understanding of the biological and\r\nfunctional importance of anatomical diversity, and adds to the picture of\r\nhow these bats function within their ecosystems.  By constraining behavioral\r\ncapabilities, anatomical differences ultimately help sculpt ecological\r\npatterns of resource use and mediate the interactions between bats and\r\nflowers.  This combination of anatomical and behavioral data will provide\r\nnew insights into the diversity, evolution, and ecology of these important\r\npollinators.\r\n",
