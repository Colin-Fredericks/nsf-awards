 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leslie\r\n0075879\r\nThis grant is for partial support for a FASEB Summer Research Conference on Phospholipases.  The conference aims to review the current status of what is known about the structure, function and regulation of phospholipases A2, C and D.  These ubiquitous enzymes trigger major signal transduction pathways by producing lipid products that mediate diverse cellular responses.  Phospholipase A2 enzymes release arachidonic acid, which is the first step in the production of the eicosanoids and platelet activation factor, which are inflammatory mediators.  Phospholipase C enzymes mediate the production of polyphosphoinositols and diacylglycerols, which regulate calcium levels and protein kinase C.  Phospholipase D enzymes produce phosphatidic acid  from phosphatidylcholine and are implicated in regulating vesicle trafficking, mitogenesis, respiratory burst oxidase and other enzymes.  This conference will bring together enzymologists and molecular cell biologists to provide an opportunity for in depth scientific discussions.  It will also promote interactions between young investigators and senior scientists. \r\n",
