Gene Robinson of the University of Illinois, and Alison Mercer, University of Otago, New Zealand, will organize the workshop.  The workshop involves US researchers' participation in a forum for a multidisciplinary group of researchers from the US, Europe, and Asia to develop opportunities for future collaboration on emerging technologies in neuroscience and genomics, enhancing the value of the honey bee as a model for integrated studies of behavior, neurobiology, and genetics. The focus of the meeting will be on studies of behavior that demonstrate, at the molecular level, the influences of genes, the environment, and their interaction. The goal of these studies is to explain the function and evolution of behavioral mechanisms that integrate the activity of individuals in a society, neural and neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate behavior within the brain of the individual, and the genes that encode these brain mechanisms and thereby influence social behavior.\r\n",
