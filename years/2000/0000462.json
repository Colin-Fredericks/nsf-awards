The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Darwin R. Reyes with support for twenty-four months to work with Dr. Andreas Manz at Imperial College of Science in London, England.\r\nThis project is co-funded by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop a separation system capable of multiplex protein analysis - `proteomic array analysis' - to analyze the levels of proteins in samples of genomic complexity.  It will involve the use of microfabricated channels (pseudo-gels) on polymers or quartz substrates for electrophoretic separations of proteins, first by isoelectric focusing and then \r\nby sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis. Ultimately, the device will be employed to separate complex multiprotein biological samples.\r\n\r\nDr. Manz is one of the pioneers in microchip technology used for chemical applications.  He was involved in the development of high-speed analyzers based on capillary electrophoresis, liquid chromatography and flow injection analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
