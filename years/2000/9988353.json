This\r\nproject aims at investigating some fundamental algorithmic issues\r\nin several key areas of computational molecular biology,\r\nincluding multiple sequence alignment, the reconstruction of\r\nevolutionary trees, physical mapping, and DNA sequencing.\r\n\r\nMultiple sequence alignment is a standard model for comparing a set of\r\n(biomolecular) sequences simultaneously. Software tools for computing multiple\r\nsequence alignments are routinely used by biologists.\r\nThis project continues the study of a unique approach for multiple sequence alignment\r\nthat takes into account the evolutionary history of the input sequences.\r\nThe objectives include improved approximation methods to compute multiple\r\nsequence alignment and evolutionary tree simultaneously. \r\n\r\nEfficient and accurate inference of evolutionary trees has long been a\r\nchallenging topic for both biologists and computer scientists. \r\nThis project is especially focused on quartet-based evolutionary tree reconstruction\r\nmethods that attempt to extract topological information about quartets\r\n(i.e. sets of four) of input species and then recombine these quartet topologies\r\ninto a full evolutionary tree. Efficient approximation algorithms will be \r\ndevised that explicitly aim at minimizing the inconsistency between the output tree\r\nand the estimated quartet topologies. \r\n\r\nThe other objectives of the project include the study of efficient (approximation)\r\nalgorithms for some combinatorial problems that are motivated by physical mapping and\r\n(shotgun) DNA sequencing, which are two fundamental steps in the Human Genome Project. \r\nSome specific topics to be studied include the complexity of fragment identification\r\nin multiple complete digest mapping with bounded multiplicity and the approximation\r\nof (vairants of) shortest superstrings.\r\n\r\nAlthough this research is theoretical in nature, its results will \r\nlikely have applications (or implications) in the development of software tools\r\nfor multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic inference, and restriction mapping.\r\n",
