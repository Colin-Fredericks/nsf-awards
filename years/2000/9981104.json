 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Science (61)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing web-based teaching material for a one semester introductory course to the interdisciplinary field of Bioinformatics. This subject of study integrates mathematical and computational techniques with biological knowledge to extract, organize, and interpret information from a wealth of genetic sequence data obtained from various genome projects. Since Bioinformatics is a young discipline, very little organized teaching material, especially at the undergraduate level, is available. The product in this project is intended to fill this void and help students acquire quality training in an area of expertise which is currently in tremendous demand from the biomedical research community and biotechnology industries.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year the project is developing the Bioinformatics course material on the Internet. Activities include constructing a web module, consisting of lecture notes and problem sets with links to appropriate sources of information and software tools, to enable students learn through hands-on problem solving approach. The targeted audience is junior and senior level undergraduate majors in Mathematics and Biology.\r\n\r\nTo test its effectiveness, this material is being used for a problem-based Bioinformatics course to be offered in spring 2001 with the principal investigators as faculty facilitators. An evaluation committee consisting of highly qualified individuals from Mathematics, Biology, and Education is providing advice during the development of the course material, helping to obtain feedback from students, and assessing project performance. Incorporating these reviews, the Bioinformatics module is being finalized in the fall of 2001, ready for national distribution by commercial publication. This project is in line with the DUE themes of diversity, faculty development, as well as integration of technology in education.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
