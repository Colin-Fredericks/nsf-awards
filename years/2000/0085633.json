An existing CVD reactor will be modified and used to generate data for developing a detailed simulator for reactor design and operation.  The goals are to evaluate the actuation capabilities of this programmable reactor and establish its process simulation, optimization, sensing, and control requirements.  The research is expected to demonstrate proof of concept for an entirely new mode of CVD processing.\r\n\r\nSpecific tasks will include:\r\n(1) Proving a new concept for CVD reactor design that will demonstrate spatially controllable reactant delivery to the wafer:  This will enable across-wafer uniformity to be achieved at virtually any process design point desired for material performance or manufacturing throughput.  It will also allow intentional, programmed non-uniformity to reduce cost and time in process development.\r\n(2) Developing object-oriented simulation-based design, analysis, optimization, and process control tools for the programmable CVD reactor system.\r\n(3) Establishing a prototype for the next generation of CVD reactors for use in a materials development environment for conducting combinatorial CVD studies to rapidly evaluate new processes and materials.\r\n(4) Demonstrating a concept in semiconductor processing equipment design that can be extended to other important manufacturing processes, including plasma-enhanced CVD, reactive ion etching, and possibly liquid-phase processes such as wafer cleaning and plating.\r\n",
