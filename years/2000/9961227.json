 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine how certain critical steps in the synthesis of reactive nanoparticles (RNP) can be transformed from batchwise to a continuous process. This research is critically needed in order to develop a commercially viable process for manufacturing RNP materials for applications in both the civilian and military marketplaces.  RNP materials and related technologies hold great promise for meeting a number of critical and high-value needs.  Military applications include personnel protection, demilitarization, and decontamination.  Nantek's proprietary RNPs are capable of destroying both chemical and biological warfare agents. Applications include destroying chemical weapon stockpiles; developing topical skin protectants against chemical agents; and materials for decontaminating equipment and personnel.  Civilian uses include kits for counter-terrorism and safety response for the chemical industry.  RNPs are effective against a wide range of toxic compounds, including PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and dioxins, and can remove acid gases from industrial emissions.  With the number of important commercial applications growing, it is critical that the synthesis of these nanostructured materials be simplified into a commercially viable process. \r\n\r\nRNPs are truly a dual-use enabling technology capable of meeting a wide range of critical and high-value needs in both the military and civilian marketplaces. In the military area Nantek is developing RNPs to destroy chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents for (1) personnel protection, (2) demilitarization, and (3) decontamination. In the civilian marketplace, potential products include materials and devices for counter-terrorism, and emergency response kits for accidental spills and releases in the chemical and biochemical industries.\r\n",
