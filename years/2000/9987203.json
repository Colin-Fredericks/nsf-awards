The scholarships should allow the university to make notable impact on the overall success of our student to complete the degree. These need-based scholarships are comparable to the engineering college's more lucrative merit-based awards.\r\n\r\nAt the undergraduate level, we will target upper division junior and senior scholars, and those who transfer into our engineering and mathematics programs at this level. At the graduate level, the need-based awards will supplement assistantship offers made to outstanding students. This significant enhancement to our recruitment package will allow us to become more competitive in attracting the best and brightest U.S. citizens into our graduate program.\r\n\r\nOur major objective in this project is to reduce the time to degree completion of high-achieving engineering, computer science, and mathematics scholars. We will involve scholarship recipients in program activities that will help them to improve interpersonal skills, serve as mentors to other students, and reduce or remove the need to work off-campus during the academic year.\r\n",
