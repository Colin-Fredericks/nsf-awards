It is the first time\r\nthat surface faulting impacts urban and industrial areas to such an extent,\r\nand raises major concerns about our current practices in earthquake\r\nengineering. During the 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey, earthquake, there was also\r\nmajor damage due to liquefaction-induced lateral spreads and coastal\r\nsubsidences along the coasts of the Bay of Izmit and Lake Sapanca. The\r\nobjective of this proposed exploratory research is to measure ground\r\ndeformations caused by surface faulting and liquefaction during the 1999\r\nKocaeli and Duzce, Turkey earthquakes. This information, which will be\r\ndisseminated to researchers and practitioners via the Internet, will\r\ncontribute to improving models for liquefaction-induced lateral spreads and\r\nmitigation criteria for surface faulting effects. \r\n\r\nThe proposed exploratory research completes the work performed immediately\r\nafter the earthquakes by the earthquake reconnaissance teams and\r\nsubsequently by our research collaborators in Turkey. The discontinuous\r\ndislocations from surface faulting have already been mapped by geologists.\r\nHowever, the continuous fields of ground strain surrounding surface\r\nfaulting have not yet been measured. The aerial photographs taken prior and\r\nafter the earthquakes are yet to be interpreted to yield a large-scale\r\nunderstanding of ground deformation and failure mechanisms, especially in\r\nstepovers between two strike-slip strands (e.g., Golcuk). The same image\r\nprocessing techniques need also to be also applied for producing maps of\r\nliquefaction-induced ground deformations (e.g., Sapanca Lake). The\r\nprocessing and interpretation of aerial photographs will be instrumental in\r\nunderstanding the large-scale ground deformation and failure mechanisms\r\nobserved during the 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce, Turkey, earthquakes. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the proposed exploratory research are: (1) Compilation\r\nand organization of existing data on surface-faulting and\r\nliquefaction-induced ground deformation for the 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce,\r\nTurkey, earthquakes; (2) Processing of aerial photographs taken prior to\r\nand after the earthquakes for producing maps of permanent displacement\r\nvectors and settlements induced by surface faulting and liquefaction; (3)\r\nCollection of additional ground surveys, and data on geology and\r\ngeotechnical soil profiles (e.g., SPT and CPT soundings) in selected areas;\r\nand (4) Dissemination of information collected thorough a new GIS platform\r\n(Internet Map Server) on the Internet.\r\n\r\n",
