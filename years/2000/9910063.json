The researchers will be undertaking a study of the flatness metrology of large wafers with nanometer accuracy.  The continuous drive toward smaller features and larger wafer sizes is making the requirements on wafer flatness increasingly stringent.  This demand cannot be met by simply extending the currently existing technologies.  A paradigm shift is necessary and new concepts need to be developed.  This research is aimed at developing a completely new method, namely absolute flatness metrology, for next generation wafer and device manufacturing.  With this method, the flatness measurement results are free from errors caused by the scanning motion and method, the flatness measurement results are free from errors caused by the scanning motion and are thus expected to be significantly more accurate compared to those achievable by the traditional methods.        \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The successful use of this method will eventually eliminate the need for periodical calibration of the metrology system with a wafer master, which reduces system maintenance costs.  The impact of this research is not limited to the semiconductor industry.  The same technology can also be applied to the metrology of liquid crystal panels, advanced optical mirrors such as x-ray synchrotron mirrors, hard disk substrates, etc. to significantly improve their measurement accuracy.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research at technical meetings and on their web site (http://www.precision.eng.sunysb.edu).\r\n",
