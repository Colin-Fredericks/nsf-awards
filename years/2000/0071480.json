The main thesis of \r\nthe investigator is that the operation with respect to which the Floer homology\r\nbehaves most naturally is the branched covering. Therefore, the investigator \r\nstudies gauge theory on 3-manifolds with group actions and relates \r\ngauge-theoretical invariants to the classical invariants of the branch set. \r\nAs an example, his previous study of equivariant gauge theory on the links of \r\nquasi-homogeneous surface singularities has led to a closed form formula \r\nexpressing their Floer homology in terms of classical invariants. The \r\ninvestigator introduces and studies an equivariant Casson invariant for an \r\nintegral homology sphere with a cyclic group action and relates it to the \r\nclassical Casson invariant and the knot signatures. The definition makes use \r\nof the equivariant gauge theory and, in particular, of the equivariant Floer \r\nindex. The latter is closely related, in the case of anti-holomorphic \r\ninvolutions, to the topology of Stein surfaces and the non-compact Kaehler \r\ngeometry. The investigator also continues his study of the links of complete\r\nintersection singularities, and the relevance of the equivariant Casson \r\ninvariant to homology cobordisms and the triangulation conjecture for \r\ntopological manifolds in dimensions five and higher. \r\n\r\nThe research is a study of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds by the methods of \r\ngauge theory, coming from theoretical physics. In the last two decades, these \r\nmethods brought new life into the classical low dimensional topology, leading \r\nto many spectacular developments and to the solutions of many difficult \r\nproblems. The area was revolutionized to the point that the state of knowledge\r\nof two decades ago looks now, in many aspects, like a desert of nearly \r\ncomplete ignorance. Manifolds of dimension four were the ones that benefited \r\nthe most: gauge theory methods worked very efficiently in this setting. At \r\nthe same time, their analogue in dimension three, which is known as the Floer \r\nhomology, is yet to reveal its full potential. The Floer homology is in the \r\nfocus of investigator's research efforts.\r\n",
