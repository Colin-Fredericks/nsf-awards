There is a natural\r\nRiemannian metric on both classical and universal Teichmueller\r\nspaces, called the Weil-Petersson metric.  Although those spaces\r\nare not symmetric spaces, and there are no classical Lie groups\r\nacting on them isometrically (unlike the hyperbolic spaces with\r\nthe special linear group), one notes that on the classical\r\nTeichmueller spaces the mapping class group of the Riemann\r\nsurfaces acts isometrically, and that on the universal\r\nTeichmueller space the diffeomorphism group of the circle acts\r\nisometrically.  These group actions on Teichmueller spaces can be\r\nutilized to construct flat bundles over various manifolds with\r\nits fibers being copies of Teichmueller spaces, which leads to\r\nthe questions of strong/super rigidity.  It is in this context\r\nthat the investigator intends to use the Weil-Petersson geometry\r\nof Teichmueller spaces.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Riemann surfaces has been one of the central\r\nthemes of modern mathematics over the last two centuries.  In\r\nrecent years, it has received renewed attention due to the\r\ninterest created by the so-called super-string theory, with which\r\nphysicists hope to construct the grand unifying theory (GMT) of\r\ngraviation and quantum physics.  The Teichmueller space, which is\r\nthe subject of this investigation, plays an important role since\r\nit is known to parametrizes the \"shapes of the string.\"\r\nInteractions between mathematics and theoretical physics have\r\nproved to be fruitful for both sides, and it is the\r\ninvestigator's belief that the proposed research may offer some\r\nnew way of understanding the outstanding issues in the relevant\r\nscientific fields.",
