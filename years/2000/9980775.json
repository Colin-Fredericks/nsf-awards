 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Mechanical (56)\r\nThe goal of this project is the establishment of a visualization-based multimedia studio for the enhancement of teaching of the Dynamic Systems course sequence in a mechanical engineering program.  The  project adapts the \"seeing is believing\" concept from the Air Force Academy and the University of Colorado and the use of virtual laboratories and pre-lab demonstrations from the Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Vanderbilt University.   Also adapted are the use of hands-on demonstrations from the University of Alberta,  the \"learning through developing concept\" from the University of Pittsburgh,  and the \"learning through teaching\" concept from North Carolina A&T University.   Visual presentation has always been one of the most effective approaches to teach engineering fundamentals because 'seeing is believing'. This is especially true for the study of dynamic systems since many concepts are either difficult to observe due to fast motion or to comprehend because they are counterintuitive. Therefore, image-processing techniques to produce courseware to capture these dynamic processes in digital video format are being used. This allows the students to observe in slow motion these dynamic events and, consequently, develops a better understanding of the physical concepts. The project is developing three levels of courseware delivery: active examples, demonstrations and a full-scaled dynamics laboratory to provide students with a hands-on learning experience. In addition the 'learning through teaching' concept is implemented by requiring students to produce, with faculty guidance,  visualization projects and presenting to their fellow students. Not only is this motivating their active participation but also teaching them advanced image processing technology and Web-authoring skills. A set of multimedia courseware is being produced under this project, which is being made available to the entire teaching community through the Internet. The final assessment of the project is being presented at an ASEE education conference and published in an ASEE journal.\r\n",
