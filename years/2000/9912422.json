 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal-9912422\r\nPI:  David Shmoys\r\n\r\nMost combinatorial optimization problems that arise in applications from scheduling, logistics, and network design, for example, are NP-hard, and hence unlikely to have a polynomial-time algorithm that finds an optimal solution. This project is focused on the study of approximation algorithms for these problems, where the aim is to design effective algorithms that are guaranteed to produce near-optimal solutions, and typically produce solutions of extremely high quality.\r\nThis project aims to further develop the three major techniques that have emerged as consistently producing superior results: rounding techniques based on mathematical programming relaxations, primal-dual methods, and local search methods. Although there has been significant progress, there are many problems for which the current state of knowledge is not sufficient. This project is devoted to the investigation of several problems in this area.\r\nThe primary focus of this work is to investigate algorithms that produce solutions guaranteed to be nearly-optimal by relying on information contained in the optimal solution to a linear programming relaxation.  One consequence of such results would be to provide a theoretical justification for the strength of the bounds given by these linear programming relaxations.  By giving algorithms for which one can prove that the solution found has value relatively close to the LP bound, one also shows that relative error of the solution (compared to the integer optimum) is also small.  Furthermore, past experience has shown that the insight needed to devise algorithms with such performance guarantees can also lead to algorithms with superior empirical performance.\r\nThis work focuses on several specific areas to attempt to design approximation algorithms with good performance guarantees and good practical performance. \r\nFacility location, clustering problems, and scheduling problems arise in a number of application settings, including computational biology and project resource management, and this project considers a number of basic models, with the aim of developing algorithmic techniques that are not particularly application specific.\r\nFor several basic problems including the k-median problem, the uncapacitated facility location problem, the bin-packing problem, and the problem of scheduling jobs on parallel machines subject to precedence constraints, the aim of this work is to design algorithms with superior performance than was known previously.\r\nPolyhedral methods are the foremost techniques used to find optimal solutions to hard discrete optimization problems.  These methods require the solution of a series of linear programming relaxations. Heuristic methods that rely on linear programming can be easily integrated into this approach, with the aim of speeding up these methods, since they can take advantage of the work already done is solving these linear programs.  This work also studies the efficacy of such heuristics in enhancing the polyhedral methods to solving (to optimality) these problems.",
