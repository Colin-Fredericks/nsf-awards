 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nTraditionally, college developmental-level mathematics instruction focuses on reviewing computational algorithms in arithmetic and performing routine equation solving in algebra. The reform movement in K-12 mathematics has produced ample evidence indicating that such a skills based approach to instruction fails to provide students with opportunities to construct the knowledge and develop the disposition needed for conceptual understanding.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to develop reform-guided instructional materials and an instructor development program for college developmental-level mathematics courses. The activities to accomplish the project goals require investigating students' initial level of conceptual understanding of the targeted topics, developing instructional materials, incorporating appropriate technology, and preparing instructors who are able to facilitate an inquiry approach to instruction. These instructors include faculty, graduate assistants, and superior undergraduate interns.\r\n\r\nA key component of this project is the adaptation of instructional materials from two research-based projects developed for middle school mathematics: Mathematics in Context (MiC) and the Connected Mathematics Project (CMP). These materials promote an inquiry approach to mathematics instruction, which emphasizes explanation and justification. The end results of this project includes the creation of instructional materials for students, support materials for staff, and an instructor development model which will be appropriate for use at other colleges and universities that teach mathematics courses to developmental -level students.\r\n\r\nThe viability of this framework is currently being tested in a pilot program. At present, no systematic investigation has taken place to determine the appropriateness of the instructional materials development or the instructor development model. This project is providing further impetus and critical evaluation of the evolution of this program.\r\n\r\n",
