 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year of funding of a 4 year, continuing award. One of the major roadblocks in the\r\nefficient and accurate communication between humans and machines is the resolution of the\r\nambiguity inherent in natural languages. A major bottleneck in developing solutions is the severe\r\nshortage of training data that distinguishes word senses, and the high cost of inputting this\r\ninformation manually. A focus of this project is the development of unsupervised and minimally\r\nsupervised algorithms for acquiring such skills without costly hand-tagged training data. Such\r\nmethods will exploit the distribution properties observed in very large text corpora (over 10 billion\r\nwords); the PI will also investigate richer representations of feature space, class models,\r\nsmoothing methods and learning algorithms specialized for classification in very high-dimensional\r\nfeaturespaces. In addition to the problem of word-sense disambiguation, this project will explore\r\nshared solutions to a closely related set of lexical-ambiguity tasks including spelling correction,\r\npropername classification, capitalization restoration, accent and diacritic restoration for, diverse\r\nlanguages, vowel restoration in Hebrew and Arabic, speech synthesis on homographs, lexical\r\nchoice in machine translation, and certain aspects of choosing among phonetically confusable\r\ncandidates in speech recognition. These diverse problems are not normally recognized as being\r\nmembers of the same class, and this project seeks to exploit the synergies present by developing\r\nmethods and training data on one member of the class and utilizing the methods and data on other.\r\nproblems in the class. Thus this unified approach offers the potential for rapid parallel progress on\r\nkey problems in human-computer interaction and information extraction.\r\n",
