 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial competence is  a fundamental aspect of intelligence, \r\nimportant to successful functioning.  A high level of spatial skill \r\nis critical to the achievement of a technologically sophisticated \r\nwork force for the twenty-first century.  Spatial intelligence plays \r\na major role in effective education in mathematics, science and \r\nengineering.  The interdisciplinary research we will carry out \r\nfocuses on understanding of spatial intelligence and establishing \r\nmethods for maximizing the development of spatial skills.  We will \r\nstudy spatial competence at different levels of analysis.  At the \r\nbiological level, we will will investigate the neurological \r\nfoundations for spatial growth.  We will examine the growth and \r\norganization of neural connections in areas of the brain that \r\nunderlie the processing of spatial information. At the behavioral \r\nlevel, we will investigate the mechanisms that are involved in the \r\nmental representation of the spatial aspects of the world.  We also \r\nwill study the ways in which children come to understand spatial \r\nsymbols such as maps and models. We will study how acquisition of \r\nthese symbol systems affects the development of spatial intelligence. \r\nThis work will include computational modelling of spatial \r\nintelligence. Finally, at the level of educational application, we \r\nwill investigate the educational input responsible for the \r\ndifferential gains in spatial skill levels children achieve in \r\nschool.  We plan to identify specific teacher practices that are \r\nassociated with high gains in student achievement.  Our research team \r\nhas expertise in a variety of relevant fields, including neural \r\nscience, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology,computer \r\nscience, education, and statistics.  This research team has worked \r\ntogether for the past three years on research that has identified \r\ncore elements of spatial functioning.  Our goal now is to further our \r\nunderstanding of how the development of spatial competence can be \r\nenhanced .M\t\t",
