The instrument will generate classical mass spectra, be highly sensitive for the analysis of trace biologically active components from complex mixtures, be highly reliable for daily routine analyses, and would be designed for easy operation and maintenance. The instrument will be used on a daily basis for research programs of the 4 Co-PIs. The PI will supervise instrument usage and two chemist postdocs will provide daily operations and maintenance.\r\n\r\nResearch projects that will use the GC/MS include the following: characterization of unique desaturase genes from insect pheromone glands; isolation and identification of a naturally occurring fungicide in blueberry; the identification of key volatile compounds from host plants of various species of Rhagoletis flies, which have been the center of a controversial discussion on sympatric speciation; the generation a yeast expression system for commercial production of unsaturated acids; identification of root volatiles important in host finding by soil arthropods;  and for characterization of sex pheromone components in several coleopterous soil feeding pests. These projects will involve close coordination of behavioral studies and GC/MS analysis of minute quantities of biologically active materials in airborne-collected samples. The GC/MS will be an invaluable resource in the Department of Entomology for the above projects and will provide training and research opportunities for postdocs and graduate students.\r\n",
