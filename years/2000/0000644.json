 "awd_abstract_narration": "0000644  Gray  This is an award to support exploratory research on the ways in which metal oxide surfaces mediate the interactions between ionizing radiation and organic compounds particularly those with large oxidation-reduction potentials such as hexachlorobenzene.  Specific objectives are to determine how oxide surfaces affect reaction rates induced by ionizing radiation and to relate band energy of metal oxides to surface adsorption and rate of chemical transformations that are induced by ionizing radiation.  The investigator also plans on applying knowledge gained in the initial phases of this project to explore its application for decontamination of liquids and solid materials used in production processes for potential reuse in production and in determining the feasibility of radiation-induced metal oxide catalysis in accelerating radiolysis for decontamination of contaminated soils and solutions.  The proposal leading to this award was submitted to NSF under the Special Guidelines for an SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (NSF 00-2).  Results of this research are expected to provide the basis for further research on the potential for use of radiolysis in decontamination of contaminated soils and sediments.  ***",
