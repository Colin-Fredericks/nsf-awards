 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) This project develops courses in operating and distributed systems as part of revision to the systems curriculum at Worcester Polytechnic. The project adapts NSF supported work at several institutions and develops a laboratory and software modeled after the projects on which the adaptation is based.  This includes the development of a laboratory of machines running the Linux operating system along with projects to use these machines. The working name for this laboratory is the Free/Open Source Laboratory, or Fossil Lab for short.\r\n\r\nThe development of the Fossil Lab is improving the systems courses because students have the opportunity to work with the internals of an operating system in a secure environment, providing experience that would be impossible in a general-purpose computing environment with a commercial operating system. A principal theme in developing the course projects is a \"performance supplement\" to examine performance issues of different system designs and implementations. There is a real need expressed by industrial contacts for students to have such experience while at the same time little related work was found at other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Fossil Lab is being used by students enrolled in the newly revised Operating Systems and Distributed Computing Systems courses, each offered twice per year, and by students choosing to use its facilities for their senior projects. It is estimated that, over 200 students each year are making use of this lab. This work is not only having a strong positive effect on its students, but serves as a cost-effective model that can be replicated at other institutions.\r\n\r\n",
