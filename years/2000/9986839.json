Bonde\r\nUniversity of Minnesota\r\nA GPS-linked Model Helicopter System for Stream Imaging\r\n\r\nEcologists need a remote sensing device to map data at resolutions intermediate between on-the-ground measurements and satellite measurements.  Previous techniques to provide this data have focused on photography from cameras affixed to tall ladders, long poles, and balloons.  Unfortunately, these methods cannot be used for making maps because they only cover a single spot on the ground.  Ground mapping with surveying instruments is a frustrating and time consuming process that limits experimental replication.\r\n\r\n\tTo solve the mapping problem for stream imaging, a Model Helicopter Stream Imaging System (MHSIS) will be developed.  The system will use a remote control model helicopter, capable of carrying a 10 pound payload and flying at very low elevations.  A gondola attached to the helicopter will contain a small computer, a 2-way radio, a GPS, an aerial survey laser, and an infrared digital camera.  The digital camera will photograph the ecosystem, the laser will measure helicopter height above the ground, the GPS will measure the exact location of the helicopter, the 2-way radio will transmit commands and data, and the computer will control operations and record data.  Back on the ground, the information collected will be converted into an ecosystem map.\r\n\r\n\tThe MHSIS will be tested in wetlands and desert streams, in conjunction with two research projects funded by the NSF Division of Environmental Biology. The project will support an Undergraduate Research Assistant from the Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Duluth, an undergraduate institution.  Because of the Natural Resources Research Institute's applied mission, our GIS Laboratory is often toured by visitors from area secondary schools, and county, state, and federal government land use agencies; this project will be highlighted during those tours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n",
