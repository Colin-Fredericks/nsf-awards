 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estrogenic endocrine disrupters are chemicals in the environment that are either naturally occurring, such as plant estrogens in foods (e.g., soybeans) ,or residues in the environment from pesticide use.  These chemicals have been blamed for reproductive abnormalities in wildlife.  On the other hand, plant estrogens (e.g., genistein) are recommended as a nutritional supplement for increased health and relief from menopausal symptoms.  Because development of the brain is very sensitive to disruption, research in this area is vitally important to understand the potential consequences.  The symposium will focus on research concerning exposure to estrogenic compounds and the resulting effects on brain anatomy and behavior in developing and adult animals.  The participants are scientists with research programs that examine exposure to such compounds.  The goal of the symposium is to promote collaboration and exchange of information between endocrinologists or those who study hormonal systems and toxicologists or those who study the effects of toxic exposures to chemical.\r\n\r\n\tThis particular symposium is significant because while many recent meetings have focused on endocrine disrupters, none has devoted itself to the developing organism's brain and behavior.  A \"meeting of the minds\" will bring together scientists from many disciplines to exchange ideas and views.\t \r\n",
