 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the acquisition of a new generation flow cytometer with high-speed cell \r\nSorting to replace the 17 year old Coulter EPICS V cell sorting instrument at Bigelow Laboratory's\r\nJ.J. MacIsaac Facility for Flow and Imaging Cytometry.  This shared-use instrument will be available to aquatic science researchers for a wide range of research applications, and for training undergraduate students, and researchers in aquatic sciences.  In addition to improved reliability, the upgraded instrument will provide several major advantages over the present one including: 1) increased sensitivity for detection of submicrometer particles, 2) the ability to sort larger particles(30-60 M), dual-laser excitation capability, and 4) improved computer hardware and software for easier instrument setup, control, and data analysis  capabilities.  Acquisition of this instrument is an integral part of Bigelow Laboratory's scientific plan to build upon our capabilities in microbiology, phycology, single-cell analysis and species-based ecological approaches to questions in biological oceanography.  The MacIsaac Facility is a unique center for advanced research, development and training in automated methods for studying particles in naturals waters.  In the past 6 years the Facility has served over 25 investigators from 20 different institutions in the U.S. and internationally.  It is a center for innovation, having spawned several new research and development directions, including the recent invention of an imaging-in-flow instrument for microplankton (20-200 gm) analysis.  As part of the shared-use MacIsaac Facility the new instrument wil enhance several areas of new research opportunities for researchers in acquit sciences.  These include the development of new single-cell fluorescence methods for studying bacteria, phytoplankton and microzooplankton physiology, the physiology of harmful algae species, ecological studies of plankton populations, the application of \"phylogenetic stains\" for aquatic plankton, the chemical and optical properties of aquatic particles, and the molecular genetics of subpopulations.  The new generation flow cytometer with high speed sorting will significantly enhance the continued education and training activities in this technology.  Bigelow Laboratory courses and workshops attract graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from around the world.  A modem instrument for education and training is essential for maintaining this leadership role.  The instrument wil be integrated into the J. J. MacIsaac Facility, which has actively served the international acquatic science  \r\n",
