The co-organizers are Professors Robert Sinclair at Stanford University and Professor Hiroyasu Saka at Nagoya University in Japan.  The majority of in situ TEM (transmission electron microscopy) is carried out in the U.S. and in Japan.  The former has strengths in materials science applications (e.g. thin film deposition, semiconductor defect behavior, and catalysis), whereas the latter has a wider variety of hardware (e.g. higher voltage microscopes, higher temperature specimen holder, and piezo-electric devices).  Currently there is very little basis for the exchange of ideas, experiments or personnel. This seminar will include presentations of the most recent developments in the field.  In addition, the strengths of the two countries' approaches will be highlighted.  A significant portion of time will then be allocated to developing the field in the future and assuming definitive collaborations.\r\n\r\nMany high technology materials these days are made from the atomic level up (e.g. microelectronic, computer hard disks, nanomaterials).  Understanding and improving their performance requires examination at extremely high levels of magnification and resolution, which is provided by transmission electron microscopy.  This method is being applied in an increasing number of ways and in a more innovative fashion.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Dissemination plans for the seminar proceedings include publication in the \"Journal of Electron Microscopy.\"  A summary of the symposium should also be available in \"Materials Research Society Bulletin,\" and \"Microscopy Society of America Bulletin.\"\r\n",
