 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves localization type effects for ergodic Schrodinger\r\noperators, the general study of spectra and wave functions of\r\nmultidimensional Schrodinger operators, and also of the transport\r\nphenomena of quasiperiodic operators and two-dimensional magnetic\r\noperators in the integer quantum Hall regime. An important objective is to\r\ndevelop nonperturbative methods of proving localization type effects for\r\nSchrodinger operators with deterministic potentials. The other goal is to\r\nstudy the relation between spectral and quantum-dynamical properties and\r\nbehavior of the generalized eigenfunctions, particularly outside the\r\nlocalization range and in the multidimensional case. Another goal of the\r\nproposed research is to study singular continuous spectrum that exhibits\r\ncritical behavior and/or anomalous transport, particularly for models where\r\nit appears for critical values (or intervals) of the parameters.\r\n\r\n The proposed research is centered around the fundamental properties\r\nof disordered systems that serve as models of systems with impurities.\r\nDeterministic, particularly quasiperiodic, potentials are most often used\r\nto model quasicrystals.  In order to be able to understand much of the\r\nexperimental data on quasicrystals, it is particularly important to\r\ninvestigate the transport coefficients like the electrical and heat\r\nconductivities of the microscopic models. Such an understanding is most\r\nhelpful for finding new materials with desired physical properties. This\r\nmay lead to various industrial applications (the first one nowadays being\r\nthe covering of pans replacing the conventional Tefal film).  Disordered\r\nsystems are also used in modeling many other micro and macro effects: from\r\nquantum localization to earthquakes. Our research concerns the anomalous\r\nspectral and diffusive properties of quasiperiodic and other deterministic\r\nstructures. The quantum Hall effect is since 1985 used by the National\r\nBureau of Standards to define the Fine Structure Constant (and hence the\r\nelectrical charge of an electron). It is still not well understood why the\r\nexperiment can be reproduced with a relative error of only $10^{-8}$. Our\r\nresearch is concerned with a microscopic theory of the quantum Hall effect\r\nthat is aimed at getting deeper insights of this phenomena.\r\n",
