However, existing architecture-based\r\napproaches have typically modeled systems as \"one of a kind;\" additionally,\r\nthey have failed to ensure consistent transfer of architectural properties\r\nto a system's implementation.  Realizing the full potential of software\r\narchitectures requires a more realistic approach, in which systems are\r\nmodeled and implemented as members of an application family.  This project\r\nfocuses on the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation of\r\ntechniques for supporting architecture-based development of software\r\napplication families.  Three general issues are studied: (1) notations for\r\nmodeling application family architectures; (2) mechanisms for refining\r\nfamily architectures into their implementations; and (3) nature of software\r\nconnectors--services facilitating component interactions--and their role in\r\ncontrolling non-functional properties (e.g., performance, security) across\r\napplications in a family.  This research will augment the current\r\nmodel-centric focus on architectures with a system-centric perspective and\r\nprovide principled support for heterogeneity and reuse, two cornerstones of\r\ndeveloping application families.  The research will also serve as a vehicle\r\nfor modernizing the software engineering curriculum, by exposing students to\r\nthe impact of architecture-based and application family-based development on\r\nfundamental software engineering principles\r\n",
