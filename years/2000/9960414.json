 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims to develop flexible, magnetic polymer composite coatings and free-standing forms having induced magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy using thermal spray technology.  There exists a need for a cost-effective method for efficiently making anisotropic magnetic structures less than 1mm in thickness as well as complex, geometric shapes, which cannot be achieved by an extrusion process.  Furthermore, there is a need to deposit flexible magnetic coatings onto a surface without the use of adhesives for sensor applications.  Poly Therm proposes to develop magnetic polymer powders using a mechanofusion process.  The powders will be injected through a combustion flame whereby the binder melts and the composite impacts a substrate to produce coatings or a release surface to produce free-standing forms.  The magnetic phase will also be dispersed in solution and injected externally into the flame during deposition for maximum magnetic phase content.  A magnetic field will orient the magnetic particles during deposition to create oriented magnetic structures.  The development of flexible magnetic thin films and complex 3D structures will open new markets for flexible magnets.  Coatings will be used for magnetic sensors and proprietary fasteners.  Automotive components, aerospace components, electromechanical devices, motors, actuators, magnetic fasteners, and magnetic recording devices will benefit from the development of such magnetic materials.\r\n\r\n",
