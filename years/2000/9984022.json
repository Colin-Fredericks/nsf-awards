 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nCTS-9984022\r\nRutgers University\r\n\r\nThe overall of his research proposal is to provide a basis to design engineer partially miscible polymer interfaces by obtaining meaningful relationships between molecular information information (interdiffusion mechanisms) and macroscopic properties (fracture mechanisms).  Such knowledge will lead to rigorous and objective design of polymer interfaces.  The adhesion of polymeric surfaces is technologically relevant in applications such as welding, melt processing, composite lamination, compatibilizer and blend technology, co-extrusion, and cracking healing among others.\r\n\r\nThe system chosen is polystyrene/brominated polystyrene (PS/PBS), a partially miscible blend, which lends itself to be conveniently investigated for both interdiffusion and fracture measurements over a wide range of identical physicochemical conditions.  The first phase of the research seeks to elucidate the mechanism of interdiffussion by quantitative understanding of the dynamics of macromolecular chains at interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe second component of the research will be directed towards relating the molecular information obtained from interfacial dynamics studies to the strength of the interface.  The fracture energy of PS/PBS specimens will be measured using a modified double cantilever beam test interfaced with a tele-miscroscope and an electronic speckle pattern interferometer.  The knowledge derived from this research will be pivotal to the rational design and control of polymer interfaces relevant to high performance materials, such as bioadhesives, electronic materials, and high performance nanocomposites. \r\n",
