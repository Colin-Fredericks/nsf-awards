 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Glenn Crosby of Washington State University is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program, and by the Office of Interdisciplinary Programs, of the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Division for a program of research dealing with the preparation of iridium(I) complexes, and investigation of their electronic excited states. This research will involve students and faculty members of community colleges located in (mainly rural) eastern Washington as coworkers. \r\n\r\nThis research program will carry out the synthesis of a carefully designed series of  complexes of iridium, and  study the luminescence and related  properties of these materials. One objective of the research will be to understand, on a fundamental level, how the internal electronic structure, and the photophysical behavior, of these complexes resembles and differs from the corresponding characteristics of related platinum complexes. A second main objective of the project will be to increase the number of students at community colleges in eastern Washington who continue their education in science beyond the community college level. Many such students are Hispanics or Native Americans. Community college students and faculty members will carry out parts of this research during summers. Recruitment of outstanding community college students and faculty to participate in this program will be aided by a network of teachers in eastern Washington who have previous connections with the Principal Investigator and are familiar with his research.",
