 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a prototype information infrastructure that integrates high quality, focused, and well-maintained collections with an intelligent, interactive, and community-based user interface to assist teachers in developing powerful science and mathematics instruction for the secondary classroom. The collaboration of one of the nation's largest university-based teacher preparation programs with the leadership of the Merit Network is specifically addressing the needs and developmental perspectives of pre-service teachers in their preparation of instructional strategies and use of standards-based materials. Project activities include the collection of materials for understanding and implementing science and mathematics curriculum at grades 6-12 by locating and, where necessary, archiving exemplar materials, with a particular focus on the needs of pre-service teachers. In addition, the PI and team are addressing interoperability among existing information resources, including online clearinghouses and traditional library catalog collections. Finally, the project is establishing a user community to build, share, and review resources that promote engaged learning in the context of state and national curriculum standards. Significant co-funding of this project is being provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences in particular recognition of the important K-12 teacher preparation and professional development aspects of this work.",
