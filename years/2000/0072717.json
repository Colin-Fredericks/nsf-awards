 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal studies optimal structured materials. These problems  \r\nrequire non-standard methods of calculus of variations that are  \r\ndeveloped.  The first project deals with materials or structures  \r\nwith inner instabilities. Under ballistic impact, these materials  \r\ndissipate and radiate the energy in an abnormal high rate; the  \r\neffect can be used in various protective devices.\r\nThe second project aims to find the optimal structures for  \r\nmulti-component composites. This problem is not solved even \r\nfor the simplest cases;  the optimal structures  are significantly \r\ndifferent from optimal  two-material structures.\r\nThe third project deals with specific problem of ``inverse  \r\noptimization\". It aims on understanding of optimality of natural  \r\nstructures, as trunks of trees or human bones. Here we want to  \r\ndetermine the goal functional of the structural optimization from  \r\nthe known structure and external conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three chapters of the proposal treat novel problem in theoretical \r\nmaterial science that require development of new mathematical methods. \r\nAll problems originate in science and engineering.\r\nThe first projects is concerned with new structures with a very high ability to \r\nresist shocks. Such materials can be used in various protective devices or  \r\ncontainers.  The second project addresses optimal structures of   \r\ncomposites that are made of three or more components. The study of such \r\nstructures is demanded by many engineering applications because the  \r\nmajority of natural or artificial composites are made of more than  \r\ntwo materials. The last project aims to develop mathematical  \r\nmethods for evaluating the optimality of biological structures.  \r\nThe goal here is to understand in what sense biology is optimizing its \r\nstructures and to use biological \"solutions\" to evolutionary challenge \r\nin engineering applications.  \r\n",
