Second, the\r\nsubject is important because it provides tractable models which can be exploited\r\nto gain insight into the phenomenon of intermittency.  Because the approximations\r\nwhich underlie the applications of wave turbulence theory are generally not valid uniformly in wave number, there are windows of intermittency at both high and low wave number values.  At these scales, the system is fully nonlinear and exhibits intermittent bursts of activity associated with coherent but almost singular structures.  Our aim is to build a comprehensive theory which combines and connects wave turbulence with the random occurrence of coherent events.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the long-time statistical behavior of complex solutions to nonlinear field equations arising in a broad family of physical systems.  Applications of the research include modeling of: wind-driven ocean waves, weather, laser beams in transparent materials, sound waves, solar wind and stellar atmospheres, and motion of charges in semiconductor lasers.  All these systems exhibit turbulent behavior with common features, and the project develops the theory of this common structure.  The goal is to gain understanding of the behavior of this family of physical systems as well as to study the general statistical behavior of nonlinear systems in which large fluctuations",
