SAFOD is part of the Earthscope Phase 1 Initiative that is included in the MRE Request in NSF's FY 2001 Budget now before Congress\r\n  \r\nSAFOD involves drilling a 4 km deep hole penetrating the San Andreas Fault.  Such an undertaking involves considerable advance planning, obtaining permits, leasing land, etc.  The project involves about 100 scientists from the U.S and abroad and will be conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Department of Energy (DoE) and foreign institutions.  The specific items for which funding is being requested from NSF are:\r\n\r\n1) $10,000 to extend the lease option on the SAFOD site for another year.  The USGS paid the lease option last year, so it is appropriate that NSF pay the lease option in FY 2001.\r\n\r\n2) $20,000 for the NSF share of the EA and associated drilling permits.  This represents half the total; the USGS will pay the other half.\r\n***\r\n",
