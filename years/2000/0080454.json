 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the next 25 years, the majority of homes will be computer networked. The availability of networked homes is expected to facilitate integrated home control of heating, cooling and lighting. The element of the integrated home control system that enables significant savings in energy consumption is the adaptive shade. With adaptive shading, energy bills in housing with integrated controls can fall by 25% or more, the quality of interior light can improve, and related household conveniences can emerge.  \r\n\r\nA basic understanding of the principles underlying the effective use of adaptive shading in housing is needed for the full impact of the energy savings to be felt. On this basis, this proposal focuses on developing a basic understanding of the principles underlying the effective use of adaptive shading for future housing. The four objectives of the study are \r\n\r\n(1) to gain an understanding of the home designs that accommodate adaptive shading \r\n(2) to gain an understanding of the methods by which energy consumption is reduced with adaptive shading\r\n(3) to develop integrated control algorithms for housing and\r\n(4) to foster commercialization of low-cost adaptive shading technology.\r\n",
