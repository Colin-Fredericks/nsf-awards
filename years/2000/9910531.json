S. Chun, Chungham National University, Korea.   The proposed research aims to develop high-strength and wear-resistant nanocomposite Al-base alloys by rapid solidification processing.  Al-Si alloys have been traditionally used in the industries for wear resistance purposes because the high volume fraction of the Si phase imparts good wear resistance of the Si phase, and this can be achieved by rapid solidification processing (RSP) techniques.  \r\n\r\nThis project will be performed in conjunction with Professor Chun's group at Chungham National University, Korea under the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program.   Excellent facilities exist for rapid solidification at the Chungnam National University in Taejon, Korea where rapid solidification processing (RSP) of Al-Si-base alloys will be conducted on a variety of Al-Si-based alloys containing transition metals like Fe, Cr, Zr, and Ni.  Aluminum alloys containing essentially Si and transition metals will be subjected to RSP and their microstructural and mechanical properties will be evaluated.  Attempts will also be made to test these alloys in an industrial environment.\r\n\r\nThis project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\r\n",
