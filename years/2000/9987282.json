 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California Community College Transfer Scholarship Consortium is a statewide effort to develop better prepared transfer students from under-represented and disadvantaged background seeking entry into university level engineering, computer science and math based majors. The NSF scholarships possess the common thread to draw together four statewide academically based support environments serving 90% of the states under-represented technical students. The joining of MESA Engineering Program (MEP), California Community College Program (CCCP), California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) and Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) provides a diverse pool of transfer-ready students who are extremely competent and well prepared to major in math, engineering and science based fields. The resources give community college transfer students the opportunity to demonstrate full-time commitment towards university transition and continuous academic enrollment. \r\n\r\nThe statewide collaboration currently serves over 14,500 students pursuing engineering and science degrees in California institutions of higher learning. All of the participating students come from disadvantaged backgrounds and represent segments of our society which are historically underrepresented in the technical field. Approximately 90 percent of these transfers will remain in the math-based majors. CCCTC provides a rigorous program of academic excellence and academic support for educationally disadvantaged students, especially those from groups historically underrepresented in math-based fields. \r\n",
