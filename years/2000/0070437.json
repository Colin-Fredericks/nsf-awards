 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nThis proposal is concerned with research on singular integrals, the theory of\r\nweights, with applications to linear elliptic partial differential \r\nequations of second and of higher order. There are three main areas of\r\ncurrent focus. First, we study the elliptic measure associated to\r\na second order elliptic operator - both divergence and nondivergence \r\nform. Second, we are studying the boundary values of solutions to\r\ncertain higher order elliptic operators in non-smooth domains. The third\r\npart of this proposal concerns the maximal functions and singular\r\nintegrals associated to certain product domains - such operators involve\r\nnonisotropic dilations and results require a study of the geometry of\r\nfamilies of rectangles arising from this dilation structure.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this century, revolutionary ideas in analysis were\r\nbeing forged on two fronts: the theory of singular integrals in \r\nharmonic analysis (the Calderon-Zygmund school of analysis) and the\r\ntheory of elliptic equations (Di Giorgi, J. Nash). Each of these\r\nsubjects has provided fascinating applications - the first in such\r\nareas as applied harmonic analysis/wavelets/Fourier analysis, and the\r\nsecond in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, of\r\ntremendous value in applications. But at the beginning of these studies, and\r\nfor a period of twenty or so years, the development of each of these\r\nsubjects proceeded independently, and with little interaction. However,\r\nsince the early 1980's, the connections between these areas have\r\nbeen increasingly exploited and understood, to the great benefit of\r\nthe fields of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.\r\nThis proposer's research is in this field of harmonic analysis, with\r\nan emphasis on its connection to and inspiration from partial \r\ndifferential equations.\r\n\r\n",
