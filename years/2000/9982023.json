 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research under this CAREER award is to develop a robust methodology to predict dynamic damage evolution in the interfaces of laminated composites of dissimilar inhomogeneous orthotropic materials.  The approach is to integrate the synergistic effects of contact zone and intralayer kinking in an interfacial damage predictive model for inhomogeneous bimaterials.  In particular, the objectives are to: 1) investigate the parameters of contact zone formation, 2) study the effect of contact zones in the kinking of delaminations, 3) assess the connection (if any) and the effect of damage accumulation in (1) and (2), and 4) to predict deviation, propagation, or arrest of delaminations based on the findings from (1) and (3).  The results are expected to lead to a significantly improved quantitative assessment of the energy release rate and fracture toughness of a damaged composite structure and to better design methods to avoid specific modes of damage.\r\n\r\nThe educational plan has three specific goals: 1) to increase the involvement of women in engineering, 2) to increase awareness of opportunities in science and engineering of high-school students (Technical Youth Program), and 3) to modernize the mechanical engineering laboratory and course curriculum.  In an effort to increase the gender diversity, the PI will collaborate with Douglass College of Women in initiating high school outreach programs.  During these programs students will have the opportunity to visit the Rutgers University School of Engineering for hands on demonstrations, small group sessions with female scientists and engineers, and interaction with female guest visitors from industry.  In the curriculum development plan, the learning process is promoted via visualization of concepts and hands-on practice.  A unified educational/research approach will be utilized in order to infiltrate the knowledge and expertise gained from the conducted research to the classroom. \r\n",
