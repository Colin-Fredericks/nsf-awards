Forty-four scholarships for full tuition and books are being awarded to low-income, academically talented students with special efforts to recruit women, disabled, and ethnic minority students. To increase retention and program completion, an infused system of supports and experiences spans the recipients' time in the program. Each scholarship recipient receives mentoring and tutoring, participates on a number of field trips to industry sites, attends presentations by industry leaders, and completes an integrated capstone project of applied learning. Mentoring is provided by the highly-qualified and industry-standard faculty at Chemeketa and tutoring by certified tutors. On site visits Silicon Forest Scholars hear presentations from each of the Silicon Forest industry partners, including Intel Corporation, Cisco Systems Incorporated, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, and ISM Group. The State of Oregon is presenting informational sessions for the recipients. During the integrated capstone project at the end of the scholarship term, recipients complete an academically demanding applied learning project from their individual fields of study. These provide opportunities for hands-on, experiential learning that will prepare students for work in the high-tech industry. The program expects to retain 90% of SFS recipients each year of the project and to graduate 85% of SFS recipients in their fields of study. Furthermore, the program provides assistance with a goal of ensuring that 95% of SFS graduates are employed in their field of study or transfer to a four-year college or university to continue their field of study. In addition to striving for these graduation and successful transfer goals, the SFS program is enhancing networks between Chemeketa Community College, local, national, and international industry, and four-year schools; strengthening partnerships between institutions of higher education and related employment sectors; and increasing its focus on the needs of industry and on cross-disciplinary studies that enhance student learning and worksite readiness.\r\n",
