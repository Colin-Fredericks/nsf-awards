 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will investigate the spinning performance of melt spun fibers containing microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs).  MicroPCMs have been successfully incorporated into solution-spun acrylic fibers, significantly increasing their thermal energy storage capability.  However, of the billions of pounds of non-cellulosic fibers produced worldwide, melt-spun fiber production far exceeds the amount produced of acrylics.  With demand for acrylics expected to continue to decline over the long term, the opportunity for technological innovation in synthetic fibers clearly lies with melt-spun fibers.  The overall objective of Phase I is to acquire a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the spinning process, the polymer matrix containing microPCM, and the resulting product.  To achieve this the limits of spinnability of microPCM filled polyester and/or polypropylene will be determined.  This includes determining the maximum concentration of microPCMs for spinning continuity at 2000 m/min. and higher.  Anticipated benefits to the nation include (1) the commercial potential of melt-spun fibers and resulting fabrics with enhanced thermal energy storage capabilities, and (2) an enhancement to national security offered by the use of this technology to extend the endurance and survivability of members of the military services who operate in extreme environments.\r\n\r\nCommercial potential\r\nThe commercial potential of melt-spun fibers and fabrics with enhanced thermal energy storage capabilities is enormous for the apparel (e.g., socks, gloves, jackets) and industrial insulation markets, where hot or cold thermal control is required.\r\n\r\nKey words\r\nPhase change material, microPCM, melt-spun fiber, fiber spinning",
