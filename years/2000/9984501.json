 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will focus on three partly related\r\ndirections in multiresolution methods: (I) subdivision schemes\r\nand wavelets in the geometric setting, (II) the advantage of redundant\r\nsystems and  (III) ideal data representation in higher dimensions.\r\n\r\nSubdivision and multiresolution methods in the geometric setting\r\nis a recently launched research area.\r\nPrompted by the extremely high interests in applications such as terrain\r\nmodeling and 3-D scanning technology, this research direction has attracted\r\nthe attention of both computer scientists and applied mathematicians.\r\nExisting subdivision schemes for surface generation do not promise\r\nwell-defined curvature everywhere in a resulted surface. In various\r\napplications it is desirable to work with curvature smooth surfaces.\r\nIn the regular setting the proposer recently constructed a family of\r\nC^2 subdivision schemes with a small interpolating stencil.\r\nUnderlying this construction is a variety of tools from optimization,\r\nwavelet theory and multivairate interpolation theory. This project will\r\nfurther refine these tools in order to resolve the original open problem\r\nand such that these tools can be applied to other settings as well.\r\n\r\nFor various applications in image reconstruction/processing, it\r\nwas found that highly redundant wavelet-like image representations\r\nsignificantly outperform the standard non-redundant orthogonal\r\nwavelet transforms used ubiquitously in the image coding\r\ncommunity. On the one hand, there is currently no complete theory\r\nfor explaining the fundamental advantages of redundancy. On the\r\nother hand, researchers have just started to realize the\r\nfundamental limits of wavelet transforms in higher dimensions and\r\nhave proposed a wide variety of novel data representation schemes\r\nthat address these fundamental limits. Research activity\r\nunder this project seeks to develop mathematical theory and\r\ncomputational tools in the general area of adaptive methods of\r\nrepresenting and analyzing images and other multidimensional data.\r\n\r\nThe educational plan proposes a new way of teaching\r\ncomputational science. The project\r\nwill develop teaching materials for our numerical computing courses\r\nthat better suit the needs, interests and mathematical ability\r\nof computer science students. The goal of\r\nthis project is to develop a set of\r\nelectronic lecture notes for our future senior numerical computing\r\ncourse. These lecture notes will add two new dimensions to any of\r\nthe existing textbooks: (i) An interactive computational\r\nenvironment (based on QPE's such as Matlab or Octave)\r\nwill be integrated into the notes so that a student can easily reproduce\r\nany computational result presented and derive any new\r\ncomputational experiments. (ii) Applications\r\nareas such as computer graphics, computer vision, data-mining and\r\ncomputational fluid dynamics will be\r\nused in various places of\r\nthis notes to illustrate the role of numerical methods in industry.",
