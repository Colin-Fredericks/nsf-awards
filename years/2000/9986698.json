 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is continuing support for the work of Dr. Kenneth Fountain in the Division of Science/Chemistry at Truman State University in Kirksville, MO.   The purpose of the work, using a combination of laboratory experimentation and theoretical calculations, is to explore and understand the alpha-effect, in which a nucleophile (a molecule with a reactive pair of electrons) can be much more reactive if there is an additional pair of electrons on a neighboring atom.   The work attempts to answer some  important questions in physical organic chemistry, and provides excellent training for the undergraduate students who do the work.   Dr. Fountain has infectious enthusiasm, and has been unusually successful in attracting students, getting them involved in the excitement of research, and encouraging them to go on to careers in chemistry.\r\n\r\nDr. Fountain proposes to develop quantitative expressions for the alpha-effect as functions of the groups being transferred, the nucleophiles involved, and the leaving groups.   He will also explore solvent effects, which can be quite important.   The results of linear free energy studies will be correlated with independent determinations of secondary deuterium isotope effects.   Students will be involved in synthesis, kinetics, electrochemistry, and ab initio computations, and encouraged to publish their results both in papers in the chemical literature and talks at national meetings of the American Chemical Society.",
