 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project evolves around the goal of improving the applicability of general relativity (the Einstein equations and the equations of motion) to astrophysical issues, from gravitational lensing to gravitational radiation.  Both these fields are currently emerging as new astrophysical tools for the study of the structure and evolution of the universe.  Regarding the former, the project would focus on the theoretical aspects of gravitational lensing from a rigorously relativistic perspective. Specifically, the proposer would concentrate on the lens equation and on the distortion of images by strong gravitational fields, topics normally treated by means of approximation techniques.\r\n\r\nWith respect to gravitational radiation, the project would focus on the theoretical aspects involved in the prediction of gravitational waveforms via numerical simulations.  Specifically, the project looks at the evolution of the Einstein equations in normal time and in retarded time, with the aim of finding configurations of equations, gauge, initial data and boundary conditions well suited for numerical evolution.  The project, in part, would concentrate on scenarios with well defined Newtonian limits as the speed of light approaches infinity.\r\n",
