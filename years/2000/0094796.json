 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop explores opportunities and directions for increased interaction between the geospatial and mainstream information technology (IT) research and development communities. Its goal is to illuminate directions for future research that would enhance the accessibility and usability of geospatial information and explore how geospatial applications can influence IT design and research. Topics include research and development areas and associated development/implementation issues, including trends in the enabling information technology, the nature and roles of the potential information contributors (information providers and validators), system builders, and users. The workshop report will synthesize the ideas and viewpoints expressed at the workshop, supplemented as necessary by additional material developed by the committee, including findings and recommendations on opportunities for collaboration between the geospatial and information technology disciplines as well as other research, development, and implementation issues, and may make suggestions for appropriate follow-on activities that would examine these issues in more depth. The report will be widely disseminated and available on-line.\r\nhttp://www.cstb.org\r\n",
