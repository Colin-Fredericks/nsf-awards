 "awd_abstract_narration": "9985625   Keoleian   Automobiles are among society's most resource intensive products.  They have significant environmental impacts throughout their entire life cycle, including material production, manufacturing, use, service and end-of-life management stages.  In the United States, approximately ten million vehicles are retired each year due to poor reliability of parts and components, degraded performance, and loss of structural integrity from corrosion or accidents.  While retirement decisions are most often guided by economic considerations, the optimal vehicle service life also poses a complex resource and environmental management problem for both manufacturers and consumers.  For example, there is an environmental cost-benefit tradeoff between investing in a new, more energy-efficient, lower polluting automobile versus continuing to operate an older, less-efficient, more polluting vehicle.  Further complexities arise from differences in environmental burdens between older and newer vehicles during their production and during their use.  This research will integrate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and vehicle replacement optimization and lead to novel developments in each field.  The state of the art in LCA will be advanced through the treatment of dynamic systems.  Thus, the boundaries for analysis will encompass a sequence of products where the design variable becomes the optimal service life of each vehicle.  Previous work in dynamic vehicle replacement modeling has focused on cost optimization but has not yet considered life cycle environmental and energy criteria.  A life cycle dynamic replacement model will be developed through the application of dynamic programming methods to LCA.  The results are expected to have direct relevance to other product systems, such as computers and appliances.  This work will be accomplished by an interdisciplinary team of experts from the School of Natural Resources and Environment, Industrial and Operations Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Physics Department specializing in life cycle assessment and design, optimization theory, reliability theory and vehicle emissions and fuel economy modeling.  It will provide unique interdisciplinary education and training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. This grant is made pursuant to the NSF/EPA Partnership competition Technologies for a Sustainable Environment. ***",
