 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Project will be directed toward assessing the performance of a new a front-end-of-line (FEOL) photoresist stripping process for electronic device manufacturing.  A Sulfuric acid and oxidant mixture (SOM) continues to be used for stripping photoresist from semiconductor wafers.  Recently, several groups of researchers have investigated the use of ozone dissolved in DI water (DIO) for photoresist stripping.  The use of ozone dissolved in water in lieu of SOM offers a number of advantages including:  1) decreased chemical disposal cost, 2) decreased rinse DI water consumption, 3) increased user safety, 4) decreased chemical cost.\r\nPhifer Smith Corporation has developed a new process which has achieved an etch rate that is two to four times faster than the fastest DIO process.  We have defined four goals for phase I:  1) modify our existing wet processing test apparatus, 2) measure the etch rate for positive and negative I-line and DUV photoresist,\r\n3) measure the etch rate for positive I-line and positive DUV photoresist ion implanted at dose levels of 1E13, 1E14, and 1E15, 4) develop a preliminary design for a (FEOL) wafer cleaning process for evaluation in phase II.\r\nThis process can be applied to high-speed photoresist stripping and post ash residue removal.  It may also find application in post-etch residue removal for front-end-of-line semiconductor manufacturing processes.  Finally, it may also find application in other industries as a residue free, environmentally benign, cleaning process.\r\n",
