 "awd_abstract_narration": "MASTER IT is a collaboratively-planned program targeted at rural young women in the state of Kansas who have completed grades 7 and 8.  Each year 48 young women, 24 rising eighth and 24 rising ninth graders, are selected to participate in MASTER IT.  The objectives of this program are to:   1) make rural young women aware of applications of science and mathematics used in everyday functions, as well as in a variety of work places; 2) provide them with professional female role models in careers that are nontraditional to females; 3) strengthen their self esteem and confidence in doing mathematics and science; 4) show them the importance of continuing to take advanced mathematics and science classes in high school; and 5) set up a support network among peers and professionals.\r\n     These efforts have been collaboratively designed by Emporia State University faculty and representatives from private and public institutions that serve Kansas residents.  MASTER IT is a year-long program that consists of a one-week summer residential program followed by four Saturday activities throughout the school year.  Activities during the summer component and at the Saturday meetings include hands-on investigations of mathematical and scientific concepts led by university women faculty and women professionals in industry, career discussions, field trips to corporate partners, and assertiveness and self esteem training.  Furthermore, a listserv is used to maintain ongoing dialogue among the project staff, women professionals in industry, and the young women participants.\r\n     An anticipated outcome of the project is the increased participation of young rural women in advanced science and mathematics high school courses.  As a result of increased mathematical and scientific knowledge, the networking with successful professional women, and an increase in self-confidence, a second projected outcome is that these young women will seek careers that are traditionally held by males, such as engineering, computer science, and physics.\r\n     Not only does MASTER IT provide a resource to keep young women in the mathematics and science pipeline, it provides other comprehensive universities or community organizations in rural settings, where corporate partners may not be in their immediate vicinity, with a framework to develop programs for young women.\r\n",
