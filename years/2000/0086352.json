 "awd_abstract_narration": "0086352\r\nUetz\r\nIn April 1999, a class 5 tornado struck north of Cincinnati, Ohio. This storm destroyed approximately one half of the 65 acre Benedict/Hazelwood Botanical Preserve. This event provides an opportunity for a number of studies on ecosystem recovery following a catastrophic natural disturbance. The blow-down area has been managed minimally and most of the area has been left relatively undisturbed for studies of forest recovery. This SGER study is directed at the first post-disturbance generation of several animal species (invertebrates and vertebrates; primary and secondary consumers) that have been subjected to environmental stress fro a major ecosystem catastrophe during their development. This study concerns the question of whether environmental stress from habitat destruction will have an impact on developmental instability. The investigators will use a frequently-cited indicator of environmental stress - measures of fluctuating asymmetry, or FA (small, random deviations from perfect left-right symmetry in bilaterally symmetrical animals) - as a means of determining impact of disturbance on animal populations. Recent studies with forest-dwelling animal populations have demonstrated that FA is increased in populatoins undergoing interruptions in food, or in areas where vegetation is removed by logging. This is the first study of FA associated with environmental stress from a major natural catastrophe. This SGER research represents a unique opportunity to increase our knowledge about the response of animal populations to a rare but severe natural disturbance.\r\n",
