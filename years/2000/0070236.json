 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMagneto-electronic devices, which exploit the spin-dependent transport in ferromagnetic materials, have a tremendous technological potential as sensors or memory elements. \r\nThe performance of such devices is determined by structure, chemistry and magnetic properties of the interfaces. Growth of these materials should thus be controlled at the atomic scale, in order to reliably obtain structurally and magnetically well-defined interfaces. Current processes often fail to satisfy these requirements. Electrochemical methods are potentially able to control and monitor nucleation, growth and film modification at very small film thickness. Furthermore, the growth is highly selective, allowing formation of patterned structures and localized conditioning/etching.\r\nFirst, we will develop electrochemical techniques for the synthesis of defined ferromagnet/insulator and ferromagnet/semiconductor interfaces. Tunneling barriers of magnetic tunnel junctions will be synthesized through anodization of aluminum films. Direct electrodeposition onto semiconductors for the formation of ferromagnet/semiconductor interfaces is expected to yield sharper interfaces.\r\nSuccessively, electrochemical self-organization will be employed to synthesize arrays of nanometer-scale tunnel junctions. Fabrication of self-aligned patterned magnetic films on semiconductors will allow studies of spin-dependent transport in ferromagnet/semiconductor devices. \r\nThe advanced training of the graduate students will provide them with the skills required for competitiveness on the job market, and companies with highly skilled workforce.\r\n",
