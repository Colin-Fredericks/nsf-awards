Berger, the\r\nundecidability of certain questions regarding tilings and aperiodic\r\ntilings have been studied.  But as we extend our horizons and consider\r\ntilings in more general contexts than the Euclidean Plane, we see that\r\nmany foundational questions are still open.  In any particular,\r\nreasonably well-defined setting (e.g., \"tilings in the hyperbolic\r\nplane by polygonal tiles, moved about by orientation-preserving\r\nisometries\"), there are several intertwined questions that may be\r\nasked: 1) Is there a general method to determine whether a given set\r\nof prototiles admits a tiling that includes a specified configuration?\r\n(Is the \"Completion Problem\" decidable?; 2) Is there a general method\r\nto determine whether a given set of prototiles can tile the space at\r\nall?  (Is the \"Domino Problem\" decidable?)  3) Is there a \"weakly\r\naperiodic\" protoset? (Such a protoset admits no tiling with a compact\r\nfundamental domain.); 4) Is there a \"strongly aperiodic\" protoset?\r\n(Such a protoset admits no tiling that is invariant under an\r\ninfinite-cyclic symmetry); 5) Is there a computable bound on the\r\nHeesch number of protosets?; Is there a computable bound on the\r\nisohedral number of protosets?; 7) Is the period problem decidable?\r\nWe consider conjectures concerning some of these questions in two\r\nsettings that have been thought about for 20 years: protosets in the\r\nhyperbolic plane and monotiles in the Euclidean plane; and we sketch a\r\nnumber of proposed approaches to these problems.  We feel these\r\ntechniques should generalize and shed light on many foundation al\r\nissues in discrete geometry.\r\n\r\nWe hope the project will be significant in several ways.  First, these\r\nproblems, which have largely been seen as isolated from each other,\r\ncan all be seen as tightly connected.  It is anticipated that\r\ntechniques will arise that will shed light on several aspects of this\r\nproblem.  But moreover, the techniques under consideration may link\r\nthese questions in several topics in low-dimensional geometric\r\ntopology and combinatorial algebra.  Finally, questions of\r\ndecidability and tractability are one of the central concerns of\r\ntheoretical computer science; form one point of view, we are simply\r\nexploring a particular example, but hope that the techniques we\r\ndevelop will be of more general use.\r\n",
