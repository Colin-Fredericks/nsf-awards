 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThree-dimensional model simulations will be performed of storms during STERAO-A (Stratosphere-Troposphere Experiments: Radiation, Aerosols, and Ozone, 1996). The objectives of this field project were to examine trace gas transport, lightning production of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and photochemistry in convective storms. Events from the EULINOX (European Lightning NOx) project will also be simulated.  \r\n\tThe Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model will be modified to allow nonuniform initial conditions and consideration of terrain. A 3-D cloud-scale chemical transport model will be constructed, to be driven by data fields generated by the 3-D cloud model. The CTM will include an advection scheme, a photochemistry solver and mechanism, a cloud-perturbed photolysis scheme, a lightning NOx parameterization algorithm, and a wet scavenging scheme. The characteristics of the observed cloud dynamics and microphysics will be replicated as closely as possible using the 3-D GCE model. Simulations will be conducted of the convective redistribution of trace gases within the thunderstorms. For lightning NOx, the approach observed flash rates and locations in the model will be used. The goal of the lightning analysis will be to better determine the amounts of NO produced per flash. \r\n\tThis project is a collaboration with Kenneth Pickering, University of Maryland, College Park, ATM-9912336.\r\n\r\n",
