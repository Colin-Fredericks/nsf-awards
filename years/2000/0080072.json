 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities provides support for the Symposium on Bioinformatics held at the ACS National Meeting in San Francisco March 26-31, 2000.  The symposium is organized by Dr. Robert Kennedy of the University of Florida for the American Chemical Society.  Bioinformatics refers to the use of computer searching and modeling to maximize utility of database information.  It is particularly relevant to the analytical chemistry community where large volumes of data are being generated on protein sequences, signal transduction networks and genomic sequences.  This is a significant, emerging area of scientific endeavor.  The success of Bioinformatics will help integrate multiple disciplines including analytical chemistry, biology, biochemistry, biotechnology and computing.  The explosive growth in high throughput analytical measurements has resulted in correspondingly large data bases of information.  It is imperative that effective means of making correlations and identifications with this data are developed.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the symposium is to bring together scientists to promote an understanding of this emerging field, to promote collaborations and chart future directions.  The symposium speakers include members from academia, the biotechnology industry, the chemical industry and manufacturers.",
