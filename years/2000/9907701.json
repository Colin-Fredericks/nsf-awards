 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the development of a facility for marine research and education for \r\nStudying the role of suspended matter in mediating interactions within and between the pelagic\r\nAnd benthic environments.  The University of Connecticut has committed $31 million to the\r\nConstruction of a new marine sciences research and education building located at the Avery Point\r\nCampus, Groton, CT, and with this NSF support, the PIs  will acquire instrumentation that will allow state-of-art analysis of suspended matter, which includes the kinematics of particles (both living and non-living). The laboratory has been designed to support projects which encourage cross-fertilization of ideas among faculty, visiting scientists and students in differing disciplines.  The equipment needs of this facility include particle velocimetry instrumentation, with digital image acquisition components for use with existing upright and inverted fluorescence microscopes, laser-based particle counters/sizer, spectrofluorometer, scanning spoectrophotometer, DOC analyzer, HPLC with UV-VIS and fluorescence detectors as well as related support items (e.g., balances, drying ovens, muffle furnance).  The facility will enhance collaborations between members of the Department of Marine Sciences and scientists in the southern New England region.  Interactions with researchers outside of the Department constitute a critical component of the facility.  In addition, the proposed facility will serve as a vehicle for experiential opportunities for undergraduate students within the Department's new Coastal Studies program and nearby college programs.  Courses will be enhanced by the use of instrumentation not only in demonstrations, but also in supervised, hands-on laboratory excercises.  Finally, the laboratory will serve as a training center for",
