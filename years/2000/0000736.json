The program will recruit postdoctoral to mid-career scientists and engineers. Up to three Fellows for NSF will be selected. Fellows will learn how NSF funds science, while providing scientific, engineering and educational input on issues relating to NSF's mission support fundamental science and engineering research and education. Individuals will be selected in a widely announced, highly competitive process, for one-year fellowships. The fellowships potentially are renewable for a second year.\r\n\r\nAAAS/NSF Fellows will be placed in offices throughout NSF, working on projects of mutual interest to the Fellows and the host directorate or office. Fellows will work with staff involved in planning, development and oversight of agency programs in all fields of fundamental research.\r\n\r\nAssignments may involve significant interagency, congressional or international activity, as well as involvement with the National Science Board, NSF's policy-setting body. The program includes an orientation on executive branch and  congressional operations, as well as a yearlong seminar program on issues involving science, technology and public policy.\r\n\r\n",
