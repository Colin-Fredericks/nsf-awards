 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pellissippi State Technical Community College is providing support for eighty (80) talented, low-income students to pursue degrees in compute  science, engineering technology, and mathematics. Scholars are recruited by face-to-face contact with counselors, teachers, and principals in feeder high schools and with PSTCC faculty, counselors, and enrolled students.  Scholars are selected based on application process, eligibility criteria, and SMM team recommendations to the Selection Committee: PI, Chairperson; Directors of the Foundation, Grants Office,  Admissions, Community Relations; and the Business/Industry Mentoring Coordinator. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to increase the numbers of students pursuing targeted degrees, to increase awareness among students of career opportunities in these fields, and to increase the skilled worker pool for these disciplines to meet local workforce needs.\r\n\r\n The outcomes of the project include: \r\n\r\n$  Improved education in targeted disciplines demonstrated by scholars grade point averages.\r\n$  Increased retention for scholars to complete degrees in targeted disciplines. \r\n$  Improved professional development of scholars demonstrated by skills achieved for entry-level job placement and retention and/or  successful transfer and retention at 4-yea institutions. \r\n$  Strengthened partnerships between education and business and industry through the mentoring support component with scholars. \r\n\r\nScholars are expected to participate in the infrastructure of support which will include PSTCC support services; project designed workshops; professional mentoring partnership; work- related programs like tech prep, school-to-work, and cooperative education programs; and academic achievement in targeted disciplines/majors. \r\n\r\nBy providing an enriched learning environment, professional mentoring support, and career awareness with professional development assistance scholars are guided to stay in school and achieve critically needed skills needed by the local workforce. \r\n\r\n",
