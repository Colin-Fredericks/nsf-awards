 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational Modelling of Multi-Unit/Multi-Level Organizations\r\n\r\nOne of the most important organizational forms in modern economies is the multi-unit\r\norganization. In manufacturing, the typical plant is part of a multi-plant manufacturer. In\r\nservices, the typical store is part of a retail chain. A defining problem of a multi-unit\r\norganization is how to balance giving units the freedom to handle the idiosyncratic\r\nfeatures of their environments while, at the same time, coordinating the units to take\r\nadvantage of the commonality among them. How do multi-unit organizations solve this problem\r\nand what is the most effective means of doing so? What is the relevant set of instruments\r\nand what are the relevant features of the environment determining the best organization and\r\nstrategy? This project explores these questions and more broadly advances our understanding\r\nof multi-unit organizations.\r\n\r\nOur focus is on retail chains. The central idea underlying our approach is that much of the\r\nbehavior and performance of a retail chain can be explained by understanding how chains\r\ngenerate, communicate, and use information. How new ideas arise and how they are evaluated\r\nand adopted. How the authority to use information is distributed within the chain and how\r\nincentives are structured to influence the creation and effective dissemination of\r\ninformation. And how competition and technology interact with these information processes.\r\n\r\nImplementation of this approach involves the development of a computational model of a\r\nretail chain in which corporate headquarters (HQ) and stores are adapting to their\r\nenvironments. HQ and store managers develop new ideas, evaluate their ideas and the ideas\r\nof others, and then decide whether to adopt and communicate them to other members of the\r\norganization. Competing chains are simultaneously engaging in an analogous exercise while\r\nconsumers experience and experiment among stores to find the one that best suits their\r\nneeds. Our analysis explores how various factors influence the rate of improvement of store\r\npractices and chain efficiency. These factors include organizational structure (in\r\nparticular, the authority of store managers to change practices), store manager incentives\r\n(as influenced by how they are compensated), the degree of competition within and across\r\ngeographic markets (and, relatedly, the effect of mergers), the amount of consumer search,\r\nthe rate of change in consumers' preferences, the degree of informational spillovers across\r\nchains, and advances in information technology.\r\n",
