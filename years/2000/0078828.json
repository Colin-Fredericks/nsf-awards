 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award to Prof. Jay S. Siegel of the University of California, San Diego, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of annual Workshops in Physical Organic Chemistry, which have taken place since 1981.   The workshops in this three-year cycle will be chaired in turn by Dr. Siegel, Dr. Barbara Imperiali of M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass., and by Dr. Jeffrey Moore at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champagne.   The purpose of the workshops is to bring together leaders in the field and young faculty early in their careers, to discuss their latest ideas and results in research and education in an informal setting, with lots of opportunities for interaction and discussion.   The meetings are intentionally kept small (ca. 20 participants), and blocks of unstructured time made available to maximize interactions.   Attendees are selected by the Chairs to represent a spectrum of research interests, and  sizes, types and locations of institutions, and to include both women and underrepresented minorities.   In order to give as many people as possible the opportunity to participate, no one is invited more than once or twice in any 10 year period.\r\n\r\nSubdisciplines represented at the workshop include organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis, photochemistry and the chemistry of reactive intermediates, synthesis, bioorganic chemistry, and theoretical organic chemistry.",
