Lian\r\n\r\nThis project addresses problems in three closely related areas in\r\nthe context of mirror symmetry and duality. As a continuation of\r\ncurrent joint work with K. Liu and S.T. Yau, Lian proposes to\r\nboth generalize and specialize their theory (\"mirror principle\")\r\nfor studying characteristic classes of vector bundles on a stable\r\nmap moduli space. First, this work has thus far considered convex\r\nprojective manifolds.  Dropping the convexity assumption is\r\nimportant if one wishes to consider general Calabi-Yau\r\nmanifolds. Part I of this proposal outlines an approach which is\r\nexpected to lead to the full generalization of mirror principle\r\nin in genus zero. The main new input here is a way to combine the\r\ndifficult machinery of virtual cycles and the many ingredients of\r\nthe mirror principle. Second, the mirror principle can be\r\nspecialized to surfaces and many new questions which have\r\nrecently arisen in local mirror symmetry, as well as enumerative\r\ngeometry on surfaces.  In the former case partition functions of\r\na given genus are related to modular forms whenever the\r\nunderlying surface is elliptic. In the latter case, enumerating\r\ncurves of a given genus with suitable incidence in a surface also\r\nyields modular forms. This project seeks to understand modularity\r\nfrom the point of view of characteristic classes of vector\r\nbundles on stable map moduli spaces. For positive genus, the\r\nmirror principle requires yet another generalization.  In Part II\r\nof this project, Hosono, Lian, Liu and Yau will examine these new\r\nquestions. In recent joint work of Hosono, Lian and Yau, they\r\nhave settled the problem of constructing the ubiquitous large\r\nradius limit for the \"universal\" family of Calabi-Yau\r\nhypersurfaces in a toric manifold. In Part III Lian, Todorov and\r\nYau will study this limit for more general families.\r\n\r\nString physics is an ambitious effort to unify all the\r\nfundamental forces of nature. A remarkable prediction of String\r\nTheory is that nature apparently allows for many different\r\nversions of spacetimes.  A major current problem in string\r\nphysics is to understand how a plethora of apparently different\r\nspacetimes are related, often in an unexpected and remarkable\r\nways, under the rubric of ``String Duality''. Mirror symmetry is\r\na special yet nontrivial case of String Duality. Though they come\r\nin vast variety, the spacetimes in questions are still highly\r\nrestricted.  They turn out to be a class of geometrical objects,\r\nknown as Calabi-Yau manifolds, which have been studied by\r\nmathematicians for over 100 years.  Physicists have discovered\r\nthat string theories associated to certain pairs of Calabi-Yau\r\nmanifolds (\"mirror pairs\") are equivalent.  This project aims at\r\nunderstanding the geometry of these mirror manifolds from the\r\nmathematical point of view.  A constant exchange of insights and\r\nfeedback between physicists and mathematicians on mirror symmetry\r\nand other issues has been a hallmark of String Theory in its last\r\n20 years of development.\r\n",
