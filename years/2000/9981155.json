 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) Assessment drives learning. But teachers cannot assess effectively unless they can access and implement proven techniques. In 1998-1999, a team of science faculty and education researchers worked together at the National Institute for Science Education (NISE) and created the Field-tested Learning Assessment Guide, or the FLAG. This Web-based resource is aimed at \"jump starting\" the implementation of alternative classroom assessments. The target audience is teachers in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) courses at all types of post-secondary institutions. Efforts to disseminate information about FLAG are especially focused on reaching those who are eager to improve their courses and incorporate assessment of student learning outcomes in that process. An easy-to-use classroom assessment resource coupled with nationwide distribution will empower current and future SMET faculty to catalyze change on a national level.\r\n\r\nThis project aims at three key goals. One is the national dissemination of the FLAG. The project plans to capitalize on natural outlets in SMET professional societies, national education organizations, workshop developers, and faculty development organizations. The ongoing network of alliances between the NISE and such organizations provides a foundation from which to build these relationships. The second objective is a major expansion of the FLAG. The current FLAG contains an excellent set of classroom assessment techniques (CATs) but only a limited set of tools. The project is in the process of acquiring an extensive population of field-tested tools from a diverse set of SMET disciplines. The FLAG team is also working to upgrade the FLAG resource to a highly interactive environment so as to incorporate users in this process. The third goal is to provide a permanent, funded home for the FLAG and its development team at the University of New Mexico, with an ongoing collaboration with the NISE.",
