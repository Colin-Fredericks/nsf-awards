 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  Population increase, industrialization, and urbanization are growing threats to environmental quality and human health. It is more important now than ever to provide opportunities for undergraduates to understand the processes that lead to environmental degradation and how these problems can be avoided or mitigated. The goal of this project is to increase inquiry-based learning of environmental science at the national level. This project is a plan for the development of a library of \"virtual courseware\"-- interactive, web-based software that engages students in active learning of important environmental concepts. The virtual courseware is being designed and implemented by the principal investigators in collaboration with the Center for Distributed Learning.  Six virtual courseware applications are being developed.  Each \"virtual application\" is Web-based and easily accessible. Each application is also appropriate for introductory environmental science courses and reinforces scientific methodology.  It is interactive, intuitive, and inquiry-based, and is vertically scalable so that it can be used by college biology majors, general education non-majors, and high school students, (modular and self-contained).  Project evaluation is being conducted by the Center for Usability in Design and Assessment.  Because of the web-based nature of the project, dissemination is widespread.  The products of this project are making environmental science education more accessible, promote learning and environmental awareness, and provide the possibility for reducing the costs of education.  \r\n\r\n",
