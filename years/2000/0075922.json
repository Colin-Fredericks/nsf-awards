 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Engineering Foundation Conference is to provide an international, cross-disciplinary forum for discussion and presentation of the latest results in the area of heat transfer and transport phenomena occurring at very small time or length scales. This conference will provide an opportunity to share the knowledge in the areas of microscale thermophysics and transport which are key to a variety of rapidly emerging areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology and microelectromechanical system (MEMS) development. The conference will provide the forum for an exchange of ideas, results, and industrial needs in the area of thermal phenomena associated with microstructures and microsystems.  This 5 day conference will be held in Banff, Canada in mid October 2000. Papers presented in this conference will be accepted based on abstract reviews. A call for papers for the conference has been disseminated throughout the world, soliciting abstracts of papers to be considered for presentation at the conference. All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings, which will be published for wide dissemination.",
