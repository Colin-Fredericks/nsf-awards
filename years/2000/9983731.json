 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER grant goes to young member of the faculty at the Ohio State University. The PI will integrate theoretical research in the properties of strongly correlated materials with innovative education activities at all levels.  He is planning to develop a new course on recent developments in condensed matter physics.  There are also plans to consider an interactive web site as a bulletin board for current problems to facilitate information exchange between students and more experienced researchers.  In research, he plans to study in detail two classes of materials, the doped Lanthanum Manganates also known as the CMR (colossal magnetoresistance) compounds and Strontium Ruthenates, a compound which is a superconductor with several unusual characteristics.  There are reasons to believe that the electron pairing state in the latter compound is with a finite angular momentum.  The PI, in a collaboration involving both theory and experiments, plans to search for a definitive answer to the various puzzles.\r\n%%%\r\nThis CAREER grant to a young faculty member at the Ohio State University is awarded to support cutting-edge frontier research and innovation in education at several levels.  In the search for better materials suitable for magnetic recording or magnetic-memory industry, a promising avenue is believed to be the materials widely known as CMR (colossal magnetoresistance) materials.  The PI plans to carry out a theoretical study of doped Lanthanum Manganates to better understand their CMR properties.  He also has plans to conduct a theoretical study of a superconductor (Strontium Ruthenate) which has several anomalous characteristics.\r\n*** \r\n",
