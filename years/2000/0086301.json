The meeting will 1) bring together scientists and engineers working in the area of Neural Engineering, 2) provide a opportunity for young scientists to organize and chair multidisciplinary sessions 3) provide mini-symposia in chosen topics of Neural Engineering 4) provide a forum for scientists, engineers and students to present their research in Neural Engineering through oral presentations and poster presentations.  The Neural Engineering track is part of a larger scientific and engineering meeting whereby interaction and collaboration between neuro-scientists and biomedical engineers will be greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\nThe Annals of Biomedical Engineering is to publish a special issue dedicated to this Neural Engineering Track.\r\n",
