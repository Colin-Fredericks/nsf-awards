 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal to the National Science Foundation requests a grant to administer The Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) Program at Brevard Community College (BCC).  This program supports scholarships for talented, low-income students seeking A.S. degrees in computer science at BCC.  The CSEMS Program addresses the needs of the whole student at BCC by providing the student with financial, academic, and social support to encourage achievement and completion of the degree. \r\n\r\nThe program's three objectives for each year of the two-year continuing grant are: \r\n\r\n1) To increase by 20% completion of the A.S. degree in CISA and CPRA programs by low-income students, through providing 66 awards of 32 credits tuition waiver to eligible students. \r\n\r\n2) To increase by 10% transfer rate to higher education by low-income CISA and CPRA students, through providing a professional tutor to assist CSEMS Program students year-round.\r\n\r\n3) To obtain 100% CSEMS student satisfaction with academic support, through establishment of a CSEM Scholarship Club.\r\n\r\nThe program will increase the success of low-income students in a field where they are traditionally underrepresented.  The program will also create strengthened partnerships between the College and the computer science industry.\r\n\r\nMr. Steve B. Johnson, Department Chair of the Computer Science Department at Brevard Community College Palm Bay Campus, is the Principal Investigator/Scholarship Coordinator for the CSEMS Program.  Mr. Johnson will ensure that program objectives are met and progress reports are submitted on a timely basis to the National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal requests a total of $218, 380 (or $109,190 each year).  90% of that amount will go for scholarships; 10% is for administrative and student support infrastructure costs.\r\n\r\n",
