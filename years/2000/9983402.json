 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a CAREER award to create a space physics research program for undergraduate physics and physics education majors at Southeastern Louisiana University.  The educational objective is to use the proposed research project as a vehicle to have the PI mentor undergraduate students as an adjunct to their regular course work.  The scientific objective is to combine data from the Sondrestrom Incoherent Scatter Radar and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) to measure the rate of magnetic reconnection between the interplanetary magnetic field and Earth's magnetosphere more accurately and over a larger magnetic local time than is possible using either instrument independently.  Through statistical analysis of the reconnection rate measurements before and after the onset of a large number of geomagnetic substorms, the investigators will test the hypothesis that substorms are often triggered by reductions in magnetospheric convection, which is driven by reconnection.  If the hypothesis is true, the project will develop criteria that will allow actual prediction of substorms. The funds will provide student stipends, both during the academic year and summer, so that students can travel to conduct research and attend scientific conferences to present results.\r\n\r\n",
