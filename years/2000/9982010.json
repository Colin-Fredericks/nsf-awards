The research goal is to develop molecularly organized electro-and optically-active oligothiophene (conjugated) ultrathin films suitable for \"wet processing\" and applications as solid state materials.  This is in contrast to current methods involving vacuum evaporation and solution crystallization techniques.  New oligomer structures, telechelic oligomers, and \"precursor\" polymers with oligothiophene derivatives ( than 5-6 units) will  be synthesized.  The ultrathin films will be fabricated using molecular and supramolecular assembly techniques to form multilayers on various solid-support substrates.  Orientation, aggregation, layer ordering and morphological control is essential during film fabrication.  This will be analyzed by combining surface sensitive spectroscopic and microscopic analysis methods.  By determining structure-property correlations, the intention is to \"tailor\" the preferred order towards several solid state materials applications.  Electropolymerization and doping techniques on well ordered ultrathin film systems would be used to induce coupling reactions and conductivity for incorporation in various electrical and optical device applications.  Ultimately, the goal is to establish a research protocol for discovery of new organic ultrathin film materials and bridge research and training for a new breed of materials scientists.\r\n\r\nThe exponential growth in handheld devices, portable computers, displays, sensors, miniaturized components, requires new materials and processes that allow rapid prototyping and manufacturing even approaching that of the nanoscale.  Thus, there is a need to direct molecular organization in ultrathin films during processing with a rational design of polymer materials.  This research program combines these aspects and at the same time focuses on training  new breed of materials scientists, capable of parallel thinking and skills progression for developing organic solid state materials.  While new materials and methodologies can be discovered, the most important contribution to society is through a sustained approach in educating new scientists and technologists.  To meet this challenge, a number of education initiatives are proposed which includes high school students and teacher mentoring (K-12), combined with graduate students participation.  Opportunities for participation in interdisciplinary institutions and projects both here and abroad are also proposed.\r\n",
