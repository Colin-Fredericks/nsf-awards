 "awd_abstract_narration": "9983659\r\nThis CAREER project will investigate experimentally the instabilities in the flow of cohesive and non-cohesive granular matter under a variety of excitations and boundary conditions that lead to granular flows, patterns, or segregation. There is no fundamental theoretical approach for granular matter similar to the Navier--Stokes equations for fluids. An important deterrent to the development of a comprehensive theory has been lack of quantitative experiments on granular matter. The results of the proposed studies using silo systems, and couette shear flow cells will yield critical tests of the range of applicability of newly developed hydrodynamic approaches, especially in light of recent numerical work which shows a clear breakdown of hydrodynamics for even nominal dissipation and raises questions about the applicability of other continuum approaches. A new laboratory-based course will be developed on nonlinear phenomena in nature as part of the undergraduate physics curriculum and a summer high school teacher training program.\r\n%%%\r\nThis condensed matter physics CAREER project is an experimental study of the properties of dry and wet granular matter. Granular matter, like sand or grain, is important in many engineering processes and geological phenomena, but a satisfactory description of its properties does not exist. The proposed experiments using high speed and high resolution imaging will examine granular materials in various geometries to determine their properties under external mechanisms of adding energy. The basic understanding gained from the proposed experiments will ultimately lead to a better understanding of a range of phenomena such as conditions that give rise to long run-offs in landslides, and segregation of grains in hopper flows. A new laboratory-based course called \"Patterns in Nature\" will be developed as part of the undergraduate physics curriculum and a summer high school teacher training program. The write-ups and the designs for the experiments will be made available on the Web to offset the current lack in textbooks in nonlinear physics with emphasis on doing experiments.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
