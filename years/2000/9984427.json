 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project is an experimental condensed matter physics investigation of chiral biopolymer liquid crystals.  A molecule is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Nearly all molecules synthesized by living organisms are chiral, often expressing their chirality by forming helical structures, as typified by the alpha-helix in proteins, DNA, and many polysaccharides.  Despite the vast number of examples of chirality in nature, important details of chiral interactions are still poorly understood.  In this integrated research and educational project the self-assembly of chiral will be studied.  A connection between structure and thermodynamics of chiral mesophases and their molecular-level chirality will be made by measuring their equation of state using the osmotic stress method, x-ray diffraction and polarizing microscopy.  Biomolecular systems that will be studied include DNA, 2'-deoxyguaniosine-5'monophosphate, and alpha-helical polypeptides.  Results from this project could lead to the development of efficient chiral separation techniques which are much needed in the pharmaceutical industry to produce enatiomerically pure drugs.  Such drugs are often safer and more potent.  The educational part of this project will initiate a collaborative biophysics effort in the Five College area.  Students participating in the project will receive excellent training in multidisciplinary techniques at the interface of physics and biology.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER project is an experimental condensed matter physics investigation of chiral biopolymer liquid crystals.  A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image.  Nearly all molecules synthesized by living organisms are chiral, often expressing their chirality by forming helical structures, as typified by the alpha-helix in proteins, DNA, and many polysaccharides.  Ironically, despite the vast number of examples of chirality in nature, important details of chiral interactions are still poorly understood.  In this integrated research and educational project the interactions between chiral biopolymers will be measured directly.  Knowledge of chiral forces will allow us to predict how chiral molecules assemble into more complex, higher level structures.  Biomolecular systems that will be studied include DNA, quadruple-helical DNA, and helical polypeptides.  Results from this project should lead to the development of new and efficient chiral separation techniques which are much needed in the pharmaceutical industry to produce enantiomerically pure drugs.  Such drugs are often safer and more potent.  The educational part of this project will initiate a collaborative biophysics effort in the Five College area.  Students participating in the project will receive excellent training in multidisciplinary techniques at the interface of physics  and biology.\r\n",
