 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) This project is focused on disseminating broadly successful strategies and methods for enhancing undergraduate interest in science through stressed stream analysis. Twenty workshops are being conducted for science and engineering faculty who are interested in learning how to design new courses or integrate into existing courses environmental analysis concepts and state-of-the-art techniques (e.g. biotic indices, electrophoresis, geographic information systems, automated water quality analysis, toxic organic chemical detection in environmental samples, and spreadsheet modeling). Admission to these workshops is based on participants plans for incorporating workshop materials into courses and curricula at their home institutions. Participants pay their own travel expenses and the workshops pay all other expenses. These 3-day workshops are teaching faculty how to organize student teams for collecting data needed to prepare environmental impact statements for real, local problems. Participants receive fully documented course materials with easily adaptable sample exercises, work with regional faculty workshop leaders to modify courses and curriculum at their own institutions, and learn how to sustain this process. The workshop activities are also supported by ample opportunities for follow up with faculty leaders and other participants. Fifteen of the workshops are being conducted at regional sites at the rate of 3 per year, and five are being conducted at the national meetings of different scientific societies, at the rate of 1 per year, including at least one national meeting of an organization of minority scientists. The project leaders are offering full travel allowances for underrepresented minority faculty. \r\n",
