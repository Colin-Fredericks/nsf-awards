 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Routledge\r\nand his colleagues will conduct a program of archaeological excavation and\r\nsurvey in the vicinity Khirbat al-Mudayna al-`Aliya (KMA) on the eastern\r\nedge of Jordan's Karak Plateau, ca. 35 kilometers due east of the Dead Sea.\r\nKMA is an exceptionally well-preserved village occupied for a brief period\r\nof time in the last half of the eleventh century BC (Iron Age Ib).\r\nImportantly, this occupation immediately precedes the emergence of\r\nterritorial states in the region, including the biblical state of Moab into\r\nwhich this part of Jordan was incorporated in the ninth century BC.  The\r\nfounding, and brief occupation, of substantial villages in what is now an\r\nagriculturally marginal part of Jordan raises many questions about economic\r\nand political developments during this period of significant social change.\r\nDr. Routledge's research aims to address these issues by elucidating the\r\ncultural form, political economy, and local ecology of Khirbat al-Mudayna\r\nal-'Aliya and its surrounding Iron Age settlement system.  In particular,\r\nevidence will be sought for past environmental change, crop husbandry\r\npractices, herding strategies and off-site pastoral activities, household\r\norganization, the spatial distribution of activity areas in relation to\r\narchitectural variation, and exchange \"paths\" between households.  This\r\nevidence will not only shed light on the political economy of local\r\nagro-pastoral production strategies, it will also illumine the structuring\r\npractices of everyday life that are the social context for these\r\nstrategies.  One key idea to be tested in this research is the suitability\r\nof African models of state formation that emphasize social relations over\r\nEurasian models that emphasize control of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
