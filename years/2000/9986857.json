 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (59), (21) The College of Engineering and two departments, Mathematics and Experimental Statistics, are increasing the opportunities for academically talented students who are willing, but financially unable to reach their fullest potential. This is being achieved through a student/faculty partnership, with a comprehensive monitoring system, under the sponsorship of the NSF/CSEMS program. About one-fifth of the undergraduate students attending the university during the Fall-1998 (5,537 of 24,773) were eligible to receive a Pell Grant. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are: (1) to improve the education of students in engineering and mathematics, (2) to increase the retention of students to degree attainment, (3) to increase the number of undergraduates, including minorities and women, receiving baccalaureate degrees in engineering and mathematics, as well as master's degrees in mathematics; (4) to improve the professional development and employment and further higher education placement of participating students, and (5) to strengthen partnerships between institutions of higher education and related employment sectors. The students that are selected will benefit by joining the academic enhancement activities of two unique ongoing NSF/REU programs. The CSEMS scholars will not be required to conduct research but will be offered the opportunity to do so. This project is resulting in students being well-prepared and technically competent engineers and mathematicians. \r\n\r\nThe 32 students selected each year will participate in research projects of their choice in engineering or mathematics. About half of the 32 students selected CSEMS are minorities and/or and women. The students are co-advised by academic mentors.. The engineering students are juniors and seniors, and the mathematics students are a mix of undergraduate and graduate students. About 25% (4-8) of the students are from the mathematics and experimental statistics departments. Moreover, the addition of graduate students to current projects provides first-hand insight to the undergraduate about graduate studies. \r\n\r\nSince mathematics is one of the building blocks for engineers, closer interaction between students and faculty increases the levels of understanding for both. This project expands the learning community and provides an exciting way to enhance students' academic, social and personal success at the university. The investigators believe that this educational program is a successful national model to assist students in gaining the educational skills needed for industry and graduate studies through various sponsored activities including: 1) Retention, 2) Professional Development, 3) Graduate School, and 4) Dissemination.\r\n",
