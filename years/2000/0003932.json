 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one-day workshop will be held currently with the 2000 ASME Design Engineering Technical Conference. The goal of this workshop is to bring relevant academic, industry, and government experts together, especially including those outside of the ASME community, to discuss research challenges and establish research goals in the general area of human assist devices and automation. The focus will be on task-oriented integration of simple mechanisms, controls and intelligence to provide customized flexibility at an affordable cost. The potential task scopes range from aiding people with disability, microsurgery, health care, industrial automation, material handling, manufacturing, construction, combat, tele-operation, to satellite deployment. Findings of the workshop will comprise the substance of a public report  to the NSF, which is also made available on the web for appropriate wider dissemination.",
