 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stuart Rice of the University of Chicago is funded by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program  for a combined experimental and theoretical approach to study the interfaces between pure metals and alloys and other species of condensed matter.   The studies are directed primarily at interfaces between liquid and vapor, liquid and solid, and between liquid and an adsorbate on the liquid surface.  The experimental studies will use grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, grazing incidence differential anomalous x-ray diffraction, x-ray reflectivity, x-ray reflectivity fine structure and surface sensitive EXAFS measurements.  The theoretical studies will employ self-consistent quantum Monte Carlo simulations.  The longitudinal and transverse structure in the liquid-vapor interface of alloys will be studied with particular attention to the heterovalent alloys.  The longitudinal and transverse structure in the liquid-solid interfaces of pure metals and alloys will be examined for the influence of the field of the solid on the structure of the liquid at the interface.  The variation of the interface will be studied as a function of the alloy composition and temperature.\r\n\r\nVery little is known about the structure of the interface between two immiscible phases. Many chemical phenomena depend on the nature of this interface.  Professor Rice is using a combination of theoretical and experimental methods which have only recently become available to explore the detailed structure of these phase boundaries and the factors which influence this structure. \r\n",
