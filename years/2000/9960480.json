 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop methods for generating alignment of short but highly graphitic and inexpensive nanofibers in polymer matrix composites.  These efforts, carried out by Applied Sciences, in collaboration with its subcontractor, Ohio University, are expected to result in excellent mechanical reinforcement of the matrix, and effectively achieve the elusive goal of simultaneously attaining high modulus, high strength, and low cost from a carbon fiber reinforcement.  Carbon nanofibers will be made to align in thin, extruded strands of thermoplastic polymer that can then be laid up and molded into composites by conventional textile handling techniques.  The formation and lamination of papers from the short fibers will also be explored.  Composites will be tested for mechanical properties and evaluated for the degree of fiber alignment actually obtained.\r\n\r\nA wide variety of military and commercial applications would benefit from carbon fiber reinforced composites.  Any application that currently uses chopped glass fiber reinforcement could be replaced by a carbon fiber reinforced component with improved mechanical properties.  Application that can benefit from added electrical conductivity in composites panels, such as low observable materials for aircraft, EMI control enclosures, and automotive panels that need electrostatic painting techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
