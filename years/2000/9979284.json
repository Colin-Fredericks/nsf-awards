 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary Revised\r\nIn the face of an acute economic crisis, Venezuela recently reversed its nationalization of the oil industry and offered leases in Delta Amacuro State to BP-Amoco and other transnational corporations. As capital- and technology-intensive facilities are constructed in the midst of impoverished communities, the government and NGO's are using corporate funding in producing sudden infusions of capital, bringing health care, schools, and small development projects into selected areas. Funding is requested for a two-year investigation that will produce systematic quantitative and qualitative data on the way that petroleum investment and associated changes affect the way that individuals in this region construct social identities. Open-ended interviews and focus groups will explore the concepts of race, class, place (including notions of local, regional, national, and transnational spaces), and citizenship that people use in characterizing themselves and their life experiences and the relative importance of each of these factors. The survey will focus specifically on the latter question, the differential weight that is accorded to each of these factors. The PI and a consultant will work in three delta communities that are classified as \"indigenous,\" while two undergraduates from the Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) in Caracas will conduct fieldwork in two towns that are classified as being primarily \"non-indigenous.\" The sites have been selected to include areas in which oil exploitation is currently taking place, in which exploration alone has taken place, and where no oil activity is evident. A UCV faculty member who teaches in the School of Anthropology and is currently a student in the Ethnic Studies doctoral program at UCSD will interview oil company representatives and officials in NGOs and similar organizations working in the delta.  She will investigate how they view and are attempting to shape the attitudes and actions of residents in addition to documenting the nature and extent of their activities in the delta.\r\n\r\n",
