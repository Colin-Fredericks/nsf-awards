The program's awards \r\nprovide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary \r\nfacilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Ronald K. Castellano with support for twenty-four months to \r\nwork with Dr. Francois Diederich at Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in \r\nZurich, Switzerland.  This project is being co-funded by NSF's Directorate for \r\nMathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThis project involves the study of programmed structural order in functional dendrimer \r\nprotein mimics.  Dendrimers are symmetrically-branched molecules.  In biological \r\nsystems, secondary and tertiary protein structures work cooperatively to modulate the \r\nenzyme active site by exposing functionality and providing substrate accessibility.  As a \r\nnext step toward functional, dendrimer-based protein mimics this research will address \r\ncontrol over dendrimer surface and branching structure.  The proposed coiled coil \r\ndendrimers will be a new class of synthetic protein model systems that combine both \r\nstructural and functional elements and will represent the first peptide-containing \r\ndendrimers to demonstrate well-defined and tunable structural order.\r\n\r\nDr. Castellano's project will complement ongoing research at Dr. Diederich's lab, on \r\nfunctional dendrimers for recognition and catalysis and promises to help work toward \r\nmajor advances in the field of dendritic biological mimics. Dr. Diederich has nearly 20 \r\nyears of experience in molecular recognition and supramolecular architectures.  He is a \r\nleader in biomimetic dendrimer chemistry.  The ETH will provide a unique melding of \r\nbiological and chemical sciences making it the ideal place to this bioorganic research \r\nproject.  This research will have impacts in fields such as biochemistry, specifically \r\nbiometric synthetic chemistry and in self assembly of nanoscale materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
