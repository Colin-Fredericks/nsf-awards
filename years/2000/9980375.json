 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nIn recent years, agent-based computing is increasingly being used in information management and distributed computing.  In undergraduate computer science education the technical aspects of agent-based computing are closely related to other areas of the discipline.  This proof-of-concept project incorporates agent-based computing across the computer science and engineering curriculum.  The objectives of the project are to design and develop course materials, including examples and exercises for an introductory course, Foundations of Agent-Based Computing, and a series of in-depth course modules, including teaching materials and agent software, that can be integrated into other computer science courses such as artificial intelligence, distributed computing, networking and distributed computing.    \r\n\r\nThe project is being evaluated internally with help from the College of Education and externally in collaboration with five other sites.  The evaluation is based upon the feedback from the collaborating sites regarding the effectiveness of the agent-based teaching materials for the introductory course as well as the modules for other courses.  Results are being disseminated through a website, professional conference presentations and journal articles. \r\n\r\nIf the evaluation of the prototype produces positive results, future plans include full development of the agent-based concepts in collaboration with professors from the external sites, extending the course materials to Spanish-speaking audiences, and the publication of a textbook on agent-based computing.\r\n",
