 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves improvements in current pilot life support equipment and emergency medical compression clothing that can be achieved through the incorporation of the shape memory alloy (SMA) Nitinol as part of an active system to replace traditional air bladder concepts. Used to reduce the risk of pilot blackout during high-G maneuvers and for pneumatic tourniquets in emergency situations, clothing components with air bladders may be dramatically improved by using SMAs to reduce size and power requirements. The developed system will be the application of active cinching straps for leg compression and emergency tourniquets, and for mask sealing during high-G maneuvers. These actively controlled straps will be less cumbersome and more reliable than air bladders used to seal masks, and compress limbs. For pilots, the proposed systems will incorporate sensors to activate the uniform components during critical times and reduce pilot error. Shape memory alloys can form very high stroke, high force solid state actuators for use in textile structures. They offer a high degree of flexibility and are easily incorporated into fabric designs. Using amplified designs and leverage mechanisms, DSM proposes to develop the integrated fabric components that will perform the desired functionality.\r\n\r\nPotential commercial Applications for the Nitinol and smart material reinforced uniform components have a great potential in the medical and physical therapy industry. Pressurized suits or selectively stiffened or reinforced suits can be used to stop significant blood loss, aid in supporting damaged legs, arms or necks, and help patients achieve therapeutic advances in motion by providing some support during  rehabilitation.",
