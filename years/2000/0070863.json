 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fourth Gordon Research Conference on the Biology of Spirochetes is the only ongoing international meeting devoted to basic research on spirochetes, which comprise a separate phylum of the Bacteria. These organisms have a unique but common structure and mode of motility. There are free-living spirochetes, whereas others are parasitic for arthropod hosts including termites. Several other species cause disease in humans and animals. Recently, termite gut spirochetes have for the first time been cultured and were found to augment degradation of polymers such as cellulose. As a group, these organisms are difficult to study because of the lack of a system for continuous in vitro culture (in some cases) and adequate genetic systems. However, the recent publication of the genomic sequences for two spirochete species provide a wealth of information that is now being incorporated into studies on the biology of these bacteria. Furthermore, significant progress has recently been made in developing genetic exchange systems that should be applicable to both free living and pathogenic spirochetes. Additionally, the new developments of devising methods to cultivate termite gut spirochetes has broad application, as this basic knowledge is now being translated into cultivating spirochetes associated certain human diseases. The first three Biology of Spirochetes Gordon Conferences were well-received.  For the 2000 conference, 150 faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and industrial scientists are anticipated. Special attention will be made to obtain adequate representation of young investigators. The planned oral presentations and poster sessions will provide a forum for discussion and exchange of ideas. The past conferences have led to important collaborations between laboratories. \r\n\r\n",
