 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, the potential for subtle but serious chronic/sublethal impacts from dino-flagellates known as the toxic Pfiesteria complex on fish health as well as human health was realized during toxic outbreaks in several tributaries of the largest estuary on the U.S. mainland, in the second largest estuary, the Albemarle-Pamlico, for nearly a decade before the Chesapeake outbreaks.  In this research we will mass-produce toxic culture of P. piscicida in a custom-designed biohazard III facility for research on toxic stages.  This facility will be required for maintenance of toxic stages of Pfiesteria piscicida and the second known toxic Pfiesteria-like species, and for all experiments to determine the range of stage transformations among toxic stages of each species.  This will involve cloning toxic and nontoxic isolates of Pfiesteria piscicida, and of the second known toxic Pfiesteria-like species, from the Neuse and Pocomoke Estuaries at 8- to 12-month intervals (needed since cultures that are maintained in toxic mode with live fish for longer periods tend to lose virulence).  This research will greatly improve recognition of Pfiesteria in field samples from fish kills/epizootics, and will also enhance general understanding of trophic controls on stage transformations and abundance of both known species in the toxic Pfiesteria complex.",
