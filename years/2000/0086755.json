 "awd_abstract_narration": "0086755  Roberts  This research explores the use of zero-valent metals for treating vapor phase chlorinated organic contaminants commonly found in landfill gas.  Specifically, the reactions of 1,2-dichloroethane and cis-1,2-dichloroethane (and their daughter products) with a variety of bimetallic reductants (or iron alone) will be studied.  Batch and column tests will be conducted for screening and for determining performance, longevity, and reaction rates and products.  Additional studies will focus on developing a better understanding of the molecular-scale chemical reactions that result in destruction of halogenated contaminants at metal particle surfaces.  Batch and column studies will be complemented by surface chemical investigations, designed to provide information concerning trhe composistion of the reactive metal surface as it evolves under the influence of exposure to water, chlorinated contaminants and the minor gas-phase constituents, oxygen and hydrogen-sulfide.  In addition to the intended application to landfill gas, applications of this research include controlling emissions from chemical production and manufacturing processes, as well as treating contaminants present in soils (removed via soil vapor extraction or bioventing). This grant is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF 00-49, New Technologies for the Environment.***",
