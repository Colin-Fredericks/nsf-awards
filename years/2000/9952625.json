This sequence involves modeling, numerical analysis, and computer programming. The first purpose of the course is to teach students how to solve extended problems that require them to learn how to formulate the problem; decide on the appropriate mathematical tool; implement the method; obtain, interpret, and communicate the results; and use that information to refine the model. The second purpose is for students to learn how to implement modern technology in their problem solving techniques. The overall motivation for the course is that most real world problems are solved with the aid of technology and require these types of problem solving methodologies.\r\n\r\nIn this course students are learning the basics of numerical analysis, including Simpson's rule, Runge-Kutta methods, and finite difference models. The course also includes a discussion of object-oriented C++ programming and shows how computer objects can be used to simplify scientific programming. The primary focus of this multidisciplinary course is on simulations such as a swinging pendulum and catalyzed chemical reactions which can be taken from the sciences. The course is being adapted from the course \"Experimental Mathematics\" at Northwestern University. \r\n",
