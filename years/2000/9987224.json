The goals are accomplished by establishing a mentor program and by allowing students to devote more time to their educational pursuits in a well - structured program as opposed to working on non-discipline jobs to support their educational expenses. Students participate in a mentoring program, field trips, tutoring, research, and other project activities specifically designed to increase their productivity. Expected outcomes are improved retention, increased GPA's for participants, and better preparedness for the job market or graduate school.",
