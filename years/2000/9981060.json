 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\nUndergraduate engineering education has undergone considerable reform in the last decade in order to make engineering more relevant to students and more attractive to underrepresented populations. Incorporation of Experiential Components and Cooperative Learning into an Introductory Problem Solving Course addresses these audiences as well as pre-service teachers and two-year college students. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to provide an introductory course to develop a set of the characteristics in the students that define the \"best UW graduate\": project design and execution, experimental capabilities, system analysis and modeling capabilities, and communication abilities. This model will serve as a catalyst for modifying the engineering science curriculum to address the \"best graduate\" characteristics. Classroom activities, implemented in a web-based format, will be available to other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe ideas are adapted from a course, Engineering Problem Solving, offered to freshmen at Iowa State University, a member of the Synthesis Coalition. Through efforts of Synthesis faculty, significant courseware development has led to more active learning in the course by integrating traditional hands-on engineering practice with new technology. Through collaboration with ISU faculty, essential components of the Iowa State course-both experimental and technological- will be adapted to the UW course.\r\n\r\nThe Mosrse Alumni Distinguished Teaching Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Minnesota will assist in integrating teaching methodologies and strategies in the course to actively engage the student in the learning. The course modifications will also be designed such that the course can be offered to Science and Mathematics Secondary Education majors.\r\n\r\n",
