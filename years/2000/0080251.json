Professor Ruth will meet with Dr. Arjoon Suddhoo, Executive Director of the Mauritius Research Council, and Professor Indur Fagoonee, Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University of Mauritius.\r\n\r\nMauritius, which is located in the southwestern part of the Indian Ocean, has a stable government and a growing economy, brought about in part by the expansion of tourism.  As tourism has expanded, the demand for new facilities has increased, causing many Mauritian natural resources to be overburdened and its environment to become degraded.  But Mauritius is still home to several rare animal species, such as the echo parakeet, and the last remnants of its original coastal forest are in a small nature reserve.  In the past, Mauritian investigators interacted with the European and Indian scientific communities, and very few American researchers had an opportunity to become familiar with Mauritius or its resources.  The proposed workshop can provide an opportunity for the participants to exchange information about their current projects, identify areas of mutual interest, and stimulate the development of collaborative activities.  This planning visit will enable the co-organizers to finalize the workshop agenda to maximize these interactions. \r\n",
