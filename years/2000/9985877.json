 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Duke University Phytotron - a national facility for controlled environment research on plants - was established in 1968 with funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Duke University. The Phytotron houses 48 artificially lighted controlled-environment (CE) growth chambers, six research glasshouses, offices, and laboratories for advanced research in environmental plant biology. These growth facilities permit precise control over environmental conditions, e.g., air temperature, light intensity and day length, nutrients, carbon dioxide, etc., which enables researchers to gain increased understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their environment. The mission of the Phytotron is to provide high-quality CE research space, expertise in performing CE research, and routine care of experimental plants to researchers from all over the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Phytotron is also an important education resource to the scientific community. One-third of all of projects are performed by graduate students as part of their thesis research. Postdoctoral researchers account for 29% of all projects. The Phytotron conducts educational tours to groups from grade school to college age from both on campus and across the region. On average, 500 visiting scientists, students, and teachers tour the facility annually.  Continued support for the Phytotron enhances NSF's investment in ecological research and will allow the Phytotron to continue and expand its role as a national facility for controlled-environment research and education.\r\n",
