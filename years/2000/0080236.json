 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wyoming and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) have previously collaborated to research the durability of manufactured homes. This research involved subjecting a single-wide manufactured home to simulated design lateral loads, analyzing structural response and modeling. This project also builds on prior work sponsored by NSF, HUD, and the Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI). The project seeks to better understand structural response and to predict behavior under loads from hazardous winds, the key to providing homeowners higher quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness. The previously tested (design lateral load), single-wide manufactured home is installed in a remote, high-wind area and a meteorological tower provided. Programmed task for this project include: 1) Completion and testing of the data acquisition system, 2) Data collection and analysis during high wind events, #) Wind force studies and wind tunnel testing, 4) Structural analysis and modeling, and 5) Reporting and technology transfer. The results of this research can lead to significant savings in annual losses of life and property by providing validated information for the development of cost-effective building technologies that optimize wind resistance and maintain home affordability\r\n",
