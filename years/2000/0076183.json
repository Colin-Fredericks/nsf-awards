The program's awards \r\nprovide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary \r\nfacilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Mark A. Jordan with support for eighteen months to work \r\nwith Dr. William Jordan at the Zoological Society of London in the United Kingdom.  \r\nThey will study gene flow as a constraint on adaptive evolution, a test in a polymorphic \r\npopulation of lizards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheory predicts that gene flow should constrain local adaptive evolution.  The principal \r\ninvestigator proposes to test this hypothesis using a population of Galapagos lava lizards \r\nthat is polymorphic for traits associated with locomotor performance.  He will use \r\nmicrosatellite DNA markers to determine the amount of gene flow within the population.  \r\nHigh levels of gene flow will suggest that natural selection must be severe to maintain \r\nmicrogeographic variation in performance.\r\n\r\nDr. William Jordan and his colleagues at the Institute of Zoology have extensive \r\nexperience in the application of molecular techniques for the analysis of microsatellites in \r\nnatural populations.  The principal investigator will also travel to Ecuador and will \r\ninvolve students from there to help with his fieldwork.  This research will benefit \r\nongoing conservation efforts in the Galapagos.  This project will allow estimates of \r\npopulation structure and effective population size:  measures that are critical in making \r\ninformed management decisions. \r\n***\r\n",
