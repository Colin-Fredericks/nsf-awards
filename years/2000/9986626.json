Lithographic approaches to the arrangement of such structures was the basis for technological advancement in the past two decades.  New developments which utilize methods such as self assembly, surface modification, printing, transfer, and etching on the molecular to nanoscale level have introduced a number or innovative approaches to the systematic formation of periodic structures that go beyond traditional lithographic methods.  The tools of interest for building and directing the construction of such structures include physical, chemical, biochemical, intermolecular, ionic and surface interactions.  The objective of this symposium is to explore the many approaches to the production of patterned or periodic structures in two and three dimensions that are under investigation in industrial and academic laboratories.  A focus will be place on new and unique methods, which may utilize a range of materials and processing techniques.  Final applications for these approaches range from electro-optics and photonics to biosensors or MEMS technology.\r\n\r\nThis conference will offer opportunity for young investigators and graduate students to present their work, and develop contacts which might prove critical in their professional lives.  Funding will be particularly targeted toward such young investigators, including those amongst the invited speakers.\r\n",
