 "awd_abstract_narration": "7Although the extensive use of modern computers and communication systems generally is seen as having profound impacts on the economies of developed nations, but these same technologies also are reshaping opportunities and livelihoods of people in less-developed countries.  This doctoral dissertation research project will evaluate a growing yet under-analyzed facet of economic development focusing on the value of information and communication technology, particularly the practice of cybernetworking (using computer-based communications systems to link into a broad range of networks for a variety of purposes).  The project will study the gender-based impacts of a transnational cybernetwork of rural development projects throughout Latin America; specifically the material, social, and political opportunities and constraints that exist for local women to access and utilize internet resources in the accomplishment of their local political and development agendas.  In order to address this question, research will include archival analysis of existing life histories of over 100 rural women leaders; an electronic forum of these women to assess their priority issues; and online surveys of local project officials and women.  Two illustrative case studies will be conducted in nations served by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Fidamerica project to provide insights into best- and worst-case outcomes for women.  These case studies will include the use of intensive semi-structured interviews with local women, key informant interviews, focus-group sessions with local project administrators, and local archival research.  This project will evaluate the potential application of information and communication technology for development projects for women by delineating the cultural politics surrounding the material conditionsas well as the social and political relations that support or inhibit women's access to successful cybernetworking.  By understanding the details of these politics at the scales of the network administration, the local projects, the local community, and the household, it will be possible to identify key locations for policy influence and expenditures. As such, it will be possible for development organizations, network officials, local projects administrators, and local women to maximize resources to achieve their objectives.  This research will benefit not only the study population.  It also has potential application to other development cybernetworks concerned with a broad range of sustainable development issues, and it will enhance theoretical understandings of the role of modern information and communication technologies on rural economic development in lesser-developed nations.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
