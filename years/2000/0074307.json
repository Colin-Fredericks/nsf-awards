 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this proposal is to investigate processes \r\nfundamental to the behavior of multicomponent fluids and\r\nmultiphase materials. We will do this by (1) developing and applying \r\nstate-of-the-art numerical methods to large scale computation and (2)\r\nanalytical, numerical and modelling studies of important constituent \r\nprocesses. More specifically, our focus will be on developing, \r\nimplementing and analyzing  successively more realistic models of the\r\n diffusional evolution  of microstructure in solid/solid phase transitions. \r\nOur investigation of multiphase fluids includes a study of ternary fluid \r\nflow where only two of the components are immiscible. These projects \r\ninvolve fundamental physical processes whose phenomenology is basic to \r\nunderstanding the behavior of real fluids and the material properties of \r\nsolids. Both are characterized by the presence of multiple constitutive \r\ncomponents, complex pattern formation and/or singularities (i.e. spatial \r\ncomplexity). Although these processes arise in very different physical \r\nphenomena (fluids versus solids), both involve free boundary problems\r\nwhere the motion of a bounding interface, separating the different \r\ncomponents, is driven by a competition between surface energy and either \r\nan instability or multi-body interactions. As such, they can be treated \r\nusing a common set of analytical and computational tools. The highly \r\nnonlinear nature of these problems makes fast, accurate and robust \r\nnumerical methods essential to their study.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we bring together mathematical and numerical\r\nanalysis, modelling, and large-scale scientific computation to study\r\ncertain fundamental problems in fluid dynamics and materials\r\nscience.  Our focus will be on developing, implementing and analyzing\r\nsuccessively more realistic models of the diffusional evolution  of \r\nmicrostructure in solid/solid phase transitions.  These transformations\r\nare an important method of processing multicomponent metallic alloys such\r\nsuch as steels. The result of this process is the formation of a multiphase\r\nmicrostructure, which is a key variable in setting the macroscopic\r\nmechanical properties (i.e. stiffness, strength and toughness) of the\r\nalloy. The microstructure is characterized by regions of different metallic \r\ncomponents separated from one another by interfaces. The goal of our \r\nresearch is to accurately model and simulate the formation of microstructure \r\nin alloys in order to provide metallurgists with a recipe for generating new \r\nalloys with desirable material properties. Our investigation of multiphase \r\nfluids involves modelling liquid/liquid extraction processes that are widely \r\nused in chemical production and waste processing. In these processes, two \r\n(or more) fluids are placed in contact and a contaminant in one of the fluids \r\ndiffuses preferentially into another. The first fluid thus is cleaned and is \r\nthen extracted. In these processes, two (or more) fluids are placed in contact\r\nand a contaminant in one of the fluids diffuses preferentially into another.\r\nThe first fluid thus is cleaned and is then extracted. If the contaminated \r\nfluid is broken up into small droplets, the interfacial area and hence mass \r\ntransfer is increased. We will use analysis, modeling and large scale \r\nscientific computation to study reaction and mixing rates within these \r\nsystems. The ultimate goal of this work is to provide a theoretical \r\nfoundation for improving the performance of liquid/liquid extractors.\r\nAlthough the two problems described above arise from very different physical \r\nprocesses (fluids versus solids), they are similar in the sense that the \r\nrelevant phenomena is strongly influenced by surface tension at the \r\nrespective interfaces. Consequently, they can be studied using common \r\nanalytical and computational tools. The highly complex nature of these \r\nproblems makes fast, accurate and robust numerical methods essential to their \r\nstudy.\r\n",
