 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through an established scholarship activity under the NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) program, Green River Community College (Green River) is enabling the achievement of higher education degrees in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics by talented but financially disadvantaged students. This program is also improving scholarship student's opportunities for professional development and employment. The CSEMS program is serving as a reproducible model that demonstrates the positive outcomes of financial and academic support and student support infrastructure as they relate to student retention toward degree completion and adequate preparation for the workplace. On an institutional level, this program is strengthening partnerships between Green River and other institutions of higher education and computer science, engineering, and mathematics employment sectors. \r\n\r\nA Program Advisory Committee is overseeing the program's activities and evaluating its ongoing effectiveness. This committee includes representatives from industry, local area high school computer science, engineering, and mathematics teachers, Green River alumni, and four-year university faculty. A Scholarship Selection Committee is evaluating success of scholarship applications. This committee includes faculty representatives from Green River's computer science, engineering, and mathematics departments, and a scholarship office representative. Scholarship students are being chosen based on academic merit, professionalism, and potential to complete their degree in a CSEMS discipline by the close of the grant period. \r\n\r\nThe academic and student-support infrastructure for successful graduation of scholarship recipients includes classes and programs through Green River's high quality computer science, engineering, and mathematics departments, faculty advisors for each student in his/her discipline, one-on-one mentor relationships with area leaders in the student's field of interest, and student support groups and organizations. \r\n\r\nThe CSEMS scholarship program is enabling Green River to further enhance the existing community infrastructure for the recruitment, attainment, and increased educational and employment opportunities of students of diverse backgrounds with diverse career goals while also creating a reproducible model for other community colleges. Ultimately, this program is improving undergraduate education at Green River, other community colleges, and four-year universities. \r\n",
