 "awd_abstract_narration": "The memory model for a programming language specifies\r\nthe relationship between the order in which data accesses\r\nappear in a program and the order seen during execution by\r\nthe different program components With the advent of parallel\r\nprogramming environments like Posix threads, Java, and OpenMP, multi-\r\nthreaded explicitly parallel programs have become much more\r\nfrequent. This increases the need for memory models that\r\nare easy to understand and efficient so that correct pro-\r\ngrams can be developed and still give good performance.\r\nUnfortunately, the usability of memory models, their impact\r\non performance, and the compiler technology needed to per-\r\nform optimizations of parallel programs are poorly under-\r\nstood. The result is that current memory models tend to\r\nfavor performance over usability by restricting the programs\r\nthat can be written with them, or by being difficult to\r\nunderstand. The objective of this project is to study com-\r\npiler techniques to optimize explicitly parallel programs by\r\nusing optimizations and analysis algorithms structured to\r\nhandle a broad class of consistency models. The techniques\r\nstudied will be implemented in a compiler that will serve\r\nas a testbed for prototyping and studying programming\r\nlanguage memory models and for studying the optimization\r\nand analysis of explicitly parallel programs.",
