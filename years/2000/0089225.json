 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis investigation addresses the challenge of implementing effective instruction for reading comprehension in the elementary grades, based on a cognitive-motivational model of reading comprehension. From this framework, we developed Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI), which combines reading strategy instruction and inquiry science. The goals of the interdisciplinary team are to: (1) 'scale-up' CORI to the district level in the later elementary grades, (2) compare the effectiveness of CORI to strategy instruction (SI) and traditional reading instruction (TRI) for increasing reading comprehension, reading motivation, and science knowledge, (3) examine the variables influencing the scalability and sustainability of CORI, and (4) use technology for student learning, assessment, and teacher development. \r\n\r\nIn a three-year longitudinal design, we are phasing-in CORI and comparison groups with a target sample of 3600 students across grades 3, 4 and 5 in 144 classes in 16 schools in one district. Effects of treatments are analyzed cross-sectionally and growth curve modeling is conducted longitudinally with Hierarchical Linear Modeling. Computer-based technology is used for: student learning (Internet web sites, computer tools, and CD-roms); student assessment (science knowledge); teacher professional development (preparation, collaboration, and monitoring); and dissemination.",
