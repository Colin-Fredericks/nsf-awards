 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current low power technology focuses on low power hardware designs\r\nand OS-level power management. In contrast, compiler support for \r\nlow-power is still in its infancy, mainly due to the fact\r\nthat most classical optimizations for speed and space    \r\ntypically reduce a program's overall power consumption as well, \r\nmaking power as a separate optimization objective redundant. \r\nHowever, recent trends and developments in architecture and OS \r\ndesign have made power dissipation an optimization objective in its\r\nown right. These recent developments are (1) more advanced OS-level \r\npower management support, (2) availability of low-power wireless \r\ncommunication, and (3) reconfigurable architectures with dynamic \r\nvoltage scaling capabilities. This project investigates low-power \r\noptimizations in the context of the Java programming language. Java \r\nhas become the language of choice for portable programming across a \r\nvariety of different architectures, including mobile computers, \r\npersonal digital assistants (PDA), and embedded systems. Such devices \r\nrely on battery power for significant periods of their up-time, if \r\nnot during the entire time of their operation, making power savings \r\na crucial issue. The new low-power optimizations may trade-off \r\nexecution time for power savings. They include application-driven \r\npower management, location-aware method/task mapping to remote \r\nservers, and instruction scheduling for reconfigurable architectures \r\nwith dynamic voltage scaling. \r\n",
