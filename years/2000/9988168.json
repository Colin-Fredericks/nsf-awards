Complexity in specification, design, and analysis\r\ndramatically increases in software architectures defined\r\nby distributed components interacting via non-deterministic\r\ncommunication patterns. One of the most significant research\r\nproblems is achieving a balance between general theoretical\r\nconcepts and specific practical techniques. This research\r\ninvestigates a domain-specific design technique for\r\ndistributed-object software systems. The approach is based on\r\napplying and adapting Petri nets, an existing graph model\r\noriented toward concurrent systems. The specific objectives\r\nare to solidify the theoretical foundations for a\r\nstate-based object design notation and investigate\r\ncapabilities for inheritance modeling within the design\r\nframework. This research can lead to methods and notations that\r\nsupport engineering-oriented design of complex distributed\r\nsoftware systems. This has the potential to improve the overall\r\nquality and cost-effectiveness of development and maintenance\r\nfor a wide range of critical software applications.\r\n\r\n",
