 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts studying ice, evolution, biological preservation, ancient life, and astrobiology to assess our current knowledge of life in ancient ice, and to discuss future research and collaborations that would extend our knowledge in this area.  A surprising number and variety of microorganisms have been recovered from the interior of glacial ice cores, dating back beyond 400,000 years.  Researchers have performed systematic surveys for bacteria, fungi, algae, vascular plants (as pollen), and viruses in samples of ancient ice cores.  Glacial ice is a natural air-sampling and preservation matrix.  Through geological epochs wind-transported microorganisms have been trapped within these matrices.  Thus, glacial ice provides a unique global source of microorganisms which, in turn, presents a view of both contemporary and ancient fungal, bacterial, and viral diversity. Profiles of successively older ice strata will extend temporal and spatial assessments of microbial biodiversity to geologic time frames.  The microorganisms might then be utilized in subsequent studies as bioindicators of global change with respect to climate, geology and human activity.  In addition, species detected across a continuous chronological sequence can be utilized to study phylogenic, mechanisms of longevity, dormancy and ecological relevance.  Finally, developed and tested protocols may contribute to future searches for microorganisms in extraterrestrial ice (e.g., ice from the Moon, Mars, Europa, comets, etc.).  The proposed workshop will engage in active discussion of life in ancient ice and discuss current research trends.  The workshop will also serve as a medium for discussion of the methodological approaches needed for microbial detection in these ancient matrices.  Various approaches, all involving fungi, bacteria, and viruses, will focus on assessing diversity in both time and space.  Workshop presentations and discussions will serve to generate recommendations for future research and for improvements in methodologies.  Ultimately all information will be disseminated through a workshop report, workshop summary books, and Internet information sites.\r\n\r\n",
