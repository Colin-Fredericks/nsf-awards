 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) This project expands and enhances undergraduate opportunities to utilize Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy in General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry and Undergraduate Research.  The project adapts an existing program at Boise State University (BSU).  The BSU model uses FT-NMR starting with organic chemistry and continues through advanced courses and undergraduate research.  Similar improvements are being implemented at Idaho State University with experiments and research being modified to take advantage of the expertise of the faculty at Idaho State.  Laboratories and curricula are enhancing students' critical thinking skills and exposure to the scientific process of inquiry through investigation.  Laboratories have become open-ended investigations, where students hypothesize, interpret data, reach conclusions, and move directly into independent research.  The project reflects a national and institutional effort to promote active learning in science.  \r\n\r\nThe emphasis on NMR spectroscopy complements DUE's theme of integrating technology into education.  Intensive use of NMR in academics has historically been limited to graduate students; the advanced systems now available make this research tool readily available for undergraduate use as well.  Also, NMR is increasingly important to both academic investigation and industry.  When students complete the undergraduate curriculum, their level of NMR exposure rivals that of many graduate students.  The project is enabling an increase in undergraduate research in chemistry at the university.  It will be replicable by other universities that wish to enhance inquiry-based learning, critical thinking and undergraduate chemistry students' research abilities.",
