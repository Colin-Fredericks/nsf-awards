 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n     Portable computer and communication systems are all around today and\r\nthey will only become more prevalent in the days to come.  The design of\r\nsuch mobile electronic systems involves a number of significant engineering\r\nchallenges.  Because they operate from batteries, they must both consume\r\nvery little power and operate on a low power-supply voltage.  Moreover,\r\nbecause they are always on the move, such systems must be able to\r\ndynamically adapt their performance to an ever-changing environment.  This\r\nresearch involves the development of a unified framework for systematically\r\ndesigning and implementing efficient adaptive signal-processing systems\r\nthat consume very little power and can operate on a low power-supply\r\nvoltage with applications in the areas of mobile communication systems and\r\nenhanced human-computer interfaces.\r\n     The class of dynamic translinear circuits implements the feed-forward\r\nsignal processing functions needed for continuous-time linear, polynomial,\r\nand rational-function adaptive filters with very few devices.  Such\r\ncircuits are capable of operating with low power consumption and on a low\r\npower-supply voltage.  This research involves the design an implementation\r\nof continuous-time linear and nonlinear adaptive filtering algorithms with\r\ndynamic translinear circuits with applications in the areas of mobile\r\ncommunication systems and enhanced human-computer interfaces.  The primary\r\nfocus of this research is on the efficient hardware implementation of such\r\nadaptive filters, assessing how device nonidealities and noise impact\r\nsystem performance and developing robust architectures and adaptive\r\nalgorithms.",
