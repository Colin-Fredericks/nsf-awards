 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFive controlled environment plant growth chambers will facilitate research of a cross-disciplinary group at Kansas State University (KSU) on the response of plants to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses.  These chambers will provide controlled growth conditions crucial for understanding the mechanism by which plants perceive and respond to environmental cues. \r\n\r\nThe acquisitions will facilitate the individual and collaborative research of the group members on understanding the biochemical, physiological and molecular changes in plants exposed to stress, identification of genes involved in stress signaling, development of plant varieties resistant to pathogens and insects, and understanding the molecular basis of cell division and cell death in plants.   The growth chambers will enhance the quality and productivity of research at KSU by providing infrastructure for innovative research, through cooperative use of facilities and increased collaboration.  Students will benefit from specialty courses providing training on plant stress response.  The equipment will further facilitate and enhance the recruitment and training of women and minorities in plant biochemistry, physiology, molecular biology and genetics at KSU.  \r\n\r\nPlant growth, development and productivity are influenced by environmental cues.  The stress of disease, insect infestation, increasing global temperatures, limited water supply and chemical toxicity, limit plant productivity.  The proposed work on understanding the perception and response of plants to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses will expedite the development of plant varieties with enhanced resistance to stress, thereby improving plant productivity, food quality, public health and the environment\r\n",
