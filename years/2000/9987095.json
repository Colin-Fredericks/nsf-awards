 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enables economically disadvantaged students to successfully complete any one of six different Associate Degree programs, (including Computer Systems Engineering Technology, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Telecommunications Technology, Computer Information Technologies, and Engineering and Computer Science Transfer), and secure employment or placement into four-year engineering or computer science programs. The program is thoroughly integrated into a tech prep consortium, a partnership between 11 area secondary schools and the college, as well as linked to a neighboring  consortium, which includes eleven additional secondary schools. A well-established network of tech prep guidance counselors and site coordinators assists in promoting the program and recruiting applicants. On-campus tech prep support services provide part of the infrastructure needed to ensure scholarship student success. A faculty mentor guides scholarship students throughout the year. This individual also collaborates with the college Career Services Office and local industry partners to develop multiple student internship opportunities in engineering/computer technology. The program provides a model for utilizing NSF scholarships as seed money for convincing corporate partners of the value of investing in promising students, a model that utilizes existing national networks such as Tech Prep and School to Work and that can be disseminated through the existing networks build through NSF funding.\r\n",
