 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nNachtergaele will work on a variety of problems in quantum statistical \r\nmechanics. In a first group of problems he will study quantum spin systems\r\nas models for magnetic materials. The main focus here is on equilibrium\r\nand non-equilibrium properties of domain walls and other structures\r\nsuch as droplets. With Messager, he proposes a new quantum solid-on-solid \r\nmodel for the 111 interface in the Heisenberg XXZ ferromagnet. For this \r\nmodel the stability of the interface at strictly positive temperatures will \r\nbe studied. The universality of fluctuations of interfaces will be investigated \r\nin a class of one-dimensional models. Another goal is to prove the existence \r\nof droplets in quantum spin models at zero temperature and to make first steps \r\ntowards the study of their dynamics. In continuum quantum statistical mechanics\r\nNachtergaele will work on the derivation of the Euler equations from the\r\nSchroedinger dynamics of interacting fermions, and on a characterization of \r\nthe various types of Bose condensation.  The latter is a project in\r\ncollaboration with Zagrebnov and Bru. The first is work already begun with \r\nHT Yau.\r\n \r\nQuantum statistical mechanics is an area of growing interest because many of \r\nthe phenomena that are being discovered and studied today in condensed matter\r\nphysics and material science are intrinsically quantum mechanical: Bose\r\ncondensation, superfluidity, superconductivity, quantum optics, quantum\r\ncomputation, and many of the most interesting aspects of magnetism at the\r\nmicroscopic scale. In addition to the implications in material science, this\r\nwork will provide new insights in fundamental problems of quantum statistical\r\nmechanics and lead to analytical methods for their solution. The mathematical\r\nmodels of quantum statistical mechanics, though related to problems in partial\r\ndifferential equations, representation theory, spectral theory of operators, \r\nand probability theory, pose new mathematical challenges of their own.  \r\nMany fascinating questions have so far resisted existing analytical and \r\nnumerical methods. The results of this project will contribute to our\r\nunderstanding of the fundamental mathematical structures of quantum mechanical\r\nmodels and, in the long run, may lead to innovations in numerical work\r\non quantum mechanical models, which is increasingly needed in pure and \r\napplied science.\r\n",
