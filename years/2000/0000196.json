 "awd_abstract_narration": "ATM-0000196\r\nKelley, Michael\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator and his graduate students have developed valuable hardware and software tools for the study of the mid-latitude ionosphere.  The hardware tools include a cooled CCD Imager capable of making sequential exposures of five different filtered emissions.  The system can be remotely operated via the Internet and has already provided new insights into the structure of the region, during both quiet and active times, through analysis and interpretation of the airglow data.  Additional software tools facilitate the analysis of GPS data, including validation of methods for determining the absolute TEC from the data stream, as well as data processing and display software, which make comparisons with other data sets much more straightforward.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this renewal proposal is to build on this developed expertise by planning and excuting simultaneous observation campaigns with the Arecibo Radar and with other groups interested in the Caribbean sector for scientific studies, as well as validation of TEC methods, spacecraft instrument calibration and tomographic work.  In addition to the imager and GPS aspects, the PI will assure that Arecibo Radar time is available for the campaigns by writing observing proposals on a timely basis and coordinating the various groups.  In addition, he will take a leadership role in interpreting and publishing the data sets on a timely basis.  During the tenure of this proposal, he will also explore opportunities for short campaigns in other locations for the purpose of solving specific problems or extending the spatial coverage of a particular phenonmenon.\r\n",
