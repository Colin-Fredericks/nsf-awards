Areas of research need to be identified that integrate information technologies and civil infrastructure systems to ensure these systems are designed for the services they provide. This project is a workshop to develop a research agenda for integrating the areas of information technology and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be conducted by the Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems (ICIS) at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. ICIS is a multidisciplinary partnership of four universities that focuses on infrastructure services for communities, users, and infrastructure managers. The workshop will be held in the fall of 2000 over a 2-5 day period. A draft white paper will be prepared to focus the workshop discussion. It will bring together professionals in various fields who will prepare summary papers prior to the workshop. The location will be in Washington, DC in order to maximize attendance by observers from government agencies and organizations that are national to scope. Final results will be disseminated in the form of a paper and electronic report to help shape research agendas that link infrastructure and information technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
