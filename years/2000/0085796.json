 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year funding of a four-year continuing award.  The proportion of elderly in the United States is growing at a phenomenal rate, yet little of today's information technology addresses the critical problems that arise as a result of this demographic shift.  This project will develop advances in IT to address one such challenge, that of enabling the elderly to remain living in their homes for as long as possible.   More specifically, the PI and her team will design and build a personal mobile robotic assistant for the monitoring and guidance of the daily activities of an elderly person.   To achieve that vision research will be conducted to advance the state-of-the-art in several areas of IT, including:   the development of advanced techniques for flexibly reasoning about plans and monitoring their execution;   the development of statistical algorithms for learning models of people's daily activities;   the design and evaluation of self-tailoring multi-modal interfaces that enable elderly people to interact easily with the robotic assistant;   and the development of new sensor modalities to meet the needs of a mobile robot in an elder's home.  The work will be evaluated along three dimensions:  through theoretical and simulation-based evaluations of components, through targeted user studies, and through a series of field tests conducted at regular intervals throughout the project in the homes of elderly people.  The research team is multi-university and interdisciplinary, comprising experts in the fields of computer science, robotics, human-computer interaction, and health care.  The project also includes a strong education focus in that it seeks to provide a unique forum for training undergraduate and graduate students in issues related to IT for the elderly.",
