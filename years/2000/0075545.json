In this model application, enterprises would provide information on their own goods and services as well as have the capability to aggregate information on the environmental performance of the enterprise itself.  Products would have their own information systems to document their manufacture and use.  With communication along the supply chain, the costs, associated information (e.g. repair manuals), and environmental impacts of any particular product could be rapidly assessed.  Virtual product records could be synthesized to help assess alternative supply chains or product designs.  Information would be scalable from individual products, through corporate performance indicators and geographic aggregations of multiple corporations.\r\nEffective supply chain logistics and environmental management systems are among the essential elements for successful scalable and sustainable enterprises.  Logistics and manufacturing support may be of even greater importance in the age of commerce than in earlier marketing eras, as customers demand rapid and reliable order fulfillment.  Environmental management systems are equally necessary as consumers and society demand lower environmental impact from the production of goods and services in order to secure a sustainable future.  It this research, we will investigate distributed models of product information that would allow scalable enterprises, government regulators and consumers to understand the entire life cycle of economic and environmental impacts for particular products.\r\n",
