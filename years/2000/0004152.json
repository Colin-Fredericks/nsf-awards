 "awd_abstract_narration": "The insect neurohormone bursicon is essential for formation of the insect\r\nhard outer cuticle.  Although discovered in 1935, bursicon and its action\r\nhave remained poorly understood. The primary aim of this collaborative project is the\r\ncharacterization of the gene sequence coding for this ubiquitous insect\r\nneurohormone. Degenerate primers derived from several partial amino acid\r\nsequences of cockroach bursicon will be used to amplify bursicon cDNA from\r\nmessenger RNA by reverse transcription and PCR. In addition, existing cDNA\r\nlibraries from other insects will be used for screening with probes derived\r\nfrom PCR.  Knowledge of the full sequence of bursicon will facilitate\r\nidentification of the bursicon active site and its receptor.\r\nBecause insects 'wear' their skeletons on the outside, they must\r\nperiodically shed them as they grow or metamorphose.  During each molt\r\ncycle, new cuticle must be synthesized.  The hormone bursicon, triggers the\r\nhardening of the new cuticle once the old cuticle has been shed.  Cuticular\r\nhardening provides not only protection, but also a framework for muscle\r\nattachment enabling locomotion.  Clearly, interference with bursicon\r\nrelease or its actions will result in the death of the animal.  This\r\ninvestigation will provide a basis for new methods of biological pest\r\nmanagement by disrupting the function of bursicon.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
