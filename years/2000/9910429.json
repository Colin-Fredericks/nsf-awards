Choi, Inha University, Korea.  The proposed research aims to obtain breakthroughs in next generation hard disk drive (HDD) technology by investigating the fundamental mechanism of spreading of thin polymeric disk lubricant films on solid surfaces.  The ultimate goals of this project are to understand the role of lubricants on tribological performance and to establish molecular design criteria for lubricants in HDD systems.   Highlights of the study will include:\r\n\r\nPerforming SME (scanning microellipsometry) measurements while systematically tuning lubricant-surface interactions (lubricant end group functionality with various high- and low-surface energy surfaces),\r\nPerforming rheology and surface energy measurements, and\r\nDeveloping novel theoretical methodologies.\r\n\r\nThis project will be performed in conjunction with Professor Choi's group at Inha University, Korea under the U.S.-Korea International Cooperative Science Program and will enhance the dissertation of PI's graduate student.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
