The simple local structure of manifolds \r\nlends them a very special role in mathematics since phenomena \r\nmodeled on these spaces are amenable to a vast array of \r\nmethods and tools. The study of the structure of manifolds \r\nhas been an important theme in geometric topology for many \r\ndecades.  More recently, spaces called generalized manifolds, \r\nwith the large-scale properties of topological manifolds but \r\nvery intricate local structure, were discovered by the proposers \r\nin joint work with S. Ferry and S. Weinberger. Previously \r\nconjectured not to exist, the first theoretical evidence that \r\nthey might exist appeared in the work of F. Quinn.  This \r\nproject proposes to continue the investigation of the topology \r\nof generalized manifolds. This study is intimately related to \r\nimportant structural properties of manifolds, such as the \r\nconjectural rigidity of aspherical manifolds and the \r\nSiebenmann periodicity phenomenon. Other indications of \r\nthe relevance of these spaces are present in areas as \r\ndiverse as Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory and C-star-algebras.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this project is to probe the local \r\nstructure of generalized manifolds and establish a deeper \r\nparallel between generalized manifolds and topological \r\nmanifolds by showing that these exotic spaces satisfy most \r\nof the fundamental properties of manifolds, such as topological homogeneity, the s-cobordism theorem, and the alpha-approximation theorem. More immediate goals of the proposed investigation \r\ninclude the study of control improvement problems, submanifold \r\nand map transversality questions, normal bundle and embedding \r\nproblems for generalized manifolds. These are elements that \r\narise naturally in the study of the core problems, and they \r\nalso represent important ramifications of independent interest. \r\nThe main technique to be employed is controlled topology, \r\nincluding controlled homotopy theory, controlled K-theory, \r\nand controlled surgery applied to patch representations of \r\ngeneralized manifolds and, ultimately, to generalized manifolds themselves.\r\n\r\n",
