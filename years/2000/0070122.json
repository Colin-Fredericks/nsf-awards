 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project entitled \"Surface Photochemistry and Interfacial Charge Transfer\" will be conducted by Dr. J. Michael White from the University of Texas, Austin and is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.  The research is focused in two areas.  (1)The study of photodissociation dynamics of adsorbed alkyl nitrite species on metals,  and (2) the study of charge transfer reactions of organic systems which function as light emitting diodes (OLEDs).  Dr. White has found that there are 3 pathways associated with the photodissociations.  Each pathway is affected by the surface substrate (metal), the adlayer structure, energy and method of excitation and the presence of coadsorbed species.  The first part of the research program will focus on elucidating the effects and separating the pathways.  The second part of the research program seeks to characterize the structure and electronic properties of adsorbed OLEDs and correlating these properties to luminescent characteristics.  Both of these projects will be carried out using state of the art surface characterization techniques.  Both projects will provide an important and fundamental understanding of photodissociation mechanisms and OLEDs.   \r\n\r\nThe results of this research will have an impact on the area of fundamental photochemistry of adsorbed species on metals and on the understanding of luminescence and how it is affected by structure and electronic properties.  The OLED studies could potentially have a broad impact on the development of new materials and devices.\r\n",
