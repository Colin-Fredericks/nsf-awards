The AMAST goal is the creation of a mathematical methodology for the development of software technology.  It is unique among organizations pursuing computing research by the vision of the field it can offer and by the balance it can provide to trends in the field.  The meeting celebrates past achievements, looks at current trends in using formal methods for software development, and adapts AMAST goals to the new problems raised by current developments.  This project would provide partial support for members of the steering committee, invited speakers, and student attendees.  \r\n\r\n",
