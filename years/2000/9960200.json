 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new interface paradigm, Digital Jigs, that makes 3D precision modeling in an immersive environment practical.  While immersive modeling has proven effective for freeform surface design, precision design has remained elusive to date.  In the proposed Digital Machine Shop, freeform tools such as cutting blades will be snapped to Digital Jigs to constrain their paths much as a carpenter's jigs guide physical tools. This paradigm supports familiar construction strategies rooted in the real world, thus encouraging traditionally non-technical experts to take advantage of digital methods.  To measure the practicality of this approach, test users will be asked to perform a series of precision tasks such as duplicating a variety of precision objects. Results will be evaluated and the system will be enhanced to make it more effective and complete at which time the software will be re-tested.  The results of this research will be a fully integrated freeform and precision modeling environment that is quick to learn and productive in its use. Target application areas are Industrial Design and Automotive Design.\r\n\r\nPotential commercial Applications of the Research include Industrial Design, Automotive Design, Visual Design for Entertainment and the Fine Arts \r\n\r\nKey Words to Identify Research or Technology: Immersion, Modeling, Precision, Interaction, Real-time, Human-Computer Interface, Industrial Design, Automotive Design",
