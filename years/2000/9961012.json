 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)  Phase I project involves the introduction of advanced, automated modeling and verification techniques into the design cycle of reactive systems. The state of the art mandates the extensive use of testing in order to ensure that such systems, which typically function in safety- and business-critical settings, behave correctly.  The key insight underlying the innovation is that many errors, and much of the cost of testing and other design, development and maintenance activities, can be eliminated through the judicious use of rigorous modeling notations based on process algebra, and through model checking to examine the properties of such models.  The project will yield cost-effective techniques for producing reactive systems that are more dependable, cheaper to design, more thoroughly understood, better documented, and easier to maintain than those constructed using current practice.  The ubiquity of reactive systems, and the nation's increasing reliance on them point to the dramatic benefits the innovation will have on society's safety, security and economic well being.  \r\n\r\nThis technology, if successful can be used in the of dependable reactive systems such as the embedded software found in automotive, medical, aeronautical, consumer-electronic and telecommunications applications.\r\n",
