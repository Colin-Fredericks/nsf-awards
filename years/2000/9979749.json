 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal award supports theoretical research in developing a theory for superconducting and normal state properties of cuprates using a spin-fluctuation approach.  This approach is based on fermions interacting via spin fluctuations that are nearly antiferromagnetic, and reduced to a model with three free parameters.  The current goal is to calculate within this model the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, as a function of doping, the forms of the fermionic spectram function, and the dynamical spin susceptibility below Tc.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop the full theory of cuprates based on the spin-fluctuation model.\r\n%%%\r\nThe high Tc superconducting materials start as insulating antiferromagnets before they are doped and transformed into metallic superconductors.  This research award will support continued work by the principal investigator to develop a theory for superconducting and normal state properties of the cuprates based on a spin-fluctuation approach, with the particular model developed under this effort attempting to describe the important materials properties of the cuprates with only three independent parameters.  This research is of critical importance in understanding the mysterious properties of the cuprates, including the appearance of high-temperature superconductivity upon doping.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
