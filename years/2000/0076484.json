 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines links between mating behavior and cautiousness towards predators. Experiments will be conducted on a cricket, Gryllus integer, in which females prefer males with long calls. Cautiousness of females will be measured as the time required to emerge from a shelter when placed in an unfamiliar environment. To measure female mating preferences, a tracking device will measure the speed, distance and angle of movement as the female runs in response to alternative male calls. Mating preferences will be combined with cautiousness scores to examine whether females with stronger mating preferences are either more cautious or more bold than females with weaker mating preferences. To test whether selectivity declines when apparent predation risk increases, females will be tested in the presence and absence of a threatening visual stimulus. Finally, to examine flexibility in female mate choices as perceived predation risk increases, females will be presented with a graded series of visually threatening stimuli. Females are predicted to become less selective in their mate choices as perceived predation risk increases. \r\n\tThe proposed experiments will provide detailed information on the links in individual females between mating behavior and cautiousness. This information is critically important for current models of the evolution of female mating preferences, because it addresses the balance between natural selection and sexual selection. \r\n",
