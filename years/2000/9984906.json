Through advances in information technology, these organizations may leverage existing real-time operations data to evaluate and improve customer service. To this end, this CAREER plan has two primary objectives: (1) to develop analytic methods and modeling tools that exploit real-time data to improve fleet operations and customer information; and, (2) to educate future transportation professionals about the use of information technology in transportation.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER plan is an integrated set of research and educational activities that:\r\n1. Explore current public transit fleet operations, using new technology for data collection and analysis;\r\n2. Develop new analytic methods for real-time fleet management;\r\n3. Explore analytic methods to provide customers with current service information and real-time itineraries;\r\n4. Develop and evaluate teaching materials to interest students in transportation and new technologies; and,\r\n5. Create an internet-based \"collaboratory\" for research and education in fleet operations and information technology.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the proposed research activities lies in the development of new tools and methods to exploit real-time data from transportation operations. These methods are useful to assist in managing fleets at the tactical and operational level and to generate useful and timely customer information. Work in this CAREER plan will expand both the state of knowledge about, and the set of available tools to solve, these transportation problems. The proposed educational activities have significance in developing and providing classroom- and internet-accessible teaching materials to encourage student interest in public transit, transportation systems analysis, and applications of information technology. In this CAREER plan, these materials are developed and evaluated, thereby filling an important gap in existing undergraduate- and graduate-level curricula.\r\n\r\n",
