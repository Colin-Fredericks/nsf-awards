 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Nancy Levinger of Colorado State University is funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on solvation dynamics in micelles.  Solvent molecules inside reverse micelle systems are perturbed by interfacial interactions with the walls of the micelle, and this is a model system for the more complicated environments such as those found in cells and in geological structures.  In this proposal the PI seeks to continue her previous work on these systems using a variety of advanced ultrafast time-resolved methods such as Stokes shift and photon echoes.  Representative micellar systems include ones with varying head groups.  Ultrafast electron transfer processes are also to be probed.  The overall goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the way in which restricted environments inside reverse micelles influence dynamical behavior of the solvent and to understand how this influences chemical reactions.  \r\n\r\nThe results will aid scientists studying reactions and processes in biological and geochemical microenvironments such as soils, rocks and biological cells and organelles where the effect of the solvent is poorly understood.\r\n",
