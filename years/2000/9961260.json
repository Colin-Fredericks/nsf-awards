 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new magnetic position sensing technology that utilizes a novel graded magnetic field and giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor.  The graded magnetic field is produced in a composite film comprising samarium cobalt (SmCo5) nanorods imbedded in an alumina matrix.  High coercivity, high magnetization SmCo5 is desirable so that the sensor may be employed in extreme environments.  The composite is produced using well-known electrochemical techniques.  A GMR read head is used to sense the strength of the magnetic field as a function of the position of the sensor over the graded field.  This arrangement is superior to conventional position sensing devices in that the proposed device may be integrated into a single package along with control and signal processing electronics.   Phase I will investigate the fabrication of the graded magnetic field composite and determine the best conditions under which to produce high coercivity SmCo5 nanorods.  Phase II will continue the development of a monolithic position sensor for automatic test equipment.\r\n\r\nThese high-resolution sensors, that can be readily integrated with silicon based electronics, will be useful in robotics, automated test equipment, and in interactive electronic devices.  Successful implementation of the proposed technology will enable disk drives to be built with data densities exceeding 100 gigabytes per square inch allowing smaller, faster storage systems for portable systems, digital video recording, and digital TV.",
