 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to support approximately 150 travel awards to US mathematicians within six years of receipt of their doctoral degree to attend the special AMS meeting in August, 2000, \"The Mathematical Challenges of the 21st Century,\" to be held on the campus of the University of California at Los Angeles. The program for this meeting includes lectures by thirty world-renowned mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenal advances in mathematical research during the past half-century has involved both the solution of centuries-old celebrated mathematical problems as well as major applications of sophisticated mathematical concepts and tools to the other sciences and in applications. The U.S. mathematical community has played a central role in this development, as has the cadre of brilliant young mathematicians fostered by that community.\r\n\r\nThe turn of the century (and the new millennium) will undoubtedly see an intensification and acceleration of these trends. In particular, developments of the last two decades indicate a deeper and closer relation between research mathematics and other front-line areas in the sciences than was the case in earlier decades. At this point of transition between centuries, it is natural that the vital and diverse community of mathematicians take stock of recent mathematical advancements and look forward to the mathematical themes that will form the core of research developments in the coming century. These travel grants will enable many of the US's young mathematicians to be an integral part of this process.",
