 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe word is as central to human communication as the cell is to biology.  In developing our understanding of how the brain processes words, researchers have relied heavily on tasks that measure the speed of processing words.  These tasks are speeded naming, in which one measures how quickly a person can name a visually presented word aloud, and speeded lexical decision in which people are asked to decide if a letter string is a word or nonword.   Unfortunately, research in this area has been somewhat hindered by the limited amount of data available for word processing in these tasks.  The current project will fill this void.  \r\n\r\n\tThe English Lexicon Project will amass a large set (over 25 million behavioral estimates) of speeded naming and lexical decision responses for 42,000 words across 1200 subjects.  This will be accomplished via the coordination of six testing sites at major research institutions across the country.  These data will be integrated within a larger database that will include estimates of variables (e.g., frequency of occurrence in the language) that have been central to our understanding of how the brain processes words.   A high-speed server will then make this large database available to researchers worldwide via the Internet.  Access and search of this data set will be facilitated by a flexible program, which will provide easy and fast access to any items or sets of items with specified constraints.  \r\n\r\n\tThe audience for the English Lexicon Project will include the following researchers: First, computational modelers will now have a large standardized empirical database to provide tests of their models.  Second, researchers (including those interested in reading educators) interested in effects of specific variables can easily test these in the database.  Third, researchers who use words as their primary stimuli will be able to select better-controlled stimuli.  This later targeted audience will include memory researchers, neuropsychologists, and researchers interested in brain imaging.  Ultimately, the English Lexicon Project will provide the gold standard for our understanding of how the brain processes words.\r\n\r\n",
