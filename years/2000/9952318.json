 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is adapting, implementing, and combining several successful programs in the algebra-based Introductory Physics Laboratories.  The changes are based on the most successful of recent laboratory-based programs: Workshop Physics at Dickinson College, Real Time Physics at the University of Oregon, and Tools for Scientific Thinking at Tufts University. Aspects of other successful programs are also being used as part of the adaptation.  However, its core will be a Real Time Physics approach.  This project is allowing students to use tools for real-time data collection and analysis.  All measurement groups in the laboratory share results via a network, allowing discussions of patterns in the data across multiple groups, as is done in the scientific community.  Since the laboratory experience usually affects all students in the introductory algebra-based physics course every semester, the physics laboratory is becoming one of the most important components of the course.  The Force Concept Inventory or The Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation are being compared against a pre-post gain score with the national sample developed by Hake (1996).  The outcomes will be reported at local and national AAPT meetings, and will be submitted for publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
