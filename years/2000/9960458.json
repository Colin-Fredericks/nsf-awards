 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project examines the potential for in situ characterization of fine particulate matter of combustion products using an innovative elliptically polarized light scattering method. Particle size, size distribution, and morphology are key factors that control the inhalation of air borne particulates. Synergetic Technologies, Inc. can determine these parameters via a unique approach based on customization of polarization settings for fine particulates. Unlike current on-line particle measuring techniques, structures of fibers and irregular shaped particles (such as particle agglomerates) can be determined with reasonable accuracy. The ability to discern such shapes will have a great impact on reliability of source and ambient monitoring efforts. This investigation will assess the feasibility of using the system to monitor particulate exhaust from small engines.  Fundamental research is proposed to closely examine the accuracy of the instrument (comparing results with electron micrographs) for a range of engine test conditions. Phase I will focus on evaluating system capability and accuracy. \r\n      In Phase II, a prototype system will be designed and constructed for measuring motor vehicle exhaust at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation laboratories.\r\n",
