This bioinformatic study will examine sequence variation in proximal promoters of genes involved with metabolic processes, and distinguish \"useful\" variations (i.e. variations associated with adaptation) from random variations that have no functional significance.  Comparisons of microarray analyses of genes expressed in cardiac tissue of different populations of teleost Fundulus, which exhibit different cardiac metabolisms, can identify genes linked to metabolic processes.  In Fundulus, genes whose transcription is altered (increased) by transcription factor SP1 will also be identified by using microarray technology, as these genes are preceded by promoter sequences that bind  SP1.  The subset of genes that are 1. Associated with cardiac metabolism, and 2. Affected by presence and concentration of SP1, will be further examined to determined which variations are adaptive. \r\n",
