 "awd_abstract_narration": "9981744\r\nHenley\r\n\r\nThis grant supports projects in many-body theory and in frustrated \r\nantiferromagnets, all having a geometrical flavor.  Most importantly, \r\na blocking renormalization group for general systems, using a \r\ndensity-matrix truncation, will be tested in one and two dimensions.  \r\nA new method will be developed for reducing quantum Hamiltonians, \r\ndefined for blocks of a lattice, to noninteracting quasiparticles.  Nontrivial \r\ntest models include a one-dimensional model with fractionally-charged\r\nexcitations, and free fermions in two dimensions.  Another many-body\r\nproject will study spinless fermions on the square lattice, with (large)\r\nnearest-neighbor repulsion. Its phase diagram is surprisingly ill understood, \r\nconsidering that it is a sort of toy Hubbard model.  The first step will be \r\nanalytic study of the charged antiphase stripes which seem to form when \r\nthe half-filled system is lightly doped.  Finally, we will continue ongoing \r\nstudies of (1) Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of systems of a few spins \r\n(for large spin S);  (2) the critical state of the quantum dimer model, in \r\nwhich an interface representation yields all the low-energy states; and \r\n(3) dilution disorder which is perfect screened in classical Kagome\r\nantiferromagnets and related magnets.\r\n%%%\r\nWhen the electrons are slowed down by the effects of very strong\r\nelectron-electron interactions, they show anomalous properties.  High\r\nTc superconductors and many other materials of current interest share\r\nthis property.  One part of this project is intended to bridge the gap \r\nexisting between purely theoretical frameworks and numerical simulations \r\nof these properties.  The idea is to explore what is referred to as a density \r\nmatrix renormalization group, limited so far to structures in which the electrons\r\nare confined to move along chains, and generalize it  to the case (relevant \r\nto high-Tc's) in which they move within planes.  The initial exploratory work \r\nwill concentrate on simplified test cases.  A separate project, using other \r\nmethods, is to study a model of electrons with only one kind of spin; it is \r\na simplified case of the Hubbard model of high-Tc materials,  and is \r\nexpected to shed light on the way positive charges arrange themselves into \r\n\"stripes\" in underdoped high Tc's . Finally, we will continue ongoing studies \r\nof magnets (antiferromagnets, to be exact) with \"frustration\", meaning that \r\nthe geometric arrangement of the atomic magnetic moments puts conflicting \r\ndemands on their ordering pattern.  All projects in this grant  involve the \r\napplication of geometry and spatial visualization.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
