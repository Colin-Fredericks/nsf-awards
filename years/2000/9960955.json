 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate major improvement in suction retention for transtibial (TT) prostheses.  True TT suction retention (i.e., intrasocket pressure below ambient) is rare because of sealing difficulty.  Fitting is arduous and expensive; stump volume changes diurnally, during illness and menstruation.  A TT socket that holds suction on donning, may lose it during the day.  The advent of Synergy's Smart Variable Geometry Socket (SVGS), now makes possible maintaining, automatically, a suction seal on the TT stump.  SVGS is simple, robust and relatively inexpensive; it enhances blood circulation and automatically prevents ischemia, protecting a stump with dysfunctional nerves from necrosis.  Project outcomes include greatly improved comfort, stability, sense of security and tissue health.  This project is necessary because TT body weight support is different from TF support, and a proximal, circumferential socket seal is needed.  Dynamic intrasocket pressures, ambulation work, endurance, speed and stability, and the amputee's sense of security will be measured.  Phase II will include broad clinical trials.  There are approximately 165,000 U.S. transtibial (TT) amputees, with 45,000 TT amputations annually.  Suction retention of TT prostheses should become popular with success of this project.  We project $10s millions/year worldwide sales of SVGS/TT socket-liners kits.\r\n",
