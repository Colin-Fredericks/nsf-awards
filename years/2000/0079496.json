 "awd_abstract_narration": "0079496\r\nKatiyar\r\n\r\nThis grant supports the acquisition of a UV microRaman spectrometer at the University of Puerto Rico, San Juan.  The instrument provides means for both fundamental and applied studies in materials where the conventional Raman signal is too weak.  Then, it becomes necessary to use specialized techniques such as near resonance excitation and the possibility of interference enhancement, available in the current instrument along with higher scattering efficiency, higher sensitivity, selectivity and spatial resolution.  The technique will be used to study ferroelectrics, solid state ionics and other wide bandgap materials.  Such a non-destructive technique is also useful for the studies of biological systems.  Thus there will be a direct impact on the studies of biological molecules at the Medical Campus of UPR.  There will be further strengthening of research collaboration with Government laboratories and other universities facilitated by the exchange of data in the range of submicron to nanometer lengthscales in various materials.\r\n\r\nThis grant supports the acquisition by the University of Puerto Rico, a specialized instrument, ultra-violet Raman spectrometer, used to study materials over varying resolutions and with tremendous sensitivity.  The materials will be examined using ultraviolet lasers and will be studied for a broad range of their properties.  The technique can and will also be used to study biological materials.\r\n\r\n",
