 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lead to fast, sensitive, and compound-specific analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in air, water, soil, and sediment. Risk assessment demands chemically-specific analysis because the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential varies widely for PAHs with nearly identical chemical structures. The traditional chromatographic methods (GC or HPLC, often with mass detection) are slow and expensive. Fluorescence is amply sensitive, direct reading, and the data are inherently multi-dimensional. Prior research has shown that cooling Shpol'skii matrix samples to cryogenic temperature, exciting the fluorescence with narrow band tunable laser light, and time-resolved spectroscopy each enhance specificity.  However, technical challenges have prevented the routine utilization of these strategies individually, let alone in combination. This project will demonstrate that benzo[a]pyrene can be quickly analyzed in real-world samples by time-resolved excitation emission matrices acquired for Shpol'skii matrices at 77 K. Technical innovations central to the project are an extremely compact tunable ultraviolet laser, simplification of fluorescence lifetime methodology, and delivering the excitation light directly to the sample by a fiber optic frozen into the matrix. The new procedures and instrumentation will see applications in environmental site characterization and remediation, health research, and fundamental laboratory studies.\r\n\r\nThe initial commercial market is expected to be environmental testing and analytical laboratories. Once the feasibility of the TREEM direct fluorescence analysis is established, expansion to other markets, particularly in the pharmaceutical, agricultural and food industries is expected.\r\n",
