 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Jacobson\r\nAutomated capillary electrophoresis system for the analysis of DNA demands relatively little training to use and involves minimum risk of exposure to radioactive or toxic substances. The automated DNA sequencing and fragment sizing (for analysis of DNA polymorphisms) capabilities of the requested instrument will make investigations more efficient, less expensive and more effective learning tools for students. This is central to the institutional goal of integrating research and education of undergraduates\r\n\r\nFour of the eight faculty in the Biology Department will use the instrument on a regular basis to explore research questions that span the breadth of the discipline. The immediate goals for instrument use are:\r\n- to explore questions relating to the nature of speciation; specifically to develop mitochondrial DNA markers suitable for phylogeographic and population analyses of host races and subspecies of the goldenrod ball-gallmaker; and to generate a DNA sequence-based phylogeny of all extant taxa of Hawaiian tephritid flies.\r\n- to examine the causes of correlated evolution in plant breeding systems, life history and morphology; specifically to use DNA polymorphisms to resolve relationships among populations of Clarkia xantiana, and search for markers that correlate with quantitative trait expression.\r\n- to further elucidate the molecular basis of DNA repair in response to DNA damage in Acinetobacter; specifically to sequence critical genes involved in this process.\r\n- to explore questions relating to community structure of subterranean fungi; specifically to use DNA polymorphisms to quantify genetic variation within and between global populations of desert macrofungi; to continue an ongoing study of the spatial and temporal distribution of variation amongst morel populations; and to explore the spatial distribution of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with bur oak.\r\n\r\nGenetic analyses will be used to answer questions that reflect the respective disciplines of the investigators, namely microbiology, organismal biology, ecology and evolution. An important goal of the anticipated research will be to provide students with authentic experiences that allow them to understand both principles and applications of DNA techniques. The automated sequencing and sizing capabilities of the requested instrument will also facilitate inclusion of exercises involving DNA sequencing and multilocus fingerprinting in upper-level courses currently being developed as part of a new NSF CCLI-funded biology curriculum at Grinnell College.  \r\n",
