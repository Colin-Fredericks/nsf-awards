 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will conduct research to develop a new approach to coating metals continuously and rapidly on large areas of moving substrates.  Currently, these types of coatings are electrochemically plated resulting in higher operating costs due to environmental regulations in the U.S.  This has added to the declining share of the world market for the U.S. electronic metal-coating industry.  Consequently, the Phase I results on the technique have generated interest in the commercial sector and a prototype demonstration is needed for the identified customers.  The proposed method is suitable for coating conductive as well as nonconductive substrates, and rigid as well as flexible substrates.  In this Phase II project, a prototype will be developed for continuously coating nonconductive substrates used in electronic applications.  Then metal coatings will be deposited at a rate better than that of the conventional methods.  Further research will be conducted to meet customer's expectations of the coating quality and process economics.  In addition, process repeatability will be assured by running the equipment for the identified customers. Finally, the coating price will be determined and a cost benefit analysis will be performed.  The proposed method has the potential to reduce operating costs in the intended coating operations substantially.  \r\n\r\nCopper, nickel and other metal coatings are widely plated on nonconductive substrates in several electronic and automotive applications.  Typical application include EMI/RFI shielding in cellular phones, conductor lines in printed wiring boards used in computers and flat panel displays, and decorative trims in automobiles. The method to be developed could provide a lower-cost alternative to the conventional methods in use today and make the US. coating industry more competitive in the international market. \r\n",
