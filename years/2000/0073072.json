Bacteria of several types\r\nare found in some but not other individual aphids sampled from natural\r\npopulations. These bacteria are transmitted from mother to daughter, and\r\nthus--if they affect the host phenotype--are a source of heritable \r\nvariation between aphids. The goal of this research is to assess: (a) the\r\ntransmission of these bacteria, (b) their fitness effects, and (c) their\r\nrole in aphid adaptation. Specifically, this work will measure variation in\r\nthe presence of symbionts across aphid populations, their rate of\r\ntransmission, the heritability of symbiont abundance, and the relationship\r\nbetween symbiont abundance and aphid fitness. A long-term selection\r\nexperiment will be conducted to investigate the role of symbionts in host\r\nplant adaptation.\r\n\r\nAlthough heritable microorganisms are commonly found in insects, their\r\neffects on host fitness are generally unknown. This study will contribute\r\nto understanding the role of such organisms in the biology of aphids, an\r\nimportant insect pest. Additionally, this study is significant and unique\r\nin that it uses the aphid-symbiont community as a model for understanding \r\ninteractions between selection acting at different levels: among aphids\r\nwith different symbiont communities, and among bacteria within individual\r\naphids.\r\n",
