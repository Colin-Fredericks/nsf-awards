 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER grant provides funding for the effort to bridge industry demand and academic research and education programs in the area of computational engineering, in particular the rapid generation and evaluation of design alternatives.  The project aims to provide what industry needs from academia: (1) research on new computational methods that can improve design and analysis processes drastically; and (2) educational programs that will provide students with a rigorous understanding of the underlying theories of modern computational tools.  The proposed research will focus on expanding the theories and applications of a physically-based method of solving the geometric problems that are currently bottlenecks in the design and analysis cycle, such as finite element mesh generation, surface filleting, and parametric design.  The proposed education effort will prepare students to become leaders in the current transformation from drawing-and-calculator-based engineering to computer-integrated engineering.  This educational goal will be achieved by establishing two unique academic programs, an undergraduate minor and an industry-oriented graduate degree in computational engineering.\r\n\r\nThe research proposed should lead to: (1) development of more fundamental theories of the physically-based approach, (2) exploration of other geometric problems in engineering that can be effectively solved by the physically-based approach, and (3) creation of a methodology to unite the physically-based approach with more conventional approaches.  The proposed new academic programs will enhance students' understanding of the underlying theories and methodologies used in modern computational tools.  Because the functionality of these computational tools and the ways they are utilized in industry are changing rapidly and constantly with new research results, the proposed approach to integrating research and education will help foster closer ties between industry and academia.\r\n",
