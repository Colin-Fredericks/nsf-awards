 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on developing efficient techniques for implementing\r\nfault-tolerant distributed systems.  Even though checkpointing and\r\nrollback recovery have been known  techniques for achieving fault-tolerance\r\nin distributed systems, the intricacies involved in designing efficient\r\ncheckpointing and recovery protocols has been thoroughly addressed  and\r\nunderstood only recently.  Based on this theoretical foundation,\r\n(i) it is proposed to develop efficient checkpointing and\r\nrecovery techniques; (ii) implement  a simulation testbed for evaluating\r\nthe performance of the newly developed as well as existing checkpointing\r\nand recovery techniques; (iii) integrate the findings\r\nof our research as well as the existing research work on fault-tolerance in the\r\ngraduate curriculum. The important expected outcomes from this work are:\r\n(i) an improved understanding of the issues involved   in building reliable\r\ndistributed systems; (ii) improved techniques for fault-tolerance in\r\ndistributed systems based on the hard experimental data as well as strong\r\ntheoretical foundation; (iii)  integration of the results of our research\r\nin an advanced course in distributed systems which would  facilitate\r\nthe students not only  understand  the intricacies involved in building\r\nreliable distributed systems but also help them acquire  the necessary\r\ntools and techniques for building such systems. \r\n",
