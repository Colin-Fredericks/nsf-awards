 "awd_abstract_narration": "Young students in the U.S. who are learning qualitative descriptions of natural phenomena exhibit high levels of achievement in mathematics and science, but as the curriculum become more abstract and quantitative, achievement steadily decreases in older students relative to that in other countries as reported in various studies.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Yaros Communications, Inc. addresses these recent trends in science and mathematics performance of U.S. students with a web based educational simulation with which students can INvestigate and QUuantify In REal-time (INQUIRE).  INQUIRE will use complex data of natural phenomena as inputs to a simulation that gives students visualizations related to concrete experiences.  The prototype system will use real time weather data as input to a balloon simulation.  In this way, students can connect the concrete image of a balloon moving through the air to the abstract concepts associated with atmospheric physics.  The INQUIRE system provides a framework for developing other simulations based on any real time data available on the Internet.  The INQUIRE system also contains provisions for students to collaborate or to compete over the Internet.  The Phase I research will develop (1) educational objectives, technical specifications and evaluation content; (2) a prototype object (balloon) simulator; (3) a prototype system to be evaluated by educators; and (4) objectives for additional scenarios and specifications for the final system.\\\r\n\r\nThe primary commercial application for the INQUIRE system will be as an addition to the existing product line of Yaros Communications, including its nationwide Weatherschool project now licensed by more than 70 commercial television stations with more than 800,000 classrooms enrolled.  As a company providing no cost educational materials to classrooms through its partnerships with local television stations and corporate sponsors, the development of this unique real-time INQUIRE science 'engine' for middle schools offers an opportunity for efficient distribution and widespread use.\r\n",
