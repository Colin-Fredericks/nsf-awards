Bray\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to better understand the Penrose\r\nConjecture in General Relativity, which is closely related to the\r\nPositive Mass Theorem.  Both statements can be thought of as\r\nattempts to describe the relationship between the local energy\r\ndensity of a space-time N (whose metric has signature 3,1) and\r\nthe total mass of N.  In physical terms, the Positive Mass\r\nTheorem states that an isolated gravitational system with\r\nnonnegative local energy density must have nonnegative total\r\nenergy.  The idea is that nonnegative energy densities must \"add\r\nup\" to something nonnegative.  The Penrose Conjecture, on the\r\nother hand, states that if an isolated gravitational system with\r\nnonnegative local energy density contains black holes\r\ncontributing a mass m, then the total energy of the system must\r\nbe at least m.  These compelling physical statements translate\r\ninto highly nontrivial geometric statements about asymptotically\r\nflat manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature.  The Positive\r\nMass Theorem was not proven until 1979 by Schoen and Yau, and the\r\nmost general version of the Penrose Conjecture is still open.\r\nThe investigator recently proved the Riemannian Penrose\r\nConjecture, which is the Penrose Conjecture for a 3-dimensional\r\nspace-like hypersurface M of N with zero second fundamental form.\r\nThe proof uses a new approach to the problem (which came out of\r\nresearch supported by the NSF), and the theorem is the strongest\r\nversion of the Penrose Conjecture proved to date.  This research\r\naims to extend these results to prove the most general version of\r\nthe Penrose Conjecture, where the hypersurface M is not required\r\nto have zero second fundamental form.  It is also hoped that\r\nthese new techniques can be used to understand higher dimensional\r\ncases and the behavior of quasi-local mass in General Relativity.\r\n\r\nEinstein's Theory of General Relativity is one of two primary\r\ntheories (along with Quantum Mechanics) thought to best describe\r\nthe laws of physics.  In the long run, it is hoped that a better\r\nunderstanding of the laws of physics will lead to advances which\r\ncould lead to a better standard of living for people.  Already,\r\nfundamental advances in understanding the laws of physics have\r\nmade modern technology possible.  The research in this project\r\ngoes to the heart of the behavior of matter in General Relativity\r\nand attempts to answer fundamental questions about the additivity\r\nof energy and momentum in space-time.  Even so, achieving these\r\ngoals would only represent a small step forward in understanding\r\nthe implications and intricacies of General Relativity\r\n",
