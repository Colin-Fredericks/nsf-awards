 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research program is to develop a broad conceptual\r\nunderstanding of geometric analysis on manifolds which takes as its\r\nparadigm the role of sharp inequalities in Fourier analysis on the\r\nmanifold as encoding geometric information about intrinsic invariants,\r\nsymmetries and the underlying geometric structure of the manifold. Our \r\ndirect focus is to obtain new and sharper results on isoperimetric\r\ninequalities, critical Sobolev embedding, log Sobolev and Levy-Gromov\r\nfunctionals, and multilinear fractional integrals that incorporate the\r\nframework of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, Stein-Weiss\r\nintegrals, Birman-Schwinger kernels and Riesz potentials, especially in\r\nthe setting of Lie groups, symmetric spaces, complex manifolds and affine\r\ngeometry including hyperbolic space, SL(2,R) and the Heisenberg group.\r\nSharp embedding estimates are a critical tool to establish existence and\r\nregularity for solutions to pde's, and to control oscillatory behavior on \r\na manifold. This program reflects a natural interplay and stimulus with\r\nproblems in conformal deformation, fluid dynamics, geometric probability,\r\nstatistical mechanics, string theory and turbulence. Computational methods\r\nare essential tools to obtain a clearer understanding of the complexity of\r\nthe geometric symmetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nMathematical models that characterize physical phenomena and the analysis\r\nof differential equations that describe dynamical processes require a rich\r\nand diverse analytic framework. Scientists say that \"mathematical laws\r\nunderpin the fabric of our universe.\" The aim of this research program is \r\nto develop a supporting mathematical structure that helps us to understand \r\nrelations that connect uncertainty, entropy and disorder, geometric symmetry, \r\nrenormalization and scaling arguments, non-homogeneity of space-time models, \r\nisoperimetric comparison between surface area and volume, and the fine detail \r\nof hyperbolic geometry. We want to obtain broad and rigorous understanding of\r\nmathematical tools that support a quantitative description of the fundamental\r\nlaws of nature, and to develop and explore mathematical structures that model\r\nphysical phenomena ranging from fluid dynamics to string theory, especially\r\nby using patterns of symmetry and intrinsic constants that encode geometric\r\ninformation about the underlying theoretical framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
