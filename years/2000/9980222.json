The extent to which doping with foreign atoms can be used to affect cluster behavior will been explored.  The formation of chemically modified surface clusters will be examined on the atomic level, in order to devise methods for introducing chemically different atoms into well-defined locations in a cluster of known structure.  Through the use of the field ion microscope, which can reveal the location and behavior of individual atoms, metal clusters will be assembled on iridium (111), a model surface for which considerable background information is already available.  Clusters will be constructed with well characterized defects in them.  There after, foreign atoms, such as rhenium or tungsten, will be deposited on the surface and their incorporation into the cluster will be followed in atomic detail.  Attempts will also be made to grow doped clusters by first depositing chemically different atoms and then allowing them to assemble into a cluster.  Once reasonable techniques for chemical modification have evolved, the effect of chemical doping on cluster behavior will be explored, with the initial emphasis on how the presence of a foreign atom affects the diffusion characteristics of clusters.\r\n\r\nMetal clusters formed on solids play an important role in chemical technology as catalysts for chemical reactions.  More recently, their importance in affecting the growth of crystals and films has also been recognized, and as a result of studies on the atomic level, it is now clear that these clusters constitute interesting chemical entities whose properties are strongly affected by the overall atomic arrangement.  This area is of high importance to industry.  There are good job opportunities for students trained in this integrated area of education and research.\r\n",
