Conveners, Atma Sahu, Coppin State College and H.G. Sharma, University of Roorkee will assemble 30 U.S. and Indian researchers for a cross-disciplinary workshop focused on vibrations and smart structures.  These areas are of high interest in the U.S. for industry and government applications and for the engineering of advanced technical systems.  There are important applications for general engineering reliability and durability problems, as well as for specific applications related to the modification of buildings for improved earthquake survivability and improved understanding of basic vibration mechanics. \r\n\r\nScope:  The University of Roorkee is hosting this workshop with funds obtained from the Department of Science and Technology (DST).  The principals will layout a well-developed plan for future cooperative research in the areas of elastic vibrations and smart structures.  They will also establish partnerships for collaborations with India's oldest and most prestigious engineering college.  The workshop is expected to stimulate advanced research in areas that are of mutual interest and benefit.   The proceedings of the workshop will be published.      \r\n\r\n",
