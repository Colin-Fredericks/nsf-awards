To quantify predation, we will use traces (such as drill holes) left by predators on shells of their brachiopod prey using a three-pronged approach. First, illustrations in paleontological monographs will be surveyed for traces of predation. Second, selected museum collections will be screened for predation traces and the data acquired will be analyzed using multivariate statistics and morphometric methods. Third, additional data on diversity, taxonomy, and abundance of prey and their predators will be obtained from the paleontological literature. The specific objectives of this portion of the project are to quantify temporal and spatial patterns in (1) drilling predation; (2) shell-crushing predation; (3) diversity, taxonomy, and abundance of benthic predators; (4) defensive morphological traits developed in the shells of brachiopods; (5) predation traces on other potential prey.\r\n\tThe quantified patterns will be used to evaluate the role and history of predation in Paleozoic marine ecosystems. We will also assess the hypothesis of escalation for the Paleozoic prey-predator system and the exact timing and importance of the mid-Paleozoic marine revolution. Causal mechanisms for brachiopod-predator interactions in the Paleozoic will be explored as well. This comprehensive insight into the history of predation in the Paleozoic will offer complimentary data to those obtained previously in extensive studies of the younger (Cretaceous-Cenozoic) fossil record of predation. The ultimate goal of this project is to assess the long-term importance of predation in controlling the evolution and ecology of marine biota.\r\n",
