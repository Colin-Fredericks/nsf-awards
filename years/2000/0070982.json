 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides retraining workshops to deaf and hard-of-hearing adults in the information technology (IT) field, clusters these workshops into a certificate program, and modifies the workshops into undergraduate courses. A critical national need exists for individuals trained in IT and for constant upgrading of their skills. Deaf and hard-of-hearing IT professionals have difficulty in obtaining training and skills development that meets their communication and learning style needs, even with an interpreter.\r\n\r\nThe sponsoring institution is a two-year technical college for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. It was established to reverse the long history of underemployment \r\nand unemployment among our nation's deaf and hard-of-hearing citizens. The project provides funds for professional development for the entire faculty. This time is used to enhance IT skills, develop curricula and offer IT workshops to deaf and hard-of-hearing adults already in the national workforce or preparing for IT employment. The project establishes a new computer laboratory to support workshop activities, and to allow faculty to incorporate new information technology material into the full-time undergraduate curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
