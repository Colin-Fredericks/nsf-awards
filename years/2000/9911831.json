The prototype will include sample lessons adapted from these curriculum materials to provide models for teachers.  The materials will also help professional development providers assist mathematics and special education teachers in working together to improve instruction for students with the targeted disabilities.  The professional development materials will support teacher professional development activities across an entire school year, with mathematics and special education teachers meeting together in study groups approximately once a month.  Teachers will learn about the principles of universal design for learning and then complete \"design experiments\" in which they will apply these principles to adapt instruction to account for the targeted disabilities.  The professional development materials to be developed in this project will address requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 1997.  The materials will be piloted in several school districts in the Boston area and will be evaluated through analysis of teachers' design experiments, self-reports, and action plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
