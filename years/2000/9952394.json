 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nThis project is enhancing student understanding of physiological and biological phenomena by incorporating inquiry-based laboratories using computerized data acquisition systems into introductory anatomy and physiology courses.  The collaborating institutions, California State University at Sacramento and Cosumnes River College, are adapting laboratories exercises previously developed at Yuba College and Pasadena City College, which have been shown to be effective at increasing students' ability to explore complex physiological relationships and enhance students' appreciation of scientific processes.  Student-friendly data acquisition systems ease data collection and improve student understanding of physiological processes through critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. This is increasing the number of introductory students who view science as accessible, valuable, interesting and applicable to their everyday lives, and who have confidence in their ability to use modern technology. Because these courses have large numbers of students underrepresented in the science and technology workforce (women, working parents, and underrepresented minorities) this project is specifically improving their preparation for entering careers in science and technology. Through the collaborative development of pedagogical expectations, we are easing the transition of students transferring from community colleges to CSUS and invigorating faculty by providing opportunities for collaborative curricular development. The outcomes of this project include implementation of new lab exercises and increased student success, demonstrated by improved student performance and enthusiasm for science, and increased transfer rates of CRC students to 4-year institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
