The overall objective of the research component is the generation of learning tools that demonstrate how to analyze numerical algorithms for parallel processing for two important and realistic classes of engineering problems involving free and moving boundaries. Course modules enable students to easily and proficiently engage in high-performance parallel computing. A variety of software helps students analyze and understand execution behavior including problem partitioning, module communication patterns, processor load balancing, computation versus communication ratios, timing characteristics, and processor idle time. Specifically, the modules demonstrate the use of the computing diagnostic software applied to typical runs on a parallel computer for fixed and free and moving boundary value problems. The transfer of this research into the undergraduate curriculum enhances students' understanding of the capabilities of parallel computers for solving difficult engineering problems and enhances the computational infrastructure in engineering and other areas.\r\n",
