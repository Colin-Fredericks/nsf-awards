In this work the PIs will continue the investigation of their discovery that elemental cesium catalyzes the conversion of non-graphitizing porous carbon and carbon fibers to forms such as intercalated graphite and tubular, nested polyhedral structures.  One objective of the proposal is to understand the reaction through kinetic measurements and electronic structure calculations on model systems.  A second objective is to extend this process to other alkali metal catalysts and other forms of carbon.  A combination of ultra high vacuum studies and ex situ techniques is proposed; these studies may suggest other routes to carbon ordering.  If electron transport is responsible for the transformation, processing with low-energy electrons may provide a similar structural enhancement.  The near-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments are intended to provide the needed insights into the siting of cesium in the structures.  The materials to be studied, nanostructured carbons, offer potential applications in a wide range of areas.  A low temperature route to such materials would represent a major accomplishment of great potential significance.  A selective, controllable route to produce nanotubes might make their widespread application feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
