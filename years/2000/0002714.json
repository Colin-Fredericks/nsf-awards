Aburaddad will examine the processes of meson photo and electroproduction from nucleons and nuclei using fully relativistic formalisms whether in the elementary process or in the nuclear structure.  Computational methods will be used to explore the complex the elementary processes of meson photo and electroproduction from free nucleons.  These processes are highly complex, and their study is experimentally challenging but theoretically rewarding.   At a technical level, this work will address the nature of fundamental forces joining subatomic particles, and of several astrophysical processes such as supernova explosions and neutron star structure. \r\n\r\nThis award supports a two-year Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Laith J. Aburaddad at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) at Osaka University, Japan.  Aburaddad will work with Professor Hiroshi Toki, Chairman of the Nuclear Theory Group, on a project entitled, \"Collaborative Studies on Meson Photo and Electroproduction from Nuclei.\"  The computational studies in the proposed project will contribute to an understanding of the nature of fundamental forces joining subatomic particles, and of several astrophysical processes such as supernova explosions and neutron star structure.  Useful contributions to the field are likely, and the exposure of the awardee to a new research setting will be intellectually stimulating.  The proposed work will benefit through collaboration with the Japanese host laboratory, where Aburaddad will have access to the necessary experimental systems, equipment and expertise.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
