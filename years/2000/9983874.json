 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most models used in engineering are prone to errors: poor measurement of physical\r\nparameters, complexity of phenomena at hand making \"exact\" models too hard to handle,\r\netc. These uncertainties are now an important limiting factor in the use of optimization,\r\nwhich by nature tends to finely tune solutions to problem data.\r\nI propose a general framework for decision problems with uncertainty, based on a robust\r\noptimization approach. In this framework, uncertainty on problem data is treated as \r\ndeterministic, unknown-but-bounded. A robust solution is one which tolerates changes in the\r\nproblem data, up to the given bound. Such a solution is too hard to compute in general, but\r\nrelaxation techniques based on convex optimization can be devised to approximate the \r\nproblem in an exhaustive manner. An efficient trade-off between computer effort and accuracy\r\nis obtained by finely exploiting the uncertainty structure in the relaxation process.\r\nThe idea of robustness is well-known in the area of feedback control systems analysis\r\nand design, where I and others have developed very effective relaxation methods based on\r\nLinear Matrix Inequalities and related convex optimization. Obviously, robust optimization \r\nis relevant far beyond feedback control, for example to the combinatorial optimization\r\nproblems with uncertain data arising in communications network design. This opens new\r\navenues of research where seemingly very different problems are analyzed and solved in a\r\nunified framework.\r\nMy proposal centers around theory and algorithms for robust optimization: convex \r\noptmization relaxations, large-scale problems, accuracy/complexity trade-offs, software. A\r\nspecific target of this research is the development ofvarious ellipsoidal approximation tools,\r\nwith applications to data fitting and estimation, simulation, and control of systems with\r\nstructured uncertainty. In addition, I seek to apply these techniques to several important\r\ndesign problems in engineering, including timing analysis of RC circuits,  filter and antenna\r\narray design, communications network design, and others.\r\nIn addition to robust optimization tools and engineering applications, I plan to study sev-\r\neral important problems in finance and management under the viewpoint of robustness and\r\nworst-case risk-notions that begin to stir great interest in the community. I intend to develop fast and efficient robust optimization tools that are specific to finance and management\r\nissues, based on ellipsoidal techniques for worst-case simulation and control.\r\nMy education plans aims at providing a solid theoretical and practical basis for our\r\nstudents in the area of optimization, emphasizing the crucial issues of uncertainty and \r\nrobustness. This goal will be implemented by course development intwo subjects: an advanced\r\ncourse in robust optimization, and a basic graduate course in convex optimization. An \r\nimportant aspect of this plan is the development of user-friendly robust optimization software\r\ntools that complement those I have developed in the past for convex optimization.\r\n",
