 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The objective of this project is to produce an interrelated collection of easy-to-use and ready-to-go materials for the topics and concepts in magnetism that can be used as classroom materials, web assignments, or homework assignments. In addition, tools for pre/post assessment in the same area are being developed. These materials are employing TIPERs (Tasks Inspired by Physics Education Research) and are designed to be easy to incorporate, in part (or in whole), into existing courses and teaching styles. They are based on the efforts and recent developments in physics education research and are focused on developing materials in magnetism. This material development project envisions the incremental development over a period of years of a collection of related materials in a variety of new formats in targeted areas that are being classroom-tested and are leading to a large, full scale materials development project. The first stage targeted the area of electrically charged objects, static electric fields, and electric potential. This second stage is expected to be followed by several other stages focusing on thermodynamics, waves, optics, and modem physics. This project is a collaboration between two-year college and university physics professors who have worked together in the past. These materials are being classroom tested at several different institutions and are being made available in both print and electronic versions. This project facilitates the incorporation and application of the results of physics education research into classrooms and thus improve the learning of physics by students at post-secondary education institutions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
