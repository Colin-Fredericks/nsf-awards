 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the development of a powerful method for real space surface crystallography of technologically important semiconductor surfaces.  Combining experimental measurements of scattered ion angular distributions with careful ion trajectory simulations, Professor J. Wayne  Rabalais and his group at the University of Houston have developed a unique surface structural tool.  This tool is applied to the determination of the structure of compound semiconductor surfaces, and to surfaces terminated by hydrogen, where other structural tools are ineffective.  The understanding obtained from these studies provides important information for the design of semiconductor devices and processing conditions.  \r\n\r\nIn order to utilize semiconductor materials in modern electronic devices, detailed knowledge of the surface structure of the material is essential.  This research project, being carried out at the University of Houston with support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program, is focussed on the development of ion scattering methods which can provide this information accurately.  By combining measurements of scattered ion angular distributions with the computed trajectories expected for particular surface structures, detailed structural information becomes available.  This information can then be applied to the design of semiconductor devices and processes. \r\n",
