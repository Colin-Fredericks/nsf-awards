 "awd_abstract_narration": "0079483\r\nFarkas\r\nThe applicant proposes to develop unique optical bioimaging capabilities, based on combining some of the most modern current methods in use:  confocal and multiphoton-excitation microscopy, spectral imaging, and optical coherence tomography.  The most important feature consists in integrating these (on the same workstation to investigate the same specimen), to yield complementary and, hopefully, synergetic information.  The workstation resulting from such integration will constitute the centerpiece of a facility, located at the University of Pittsburgh but serving as a regional resource.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is based on the demonstrated advances in physical, chemical, biological and engineering research that can be attained by adding imaging to the arsenal of investigative tools, and the acute need for new approaches to this task.  The concept consists in extending what has been learned by the PI and his collaborators during the past decade in an NSF national center (CLMIB, Center for Light Microscope Imagining and Biotechnology at Carnegie Mellon University) predicated to the advancement of microscopic bioimaging.  This will be achieved by developing new methods that have been assessed as necessary for advancing optical bioimaging applications.  Combining instrument development with newly acquired state-of-the-art commercial devices and the experience gained from past efforts should result in new and relevant capabilities.  It is likely that these improved capabilities will yield new insights, superior quantitation and better interfacing with other methods of study.\r\n\r\nThe new funding requested is for development of a novel optical imaging station combining multiphoton excitation 3-D fluorescence measurements (in cells, tissues and in vivo) with optical coherence tomography and spectral imaging.  This will be coordinated and augmented via new image processing approaches:  remote access will also be implemented by telemicroscopy.  The focal point of these developments is a special (and expensive) laser system, capable of both the high intensity, short duration (~fs-ps) near-infrared pulses needed for non-linear excitation, and the broadband output needed for high resolution OCT; additional, patented acousto-optic tunable filters technology will be applied to allow for versatile wavelength and timing selection in these experiments.  Expected new capabilities include sub-millisecond spectral shifting, luminescence lifetime and anisotropy measurements, sub-cellular resolution optical coherence microscopy and spectral confocal and 2-photon imaging.  Targeted application areas range from testing new dye chemistry and cell membrane fluidity to imaging nerve impulse propagation and minimally invasive sensor placement in vivo.\r\n",
