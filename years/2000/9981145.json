 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) The major objective of this project is to improve student learning in an introductory biology course for non SMET (Science, Math, Engineering and Technology) majors at Arkansas State University (ASU) by including problem-based (PBL) and collaborative learning experiences. All ASU undergraduates are required to complete two lab science courses as part of their general education requirement. Biological Science and Laboratory is a preferred option for freshman and has an annual enrollment of about 1500 students in 50 sections. The laboratory currently follows a traditional introductory model that is instructor-centered, with students individually responsible for completing a set of discrete lab activities that correspond to lecture topics taught by multiple instructors in multiple sections. Our course evaluation data show that the desired student outcomes including (1) retaining appropriate content by the non SMET student, (2) developing informed decision making skills about scientific issues, (3) enhancing critical thinking skills, and (4) familiarizing students with education enhancing technologies are not satisfactorily met using present pedagogical techniques. Considerable evidence from other institutions indicates that using collaborative, Problem Based Learning to introduce content in the context of complex real-world problems, and group learning can produce these desired outcomes. However, restructuring this course requires training instructors in techniques for facilitating PBL and collaborative learning as well as the development and adaptation of laboratory exercises so that students have opportunities to learn basic biological principles through discovery. To accomplish this, two adjoining classrooms are being equipped with 12 workstations allowing simultaneous data accumulation, data analysis, information acquisition, and reporting by 12 student workgroups. When fully implemented these changes will affect about 15,000 students within five years. The results of the laboratory experience are being evaluated to verify that student understanding of science processes and retention of biology content is improved. The effort is built upon and will be an adaptation of descriptions of Problem-based and collaborative learning in the science education literature.",
