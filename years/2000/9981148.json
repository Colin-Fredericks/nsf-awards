 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) This project is adapting web-based learning materials developed at the University of Colorado and elsewhere to re-design an inquiry-based, two-semester introductory astronomy sequence for approximately 1,100 undergraduates each semester. Many students who take this course are not effectively engaged by the current lecture format. Lectures are replaced with peer instruction, interactive learning environments, and asynchronous learning opportunities enabled by the WWW. In addition to the usual goals of such a course, the goals of the two-year project are to: (1) familiarize students with the use of computers for elementary analysis and for exploration on the world-wide web; (2) facilitate active and cooperative learning through computer technology; (3) realize opportunities to reduce costs of delivery of such courses through technology; (4) contribute to the development of a national resource for teaching elementary astronomy. The project is also offering courses aimed at training prospective and in-service teachers in the use of web-based technology for K-12 science education.\r\n\r\nThe project's success in achieving these goals is being measured through comparison with sections taught in traditional formats. Description of the project and dissemination if results is being done through a web site, presentations at national meetings, and publications in appropriate journals.\r\n\r\n",
