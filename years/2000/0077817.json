 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe presence of abundant repetitive sequences is among the most conspicuous\r\ncharacteristics of eukaryotic genomes.  Since most repetitive elements have no obvious genetic functions, they are often regarded as 'selfish' or 'junk' DNA.  However, it has become increasingly evident that these sequences could play important roles in regulating gene expression.  For example, the yeast telomeric repeats have been shown to regulate gene expression.  It has been proposed that gene silencing in yeast is mediated by the telomeric heterochromatin that behaves as subnuclear organelles to store transcription factors and modulate their nuclear concentration.  The overall objective of this research program is to elucidate the function of abundant repetitive sequences in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster.  Approximately 30% of this fruitfly's genome is composed of constitutive heterochromatin, which contains highly repetitive sequences.  The Drosophila Y chromosome is entirely heterochromatic and accounts for approximately 13% of a male genome.  Despite its large physical size, this chromosome carries only six genes that are mutable to male sterility.  Recent analysis has revealed that the Y chromosome carries a trans-activator that regulates transcription the male germ line.  The Y trans-activator is distributed within a distinct region on the Y long arm and is functionally redundant, suggesting the involvement of heterochromatic repetitive sequences.  In addition, the trans-activator is correlated with genetic factors that are dispersed within the same Y long region and are essential for sperm development.  These results indicate that the Y trans-activator plays an important role in spermatogenesis.  Further genetic and molecular studies have demonstrated that the Y trans-activator interacts with a genetic pathway that controls transcription in primary spermatocytes.  In addition, the analysis has identified two potential target genes of the Y trans-activator, the hsp26 and hsp60ms genes, both of which are required for spermatogenesis.  This project has three general goals: (1) The transcriptional regulation of the Y trans-activator on the hsp26 and hsp60ms genes will be investigated.  Studies of the hsp function will be extended to reveal the effects of the Y transactivator in spermatogenesis.  (2) The hypothesis that the Y trans-activator interacts with a branch of a pathway that regulates transcription in spermatogenesis will be tested and it will be determined whether the Y trans-activator controls spermatogenesis by regulating a specific set of genes required for spermatid individualization.  (3)  Reporter genes to identify the hsp26 regulatory sequence that is controlled by the Y trans-activator will be generated.  Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to precisely define this cis-element.\r\n\r\nResults from thisresearch will provide important information about function of the heterocromatic Drosophila Y chromosome.  Furthermore, knowing how Drosophila heterochromatin plays an essential role will help to better understand the biological significance of all heterochromatin, which is a large, yet poorly understood, genomic component in nearly all eukaryotic organisms.\r\n",
