 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address in-line treatment for functionalization of commercial substrate surfaces.  The proposed treatment will consist of an appropriate combination of vacuum plasma treatment, atmospheric plasma treatment, and/or acrylate coating.  It is expected to functionalize the surface of commercial substrates such as packaging films, labeling sheet, paper webs, and Teflon(tm) sheet to readily accept and bond with solventless printing inks, thus reducing the need for\r\nsolvent-based inks.  The EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) for 1995 shows that 1.224 billion pounds of organic solvents were released into the atmosphere over this country in 1995. The number 3 chemical (146 million pounds) contributing to TRI air emissions for 1995 was toluene, a major constituent of printing ink formulations.  Regulatory and community pressure to reduce the use of solvent-based inks as a pollution prevention measure is already a significant driving force and will only intensify in the future.  Proof-of-concept has been achieved in Phase I.  Sigma Technologies has indeed been able to alter the surface functionality of a variety of commercial substrates to the extent that water-based ink formulations will adhere well to the functionalized surfaces without sacrifice of ink deposit quality.\r\n\r\nSeveral major players in the packaging film and related industries are very interested in our progress in the area of interface functionalization.  They are under pressure from the USEPA to reduce their use of solvent-based inks and are operating in a highly competitive, often narrow margin, business venue.  They are watching us closely and at least two of these clients will participate in the proposed Phase II effort by providing in-kind matching funds expenditures to provide inking runs on treated substrates and to help us\r\nevaluate ink deposit quality.  If we are able to maintain this high level of interest through the Phase II effort we are confident that firm orders for equipment and process development for Sigma Technologies will result.\r\n",
