The proposed collaboration aims to conduct accurate stress analysis of fiber-reinforced composite materials with delamination cracks.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to investigate the failure mechanisms of fibrous composites both at the micro-level and at the laminate level.  The PI proposes to develop new algorithms by generating the Method of Auxiliary Mappings, which the PI developed previously together with I. Babuska.   Since fibrous composites are heavily used for components in a wide variety of industries, investigating the mechanisms for their failure is an important activity, which extends well beyond the basic research questions arising in the approximation of singularities occurring in mathematical models involving partial differential equations. The proposal suggests an interdisciplinary activity between efficient numerical analysis and mechanics of fibrous composites.  \r\n\r\nThis project will be performed in conjunction with Dr. Lee's group at Korea under the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program and will enhance the international experiences for the PI's U.S. graduate student.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.\r\n",
