The meeting has a theme of volcanic hazard mitigation, and the attendance of US volcanology students will help stimulate continued international collaborative research on volcanology, and to develop more interactions among US volcanology programs.  Selection of the students will be done from applications by an AGU committee.  Students selected must be enrolled in a US university and doing active research in volcanology as evidenced by a submitted abstract to the IAVCEI meeting in Bali.  As part of the experience, students will also participate in field trips to at least two other active volcanoes in the Philippines and Hawaii.\t \r\n",
