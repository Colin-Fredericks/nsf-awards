 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nPaulsen/Blecher/Papadakis\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigators propose several main lines of research on\r\ntopics related to the theory and applications of operator algebras,\r\noperator spaces, and frames. Blecher will be studying the general\r\ntheory of operator algebras and modules over operator algebras,\r\nHilbert C*-modules, and questions relating to noncommutative Choquet\r\ntheory. Paulsen will continue to study injective operator spaces and\r\nmodules, the weak expectation property, function theoretic operator\r\ntheory, interpolation theory from an operator algebra point of view.\r\nWith Papadakis he will also be studying and frames and reconstructions\r\nwith a view to applying reproducing kernel Hilbert space methods and\r\nsymmetric orthogonalization results.\r\n\r\nThe study of operator algebras originally grew out of quantum mechanics.\r\nIt is often important to see how formulas involving numerical variables\r\nbehave when these variables are allowed to be operator variables. It is\r\nout of such a process that the theory of operator spaces and completely\r\nbounded maps emerged. Blecher and Paulsen's research focuses mainly on\r\nquestions of how various theories behave under this `quantization'.\r\nOn the other hand, interpolation theory started as a purely mathematical\r\nexercise, and only in the past 20 years has it been found to have\r\nimportant applications in engineering. For example, in electrical circuit\r\ndesign, one starts with a desired frequency response, for a few given\r\nfrequencies, and wishes to design the simplest circuit with that given\r\nresponse. Mathematically, this problem becomes one of finding the\r\nsimplest function of a given type that achieves certain given values at\r\ngiven points. This last problem is what we call an interpolation problem.\r\nAlready the demands of electrical engineering take us beyond the known\r\ninterpolation theories. Surprisingly, interpolation theory and the study\r\nof operator algebras is interwoven, and this interplay has lead to some\r\nnew interpolation results. We have found that a better understanding of\r\nthe \"quantized\", i.e., matrix-valued, interpolation is what is needed\r\nto answer many ordinary interpolation questions.\r\nFrame theory can be applied to the study of how we extract information\r\nout of streams of data, and how we reconstruct the original data from\r\nthe derived information. A typical example of a situation where this\r\narises is the CAT scan, where from a large quantity of data, one is\r\ntrying to reconstruct a picture of the inside of a body. Our work is\r\nnot focused on particular examples, but on how one analyzes how \"good\"\r\nis a particular frame.\r\n",
