 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop a novel class of computer interfaces centered on a vision-based interaction paradigm, and human augmentation using a range of panoramic sensors and intelligent controllers to provide assistive technology to disabled users.   The goal of such interfaces is to enable people with physical disabilities such as impaired limbs, paralysis, or tremors to overcome difficulties associated with accessing computers and products with embedded computers such as wheelchairs, household and office electronic equipment, and robotic aids with traditional input devices.  The goal is to create the framework, architecture, scientific algorithms, and augmentative hardware and software to facilitate (a) interaction; (b) control and tasking; and (c) programming of computers and computer-controlled smart devices.  There are two main sets of research problems that need to be solved: (a) the development of novel, flexible, portable, adaptable interfaces that allow users with physical disabilities to interact with computers and computer controlled devices by touching and feeling; and (b) human augmentation via a combination of inexpensive sensors and controllers, along with a set of algorithms and software for computer mediated control.  This research will result in the next generation of interfaces for users to interact with computers and robot assistants, and more generally, devices with embedded controllers.  Although the immediate goal is to develop the basic framework, methods, and algorithms using the smart wheelchair as a test product, the basic ideas will be applicable to a wider range of products.",
