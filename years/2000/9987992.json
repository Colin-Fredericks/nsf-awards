The students are recruited from all over the country to conduct reserch with faculty and research scientists at the Center.  The research projects involve applying the unique capabilities of intense, ultrashort laser pulses to problems in engineering, physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, and medicine.  The students receive initial training in laser safety and machine shop techniques.  They meet regularly with their research mentors and the PI to discuss research porgress and such matters as ethics and the process of applying to graduate school.  A number of social activities are planned, which include picnics and a trip to the Greenfield village Museum in Dearborn.  At the end of the program the students present their research results in a seminar as well as in a written report.  The REU scholars are paid a stipend of $3300 and are provided a housing allowance as well as a reasonable amount for travel expenses.",
