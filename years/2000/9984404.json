 "awd_abstract_narration": "There have been substantial developments in computational methods\r\nand capabilities for material sciences applications. These include\r\nthe theory and practice of material point methods (MPM), multiple\r\ntemporal and spatial scale methods, domain decomposition  methods,\r\ntogether with increases in memory capacities, processing rates, and\r\nsoftware capabilities for distributed computing. We will develop\r\nand combine these methods and capabilities in a Multi-Level\r\nMulti-Material Problem Solver Environment (MLMM PSE).  The MLMM PSE\r\nwill target applications such as crack propagation, granular materials,\r\nimpact problems, fragmentation, damages among others. We will\r\ndemonstrate the PSE for a novel and important engineering application\r\nin semisolid materials.\r\nThe complexity inherent in this combination demands a computational\r\nframework that provides broad-based infrastructure. As a\r\n{\\it computational aim} of this project we will construct this\r\ninfrastructure in the MLMM PSE for material sciences applications.\r\nWe will create effective computational modules  and interfaces that\r\nwill be necessary to build  the MLMM PSE. These modules will be\r\nintegrated with parallel AMR and nonlinear solvers libraries, which\r\nwill facilitate code development, efficiency, load balancing and\r\nportability on a variety of parallel platforms and will support\r\nvisualization capabilities. As a {\\it theoretical aim}, we will design,\r\nanalyze, and develop innovative numerical methods to enhance accuracy,\r\nefficiency, scalability and robustness of the MLMM PSE. We will\r\ninvestigate hierarchical simulation involving explicit and implicit\r\ntime dependent adaptive grid and particle refinement. This important\r\nand novel area presents considerable mathematical and computational\r\nchallenges. As an {\\it educational aim}, we will develop with\r\nundergraduate students web-based MLMM PSE courseware that illustrates\r\nthe computational solution of problems that have arisen in our research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
