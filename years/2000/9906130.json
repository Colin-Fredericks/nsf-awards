 "awd_abstract_narration": "An increasing amount of educational material is being placed on the Internet. University instructors commonly distribute course assignments, syllabi, and other course-related information on the World Wide Web (WWW).  This practice makes the material accessible to sighted students, but it may be an impediment to visually impaired students unless the material is universally accessible.  The basic premise of universal accessibility of instructional materials is that a curriculum should include alternatives to ensure that it is accessible and applicable to students and teachers with different backgrounds, learning styles, abilities, and disabilities in widely varied learning contexts.  In spite of recent initiatives such as the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C WAI) and availability of improved software tools such as screen readers used by blind computer users, many problems remain with respect to universal accessibility. These tools cannot handle many of the complex features of the WWW such as tables, forms, and frame-based Web pages. This project will perform research on developing techniques and tools that will make Web pages more accessible to visually impaired students.  In particular, research efforts will be directed toward developing techniques to make frame-based materials, tables, and forms found on Web-pages accessible.  These techniques will be implemented in a prototype software tool.  The approach is based on parsing and analyzing the HTML structures that constitute a page (containing tables, forms, frames, etc.) to produce tree-based structural representations.  The newly developed tool will navigate the structural representation and produce meaningful output such as audio and speech.  Particular attention will be paid to representing tables since tabular information is the hardest to convey to a blind person.  This is primarily caused by the structural information that is implicit in a table that is lost when it is read aloud linearly as is done by most screen readers.  Input from the Web-page author (such as a course instructor) will be sought so that this structural information can be conveyed.  The structural information (or hints for comprehending the table) to be conveyed is formalized as a hierarchy tree in the planned approach.  A separate graphical tool will be designed that will interactively allow the page author to produce this hierarchy tree.  The hierarchy tree will be employed to appropriately interpret the HTML structures representing tables to provide improved accessibility to visually-impaired users.  A similar approach will be developed for pages containing frames.       The tools to be developed will employ programming language semantics-based techniques, as the task of interpretation requires assigning appropriate meaning to the HTML code.  Modern parsing, language processing, and compilation technology will further aid in the development of these tools.  Many of the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) issues that arise in the context of blind users will be researched as well.  Finally, these tools will be thoroughly evaluated, and the results of these evaluations will be used to make the new tools even more accessible. \r\n",
