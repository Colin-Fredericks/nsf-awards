 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematics Department in the Courant Institute of New York University\r\nwill provide significant opportunities for research and graduate education\r\nthrough its academic programs, under the support of the VIGRE program of\r\nthe National Science Foundation. This support will be used to integrate\r\nthe postdoctoral and Ph.D. programs at the Courant Institute, together\r\nwith research experiences for honors undergraduates in mathematics.  This\r\nintegration will be founded upon focused research groups at the Courant\r\nInstitute, which exist in disciplinary mathematics -- such as differential\r\ngeometry, symplectic geometry, geometric and topological analysis, the\r\nanalysis of partial differential equations, dynamical systems theory,\r\nprobability theory and mathematical physics, computational science and\r\nnumerical analysis, and applied mathematics;  as well as in\r\ninterdisciplinary science -- such as neural science, vision, biophysics,\r\ncomputational biology, plasma physics, multimedia technology, materials\r\nscience, condensed matter physics, fluid mechanics, atmosphere/ocean\r\nscience, and financial mathematics. Each of these research groups uses\r\nadvanced graduate courses, seminars, working seminars, and workshops to\r\nfoster interactions and to exchange knowledge.  Mathematicians from\r\nneighboring academic institutions, industrial laboratories and from Wall\r\nStreet, often interact with and contribute to these groups. Interactions\r\nbetween members of the faculty, postdocs, Ph.D. students, and advanced\r\nundergraduates will be developed through active membership in these\r\nresearch groups.  Junior scientists will be trained and encouraged to\r\nadvance a view in which artificial boundaries between pure and applied\r\nmathematics do not exist, and in which interdisciplinary research is the\r\nnorm.\r\n\r\nThe Courant Institute's VIGRE Program will provide support for 9 postdoctoral scientists and 24 graduate students each year. Postdoctoral participants will gain breadth and depth through the Courant Institute's uniquely interdisciplinary environment. Each will be encouraged to develop his or her own scientific personality and vision over the course of a three-year appointment. In addition, each postdoc will gain classroom skill and experience by teaching one course per semester, with supervision by an expert in pedagogy as well as by a member of the faculty. Graduate students will be drawn quickly into the scientific life of the Institute through participation in various research groups. They will be encouraged to do internships in nonacademic environments such as industrial and government research labs, to gain added scope and perspective. They will learn communication skills through a variety of mechanisms, including supervised classroom experience. Undergraduate math majors will be encouraged to participate in an enriched honors program, featuring diverse research experience opportunities. The honors program will help draw\r\ntalented undergraduates into quantitative careers, by communicating the\r\nmany opportunities and great excitement available in mathematics and\r\ninterdisciplinary science. Some specific developments associated with this\r\nVIGRE project include: (i) the creation of undergraduate research\r\nopportunities within research groups at the Courant Institute; (ii) the\r\nformalization of internship opportunities in industrial and government\r\nlaboratories and in nearby medical schools, for undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents;  (iii) systematic supervision of graduate student and postdoc\r\nteaching, by professionals in pedagogy as well as by members of the\r\nmathematics faculty;  (iv) more active recruitment of US citizen and\r\npermanent resident candidates for graduate and postdoctoral support, with\r\nspecial emphasis on women and other underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nFunding for this award is provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\n",
