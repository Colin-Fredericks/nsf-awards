 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot project will develop and implement a workshop model for nationwide dissemination of guidelines and instructional materials for incorporating topics on science and ethics and values in secondary school science classrooms. The project will develop a three-day instructional workshop to help teachers determine ways to include ethics and values in high school science classes, conduct two pilot workshops, in Florida and Washington, in summer 2000, and revise the workshops and the text on which they are based in light of observations and evaluations.  The investigators will maintain active contact with the participants to determine the impact the workshop experience has on their science teaching and the extent to which they influence other teachers to incorporate ethics and values in their science teaching, and develop plans for similar workshops in other states. The proposed project draws on results from two previous NSF-supported projects. The first involved summer workshops for science teachers in Long Island; the second involved the development of a text that used some of the materials from the summer workshops. This text includes educational materials on the important roles of ethics and values in the practice and the social use of science, six illustrative case studies and twenty-three model classroom lessons.  These materials will be used in the pilot three-day workshops.  Each workshop will have 25 participants. Planning for and execution of both workshops is being done with the collaboration of science program specialists in the offices of the public schools in those states. \r\n",
