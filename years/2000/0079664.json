In\r\nsome cases, these alternative decision-making modes are even designed to prevent\r\ncost-benefit calculations (March, 1994; Prelec & Hernstein, 1991). Yates and Lee\r\n(1996) coined the term decision modes to describe qualitatively different strategies\r\nfor arriving at a decision.\r\n\r\nGiven the new plurality of views on the ways that people make decisions, it is time to\r\ntake a look at the bigger picture and to carefully examine the range of decision modes\r\nthat people use.  In the current climate of decision making research, the careful\r\ndevelopment of a taxonomy of decision modes will be an important contribution to the\r\nfield.  A central objective of the proposed research is to develop a comprehensive\r\ntaxonomy of decision modes and a common vocabulary that can be used to identify and\r\ndistinguish decision making processes that fall within each mode.  The proposed\r\ntaxonomy includes four decision modes, i.e., cost-benefit-based, recognition-based,\r\naffect-based, and reason-based.  Each mode is characterized in terms of its\r\nattentional focus, primary cognitive and affective processes, and mental\r\nrepresentations.  The further development of this decision mode taxonomy will involve\r\nmore precisely characterizing the distinguishing attributes of different decision\r\nmodes and developing experimental procedures able to demonstrate more unequivocally\r\nthe existence of these qualitatively different modes.\r\n\r\n  A second objective is to establish a better understanding of the factors that\r\ndetermine when a particular mode will be used and why.  This requires the development\r\nof a model of implicit decision mode selection that is directly related to the\r\ndecision mode taxonomy.  Which decision mode is used in a given situation is\r\nhypothesized to depend both on person-centered factors (i.e., cognitive and affective\r\nprocesses) and on situational factors.  Identifying and characterizing the factors\r\nthat influence decision mode selection will be important not only because it is\r\ntheoretically interesting to better understand the decision making process, but also\r\nbecause the selection of one or the other decision mode is hypothesized to influence\r\nthe final decision outcome.\r\n\r\n The proposed research has the potential to integrate existing knowledge about human\r\nmotivation, the nature and function of cognitive and affective processes, and mental\r\nrepresentation into an adaptive decision making framework.  The proposed framework is\r\nfar broader than its precursors in both its specification of the criteria on which\r\npeople are trying to optimize and its specification of the strategies and processes at\r\npeople's disposal.   Such a framework has the potential to guide and focus new\r\nresearch in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
