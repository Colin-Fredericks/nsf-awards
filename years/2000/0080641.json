This concept is an extension toward shorter wavelength of the Soft X-ray Laser (SXL),which was demonstrated at Princeton in transition to the ground state in H-like LiIII at 13.5 nm.The 13.5 nm SXL operates at a repetition rate of  2 Hz using only a 50 mJ, 250 fsec pumping beam (intensity:  1-2 x  ).  The procedure and experimental set-up for the demonstration of high gain-length product (GL) for the 4.8 nm SXL is the same as that of the 13.5 nm SXL, except much higher intensities are required (~ ).  Such intensities will be available from our system through the refurbishing of our 12-year old KrF large volume amplifier.\r\n        \r\nThe 4.8 nm laser in transition to ground state of hydrogen-like BV ions would be the shortest wavelength compact, very efficient X-ray laser (\"Table top\" X-ray laser).  Demonstration of the lasing at 4.8 nm would be the most straight-forward extension to shorter wavelength of 13.5 nm laser in transition to ground state of H-like Li III ions. Development of 4.8 nm in H-like BV ions will provide crucial scaling point for the development of this type of lasers at shorter wavelength (at 3.4 nm in CVI in \"water window\" and at even shorter wavelengths).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
