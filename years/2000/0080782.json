In particular, there has been much speculation about the possible importance of the reaction products of amino acids and reducing sugars (so-called amino sugars) and their relation to the biochemistry of marine bacteria.  In this project, researchers at the University of South Carolina will determine the origins, abundance, and composition of amino sugars in marine organisms and in particulate, colloidal, and dissolved organic matter.  Three component efforts will be undertaken.  First, the principal investigator will conduct a survey of the abundance and composition of amino sugars, neutral sugars, and D/L amino acids in marine organisms, POM, colloids, and DOM from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  Then, the relative reactivities of amino and neutral sugars will be evaluated and compared in an assessment of their use as diagenetic (water column and sediment reaction) indicators.  And finally, a series of field surveys and decomposition studies will be used to assess the importance of bacteria as sources of amino sugars and DOM in seawater.\r\n",
