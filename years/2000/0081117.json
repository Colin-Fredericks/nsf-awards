The research proposed\r\nhere is the development of information technology (IT) to automate the\r\ninfrastructure, administration and data handling tasks necessary to support\r\nremote instrumentation projects for K-16 education.  The goal is to develop\r\nan IT infrastructure that can be readily adopted by other academic research\r\ngroups.  One result could be the incorporation of the remote use of\r\nresearch grade scientific instrumentation as an integral part of teaching\r\nwithin K-16 curricula with little time and effort from the research groups\r\nsupplying the scientific resources.  The outreach project, Bugscope, that\r\nwill serve as the focus of this work will be structured so that the\r\ninstrument, an environmental scanning electron microscope, is provided as a\r\nresource while leaving the planning, execution and control of the\r\nexperiment in the hands of teachers and students.  Projects such as this\r\ncan provide benefits not only to the students involved but also have the\r\npotential to provide the general public with better insight into the goals,\r\ntechniques and instrumentation used by scientists.\r\n",
