Many natural such spaces are noncompact. \r\nFor example, the space of positive definite matrices of \r\ndeterminant one is a noncompact symmetric space, and the \r\nmoduli space of all elliptic curves is a noncompact locally \r\nsymmetric space of finite volume which is one example of \r\nShimura curves and plays an important role in the recent \r\nsolution of the last Fermat's theorem.  To understand the \r\ngeometry and analysis of such noncompact spaces, an important \r\nproblem is to study their compactifications.  One of the common \r\nthemes of the four projects in this proposal is to understand \r\nrefined structures of the compactifications and their relations \r\nto the spectral theory of the spaces. For example, for locally symmetric spaces, geodesics which are eventually distance \r\nminimizing can be used to study the compactifications and \r\nalso to understand the generalized eigenfunctions of the \r\ncontinuous spectrum, specifically, the scattering matrices.\r\nCompactifications of symmetric spaces play an important role \r\nin understanding behaviors at infinity of the joint eigenfunctions \r\nof the invariant differential operators and the matrix \r\ncoefficients of representations.  The compactifications \r\nof globally and locally symmetric spaces have mainly be \r\nstudied separately before, and an important feature of \r\nthis proposal is to study compactifications of both types \r\nof spaces using a similar approach.\r\n\r\nMathematicians study geometric shapes and their structures.  One\r\nsuch collection of shapes consists of objects called manifolds. \r\nIf a drum is pictured as a particular type of manifold then the\r\ntones produced by the drum can be thought of as mathematical\r\nobjects associated to the manifold.  For a particularly important\r\ncollection of drums there are two kinds of tones: the discrete (or\r\nisolated) ones and the continuous families. The PI intends to \r\ninvestigate a variety of mathematical structures on these drums or manifolds.  \r\n",
