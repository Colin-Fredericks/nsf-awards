 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the compiled communication technique on \r\ncommodity networks. In compiled communication, high performance \r\ncommunication is achieved by using the compiler to analyze the communication \r\nrequirement of a program and to manage network resources statically to \r\nsupport the communications. As a result, runtime communication overheads, \r\nsuch as buffer management, are reduced and/or amortized over a number of \r\ncommunications, and the communication performance is improved. Compiled\r\ncommunication is more powerful than traditional communication optimization \r\ntechniques in that it performs communication optimizations in both the\r\ncompiler and the hardware/operating system/runtime system. The outcome\r\nof the proposed research is an extension of the MPI library that supports\r\nthe compiled communication model, a SUIF based restructure compiler that \r\ncan generate communication code using the compiled communication model,\r\nan experimental demonstration of how much performance improvement can be\r\nachieved by using the compiled communication model, and a clear \r\nidentification of the advantages and limitations of the compiled communication\r\nmodel.\r\n",
