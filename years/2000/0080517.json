The purpose of the symposium is to provide a forum for discussion and dissemination of cutting-edge research in the rapidly emerging area of magnetoelectronics. The symposium is planned to give an efficient, comprehensive view of the present and future of magnetoelectronics: combining both breadth and depth, both next generation and far-reaching research on materialsand devices. An unusually strong list of speakers have already agreed to make presentations. There will be no parallel sessions, so all participants can attend all the presentations. The target audience is researchers, educators and students with an interest in magnetoelectronic materials\r\nand devices, from academia, government and industry. \r\n\r\nStudents do not often have the opportunity to attend a symposium of this type. Student participants will benefit from the opportunity to get an overview and in-depth look at the current and future direction of the emerging field of magnetoelectronics. The symposium should benefit both beginning students, and those who have advanced experience in the area of magnetoelectronic devices. \r\n",
