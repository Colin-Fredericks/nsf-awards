 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference on Polymers (East) will take place June 10-15, 2000 at Connecticut College and will be devoted to the range of subjects in polymer science that are seen to project developments in the future century.  The entire conference can be found on the web at [http://www.grc.uri.edu/programs/2000/polyeast.htm].  As a bridge between the 20th and 21st centuries there will be a program titled \"Stories from the 20th Century,\" to offer a context for the lectures on cutting-edge developments in polymer science.  Distinguished contributors to polymer science in the 20th century have been invited to this program and many of them will also act as discussion leaders for the regular program.\r\n\r\nThe NSF contributions will allow graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the conference and present their work in the form of posters.  These young people will act as an interesting counterpoint to the senior investigators from the Stories section.  A committee of speakers and discussion leaders from he program will choose the best of these poster presentations and these presenters will be asked to give oral presentations before the whole conference.\r\n",
