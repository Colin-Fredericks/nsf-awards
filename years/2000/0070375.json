 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Power Conference (APC) sponsored by the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) , is an annual national forum for the discussion of the broad technical aspects of generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric power.  APC has significant educational value particularly for undergraduate students who aim to learn more about the electric power industry.  In recognition of this fact, IIT has been conducting  a special program for faculty and students, called the Ben Elliot Sponsored Student/Faculty (SSF) Program.  The program features special breakfast seminars and other events(e.g., plant tours, cracker barrel) expressly for students in addition to the regular APC technical sessions.  The proposed participant support grants will significantly aid the Ben Elliott SSF Program in its mission of encouraging more students (especially undergraduates to pursue careers in power engineering.",
