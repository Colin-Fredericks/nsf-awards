Drugs and endogenous physiologic chemicals reduce their effects by interacting with a macromolecular tissue constituent of functional significance, the receptor.   The particular receptors of interest here are those that respond to the endogneous chemical, acetylecholine, and to the mushroom poison, muscarine.  These so-called muscarinic receptors are located at many sites in the body and their activation or blockade can lead to changes in heart rate, stimulation or blockage of salivary and gastro-intestinal secretions, bronchiolar constriction among others.  Older drugs, such as atropine, which interact with the muscarinic receptors produce effects non-selectively at many sites.  However, as a result of research, the concept of different types of the muscarinic receptor-subtypes became a reality, and now many agents have been developed that act selectively at some muscarinic receptors and not at others, to produce the desired effects and fewer side-effects.  As a result of basic research on muscarinic receptors, new selective agents are available for treatment of genito-urinary and gastrointestinal problems, cardiovasular and pulmonary diseases, and the role of muscarinic receptors in Alzheimer's diseas, schizophrenia and glaucoma is being clarified. \r\n",
