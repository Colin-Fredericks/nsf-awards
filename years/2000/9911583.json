 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bantu languages are of interest to linguists because of their extensive\r\nverbal morphology and their complex tense/aspect systems. The goal of this\r\nproject is to produce a detailed description and analysis of the verb\r\nsystem of Chisukwa, an endangered Bantu language spoken in Malawi.\r\nEvidence from Bantu languages suggests that different societies\r\nconceptualize, organize, and talk about events in different ways. This is\r\nmost clear when observing the interaction of tense/aspect markers with\r\ndifferent verb types. Through fieldwork in Malawi, the student will\r\nidentify the various verb types in Chisukwa, define the aspectual/temporal\r\nproperties of the verb types, differentiate tense/aspect markers, and\r\ndetermine how these markers interact with different verb types. Project\r\nwork will involve up to eighteen months of study in Malawi, working with\r\nnative speaker consultants using both direct and contextualized\r\nelicitation sessions to gather  data in Chisukwa. Other methods\r\ninclude the recording, transcribing and translating of oral narratives\r\nsuch as stories, personal histories, and folktales, as well as the\r\nrecording of daily conversations. The data will be recorded both in\r\nnotebooks and in a computer database. Analysis will be ongoing throughout\r\nthe duration of the project both in the field and in close collaboration\r\nwith linguists at the Centre for Language Studies at the University of\r\nMalawi in Zomba. The dissertation research will accomplish three goals:\r\n(1) contribute to the theoretical understanding of the role of temporal\r\nrelations in the conceptual organization of human experience, (2) document\r\nand preserve aspects of an endangered and undocumented Malawian language,\r\nand (3) contribute a comprehensive analysis to the growing pool of\r\nknowledge about Bantu tense/aspect systems. This project will benefit not\r\nonly the academic community of the United States, but also the academic\r\ncommunity in Malawi and the Sukwa community itself. Copies of all\r\nmaterials produced will be deposited at the Centre for Language Studies in\r\nMalawi and  institutions within the Sukwa community. In addition, the\r\nmaterials will be used as a basis for eventually producing a Chisukwa\r\ngrammar and other pedagogical materials for the community.",
