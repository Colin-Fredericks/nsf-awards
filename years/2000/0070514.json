 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThe research to be conducted includes the analysis of operators associated with\r\nmultilinear singular integrals and the study of discrete functions spaces.  The\r\ninvestigations will be based on techniques related to Littlewood-Paley theory,\r\nmolecular decompositions, and time-frequency analysis tools.  Specific aspects\r\nproposed in the analysis of operators are to continue collaborations in the\r\ndevelopment of a multilinear counterpart of the linear Calderon-Zygmund\r\ntheory, and to study various classes of multilinear pseudodifferential\r\noperators.  Problems in the analysis of discrete function spaces include issues\r\nabout the sampling of functions with controlled mean oscillations and the\r\napproximation of band limited signals.  The proposal also contains an\r\ninterdisciplinary component.  In particular, theoretical problems arising in the\r\nanalytic formulation of the scattering of light by structurally colored tissues\r\nof living organisms will be considered.  The spectral resolution and\r\nmathematical properties of quasi-ordered geometries will be investigated.  The\r\nlast part of the research will be assisted by numerical computation and data\r\nvisualization.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperators associated with singular integrals arise as technical tools in\r\nanalysis and also as transformations encountered in the mathematical modeling of\r\ncertain physical phenomena.  Such transformations can be used to describe the\r\nchanges in the properties of a function or the transition from the input to the\r\noutput of a system.  Properties of functions or signals often need to be\r\nunderstood from the information encoded in samples of the data.  Such\r\ninformation can be quantified by function spaces and decoded by Fourier analysis\r\nand related time-frequency techniques.  Fourier analysis is the mathematical\r\nversion of a diffracting physical prism.  It resolves a signal into a spectrum\r\nof waves of different amplitudes and oscillations in a similar way that a prism\r\ndiffracts a ray of light into a rainbow of colors of different wavelengths.\r\nModern decomposition techniques in analysis provide a universal language for the\r\nprocessing of complicated information.  Progress in this area of analysis always\r\nproduces important advances in scientific problems where large and complicated\r\nsets of data need to be analyzed to search for ordered patterns, reduce\r\nunnecessary information, or visualize intricate structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
