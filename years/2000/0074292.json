 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will allow the principal investigator, Elaine Terry, the opportunity to spend the 2000-01 academic year as a Visiting Professor at the University of Memphis in Tennessee.  The POWRE award will give her ample opportunity to enhance her research efforts.  The award is unique in that it will give the PI the opportunity to develop an undergraduate mathematics course in her field of research, Ramsey theory.  During the one year leave of absence, the PI will facilitate her professional advancement in three ways: (1) enable her to conduct research for publication, (2) establish research ties with prominent researchers, and (3) develop a seminar course in Ramsey theory for undergraduates.  It will allow the PI time to pursue her research objectives in an environment supportive of significant interactions with other researchers in Ramsey theory.  This opportunity for informal exchange of ideas with colleagues in the same field, and for exposure through seminars in other areas within the field will foster creative approaches to her research.   This POWRE project is supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) and the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).",
