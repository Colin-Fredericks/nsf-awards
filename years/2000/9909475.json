 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nRecent international studies have elicited a great deal of interest in Japanese educational practices.  For example, researchers and practitioners alike have expressed excitement about uncovering better approaches to teaching mathematics by examining the Japanese lessons that were collected as part of the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS). \r\n\r\nJapanese models of professional development are also receiving growing attention.  We now know quite a bit about how Japanese teachers develop and refine their teaching by working together in school based groups to carefully plan, implement, and revise lessons.  In fact a number of researchers have argued that that this popular form of practice-based inquiry, called jugyokenkyu [lesson study], could be of great interest to American educators. \r\n\r\nIn this project we argue for combining these two trends.  Looking at the TIMSS tapes in and of itself is not likely to affect practice in any significant way.  The conversations that these tapes engender need to be built upon by having teachers engage in a meaningful and goal directed follow up activity.  We suggest that lesson study can provide such an activity and argue for embedding teachers' analysis of TIMSS tapes in the broader context of doing lesson study.  \r\n\r\nMore specifically this project has three main goals: 1) understanding how to adapt lesson study to a US context, 2) assessing the impact on individual teachers of participating in lesson study, and 3) exploring how to bring lesson study to scale in US schools.\r\n\r\n",
