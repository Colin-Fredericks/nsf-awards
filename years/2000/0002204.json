Klinzing, University of Pittsburgh\r\n\r\nTravel support will be provided to fifteen U.S. science and engineering graduate students to participate at an intensive course in Particle Technology especially offered by Prof. K. Leschonski at the University of Clausthal, Germany, July 1-9, 2000.  The course will be taught in English using the unique laboratory and pilot facilities for particle technology at the University of Clausthal.  It is aimed at providing students with exposure to both basic concepts in particle science and engineering and at instilling an appreciation of the particle technology field, its relevance to industry and international contributions.  Development of long-term contacts with researchers abroad is another objective.  Students will be selected by competition from the Departments of Chemical, Mechanical, Civil and Materials Science Engineering in U.S. universities and colleges and will require a statement from the student and a letter of recommendation from the student's advisor.  Three faculty advisors will help with the selection process and with the guidance of students during the instruction process.  DuPont will co-sponsor this activity.  \r\n",
