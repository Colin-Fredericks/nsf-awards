 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal uses geometry and statistics to build meaningful confidence regions for tree structured parameters.  Binary trees appear as parameters in: (1) Hierarchical clustering problems, for instance for micro-array data from contemporary genetics; (2) Methods that use decision trees such as the Classification and Regression trees (CART); (3) Estimation of phylogenetic trees built from DNA data for the taxonomy of species, but also for building `gene trees'.  The embedding of tree estimation in a statistical framework allows one to see trees as a special type of parameter to be estimated.  However the estimation procedures have been developed without the ability to construct confidence regions for these paramters or ways of comparing various estimators of these parameters.  Currently biologists validate the tree estimated by perturbing the data through a simple bootstrap of the DNA sequences and then summarizing the collection of trees obtained by associating p-values to the branches of a consensus tree.  This reduces the problem to a collection of binomial simulations, losing much of the multivariate information of which groups appear simultaneously.  This new constructive geometrical approach uses the tools available from topology and algebraic combinatorics.  Collaboration with a combinatorialist, Louis Billera, and a topologist, Karen Vogtmann, on a more mathematical understanding of tree space allows a more natural definition of distances between points in the `tree polytope'.  This topological study of tree space is crucial in the definition of a notion of neighborhood that then allows a definition of continuity of the estimation function.  The space of trees is a space with negative curvature.  It is also possible to define geodesics on this space and convex hulls.  The notion of confidence region can be defined, and it is possible to combine trees from built from different datasets or to combine trees obtained from different genes or even compare trees with other data (biogeographic, for instance).\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the geometry of \"tree space\" helps understand how to combine and compare trees.  Whether they are hierarchical clustering trees built for micro-array DNA data or family trees built from DNA sequences, binary tree data are abundant in today's genome era.  The current proposal aims to consider trees as a whole, instead of breaking them down into just sibling relationships as is done currently.  This problem uses recent results from topology and the geometry of spaces with negative curvature, like the surface of a hyperboloid.  In these spaces notions of average and distance have to be redefined, the hardest being ways of representing what is not naturally representable in our usual euclidean space.  The challenges are both computational and geometric.\r\n",
