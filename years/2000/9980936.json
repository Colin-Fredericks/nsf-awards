 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology - Biological (71)\r\nRecent discussions in the science education literature suggest that many departments continue to use primarily lecture-based approaches to teaching despite emerging evidence that students learn best when they are actively engaged in a participatory enterprise. In many cases, including ours, lack of available resources is the main barrier we have faced in implementing curricular reform. The result until recently is that our laboratory-based experiences have been less interactive and more demonstrative. \r\n\r\nImplementation of this project has made it possible to change the pedagogical culture of our department. We are initiating significant changes in several courses in our curriculum to allow our students to be more active participants in their science education. Examples of activities supported by this project include: (1) web-based interaction among groups of students within and between certain courses in the curriculum, (2) hands-on experience in using scientific instrumentation to generate and solve problems in psychological science, and (3) application of computer technology to analyze, graph, and report original data collected by students engaged in course based and independent research activities. An important anticipated outcome of this project is a collaborative research-rich environment in which classroom instruction and research are integrated across the curriculum. The effectiveness of such an approach has been convincingly demonstrated at several institutions including Furman University, Ohio Wesleyan University, and Mary Washington College. Because Furman has been especially proactive in creating a dynamic learning environment and because we share many institutional and departmental characteristics, their department will serve as an important role model and source of advice and counsel for us as we implement this project and evaluate our progress. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
