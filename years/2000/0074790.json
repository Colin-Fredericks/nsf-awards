The proposed activity leverages the author's training in physics, particularly the physics of complex systems, and applies to the study of multi-agent systems.  The goal of the research is to propose a feasible mechanism in which interactions between agents with simple local strategies lead to desirable group behavior in each of the two domains: coalition formation in a multiagent system and dynamic routing in a sensor network.  The proposed mechanism is then analyzed and a mathematical model of the process is constructed.  The model is expressed as a series of coupled differential equations.  For the coalition formation problem, for instance, the model describes how the number and distribution of coalitions change with time.  The solutions of the equations describe collective behavior, and they can be analyzed for different values of the parameters.\r\n",
