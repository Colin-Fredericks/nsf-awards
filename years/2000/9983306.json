 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will result in development of a novel oceanographic chlorophyll fluorescence sensor for the study of benthic microalgae.  This sensor will be the first to incorporate fluorescence lifetime measurement capability, and the first to implement such capability for stand-off measurements from an ROV. This is of major significance, because it will permit, for the first time, direct in situ measurements of fluorescence quantum yield, and hence of photochemical efficiency, a feat that is not possible with simple amplitude-based fluorimeters. Continental shelf benthic ecosystems are of critical importance to marine biology and the viability of these ecosystems can be objectively assessed from the\r\nphysiological status of the resident microalgae. The most important component of this status is the level of their photosynthetic performance, determined by the rates and efficiency of primary stages of light-driven photochemistry. Yet, knowledge about these processes, which control the health, long-term viability, productivity and dynamics of benthic microalgae is minimal because of the lack of suitable research tools for their study. Potential commercial applications include oceanographic sensors, precision farming, photosynthesis analyzers for the laboratory research market, non-invasive brain oxymetry, product authentication, High Throughput Screening, clinical in vitro diagnostics and on-line process analysis.",
