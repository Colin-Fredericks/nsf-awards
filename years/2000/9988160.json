Project Summary\r\nAn important goal in parallel processing is the development of general-\r\npurpose parallel models and algorithms. The challenge here has been to find\r\nthe right balance between simplicity, accuracy and broad applicability. This\r\nproject will develop a comprehensive collection of parallel algorithms suitable\r\nfor practical use by working with three general-purpose parallel computation\r\nmodels that have been proposed over the last decade | Bulk-Synchronous\r\nParallel (BSP), LogP, and Queuing Shared-Memory (QSM) models | as\r\nwell as with the external memory Parallel Disk Model (PDM). Some uni-\r\nfying themes for the design of efficient algorithms on these models will be\r\ndeveloped, and these will form the basis for a systematic development of al-\r\ngorithms on these models. The algorithms to be developed will range from\r\nkernel algorithms for basic primitives to algorithms for important applica-\r\ntions.\r\nThe research will expose unifying themes relating these well-\r\nknown models, and will result in fast and efficient parallel algorithms with\r\ngood performance on a wide range of parallel machines for large problem sizes\r\ntypically seen in practice. Additionally, this research will provide insight into\r\nthe fundamental benefits and limitations of parallel processing through the\r\ninvestigation of asymptotically optimal algorithms and lower bounds.",
