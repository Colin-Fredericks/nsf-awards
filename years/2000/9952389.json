 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  As our society has continued to become more technologically oriented, the need for college graduates to understand the processes of science and to have experience using technological devices has become increasingly important.  This project is designed to restructure the introductory non-majors biology laboratories at Western Illinois University.  We are adapting components of the biology program developed at Oklahoma State University, including inquiry-based labs (e.g., labs that incorporate hypothesis testing, simulations, modeling, and case studies) and the use of pre-lab activities to ensure students are fully prepared for each lab.  This is the first of several projects designed to overhaul our introductory biology program in order to keep it aligned with current learning theory.  We are starting with the non-majors courses because they have the highest enrollments and they are taken primarily by women and most students majoring in education.  This project will help us better meet the needs of these students.  Our project is designed to enhance students' understanding of biological concepts and the processes of science and to provide students with experiences appropriate for a technological world.  This goal is being accomplished by developing new laboratory activities and incorporating use of computer technologies, electrophoresis, and other modern biological techniques.  Finally, because these courses are taken by most students seeking elementary teacher certification, this change is designed to enhance their understanding of the types of laboratory experiences supported by the National Science Education Standards.  The labs are also designed to serve as a model for future teachers as they implement the Standards in their own classrooms.    \r\n\r\n",
