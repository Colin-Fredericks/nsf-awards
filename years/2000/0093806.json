 "awd_abstract_narration": "0093806\r\nBarron\r\nA current frontier in bioengineering is the design of non-natural, sequence-controlled polymers that can effectively mimic some of the structures and activities of natural proteins, but that are non-immunogenic and stable as in vivo therapeutics.  This exploratory research requires an integration of principles and paradigms taken from biochemistry and biophysics with methods of biochemical and biomedical engineering.  A focused, medically-relevant research project is proposed that, even if only partially successful, will have far-reaching, fundamental implications for the new field of biomimetic polymer engineering, \r\n\r\nAn important and tractable problem is chosen:  The criticalneed for improved synthetic analogs of the human surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C.  Preliminary data is shown and new strategies are proposed towards the development of novel SP-mimics based on polypeptoids: non-natural polymers based on a peptide backbone, yet differing in that sidechains are bonded to backbone nitrogens rather than to a-carbons.  N-substituted peptoids with proteinogenic sidechains previously have been shown to be extremely protease-resistant, and further to raise only very low-level immune response in vivo.  In the investigator's lab and elsewhere, some peptoid sequences have been shown to adopt stable, helical secondary structure in aqueous or organic solution.  Sequence-specific peptoids can be synthesized easily, at substantially lower cost than peptides, with facile access to diverse sidechain chemistries.\r\n\r\nNatural lung surfactant coats the internal surfaces of mammalian lungs and enables normal breathing.  It is a complex mixture composed of 95% lipids and 5% surfactant-specific proteins (SP).  Both protein and phospholipid fractions play critical roles in lung surfactant s physiological properties, providing a decrease in the work of breathing by regulating surface tension at the air-liquid interface of alveoli as a function of their surface area.  The amphipathic, helical surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C (79 and 35 amino acids, respectively) promote rapid phospholipid adsorption to the air-liquid interface, facilitate respreading of the phospholipid monolayer throughout the respiration cycle, and regulate the phase behavior of the monolayer to yield the lowest possible alveolar surface tension.  The absence or dysfunction of lung surfactant on alveolar surfaces leads to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in which lungs are incompliant and vulnerable to collapse.  Patients with severe RDS cannot be mechanically ventilated without damage to lung tissue, and require immediate surfactant replacement therapy.  Premature infants (< 30 weeks) are born with immature lungs lacking surfactant, and often suffer from severe RDS.  These patients typically receive surfactant replacement therapy at birth with an animal-derived surfactant formulation.  Synthetic formulations exist, but are significantly less efficacious than natural surfactant in enabling proper lung functioning, primarily because they lack effective functional mimics of SP-B and SP-C.  Medicines sourced from animals raise concerns about a possibility for cross-species pathogen transmission and also for immunogenicity.  Therefore, the development of an effective synthetic biomimetic surfactant replacement is a present need.\r\n\r\nAims to address this need, as well as to carry out important fundamental research are:\r\n\r\n(1) To design, synthesize, purify, and characterize the secondary structure of peptoid-based mimics of the helical, amphipathic lung surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C.  Methods include organic synthesis, analytical and preparative HPLC, mass spectroscopy, and circular dichroism (CD);\r\n\r\n(2) To confirm and further characterize the in vitro biophysical functioning of peptoid-based SP-B and SP-C mimics as spreading agents for biomimetic phospholipid admixtures.  Experimental approaches include both pulsating bubble surfactometry and Langmuir-Wilhelmy surfactometry.\r\n\r\n(3) Based on these carefully-repeated preliminary results, to prepare another proposal to the NSF Directorate of Bioengineering to continue the research project thereafter.\r\n",
