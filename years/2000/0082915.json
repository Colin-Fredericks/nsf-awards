Through research and course delivery, this collaboration will explore\r\nnew curricula that allow students from a wide variety of disciplines to\r\nobtain the understanding and skills that prepare them to be a part of the\r\nmodern information technology workforce.  The project will broaden the\r\ninformation technology pipeline in two critical ways:  by increasing the\r\ndiversity of academic disciplines and aptitudes from which students can\r\nenter the information technology workforce, and by applying this approach\r\nto a racially diverse population.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop a multidisciplinary curriculum and research in\r\ntechnology, arts, and media (TAM).  The research associated with the\r\ndevelopment and evaluation of the TAM curriculum has four components: 1)\r\ncomputer and cognitive science research addressing approaches to using\r\ninformation technology in education that will help determine both the\r\ncontent and the delivery of the curriculum. 2) social science research\r\nabout the impacts of the networked information age upon our society that is\r\nlinked to a key portion of the curriculum, 3) education research about the\r\nuse of information technology in K-12 education that will impact the\r\neducation course offerings of the TAM curriculum, and 4) formative and\r\nsummative evaluations of the TAM curriculum in achieving its goals.\r\n",
