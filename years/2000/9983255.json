The cells responsible for the formation of myelin in the\r\nbrain are called oligodendrocytes.   Some of the myelin proteins are\r\nsynthesized in the body of the oligodendrocyte and subsequently transported\r\nby small vesicles to the place where the myelin is formed.  Similarly,\r\nmyelin components can be transported from the myelin sheath to other parts\r\nof the oligodendrocytes by means of small vesicles.   The formation,\r\nmaintenance and remodeling of the myelin sheath depend at least in part on\r\nthe intracellular transport of vesicles. The transport of vesicles is\r\nregulated by controlling both vesicle formation and fusion. At present\r\nlittle is known about the mechanisms in oligodendrocytes that regulate this\r\ntraffic, because of the previous absence of definitive experimental\r\napproaches to sort out the various signalling components that function in\r\nliving oligodendrocytes.  We were able to design an approach that allows\r\nthe visualization of different pathways of vesicle transport in living\r\noligodendrocytes.  We isolated from oligodendrocytes a novel gene that\r\ncodifies for a protein, designated RabX, which is a member of a family of\r\nproteins that are known to regulated specific vesicle trafficking pathways.\r\n The Rab family of proteins regulates intracellular transport of vesicles\r\ncontrolling both the formation of vesicles in the membrane donor\r\ncompartment and the fusion/targeting of vesicles in the acceptor\r\ncompartment.  Additionally, Rab proteins appear to be involved in the\r\nmovement of the vesicles from the donor to the acceptor compartment, which\r\nis facilitated by elements of the cell cytoskeleton. The functions of Rab\r\nproteins to regulate different steps in intracellular vesicle transport\r\ndepend on their ability to alternate between two conformational states,\r\ninactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound).  The capacity to change\r\nconformational state relies on GTPase activity. Our research will be focus\r\nin the study of RabX GTPase activity and in the analysis of the movement in\r\nliving cells of vesicles containing RabX. Using molecular biological\r\ntechniques RabX will be attached to EYFP (a fluorescent protein). This\r\nchimera protein (RabX-EYFP) will be express in different cells including\r\noligodendrocytes, and since it is fluorescent we will able to see the\r\nintracellular compartment that contain Rab0-EYFP by fluorescence\r\nmicroscopy.  By taking pictures of the cells at different times we will\r\nable to study the movement of vesicles that contain RabX-EYFP.   It is\r\nexpected that this research will result in a better understanding of how\r\nRabX regulates the intracellular transport of vesicles in the\r\noligodendrocytes.  This information is essential for knowing how myelin\r\nformation and remodeling take place.  We believe that this basic knowledge\r\nwill help in the design of novel treatments for recovering the myelin lost\r\nduring demyelinating disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord\r\ninjury.  \r\n\r\n",
