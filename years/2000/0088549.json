 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research focuses on the materials growth, device design and fabrication, and\r\napplications of a ZnO monolithically integrated tunable surface acoustic wave (MITSAW) chip. The\r\nnovel chip integrates acoustic, optical and electrical process' in one material system. It uses tunable\r\nacousto-electric and acousto-optic interaction between surface acoustic waves (SAW) and a two\r\ndimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a ZnO/MgxZn1-xO quantum well.\r\n\r\nZnO is a multifunctional material possessing unique electrical, optical, acoustical, and mechanical\r\nproperties. The high electromechanical coupling coefficients of piezoelectric ZnO in conjunction with the\r\nlow acoustic loss and high velocity of sapphire (Al2O3) offers high frequency and low loss RF\r\napplications. Alloying ZnO with MgO forms the ternary compound MgxZn1-xO, which permits band-gap\r\ntuning from 3.32 eV to 4 eV. ZnO/MgxZn1-xO heterostructures with 2DEG can be integrated with SAW to\r\ncreate a unique acoustic velocity tuning mechanism. The 2DEG interacts with the lateral electric field\r\nresulting in ohmic loss, which attenuates and slows the surface acoustic wave. This mechanism is used to\r\ntune the acoustic velocity. The high coupling coefficients offered by the ZnO/R-Al2O3 systems allows\r\nvelocity tuning up to 1%. Combined with the optical characteristics of the wide and direct band gap\r\n(~3.3eV) semiconductor ZnO and transparent conductive ZnO electrodes, the MITSAW chip can be used\r\nfor UV optical signal processing. The proposed MITSAW consists of a ZnO/MgxZn1-xO quantum well\r\nstructure grown on a R-plane sapphire (R-Al2O3) substrate using MOCVD. R-plane sapphire is chosen\r\ninstead of the popular C-plane substrate, as this substrate provides in-plane anisotropy in the ZnO layer.\r\nBy aligning the device parallel to the c-axis of the ZnO film, Rayleigh type surface acoustic waves are\r\nexcited, while Love type SAWs are excited when the devices are aligned perpendicular to the c-axis. The\r\nRayleigh wave mode is suitable for gaseous environment sensing, while the Love wave mode, which has\r\nno vertical wave component, is ideal for liquid environment sensing. The ZnO MITSAW chip also offers\r\nan acoustic-optical dual mode sensing mechanism. Likewise, the optical properties parallel and\r\nperpendicular to the c-axis are different, allowing novel optical devices, such as high contrast modulators,\r\nto be fabricated.\r\n\r\nThe successful development of the ZnO MITSAW chip technology will provide industry with\r\nstate-of-the-art new multifunctional chip technologies. It will not only improve the existing devices but\r\nalso develop fundamentally new approaches to many important application areas, including\r\ntunable/adaptive communication systems, novel multi-mode tunable chemical and biochemical sensors,\r\nand optical signal processors such as delay lines and multiplexers.",
