 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, in partnership with Girls, Inc. and the UTC Challenger Center will conduct a program entitled Adventures in Computers, Engineering, and Space (ACES) to encourage girls to consider careers in these fields, and to continue their education in science and mathematics.  ACES will include a one-week residential summer workshop for 24 girls entering seventh and eight grades.  This workshop will provide space-related activities at the Challenger Center and hands-on activities in computer science and electrical, mechanical, and industrial engineering, as \"Whole Person\" activities such as nutrition, professional etiquette, and exercise.  Follow-up activities will include small design projects that encourage originally in solving problems with constraints.  To widen the influence of the project, an ACES Fair, featuring hands-on engineering, computer, and space activities, will be conducted at selected elementary and middle schools, and community centers.  Participants for all activities will be drawn from both economically disadvantaged groups and the general population; each group will be assessed and tracked separately so that the efficacy of ACES in influencing attitudes of each can be measured.  ACES will serve as a model for other communities concerned with under-representation of women in technical careers.",
