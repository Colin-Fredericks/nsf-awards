 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the research supported by this award is the\r\nmathematical analysis of certain significant material failures in\r\nsolids.  The goal of this endeavor is the qualitative prediction of\r\nthe formation and growth of voids.  Toward this end the principal\r\ninvestigator will continue his studies of the relevant nonlinear\r\npartial differential equations, which constitute the mathematical\r\nmodel, in order to determine conditions under which these problems\r\nhave singular solutions.  The underlying equations are those that\r\narise in elasticity and viscoelasticity and the desired\r\nsingularities are point discontinuities.  Problems that will be\r\nconsidered include:  the existence of singular solutions to\r\nquasilinear elliptic systems; the existence of, and admissibility\r\ncriteria for, singular solutions to hyperbolic systems; the\r\nexistence of singular solutions to certain parabolic systems; the\r\nexistence of minimizers with singularities for problems in the\r\ncalculus of variations; regularity, fine properties, and the\r\nasymptotic behavior of singular minimizers; the optimal location\r\nfor an isolated singularity; and, the determination of whether\r\nknown singular solutions to a quasilinear elliptic system are\r\nindeed minimizers of the corresponding problem in the calculus of\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nThe research area of this grant is the mathematical analysis of\r\nequations that arise in Materials Science.  The most common way to\r\ndetermine when a material will fail under the influence of external\r\nforces is to subject a piece of the actual material to tensile\r\nloads until failure occurs, i.e., \"pull on it until it breaks\".\r\nThis is fine if one is interested only in the gross properties of\r\nthe material.  However, if one wants to understand the reasons for\r\nmaterial failure then one must have recourse to mathematical models\r\nof the material.  Experiments on certain rubbery polymers, called\r\nelastomers, have shown that when one pulls on an elastomer small\r\nholes appear in the material.  These holes then grow in size and\r\ncombine to form cracks.  A similar phenomenon has been observed in\r\noptical fibers.  Catastrophic failure, due to a series of holes\r\nthat cascade down the core of the fiber, can occur when excessive\r\npower is applied.  These holes seriously degrade the ability of the\r\nfiber to transmit information.  In this grant, the principal\r\ninvestigator will uncover the mechanisms that cause the creation\r\nand growth of holes in polymers and glasses by examining systems of\r\npartial differential equations from the theory of elasticity and\r\nviscoelasticity.\r\n",
