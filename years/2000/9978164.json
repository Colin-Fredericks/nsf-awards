SEARCDE's primary objective is to promote research and education in the field of differential equations by bringing together established and new researchers, including advanced graduate students, for the exchange of ideas and the discussion of recent developments in the field.  By covering a wide range of topics, including ordinary and partial differential equations, integral and functional equations, numerical methods, inverse problems, and applications to the sciences and engineering, these conferences expose participants to current research outside of their immediate area of concentration.  They provide opportunities for all participants to present their own work in contributed talks, to interact with other researchers from the region and beyond, and to broaden their knowledge of the field by hearing the invited lectures of eminent mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe field of differential equations continues to be one of the driving forces of mathematical research and its applications.  With its special format, chosen to minimize the cost and inconvenience of participation, and its traditional emphasis on the support of young mathematicians, SEARCDE brings together established and new researchers in this field from a vast region of the country on a regular basis.  The conference thereby provides unique opportunities for the advancement of research and education in the broad field of differential equations, as well as its myriad applications in the sciences and engineering.  In addition, this conference provides opportunities for young researchers to present their work to an expert audience and to further their knowledge of the field by interacting with more experienced mathematicians.  Such interaction is crucial to a young mathematician's professional development as a researcher and educator.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
