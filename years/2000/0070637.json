The Pelican is a 105 ft. vessel, constructed in 1985, and owned and operated by LUMCON.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 244 operational days during 2000, of which 56 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support NOAA, Navy, other federal agency and private projects.  The projects scheduled on the Pelican represent several oceanographic disciplines, such as biological and physical oceanography, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel.  Operations will take place regionally in the Gulf of Mexico. \r\n\r\nChanges in personnel in late 1998 seem to be working well.  2000 rollover funds were available as a result of scientists needing fewer number of cruise days.  The major refit plan for the pelican will be postponed since funds from Louisiana State were not allocated.  The refit will either take place in late 2000 or more likely 2001.  In 1998-99 the majority of the MOSA account was spent, however no major overhaul costs are planned for 2000.  The University is instituting in indirect cost rate on TDC.\r\n\r\nThe Pelican is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
