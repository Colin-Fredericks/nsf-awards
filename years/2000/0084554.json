 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluid flow through porous materials is critical for understanding and predicting the behavior of systems as diverse in function and scale as hydrocarbon reservoirs, aquifers, separation tower and\r\nreactor units with packed beds, filters, membrane separators and even catalytic converters.  Recently, there has been a thrust to incorporate more physics in reservoir simulations, as well as a\r\ncall for substantial improvements in computational capability through the use of High Performance Computing (HPC), in order to improve reservoir management. This need has\r\nbecome particularly critical as oil and gas prices have fluctuated within one year from the lowest\r\nlevel of the past two decades to the highest. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated\r\nsimulator for flow through heterogeneous porous materials using a hierarchy of simulations.\r\nCurrent approaches involve the use of simulations having a single physical scale. However,\r\nrecent advances in HPC have made it possible to increase significantly the problem size and to\r\nuse more sophisticated approaches. The challenge is to combine the individual simulations into an\r\nintegrated multiscale system that will be able to include all physical scales and will self-adjust in\r\naccordance with the input data. Emphasis will be placed on the portability, scalability, efficiency\r\nand extensibility of the final product. The proposed simulator will be an improved prediction tool\r\nfor hydrocarbon reservoir management and will be ready for use on integrated grid architectures,\r\nas they become available.\r\n\r\nFlow through porous media is a multi-scale phenomenon. Microscopic scale simulation, based on\r\nLattice Boltzmann Methods, will be used for the direct simulation of flow through porous materials. Microtomographic digital images of rock samples will be used to realistically\r\nrepresent the spatial domain subjected to flow, taking advantage of the flexibility of Lattice\r\nBoltzmann Methods. At the mesoscopic scale, stochastic methods will be used for the systematic\r\nisolation and study of the effects of microscopic features of rock structure on the flow field. The\r\nstochastic approach will also be used to develop a method for rock property characterization. A\r\nmacroscopic simulation, based on conventional finite difference methods, will be used to test the\r\nimpact of modified flow models on hydrocarbon production at reservoir scale. The macroscopic\r\nsimulation will incorporate the behavior of production/injection wells (which form singularities in\r\na reservoir model) over the life of a reservoir. It will also incorporate coupling of flow with\r\ngeomechanics (porosity-dependent permeability and non-Darcy coefficients). The education\r\neffort resulting from this project will emphasize the training of undergraduate students in the use\r\nof HPC resources.\r\n\r\nThis research will: (i) improve our understanding of the fundamental flow mechanisms;\r\n(ii) update the model for non-Darcy flow through anisotropic porous materials; and (iii) integrate\r\nthe presence of discontinuities, such as wells and fractures, in the simulation. The innovations of\r\nthe proposed study include: (a) use of state-of-the-art simulations at different scales; (b) use of\r\nexperimentally measured quantities to deduce the properties of the porous medium and to update\r\nflow models; (c) integration of the individual components of a set of prototype software into a\r\nseamless simulator for industrial use; and (d) application of a hybrid of shared-memory and\r\ndistributed parallelism to achieve scalability on a variety of HPC architectures.  The research project will be extremely valuable for the educational experience of the graduate students involved. Its educational aspect will also involve the incorporation of HPC  applications in the undergraduate curricula of three Departments and the development of research projects for Research Experience for Undergraduates. It will, thus, prepare a large group of the technical workforce of our State to the useful aspects of HPC applications and to interact with HPC infrastructure.\r\n",
