Freudenburg of University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Dr. Freudenburg's Ph.D. student, Ms. Dana Fisher, will conduct part of her Ph.D. research in Japan and the Netherlands.  Ms. Fisher will spend 2 months in Japan to work with Professor Tsuneyuki Maorta, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Graduate School of Decision Science and Technology.  She will also spend 3 months in the Netherlands to work with Dr. Arthur P. J. Moi, Wageningen University of the Netherlands, Department of Social Sciences, Environmental Sociology Group. The research project will test the theory of ecological modernization by specifically examining the differing responses of Japan, the U.S., and the Netherlands to the Kyoto Protocol from an ecological modernization perspective.\r\n\r\nOne of the key challenges facing the effort to deal with global environmental change is to understand different nation-states' responses to global environmental issues and proposed regulations.  This project proposes to link ecological modernization theory with models of the polity to give a more complete account of the factors affecting government regulation of environmental problems in different nations.  Both quantitative and qualitative research methods will be incorporated to test ecological modernization theory.  The quantitative portion of the research analyzes certain social, economic and environmental characteristics of all of the OECD nations, and systematically assesses claims about the relation between economic development and environmental quality.  The qualitative portion of the research looks at the main actors involved in the debates surrounding implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.  Interviews with a sample of important actors from the government, industry, media, science and the NGO sectors in these countries will be carried out.  This dissertation research will provide some interesting information about the political landscape for environmental regulation in these countries.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
