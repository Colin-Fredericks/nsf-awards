 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main thrust of this project is to build new materials on the foundation of information that EASI has compiled and disseminated in previous NSF grant projects.  In addition to the new materials, EASI has identified critical new audiences that must be reached if individuals with disabilities are going to be integrated into the science, mathematics, engineering and technology fields.  To most effectively deliver EASI's message and information the project is relying on innovative multimedia techniques to disseminate the materials.\r\n     Specifically, EASI is creating a modular array of materials that will include SMET information relevant to K-12 audiences, post-secondary education and the business community.  While EASI has focused primarily on the educational aspect of SMET in past years, EASI believes and is aware of accessibility issues and requirements that are critical to reach the business community and make them aware of the potential of individuals with disabilities and issues and requirements.  Additionally, EASI wants to take a first step toward helping individuals with disabilities and issues and requirements.  Additionally, EASI wants to take a first step toward helping individuals with disabilities enter the workplace by establishing an intern program as one aspect of this project.\r\n     To get the widest dissemination in the most cost-effective manner, EASI will use the Internet, live presentations and print media to disseminate these materials.  EASI has been experimenting with innovative uses of multimedia, including Web broadcasts, on-line courses,  on-line discussion lists, audiotapes and videotapes.  All of these methods have shown impressive results.\r\n     While EASI is doing the primary work of this project, the administrator of the grant is the TLT (Teaching, Learning and Technology) Group.  A non-profit corporation, the TLT Group is an affiliate of AAHE (American Association for Higher Education).  AAHE was the administrator of previous EASI/NSF grants.  The TLT Group's mission is to provide materials and services that motivate and enable institutions to improve teaching and learning with technology while helping them cope with ongoing change.  The TLT Group has a network of over 350 TLT Roundtable Groups which are comprised of technical support staff, faculty, librarians, and administrators.  Many of these people are part of EASI's targeted new audiences.\r\n",
