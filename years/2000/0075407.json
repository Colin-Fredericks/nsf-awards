Research under this grant is directed towards specifying a complete decision support and information architecture that enables automated negotiation among firms and improves overall performance of these Flexible Production Networks (FPNs). In support of this objective, the investigators have identified four high-impact research areas:\r\n1)  Simulation, modeling, and analysis of FPN operation under imperfect information; 2) Capacity and cost models for firms that exist in multiple FPNs; 3) Generation of information 'wrappers' that tie firms' existing information systems to an information hub infrastructure; 4) Information models for representing complex FPN operations.  Each of these four areas is critical to achieving a feasible computational infrastructure that represents the diverse production technologies within the FPN, while addressing issues of scalability, rapid deployment, and decentralized operation.\r\n\r\nSuccessful conclusion of this research will generate advances in operational support for firms existing within FPNs, as well as broader advances in theory concerning the deployment of information and decision support systems in a multi-firm environment.  Current industrial initiatives in extended-enterprise resource planning systems are a positive step towards deployment and simplification of electronic transactions; however, they lack a framework for analysis and decision support for production involving a network of firms. Research under this grant provides such a framework, with a focus on low overhead, dynamic deployment of a computational, and flexible and scalable decision support for decentralized, multi-firm operations.  Research in these areas will also broaden existing theory in decision support and computer science, where current models tend towards exact analysis and representation of limited or highly specific systems.  In a broad sense, this work will re-focus current capabilities towards supporting more complex, flexible systems.\r\n\r\n",
