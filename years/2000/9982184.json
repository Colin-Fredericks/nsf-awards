 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mammalian cerebral cortex is the vastly complex and enigmatic\r\nneural structure responsible for cognitive abilities such as reasoning,\r\nimagining and perceiving.  A very useful model system for investigation of\r\nthe poorly understood cellular mechanisms underlying cortical function is\r\nthe rat somatosensory cortex, which contains discrete columns or \"barrels\"\r\nof vertically-aligned, input-specific cells that process sensory\r\ninformation from a single whisker.  Barrel cortex has six layers (I-VI),\r\neach comprised of cells with characteristic electrophysiological,\r\nmorphological and/or connectional properties.  The functional integrity of\r\ninput-specific barrels is dependent upon a balance of inhibitory and\r\nexcitatory interactions of local inhibitory cells (interneurons) and\r\nexcitatory output cells (pyramidal cells) between and within layers.  In\r\nrecent years, progress has been made in detailing the characteristics and\r\ninteractions of cells in layers II-VI of cerebral cortex, but little is\r\nknown of the properties of Layer I (LI) neurons and virtually nothing is\r\nknown of the role(s) they play in the microcircuitry of cortical columns.\r\nThis is a very significant gap, because LI is ubiquitous throughout the\r\ncerebral cortex, and, unlike other cortical layers, contains a cellular\r\npopulation comprised almost exclusively of inhibitory interneurons.  LI\r\ncells are strategically positioned to exert profound inhibitory influences\r\non pyramidal output cells, which receive many intra- and extracortical\r\ninputs on their complex processes in LI.  The goal of the proposed studies\r\nis to gain an understanding of the role of LI neurons in functional columns\r\nof cerebral cortex using the rat barrel cortex as a model system.  The\r\noverall hypothesis is that LI interneurons can be grouped into distinct\r\nclasses that play important roles in maintaining input-specific sensory\r\nintegration within and between barrels, through distinct inhibitory actions\r\non LII/III pyramidal cells and on other LI neurons. Physiological\r\nrecordings with intracellular biocytin filling of LI interneurons and\r\nLII/III pyramidal cells in in vitro  slices of rat barrel cortex will be\r\nemployed in experiments designed to test this hypothesis. Data from these\r\nstudies will yield vital information on the role of distinct classes of\r\ninterneurons in the cortical circuits responsible for integration of\r\nsensory information.\r\n\r\n",
