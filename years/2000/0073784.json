 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yellowstone National Park (YNP) represents a unique setting wherein significant geothermal activity occurs. These thermal areas include aquatic systems as well as soils, and vary significantly with respect to temperature, chemistry, and physical properties.  There is an exceptional opportunity to observe, follow, and quantify changes in a soil microbial population that occur in response to elevated temperature.  Typically, environments that are the focus of thermophile investigations are mature, established geothermal features (relative to the human experience and known records).  This preemptive study will take advantage of naturally occurring temperature gradients that have recently surfaced across the landscape at one specific location in YNP.  These recent changes provide a rare opportunity, whereby thermophiles and/or the development of thermophile communities can be studied in real time.  As opposed to other neothermal environments such as deep sea vents which are logistically difficult to access, the research site is easily accessible and sampled.  Using a combination of molecular and culturing techniques, the microbial community in this evolving thermal environment is being studied over time, with apparent alterations in community structure being correlated with changes in soil temperature and chemical properties.\r\n\r\n",
