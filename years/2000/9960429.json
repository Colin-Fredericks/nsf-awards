 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from is directed at demonstrating the feasibility of using Information Extraction, a computer technology based on Natural Language Processing, to selectively extract key information from the running text of synthetic procedures.  Synthetic procedures are batch recipes used in the creation and discovery of new chemical entities for drug discovery.  The ultimate aim of the project is to automate information extraction and place the information in a computer- understandable data structure that fully captures the content and semantics of the synthetic procedure.  Such data structures dramatically increase the value of synthetic procedures since they allow development and deployment of software applications that automate many common time-and labor-intensive tasks in chemical synthesis.  The objectives of this Phase I research project are to design and prototype critical software elements of Information Extraction.  Feasibility of the approach will be demonstrated by using the developed elements to automatically perform some common tasks that currently require manual intervention by a chemistry expert.  Demonstration tasks will include the following: automated creation of synthetic procedure domain ontology; creation of list of materials; and automated text extraction rule induction.\r\n\r\nThere are recipes for more than 19 million unique chemical compounds reported in the public literature.  There are a comparable number in the archives of pharmaceutical companies.  Overwhelmingly, these procedures are maintained as unstructured running text.  IntelliChem's proffered extraction of synthetic procedure information into computer-understandable data structures enhances the value of a procedure, promotes information reuse, and provides a basis for automating many time- and labor-intensive tasks in chemical synthesis.  The proposed system will also provide insights into the automated linguistic analysis of semistructured text in other domains that are sufficiently narrow and well organized, and thus it would be generalizable for many other potential applications and uses.",
