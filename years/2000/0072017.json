This grant contains a collaboration with G. A. Melkov, Ukraine, and has been co-funded by the INT division.  The PI has an illustrious record in the study of nonlinear spin-wave phenomena in thin magnetic films.  In general his interests lie in the study of nonlinear wave dynamics in dispersive, diffractive and weakly dissipative media.  This renewal grant focuses on 1-d and 2-d nonlinear spin waves, including (1) generation of bright spin wave envelope solitons by a linear source, (2) non-adiabatic interaction of a propagating wave packet with strongly localized parametric pumping and (3) Use of non stationary parametric pumping to amplify or turn around envelope solitons or 2-d spin wave bullets using 3-wave interaction.  In addition there will be further study of collisions between solitons and bullets and of size dependent quantization of spin wave spectrum in an array of micron size magnetic dots.\r\n%%%\r\nThis RUI grant for research in an undergraduate institution also contains support for a strong international collaboration.  It has been co-funded by the INT division. The grant supports a continuation of the PI's research program on non-linear spin waves.  These are large amplitude magnetization waves in a magnet, which occasionally have extraordinary properties and the waves then (similar to a wall of magnetization) are called solitons.  In another circumstances, the waves also resemble bullets.  The research here concerns the properties of solitons and bullets, how they can be created, how there motion can be affected by small and slow changes in the environment, how they bump into each other and what happens afterwards.  The work will be carried out in collaboration with colleagues in Ukraine and Russia.\r\n***\r\n  \r\n",
