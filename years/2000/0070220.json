 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laser-based multiphoton and fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy system will be purchased for research into the mode of action of cardiac muscle fibers, the proliferation of malignant cells, protein-DNA interactions, the imaging of visual cell constituents, and the generation of improved optical techniques to microscopically image cellular components in real tissues.  The laser will be broadly variable in wavelength and intensity, allowing excitation of many biological samples.  This sophisticated equipment will allow many in the research community at the University of Alabama to actively acquire data.  Immediate research goals include (i) determination of distances of movement in molecular \"motor\" proteins, (ii) measurement of DNA structural changes induced by UV light and cellular processes, and (iii) determination of optimal conditions for laser excitation of dyes and cells for microscopic imaging.  Ultimately, the requested instrumentation will be used to discover how subcellular components move and use energy in their activity as biological nanomachines.\r\n\r\nA titanium:sapphire laser (Mira 900D V10 XW) with wide-band optics and dual picosecond/femtosecond pulsewidth capabilities, pumped by a 10-watt diode-pumped Nd:vanadate laser (Verdi V10), with needed harmonic generator (Model 9300) and \"Pulse Picker\" (Model 9200) will be purchased from Coherent Laser Group.  This equipment will allow reliable picosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements and multiphoton excitation spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging.  A vibration-free optics table (Newport RPR-410-12/I-2000-428) and ultrafast photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R3809U-50) with associated electronics will be added to support the laser and detection capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe educational program supported by this award  will develop new research ideas, train personnel in laser and biotechnology, attract top-flight students and faculty, and train regional scientists.  Personnel from professors to promising high school scientists are presently involved in research and training at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  Credit and non-credit research training courses introduce undergraduates and graduate students to principles of new laser technologies and applications in biophysics and imaging.  Biomedical faculty supervise physics graduate doctoral dissertations in biology and biophysics.  The number of major American universities offering such educational programs, especially at the level of training and recruitment of future physical scientists from high school, is small.  Through its strong reputation in mainstream biomedical research and its rapidly-developing reputation in laser technology and biophysics, the University of Alabama at Birmingham has the opportunity to lead in the production of scientists with documented expertise in laser-based spectroscopic and imaging research in biological systems. \r\n\r\n",
