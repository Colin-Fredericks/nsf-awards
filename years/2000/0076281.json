 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to determine the role of mineral and metal ion catalysis in the formation of 3',5'- versus 2',5' -phosphodiester bond formation and in the template-directed synthesis  of RNA.  These studies will provide insight into the possible role of montmorillonite catalysis in the selective prebiotic synthesis of RNA.  The use of catalysts to limit the structural diversity of the RNA formed in prebiotic reactions will result in a greater population of those structures able to initiate life. These RNAs would have the structure capable of both serving as ribozymes and as genetic information storage sites in the proposed RNA world.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. James P. Ferris of the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  Professor Ferris will focus his work on exploring the role of catalysis in prebiotic synthesis.  The experiments, if successful, will provide a major advance in the understanding of life on Earth.  The findings of this work will be of great interest to both the scientific community and to the general public as well.",
