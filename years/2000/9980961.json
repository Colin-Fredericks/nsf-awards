 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) The goal of this project is to upgrade the research training program in physiological psychology at Vassar College.  As a result of the modernization of our teaching/research laboratory space, we are now incorporating more sophisticated techniques for exploring physiological processes that are correlated with behavioral systems.  A main goal of the current project is to incorporate neurochemical techniques, specifically neuropeptide immunocytochemistry and brain enzyme analyses, in this particular course.  A secondary goal is to provide opportunities for students to continue on and incorporate contemporary neurochemical approaches to exploring relationships between physiological and behavioral systems in their advanced independent research projects.  The laboratory exercises are adapted from exercises demonstrated at a Project Kaleidoscope workshop.  The equipment is also being used by faculty, especially the PI of this project, in ongoing faculty research programs, programs that actively involve several undergraduate students each semester. Finally, in addition to enhancing the research training program in the Psychology Department, upgrading of the laboratory component of this course is expected to have substantial positive effects on the curriculum of the Biopsychology Program.",
