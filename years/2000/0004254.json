 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Potomac Institute for Policy Studies will convene a conference in June 2000 to address two broad questions of importance to US Armed Forces:  what opportunities do advances in science offer to US forces and how do scientific advances change the type of threats to US forces.  The workshop will bring together representatives of the military, Congress, and scientific communities to present their views of changes pertinent to these questions.  Specific areas addressed at the workshop include military perspectives on maneuver and power projection and protection, firepower and precision targeting, air warfare, space warfare, information and networking, and intelligence and threat assessment.  Science perspectives on topics such as energy, human factors and neuroscience, nanoscale technologies, information and knowledge, biomedical advances, and advanced materials will also be provided.  The workshop organizers will prepare a report that summarizes the presentations and conclusions.",
