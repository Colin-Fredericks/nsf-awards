However, many researchers in these \r\nareas may not be able to use the existing results \r\nand proof techniques in matrix analysis to develop \r\ntheir theory effectively because their expertise \r\nis not in matrix theory and there is a lack of \r\ncommunication between them and researchers in \r\nmatrix theory. We have considerable experience in \r\nmatrix analysis and have developed, adapted, or \r\nborrowed many techniques to study the subject. In \r\nthis project, they plan to develop and apply matrix\r\nmethods to different problems that arise from \r\napplications.  In addition to proving the necessary \r\nresults we will put them in more general and \r\naccessible settings, so that the new results and\r\ntechniques can be readily used by non-specialists.  \r\n\r\nMatrix analysis is a basic tool in the physical \r\nand social sciences, applied mathematics, statistics \r\nand engineering. Matrices are a way of organizing \r\nand analyzing data.  Sometimes simple results in \r\nmatrix analysis are all that are needed, however, \r\noften one needs rather subtle results. Most \r\nscientists and engineers receive an only an\r\nintroduction to matrices.  We will develop and \r\napply matrix methods to a variety of applied \r\nproblems and will disseminate our results and\r\ntechniques to researchers in these applied areas.  \r\nOur goal is to advance the boundaries in matrix \r\nanalysis and equip applied researchers. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
