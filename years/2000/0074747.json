 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop technical cost models to assess the solid oxide fuel cell technology.  The program will focus on developing the required skills and methodologies for doing the assessments.  Presently, cost is estimated using the averaged cost factors derived from those used for conventional power plants.  The cost calculations give little insight to critical design or strategic decision questions.  The use of technical cost models based on engineering insight will provide guidance as to the competitiveness of materials or processing choices.  The primary focus will be on acquiring tools and methodologies. \r\n\r\nThis research should provide methodologies for using technical cost models with fuel cell technology being used as a case study.  The effort will progress from the cell component level to the level responsible for considering materials and processing choices. The project will provide decision-makers with the ability to design, determine the materials required, and processing alternatives. \r\n",
