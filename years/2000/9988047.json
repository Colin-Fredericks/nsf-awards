This commitment is reflected in the fact that each faculty members maintains a research program that invites and encourages student participation.  The current REU program has greatly enhanced student-faculty interactions in the research community.  The proposed program includes both part-time positions during the academic year and full-time summer positions in order to meet the needs of a variety of students.  The program is particularly oriented towards recruiting and retaining women and students from minorities traditionally underrepresented in science.  The program also strives to provide research experience to those who might not have such opportunities at their home institutions.  In the current program, it has been found that the increasing success in reaching these goals is due primarily to relationships established with a local community college that educates many students from underrepresented minority groups.  The impact of the program on the career trajectories of these students is exceptional--nearly all are now pursuing further education and research positions in the sciences.  The program will be strengthen our by establishing a relationship with a second local community college.  Funding provided by NSF will be partially matched by Pomona College  to accommodate 20 part-time academic year and 8 full-time summer positions annually.  Each student in the program will collaborate with a faculty advisor on a project in one of a variety of fields including genetics, molecular biology, developmental biology, population biology, ecology, animal behavior, endocrinology, neurobiology and physiology.  Students will participate in regular meetings within their research group as well as a number of activities that will both enrich the research community and involve others who are not yet involved in research.  These activities will include a series of informal research lunches, student-hosted lab open houses, and a formal poster presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
