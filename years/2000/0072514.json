 "awd_abstract_narration": "T. Healey and P. Rosakis plan to study various problems from solid continuum\r\nmechanics governed by nonlinear partial differential equations.  A major\r\nthrust of the proposed work will be on the static morphology and dynamic\r\nevolution of microstructure due to phase transitions in two-dimensional\r\nmodels of shape-memory alloys.  In contrast to well-known absolute,\r\nminimum-energy approaches to the statics problem, we plan to employ modern\r\ntechniques of symmetry-breaking, bifurcation theory.  The latter enables\r\nsystematic determination of metastable states, which we believe our ensuing\r\ndynamical studies will show to be associated with hysteresis.  Another\r\naspect of the work will involve applications of a generalized topological degree\r\n(developed previously by Healey & Simpson) to global bifurcation problems\r\nof nonlinear elasticity - these will be the first such results in\r\nthree-dimensional elasticity.  The overall goals of the work are to detect\r\nnew nonlinear phenomena, obtain constitutive restrictions that are both\r\nphysically and mathematically reasonable for general classes of materials,\r\nand to develop new tools/approaches to such nonlinear problems - both\r\nanalytical and computational.  The proposed approach comprises a blend of\r\nsolid continuum mechanics, materials science, nonlinear analysis, symmetry\r\nand group-theoretic methods and computation.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of models of nonlinear materials at a very general level is fundamental \r\nto the understanding of shape-memory effects in certain advanced engineering\r\nalloys as well as more traditional engineering materials/structures.  The\r\nproposed investigation is strongly interdisciplinary, combining models and\r\ntechniques from mechanics, materials science and modern mathematics.\r\nBroadly speaking the work will provide new mathematical approaches to\r\ndifficult nonlinear problems arising in structural/mechanical engineering\r\nand materials sciences.  This has the potentia of leading to a better understanding of\r\nmaterial behavior and design - including the design of \"smart\" structures.\r\n\r\n",
