 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wiseman will conduct research applicable to the detection of gravitational waves.  The research will have two distinct components:  (1) participation in practical software implementations of searches for signals from astrophysical sources (about 60%), and (2) theoretical calculations of expected gravitational-wave signals from highly relativistic orbiting binary star systems (about 40%).  The first is highly collaborative research and will include taking on the duties of ``Software Coordinator'' for LIGO Scientific collaboration (LSC), as well conducting Mock Data Challenges to test the software and algorithms being implemented.  The second part is largely an independent effort to study the nature of radiation reaction effects in  curved space time. This, in turn leads to better theoretical understanding of the astrophysical sources that produce the radiation.  Together these form a healthy mix of practical and theoretical research, as well as collaborative and independent work.\r\n\r\nOver the past ten years Wiseman has participated in a broad collaboration to use post-Newtonian techniques to calculate the chirp waveform produced by  binary star systems (e.g. pairs of neutron stars or black holes).  In recent years, he has broadened his efforts to to study the problem of radiation in curved spacetime.  Continuation of these efforts will improve our quantitative understanding of the signals produced by highly relativistic inspiralling coalescing binaries. This, in turn, improves our ability to find these signal buried in detector noise.\r\n",
