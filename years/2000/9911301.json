Frank\r\n \r\nThe Role of Memory Retrieval in Probability Judgment\r\n \r\nPeople are often overconfident about their answers to general knowledge\r\nquestions (e.g. whether chimpanzees have longer or shorter gestation\r\nperiods than humans).  And there is ample evidence that \"real world\"\r\njudgments, such as physicians' diagnoses of myocardial infarction, are\r\noften less than ideal in a similar way.  The proposed research is intended\r\nto further develop and test a recently proposed model which asserts that\r\nfeatures of how people bring to mind (\"recruit\") arguments pertinent to a\r\ngiven judgment situation lead to deficient judgment.  This research is\r\nfurther anticipated to illuminate procedures that yield improved\r\njudgments.  The \"argument recruitment model\" proposes that people rarely\r\nbase their judgments on more than a few facts or arguments.  And when they\r\ndo bring to mind multiple arguments from memory, the ones retrieved later\r\nin the process tend only to support those presented earlier.  The model\r\npredicts that judgment should be improved if the amounts and \"balance\" of\r\nretrieval of facts from memory are changed.  Thus, the primary\r\nmanipulation to be explored in this research is that of requesting study\r\nparticipants to recall all of the relevant facts (e.g., similar previous\r\ncases) they can prior to rendering their judgments.  Support for the model\r\nwill be indicated to the extent that such demands tend to reduce the\r\noverconfidence evident in participants' judgments. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
