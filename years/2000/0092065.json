Whitaker\r\n\r\nInstitution --- University of Utah\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the question of how to automatically generate 3D \r\ncomputer models of objects and scenes using data from a range finding \r\ndevice, such as a laser range scanner, sonar, ultrasound, or radar.  Such \r\n3D computer models are important in a wide range of applications including \r\ndefense surveillance, forensics, teaching, and medicine.  Range measuring \r\ndevices typically sweep a beam of energy to gather many millions of 3D \r\nmeasurements from surfaces of objects but they have some limitations.  \r\nFirst, because not all object are visible from a single point of view, a \r\nsingle sweep is incomplete.  Second, each individual range measurement is \r\nnot necessarily accurate because the measurement process is inherently \r\nnoisy.  The strategy is to systematically fuse together many measurements \r\nfrom different points of view in order to create accurate, complete 3D \r\nmodels.  This project examines some of the fundamental mathematical \r\nquestions pertaining to this process and then studies how to implement and \r\ndemonstrate this theory on real data.\r\n\r\nRange-finding devices measure distances to objects by reflecting energy off \r\nof the interfaces between different types of materials, but they provide a \r\nnoisy, mathematically complex, and highly nonlinear transformation from a \r\ncollection of surfaces to a set 2D depth maps.  This project will develop \r\nstatistical methods for estimating manifolds from this kind of data, \r\nthereby generalizing the current state of the art in estimation theory, \r\nwhich is primarily concerned with estimating functions or fields.  Thus, \r\nthe goal is to provide a general, complete, and practical foundation for 3D \r\nsurface reconstruction.  The strategy is to find the surface that maximizes \r\nthe posterior probability conditional on a collection of range measurements \r\ntaken from different points of view.  The reconstruction framework is \r\nBayesian; it includes a sensor model as well as prior knowledge about the \r\ncharacteristics of the object or scenes being modeled.  This work will \r\naddress a number of important issues pertaining to this statistical \r\nmethodology for building 3D models, including better sensor models, \r\nhigh-order priors, fast and robust algorithms, and broader applications.  \r\nThese developments will comprise a fundamental scientific result: the \r\ngeneralization of the basic principles of estimation theory to the \r\nchallenging and timely problem of 3D surface reconstruction.",
