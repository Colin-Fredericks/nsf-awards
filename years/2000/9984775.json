 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this study is to integrate fundamental research with education in order to explore, understand and control the development of electrodeposited nanocomposite materials. The knowledge gained will be used to create a new class of composite materials and provide novel processing methods for electrodeposited metals. Inert, ultrafine particles are suspended in an electroplating solution and are embedded into the growing metal. The research aspect is divided into three parts: 1) experimental parameter exploration of thin nanocomposite films, 2) mathematical modeling and 3) experimental investigation of high aspect ratio nanocomposite deposits. Nanocomposite materials that are highlighted will offer improved strength and wear resistant properties. Nanometric size particles codeposited with metals may also be of interest for the control of the metal deposit structure and the local, metal deposition rate. \r\nThe research effort will be merged with an educational component. A newly created course at Louisiana State University (LSU), Electrochemical Engineering, will adopt a nanocomposite \"class-system\" that will be examined as a group using the techniques learned during lectures. Teaching methods will take advantage of computer generated partial notes that are to be completed with the student interactively. In addition, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in a research effort through graduate research and semester projects, respectively. Students will have the unique opportunity to take advantage of a university run synchrotron at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD) to fabricate microstructured nanocomposites and to examine them. In addition, students at all levels can participate in a monthly informal seminar series for microsystems at LSU, which encompasses several interdisciplinary departments. \r\n\r\n",
