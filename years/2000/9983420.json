 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project for clean and efficient combustion of liquid fuels is of importance in many technologies including internal combustion engines, gas turbines, waste-incineration and, more recently, advanced materials processing.  The efficiency of the thermal combustion of a fuel controls the efficiency and emissions of a process.  Two governing factors in the combustion of a liquid fuel are atomization and vaporization of the liquid prior to its ignition.  Two advanced thin film coating deposition techniques utilize the combustion of a liquid fuel containing a dissolved metal complex to deposit films of desired materials on to substrates.  The first, flame spray pyrolysis, is a rapid deposition process yielding\r\nthick films, however, the films are generally of poor quality due to inefficient atomization.  This leads to rough films of low density and purity.  In contrast, combustion chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) utilizes an efficient atomization and vaporization process that makes it a true vapor deposition method.  The CCVD process incorporates a patented atomization method for liquid fuels, trademarked as the Nanomiser.  The Phase I\r\neffort studied the flame physics and chemistry of the deposition of high quality barium strontium titanate (BSTO) thin films by CCVD.  BSTO is a high performance ferroelectric.  This Phase II project will build upon the results of Phase I by expanding the levels of analysis and modeling of the CCVD process to develop a thorough, predictive model and thereby improve the CCVD process.  The data and models developed in Phase II will be of extreme importance to spray combustion processes in general.\r\n\r\nMCT is targeting development of high quality thin film materials for use in electronics, corrosion protection, optical coatings, nanopowders, superconductors, fuel cells as well as other applications yielding a potential multibillion dollar market.  Results from this research will be used to increase combustion efficiency and satisfy key requirements for performance of thin film ferroelectrics.  This will enable commercialization of the CCVD process applications through a combination of R&D services, advanced license agreements and pilot production services.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
