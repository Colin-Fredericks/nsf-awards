During the last few years considerable effort has been devoted to the acquisition of records of the short transitional periods during which the field reverses polarity. Thus, today one of the most exciting geophysical measurements being made is the detailed recording of the Earth's magnetic field in transitions between polarities. Much of the current interest in geomagnetic field reversals is concentrated on documenting the detailed field behavior during polarity reversals in order to constrain the various models of the geomagnetic dynamo. Detailed polarity transition records are necessary in order to understand the reversal processes generated in the Earth's core. The investigators propose to study volcanic records of three successive polarity transitions located in two different sections found in the Wai'anae volcano, O'ahu, Hawaii. These reversals are the Upper Mammoth (R-N), the Lower (N-R) and Upper Kaena (R-N). In this one-year project, the investigators will drill both sections, perform the necessary paleomagnetic and rock-magnetic laboratory measurements, and complete analysis and interpretation of the results. This detailed study of the transitional behavior of the paleofield of those reversals will also serve as the basis for the construction of the magnetostratigraphy of the Wai'anae volcano. The results will provide insight into the paleofield behavior from the Gilbert-Gauss to the Upper Kaena reversals and their relationship to the geodynamo.  \r\n",
