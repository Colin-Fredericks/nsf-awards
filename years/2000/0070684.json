 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA major goal of this proposal is to understand the role of fixed and\r\nfree boundaries in rigorous nonlinear geometric optics.  The central\r\nimportance of boundaries is indicated, for example, by the fact that\r\nmultidimensional shock and vortex sheet problems can be formulated as\r\nnonlinear hyperbolic free boundary problems.  The author proposes to\r\ncontinue his work on geometric optics for quasilinear boundary problems\r\nand multidimensional strong shocks, and to extend it to weak shocks; to\r\nstudy the evolution of boundary layers in quasilinear fixed and free\r\nboundary problems, especially the role of glancing boundary layers in a\r\nnew mechanism for shock instability; to construct Rayleigh waves in\r\nnonlinear elasticity as propagating elliptic boundary layers and to\r\ninvestigate their nonlinear (resonant) interactions with other waves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe construction of formal, asymptotic solutions to nonlinear PDEs\r\n(nonlinear geometric optics) has long been an important tool of applied\r\nmathematics.  Formal solutions  yield qualititive information about many\r\ncomplex wave phenomena  such as resonance, shocks, Mach stems, and vortex\r\nsheets, and can be used to predict and explain the results of physical or\r\nnumerical experiments.  An important task for pure mathematicians is to\r\nrigorously justify such expansions, that is, to show that they are close\r\nto genuine exact solutions.  Rigorous analysis also leads to the discovery\r\nof unexpected phenomena, such as new blow-up mechanisms, for example.\r\n\r\n",
