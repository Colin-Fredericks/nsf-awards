CFLOBDDs share many of the\r\n     good properties of OBDDs, but can lead to data structures of\r\n     drastically smaller size -- exponentially smaller than OBDDs, in\r\n     fact.  That is, an OBDD is a data structure that -- in the best\r\n     case -- yields an exponential reduction in the size of the\r\n     representation of a Boolean function (i.e., compared with the\r\n     size of the decision tree for the function).  In contrast, a\r\n     CFLOBDD -- again, in the best case -- yields a doubly exponential\r\n     reduction in the size of the representation of a Boolean\r\n     function.  Although not every Boolean function has such a highly\r\n     compressed representation, the project with see how far this\r\n     idea can be pushed.  The hope is that doubly-exponential compression \r\n     is a tool that would (a) permit verification to be performed much \r\n     faster, and (b) allow much larger verification problems to be attacked \r\n     than has heretofore been possible.\r\n",
