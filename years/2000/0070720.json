 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most enduring problems of prime number theory is to determine\r\nhow many elements remain when a set of numbers is sieved.  There is a large\r\nliterature on this topic, originating in seminal papers of Viggo Brun in 1914,\r\nbut even today the best known bounds are either not optimal or not proved\r\nto be optimal.  By starting with a simple sieving situation and then moving\r\nincrementally to more complicated configurations, it is hoped that optimal\r\nbounds can be found, accompanied by proofs of optimality.  The past work\r\non the PI on the pair correlation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function\r\nhas been interpreted as providing evidence that the zeros are spectral\r\nin nature.  The Pair Correlation Conjecture itself is equivalent to an\r\nassertion concerning the mean square distribution of primes in short intervals.\r\nIn new work with k. Soundararajan, it is proposed to extend the second moment\r\nheuristics to other moments, and hence develop heuristics concerning the\r\ndistribution function of primes in short intervals.  It is hope that this\r\nnew information, when interpreted in terms of zeros of the zeta function,\r\nwill provide further insights concerning the distribution of the zeros,\r\nincluding the Riemann Hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe seemingly irregular distribution of prime numbers has been a puzzle\r\nto mathematicians for many centuries.  In the early 20th century, new\r\nideas were introduced, which allowed one to deal with sieving for primes\r\nas a problem of linear programming.  This led to many new results, but\r\neven today the linear programming extremals remain to be found in most\r\nsituations.  By starting with a simple situation and moving incrementally\r\nto more complicated ones, it is hoped that it will at last be\r\npossible to locate the extremal configurations.  Heuristics concerning\r\nthe distribution of primes in short intervals can be developed from the\r\nHardy--Littlewood prime k-tuple conjecture, and the insights gained from\r\nsuch reasoning has an impact on other aspects of prime number theory,\r\nincluding the famous Riemann Hypothesis which dates from 1860.",
