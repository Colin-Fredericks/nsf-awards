 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Symposium on \"Structural Aspects of Protein Synthesis\" is an interdisciplinary meeting which aims to provide a forum for discussion and informal exchange among scientists from different backgrounds, on the theme of ribosome structure and its dynamic changes and interactions with ligands during protein synthesis.  The goal is to understand the molecular basis of protein synthesis as a dynamic process, and its regulation within the cells, based on recent results of structural research.   As the structure is determined to atomic resolution, the structure of the ribosome components are solved, and dynamic information is available from cryo-EM, a reinterpretation of much of the experimental information toward a dynamic model of protein synthesis is possible.  The format of the conference will provide for formal and informal exchange of information and ideas among scientists that is not possible in large meetings.    All participants will be invited to submit abstracts of posters, and a website address will be distributed to the scientific community.   Final abstracts of presentation and posters will be placed on the website enabling wider distribution.  \r\n\r\n",
