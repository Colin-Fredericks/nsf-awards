Nussbaum, Department of Mathematics, Cornell\r\nUniversity, Ithaca, NY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concept of asymptotic equivalence of experiments serves to compare\r\nproperties of statistical models. An experiment is a family of probability\r\nmeasures; a distance is defined between these objects such that the\r\ninformational content of experiments with respect to the parameter is\r\nsimilar if this distance is small. This basic deficiency pseudodistance \r\n(or Delta-distance) has been introduced by L. Le Cam, generalizing the\r\nconcept of sufficiency. If experiments are equivalent via sufficiency\r\nthen their Delta-distance is 0; here equivalence via sufficiency\r\nmeans that one experiment results from application of a sufficient statistic\r\nto the data of the other.\r\n\r\nBased on the idea of the Delta-distance, a theory of local\r\nasymptotic normality (LAN-theory) of experiments has been developed which\r\nhas found widespread application in statistics. The idea of data reduction\r\nwhich is at the heart of the sufficiency concept could thus be combined with\r\nlimit theorems of probability, resulting in approximation of general\r\nstatistical models by Gaussian shift families. These Gaussian shift or\r\ntranslation families allow explicit expression for risk bounds in many\r\ninstances, and these risk bound then become valid in an asymptotic sense in\r\nthe approximated models.\r\n\r\nThe limitation of the LAN-theory consists in its restriction to a\r\nlocal setting, in which the rate of localization is tied to the\r\nnormalization rate in the central limit theorem (the classical root-n in\r\nmost cases). This setting precludes application of the resulting risk bounds\r\nto the class of ill-posed function estimation problems. The emphasis of the\r\ncurrent project is on the treatment of this problem class (which includes\r\nnonparametric density estimation) by methods involving the Delta-distance.\r\n\r\nThe restriction to a local setting (or alternatively, a finite dimensional\r\nsetting) which is inherent in the LAN-theory has been overcome in recent\r\nyears, by efforts of Brown and Low (1996) and by various\r\nresults of the P.I. and collaborators, starting also in 1996 \r\n(asymptotic equivalence of density estimation and Gaussian white noise). \r\nThe main tool has been approximation of general likelihood processes by Gaussian\r\nones, using coupling methodology. The present project focuses on elaboration\r\nand extension of these results, with two main directions:\r\n\r\n(i) constructive realization of equivalence in nonparametric models,\r\nenabling explicit equivalence mappings (direct transfer of decision\r\nfunctions)\r\n\r\n(ii) equivalences in nonparametric models for dependent data (time series\r\nand diffusion process models).\r\n\r\n",
