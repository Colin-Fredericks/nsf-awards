 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even though women's enrollment in postsecondary institutions and graduation levels continue to increase, their participation in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) remains alarmingly low.  At the root of this problem is the lack of science content knowledge preparation of elementary teachers.  Elementary teachers often are only required to take as many as three science courses for certification, and they often are not exposed to a variety of pedagogical strategies for working effectively with girls in the classroom.  These two factors, combined with a broad and superficial elementary science curriculum, work against making SMET relevant to students at an early age.   At the same time, there is a desperate need to implement innovative and responsive intervention programs.  Therefore, the proposed study will build on current research on gender inclusive teaching, inquiry-based learning, multicultural education, and sociocultural and constructivism to provide an alternate framework for enhancing the academic performance and participation of girls in SMET.\r\n     Hence, we seek to explore the following research questions:\r\n     1.  In what ways does an inquiry-based, sociocultural constructivist, and multicultural orientation to teaching enhance cooperating and preservice teachers' abilities to work effectively with girls in the elementary classroom?\r\n     2.  In what ways does an inquiry-based, sociocultural constructivist, and multicultural orientation to teaching enhance girls' attitudes toward and academic performance in SMET?\r\nIn what ways does an inquiry-based, sociocultural constructivist, and multicultural orientation to teaching help address the factors that negatively influence upper elementary girls' attitudes and academic performance in SMET over a period of three years (i.e., grades 4 though 6)?\r\n     To explore these research questions, a three-year longitudinal study will be conducted. Three two-week summer institutes for 36 elementary teachers.  The first institute will start with science, followed by mathematics and science, and then the integration of SMET during the third institute.  Gender inclusive, minds-on activities will be modeled by the principal investigators in collaboration with three master teachers.  Participating teachers will also be responsible for preparing a two-week curriculum unit in teams according to the grade level in which they teach.  Data on pupil attitudes toward and performance grade level in science and mathematics will be gathered via questionnaires, unit pre- and post- content knowledge tests, and ethnographic interviews with a focus group.\r\n     Preservice teachers will be paired with the teachers who participated in the summer workshop to increase the opportunities for professional development.  Finally, the cooperating teachers' growth will be followed up as the girls in their classrooms progress from grades 4 to 6.  Data will be analyzed using an ethnographic approach.  Thus, all participants will be visited regularly using an ethnographic approach.  Thus, all participants will be visited regularly by the research team, and several in-depth interviews and classroom observations will be conducted at key times during the course of the study.  The results of this study should increase our understanding of how to effectively prepare teachers to teach SMET in gender inclusive and socially relevant ways.  Similarly, this study will add insights on how to enhance the academic performance and attitude toward science of girls in diverse elementary schools.\r\n",
