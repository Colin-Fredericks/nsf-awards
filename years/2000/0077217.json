 "awd_abstract_narration": "Higher plants can monitor environmental signals and control growth and development in a manner optimal for the prevailing environment. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms whereby the COP9  signalosome is used to integrate environmental and developmental signals in plants. The COP9  signalosome is an eight-subunit protein complex which was identified and characterized in this laboratory. Molecular cloning and identification of the corresponding COP/DET/FUS loci for each subunit is close to completion. The COP9 signalosome has recently been found in mammals and is probably present in most multicellular organisms. Recent work has suggested that the COP9 complex directly interacts with both a SCF type ubiquitin protein ligase associated with auxin regulation and the 26S proteasome and thus probably plays a role in regulated protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Those findings will be extended and their functional implications in light and auxin regulated development examined. The specific aims of this research are:\r\n\r\n1. The in vivo association of an Arabidopsis CUL 1 containing SCF type ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex with COP9 signalosome will be confirmed and its possible regulation by light and other light regulatory genes investigated,\r\n2. The possible association of the COP9 signalosome with the auxin specific SCFtir1subtype E3 complex and its possible role in regulating auxin controlled physiological responses will be investigated.\r\n3. Yeast two hybrid or in vitro binding assays will be used in combination to examine the pairwise interactions among the COP9 signalosome subunits and between the subunits of SCF complex and the COP9 signalosome. The proteins outside the complexes including COP1, HY5 and the demonstrated nuclear localized phyochromes and crytochromes will also be examined as time allows.\r\n4. The phenotype of the transgenic lines which specifically alter the expression or activity of individual subunits of the COP9 signalosome will be characterized at the morphological, molecular and biochemical levels in both seedlings and adult plants. Weak or inducible phenotypes using reverse genetic approaches will be created in order to investigate both COP9 and possibly subunit function in developmental stages after the seedling stage.  \r\n\r\nAccomplishment of these objectives will reveal fundamental cellular and biochemical functions of the evolutionarily conserved COP9 signalosome and its linkage with the environmental and developmental signals that regulate plant growth.\r\n",
