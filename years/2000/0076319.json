 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to subsidize travel and housing expenses of a select group of US graduate students to attend the ACM International Conference on Autonomous Agents (AGENTS 2000), to be held June 3-7 in Barcelona, Spain.  This is the premier conference devoted entirely to agents research, an area of artificial intelligence which is central to the success of the World Wide Web and the Internet revolution.  Attending the conference will allow a diverse group of graduate students whose research spans a range of topic areas and methodologies to present their work to and receive feedback from the agents community.   The students will be selected by a committee, and special mentoring activities will be planned for them with the goal of fostering interactions with senior researchers.   This, in turn, will help set the directions of future research in the field, and guarantee continued growth and development of agents technology.",
