 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a request for support for the 42nd Maize Genetics Meeting to be held March 18-21, 2000 at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. This meeting includes all members of the maize community and provides an opportunity for graduate students to meet and interact with senior scientists in the field of genetics and biology in a setting conducive to such interaction. The students are given the opportunity to discuss their research ideas at poster sessions and/or talks and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers. The NSF has supported this meeting for all of the years that support has been requested. The reports from scientists who have attended the meetings have been uniformly enthusiastic. Moreover, all knowledgeable scientists would be expected to be attending the meeting and would therefore be in conflict. Thus, as allowed by 122.1-C3(b) in the GPG the proposal was not peer reviewed prior to this recommendation for support. It should be noted that several Programs have contributed to the overall support of this conference: Plant Genomics (DBI), Genetics (MCB), Population Biology (DEB), Developmental Biology (IBN) and Integrative Plant Biology (IBN). Support is enthusiastically recommended.\r\n",
