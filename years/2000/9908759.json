 "awd_abstract_narration": "Girls Dig It Online will expand, refine and field test the Internet-enhanced learning component of Girls Dig It, a nationwide Girls Incorporated archaeology program for girls ages 12-14 currently being piloted at six test sites across the country.  Girls Dig It Online will be piloted at four of the six Girls Dig It pilot sites - Santa Barbara, CA; Bloomington, IN; Lynne, MA; and St. Louis, MO - which have been selected for their archaeological resources and technological readiness.  The program will reach out to low-income girls and girls of color in the critical early adolescent period when girls have traditionally traded in their interest in science, mathematics, and technology for other pursuits.\r\n     Girls Dig It Online will use the popularity of archaeology - a science that captures the imaginations of young people - as a bridge to sustained participation in science and technology education for girls.  The program will engage girls in discovery-based girl-centered activities that build their understanding of the principles of scientific investigation while building collaborative research teams at and among each of the four pilot sites.\r\n     The computer-enhanced learning environment will include interactive online components for girls including:\r\n     1) A password-protected threaded discussion area hosted by a team of practicing professional \t\t            archaeologists;\r\n     2) A monthly \"Ask the Scientist\" program that will create the opportunity for girls to ask questions of \t            women scientists working in archaeology and related sciences; and\r\n     3) A publicly accessible area where girls will create and publish online science exhibitions chronicling \t           their archaeological investigations, including photos, drawings and measurement records of artifacts \t            being studied, hypotheses regarding the sites being excavated (either in simulation or as assistants to \t            professional archaeologists) and debates about the validity of their hypotheses.\r\n     The web site will also serve as a resource for adult program facilitators and will include:\r\n     1) A password-protected threaded discussion area where the adult facilitators of the program \t\t            nationwide, along with the consulting archaeologists and other participating scientists can exchange \t            their field notes on the effects of the online component on the girls' understanding of the scientific \t            basis of archaeological inquiry, as well as their comfort level with working with computer and \t            online technology;\r\n     2) A publication component where the results from this field test will be published as a resource for \t           other educators developing web-assisted informal education programs.\r\n     Building on its strong foundation of informal science education, including Eureka!.  Career Development for Teen Girls through Math, Science and Sports; Operation SMART.  Science, Math and Relevant Technology, and on its new initiative, GirlsLink, an effort to equip girls with technology skills to enhance their education and career preparedness, Girls Dig It Online promises to attract new groups of girls both to science through archaeology and to information technology through interactive and sophisticated uses of computer and Internet technology in a supportive environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
