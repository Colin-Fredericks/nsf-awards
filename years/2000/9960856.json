 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to extend a proof of concept result to a more generalized technology for the electronic detection of proteins and protein-protein interactions. The proposers will develop an electronic biosensor of high sensitivity and specificity that is based on electron tunneling and transition metal cross-talk effects that occur at electrodes derivatized with self-assembled monolayers.\r\nPreliminary results show that the sensing technology is unaffected by common sample contaminants like whole blood and serum, suggesting that proteins could be detected from samples with little pre-processing. In a model system, sub-zeptomolar concentrations of streptavidin were detected. The system is made up of stable modular components that can be inexpensively produced and are easily customized by an end-user for a variety of applications. Because the sensing technology is totally electronic, it could be readily multiplexed on microelectrode arrays to create a low-cost, high-throughput MEMS (microelectronic and mechanical system) device.\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical companies would use this technology to identify families of proteins that are implicated in disease and construct data bases that define networks of interacting proteins to determine points of intervention and potential drug targets. This technology advances a major technology trend toward automated nanotechnology and multiplexing.  End-users will prefer to use the proposed technology because it is more cost effective, sensitive, faster, and flexible enough to be adapted to many user applications.\r\n",
