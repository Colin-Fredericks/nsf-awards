 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nNi\r\n\r\nProfessor Ni plans to continue his research in understanding\r\nmathematically the effects of various diffusion-related mechanisms.  \r\nUsing calculus of variations and perturbation techniques, Professor Ni and\r\nhis collaborators have established the spike-layer solutions for an\r\nactivator-inhibitor system in morphogenesis by exploiting the gap between\r\nthe diffusion rates of the activator and inhibitor.  Stability of such\r\nsolutions with single peak in one dimension is also proved.  However, to\r\nundrestand the complete dynamics, multipeak solutions in multi- dimensions\r\nand their stability properties are very important and not yet fully\r\nunderstood. They are currently under investigation.  It should be noted\r\nthat the gap between the diffusion rates alone is not sufficient in\r\ncreating patterns, as is shown by the Lotka-Volterra competition-diffusion\r\nsystem in the weak competition case.  Thus, from the point of view of\r\npattern formation, the notion of \"cross-diffusion\" was introduced in 1979\r\nby theoretical biologists.  Cross-diffusion systems are both nonlinear and\r\nstrongly-coupled in the highest order terms, and are therefore\r\nmathematically challenging.  Professor Ni and his collaborators proposes\r\nto study the effect of cross-diffusion: First, to obtain necessary and\r\nsufficient conditions for cross-diffusion rates to create patterns, and\r\nthen to investigate their qualitative behavior as well as their stability\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n      Professor Ni plans to continue his research in understanding, in a\r\nmathematically rigorous manner, the phenomena and effects of various\r\ndiffusion-related mechanisms and hopefully thereby to have some impact in both\r\nimproving our ability in modeling more complicated or realistic situation in\r\napplied sciences, as well as creating new and significant mathematics.  In\r\nthis project, from the point of view of pattern formation, Professor Ni\r\nintends to investigate the various \"concentration phenomena\" in diffusion or\r\ncross-diffusion systems.  These, in particular, include Turing patterns in\r\nchemical reactions (e.g. the CIMA reaction), Gierer-Meinhardt's activator-\r\ninhibitor systems (in modeling the regeneration phenomena of hydra) in\r\nmorphogenesis, and the Lotka-Volterra competitions with cross-diffusion (in\r\nmodeling segregation phenomena) in population dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
