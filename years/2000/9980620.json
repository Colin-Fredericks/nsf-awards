 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic-scale models are a set of mental and computer models that relate a wide range of macroscopic physical, chemical, and biological phenomena to basic properties of atoms and molecules and their interactions.  These models encompass more kinetic molecular theory because they include electrostatic forces, chemical bonds, and light interactions.  All atomic models are difficult for students to learn, and so educators are recommending delaying their introduction until the end of middle school.  But learning to reason witn atomic-scale models is a critical preparation for introductory science courses and absolutely necessary for modern approaches to biology.  Students must somehow acquire these challenging concepts between school and high school.\r\n\r\nWe propose to develop a rich interactive software micoworld called the Molecular Workbench that will help make the atomic level wolrd as familiar to students as the macroscopic world.  The software will be based on a few principles:  classical mechanics, the forces between atoms, rules for covalent bonding, and phonton interactions.  Using these basic principles, the computational model can exhibit a wide range of macroscopic phenomena.  The resulting software will be highly interactive, allowing students to experiment with an infinite variety of forces, atoms, molecules, and bond rules.  An optional force-feedback mouse will give students the sensation of interacting directly with atoms and molecules and feeding the forces that determine their interactions.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to build the Molecular Workbench, design excellent standards-based learning materials that exploit its capacity, and test the ability of typical students to use the resulting approach to learn to reason with atomic-scale models.  Our measures of success will be based on the quality of student reasoning about atomic-level phenomena and their manifestations at the maco level both with and without the software.  We will look for indications that students become more like experts by exhibiting a richer and more accurate web concepts and applying their understandings to new problems.  Concept maps, and electronic records of student performance on challenges that measure student tranfer, and structured interviews will provide the data for a series of studies of student learning.\r\n\r\nThis will be a three-year projects.  Software development will require the first two years.  Prototype software will be used in the first year to support clinical interviews designed to refine the software, learning materials, and research design.  An urban eighth grade class will be used for a detailed implementation study in the second year.  In the third year, a second research site will be established.  \r\n\r\nTo study both the teacher preparation needs for our approach and to gather data about student learning at different grades, we will offer a workshop for 20 teachers who will implement the materials in grades 6-10 in the third year of the project.  We will prepare these teachers to use and evaluate embedded assessments that include concept maps and transfer challenges.  These data will be available to the project.",
