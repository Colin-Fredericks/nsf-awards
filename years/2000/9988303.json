 "awd_abstract_narration": "A centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) is a Voronoi tessellation of a\r\ngiven set such that the associated generating points are centers of \r\nmass of the corresponding Voronoi regions. Applications of CVT's \r\nrange from problems in image compression, vector quantization, \r\nquadrature rules, grid generation and optimization, finite difference \r\nschemes, distribution of resources, cellular biology, cluster analysis, \r\nand the territorial behavior of animals. The goals are to develop highly\r\nefficient parallel algorithms for the computation of CVT's, to gain \r\nfurther understanding of interesting features related to the these \r\ntessellations, to implement and test these algorithms, and to produce \r\na useful software suite that can serve as a design tool for many\r\nproblems in applications.\r\n\r\nAmong the theoretical questions to be studied are the complexity of \r\nalgorithms for the construction of CVT's, the effects of nonuniform \r\ndensities, CVT's in general metrics, constrained CVT's, and generalized\r\nCVT's based on lines, curves and surfaces.\r\n\r\nParallel deterministic and probabilistic algorithms will be developed \r\nand tested. In the former case, different averaging and communication\r\nstrategies will be examined; for the latter,domain decomposition \r\nideas will be exploited. This effort can lead to parallel grid generation\r\n algorithms and other software useful in applications such as\r\nclustering analysis.\r\n\r\nApplications of CVT's will also be studied, with particular emphasis \r\non grid generation and optimization. The questions addressed in this\r\nconnection include the role of the density functions used to generate \r\nthe CVT's on the optimal placement of grid points, the construction of \r\ngrids with special properties and the the use of various generalized \r\nCVT's. Another application that will be examined are the use of CVT's \r\nin the clustering analysis of large data sets.\r\n",
