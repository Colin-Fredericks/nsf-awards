 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dual systems consisting of R/C walls and moment resisting frames are commonly used for moderate and high rise buildings in seismic zones. Openings for doors and windows are typically used in R/C walls, splitting them into two or more walls coupled by deep and short elements, known as coupling beams. To avoid severe stiffness and strength degradation in these beams, a diagonal reinforcement detail is used. However, such a detail is difficult to construct and leads to significant bar congestion in coupling beams. The proposed research is aimed at investigating experimentally and analytically the behavior of fiber reinforced coupling beams under earthquake loading. It is expected that the use of fiber reinforced concrete will lead to the elimination of the need for diagonal reinforcement in coupling beams, while improving their seismic performance. Analytical models will be developed to simulate the response of fiber reinforced coupling beams under earthquake loading.",
