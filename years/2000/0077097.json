Recipients of support are to be selected by the Conference Organizing Committee based on their research focus and productivity.  \r\n\r\nThe subject matter of the Conference relates directly to two important Program priorities: research in biomechanical properties of bone and tissue, and the encouragement of students and young professionals to engage in research activities. The meeting will provide the opportunity for attendees to meet and confer with world leaders in biomaterials and biomechanics research, as is illustrated by the list of anticipated participants compiled by the Principal Investigator. The proceedings of the Conference are to be published in a book by the University of California San Francisco Post Graduate Education Division.\r\n",
