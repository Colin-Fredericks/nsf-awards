 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title:  Free probability theory and problems in operator algebras\r\n\r\nTechnical description: The project involves study certain von Neumann algebras and\r\nC*-algebras using the techniques of free probability theory.  Some of the\r\nproblems on von Neumann algebras to be considered are the isomorphism problem\r\nfor free group factors, as well as related classification problems for\r\namalgamated free products of von Neumannn algebras and for type III von Neumann\r\nalgebras arising as free products with respect to non-tracial states.\r\nRegarding C*-algebras related to free products, the project is to study\r\nproperties like simplicity, stable rank and pure infiniteness, and to attempt\r\nto find Voiculescu's topological entropy of certain automorphisms of them.  In\r\na different direction, the project involves the study of commutators of\r\nelements from ideals of infinite type II von Neumann algebra factors; in\r\nparticular, to characterize which elements are commutators in terms of, for\r\ninstance, generalized singular numbers.\r\n\r\nNon-technical description: In the mid 1980's, Voiculescu discovered (or\r\ncreated, depending on your perspective), a new sort of probbility theory\r\nwhich is quite analogous to usual probability theory, except that the\r\nusual notion of independence is replaced by freeness, which is exhibited\r\nby certain noncommuting random variables.  In fact, freeness is related\r\nto and inspired by the combinatorics of free groups, which are groups\r\nwith \"maximal noncommutativity.\"  In the last decade and a half, free\r\nprobability has been shown to be a fundamental new theory, which touches\r\non diverse areas of mathematics and physics, including random matrices,\r\ncombinatorics and operator theory.  For example, freeness provides a\r\ndeep and satisfying explanation of the appearance of Wigner's semicircle\r\nlaw in random matrices, and has proven very useful for the further study\r\nof random matrices.  The natural context for free probability theory is\r\nnoncommutative von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, because the full\r\npower of spectral analysis can be brought to bear.  The project is to\r\nelucidate the structure of C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras related\r\nto free probability theory.  Successful completion of this research will\r\nbe both and application and an elucidation of free probability theory\r\nand will deepen our understanding of C*-algebras and von Neumann\r\nalgebras.  Von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras were first considered by\r\nvon Neumann and, respectively, Gel'fand and Naimark, in the 1930s and\r\n1940s. They are natural contexts for noncommutative analogues of\r\nclassical analysis, and they thus arise naturally in the mathematical\r\ntheory of quantum mechanics.  Moreover, noncommutative methods are\r\nincreasingly being used to study classically commutative problems in\r\nmathematics --- witness the Jones polynomial used to distinguish knots,\r\nand Connes' noncommutative geometric methods used to study fractals.\r\n\r\n",
