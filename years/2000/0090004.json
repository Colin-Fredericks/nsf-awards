Malcom\r\nTitle:  Bringing Women and Minorities into the IT Workforce: The Role of Non-Traditional Educational Pathways\r\n\r\nThis CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to study the role that non-traditional educational pathways play in the education of IT professionals, in particular, their role in preparing underrepresented minorities and women for IT careers.  The study will consist of four primary tasks.  The first task will be the collection of demographic data and statistical information to characterize non-traditional students and educational pathways.  The second task will be the collection of detailed information on the education and careers of non-traditional students in the Virginia-Maryland-D.C. region through surveys of former students and interviews with educators, employers, and employees.  The third task will be data analysis.  The final task will be a science policy conference to develop a policy agenda for federal and state governments based on the results of the first three tasks.  This project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the education of underrepresentation of women and minorities for IT careers.\r\n",
