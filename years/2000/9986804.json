 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on the relationship of affinely-invariant measures to\r\ncertain problems in harmonic analysis. Drury observed that affine arclength\r\nappears to be the natural measure to use when considering averaging and Fourier\r\nrestriction operators associated with certain curves. More recently, the PI has\r\nobtained certain uniform results along these lines for curves in two dimensions\r\nand for surfaces in higher dimensions. He intends to continue these\r\ninvestigations and also to consider some questions of an integral-geometric\r\nnature. The latter stem from the concept of affine dimension, an analog of\r\nHausdorff dimension which also takes into account a set's curvature.\r\n\r\nThe averaging operators considered in this project belong to a class of smoothing\r\noperators which play an important role in the study of physical processes like\r\nwave motion and heat propagation. These operators are also related to the Radon\r\ntransforms which appear in tomography. Similar operators are important in signal\r\nanalysis and communications theory. The Fourier restriction operators considered\r\nhere are part of the theory of Fourier analysis. Their study contributes to the\r\ngeneral understanding of the Fourier transform, a tool which is vital to\r\napplications of mathematics ranging from electrical engineering and\r\ncommunications theory through fluid dynamics.\r\n\r\n",
