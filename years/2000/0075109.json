 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports an interdisciplinary research project in applied mathematics and neurobiology.  Specifically, the PI will spend an academic year leave visiting the Department of Neurobiology and Physiology at Northwestern University.  The goal of this interdisciplinary research program is: 1) to participate\r\nin and assist with the modeling of ongoing experiments on hippocampal neurons; 2) to use the focused learning environment to develop a sufficient understanding of neurobiology and the skills necessary for continued research in this area; 3) to create materials that can be used as part of the graduate and\r\nundergraduate curricula in the PI's home department.  Specific problems to be examined include the modeling of slow, cumulative sodium channel inactivation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, and a study of the causes of bursting in subicular hippocampal neurons. To help ensure the project's success, the PI will be\r\nexternally advised throughout the duration of the work by other researchers familiar with the application of mathematics to biology.  This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
