 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the CTAS/CSEMS Program is to provide educational opportunities to low-income, academically talented students through scholarships that promote full-time enrollment and baccalaureate and master's degree achievement in computer technology and engineering technology. The ASU East College of Technology and Applied Sciences has established this scholarship program for 30 Bachelor of Science and 10 Master of Science in Technology students. Scholarship support is provided to students who meet the CTAS/CSEMS eligibility criteria and who compete successfully in a selection process administered by the CTAS/CSEMS Selection Committee. Selected students benefit from studying under the direction of faculty at a research university in a high-technology industrial environment. Knowledge and skills are developed with the aid of contextual laboratory experiences reinforced by opportunities to directly interact with world-class business and industry representatives, their facilities and operations. The program reflects the national workforce need to substantially increase the number of graduates of baccalaureate, and graduate degree programs in the fields of engineering technology, with special focus on computer engineering technology, electronics/semiconductor engineering technology, manufacturing engineering technology and aeronautical engineering technology. \r\n",
