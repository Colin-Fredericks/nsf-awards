The program recruits talented and high achieving science, engineering and mathematics undergraduate students as early as their sophomore year. During the three years of this grant period, they expect to recruit thirteen students each summer for the two-phase program. Most of the students participating in the program are from minority/under-represented groups. During the first phase of the program, students will be housed at SSU and will participate in group research projects that are designed to encourage active collaboration and group cohesion. During the fifth week, the students move to HBOI for a more intensive individual research program. They give written and oral presentations at the end of the program, and are encouraged to publish results and present at national meetings following the program.\r\n\r\n",
