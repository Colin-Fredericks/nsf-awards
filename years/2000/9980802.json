 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) It has been well established by science education researchers that students learn most when actively engaged. The predominant form for teaching undergraduate science classes, however, is the passive lecture format, which has been shown to contribute little to help students develop a coherent body of knowledge. One established way to engage students in large lectures is to intersperse brief lectures with conceptual questions, called ConcepTests, which are designed to challenge students to think about the fundamental concepts and gain practice explaining their ideas. Although hundreds of faculty around the country in many disciplines are already using this strategy, called Peer Instruction, most lecturers continue to follow the traditional passive lecture format.\r\nIn this project the group is making Peer Instruction easier to implement, by developing a suite of related Internet utilities and recruiting and supporting additional faculty for Peer Instruction. The deliverables of this project, which is aimed at instructors and students in introductory physics courses nationwide, include an expanded database of ConcepTests, utilities for retrieving these ConcepTests in class-ready format, on-line testing facilities, and supporting facilities for students.\r\n",
