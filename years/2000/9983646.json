 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nRPI\r\n\r\nThe focus of Rensselaer's VIGRE activities is mathematical training directed towards contemporary scientific problem solving.  This includes disciplinary depth as well as exposure to, and participation in, interdisciplinary research programs in both academic and non-academic settings.  In the process, students and postdoctoral fellows are involved in a broad variety of different research and educational activities. This includes scholarly work to learn new material, research to generate new results, talks to communicate new techniques and results, and curriculum development and excellence in classroom teaching. The fundamental integrating activity for the vertically structured groups are research and communication seminars.  The main goal of the program is the enrichment of the educational experience of students and postdocs, to promote the research and educational activities at Rensselaer, and to encourage and advance mathematical science students and postdocs toward academic careers.  This provides a foundation for what is essential in science today, that is, breadth of knowledge and the ability to communicate effectively across traditional disciplinary boundaries. \r\n\r\nOur program links undergraduate, graduate and postdoc career enhancing experiences together with K-12 outreach. Our strengths are in interdisciplinary activities including strong industrial connections together with nationally recognized innovative educational activities.  Our product will be well-trained professionals ready for successful academic careers.  The impact of the Rensselaer program will be in producing mathematical scientists with industrial problem solving experience, with a strong understanding of applications areas, with analysis, modeling and numerical computation skills, with the ability to creatively produce new mathematics needed to solve applied problems, with innovative education and teaching experiences, and with the ability to participate in the building of academic applied mathematics programs. \r\n\r\nFunding for this award is provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
