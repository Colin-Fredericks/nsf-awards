The investigators are currently examining invasions by graminoids in the Everglades region of south Florida by 1) using functional groups to develop hypotheses about invasiveness and the role of certain life history characteristics, and 2) following established populations of certain species, including one exotic invader, to better understand factors influencing growth and survival of established plants in this system. The proposed dissertation research will investigate factors that may be important in determining early invasion success of these graminoids. Work will occur in upland pine savannas of the Everglades National Park with species of Cyperaceae and Poaceae. Propagule and rhizome addition experiments will examine germination, establishment, survival and growth of individuals from species with a range of life history strategies, morphologies, growth forms, and invasive tendencies in four distinct microsites. The main objective of the study is to determine the role of early life cycle stages in limiting colonization of different savanna microsites by native and exotics. This study, together with the rest of the dissertation research, will be used to make habitat-specific invasion predictions. \r\n",
