 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference \"Organic Structures and Properties,\" to be held June 17-22, 2000 at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut is devoted to extend organic systems, their structures, and the properties that ensue from that organization.  Areas to be discussed include organic thin films, electronic and optoelectronic materials, biomolecular materials, crystalline pharmaceuticals, and novel supramolecular systems.  It is anticipated that this conference will provide a unique opportunity for developing the strong, but often unrecognized, connections between two-dimensional assemblies (thin films) and three-dimensional bulk solids, as well as the principles of molecular recognition and assembly that permeate all the session topics.  One evening has been reserved exclusively for five \"Young Investigators\".\r\n\r\nSolid-State Chemistry continues to have a direct impact on the technological advances in areas such as the design of solid-state organic materials for optoelectronics, ferroelectrics, and biomolecular materials. \r\n",
