 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in processor technology, both in increased processing power and decreased energy\r\nconsumption, have led to the creation of a new breed of small intelligent devices from tiny\r\nlaptops, to PDAs, to smart phones, to wearable computers made from a collection of small\r\nindependent devices. The advent of such devices and wearable computers brings to light new\r\npossibilities and new needs, specifically: cooperation among devices and elimination of cables.\r\nThe development of short-range radio technology, such as Bluetooth, enables the cooperation of\r\nsuch devices over wireless links. As users collect multiple small computing devices, the amount\r\nof communication resources available to the user increases and so the demand for coordination of\r\nresources between these devices increases. The overhead of this coordination may tax the\r\navailable bandwidth and energy resources of the devices. The goal of this research is to support\r\nsuch cooperation and coordination through intelligent communication management with an\r\nemphasis on the efficient use of available resources.\r\n\r\nAs the user moves between different environments, these MObile grouPEd Devices (MOPEDs)\r\ncooperate as a coordinated local area network that provides the user the desired mobile services.\r\nThis cooperation and coordination between a single user's devices changes the definition of what\r\nit means to communicate with a user. With a MOPED, communicating with any of the devices in\r\nthe MOPED represents a successful connection to the local area network, and so to the individual.\r\nIn order to better support the needs of the user, the MOPED may interact with networks in the\r\ncurrent environment surrounding the user in order to determine the availability of local services.\r\n\r\nThe researchers' approach relies on decision algorithms; services and protocols for determining what communication channels are available to which devices, as well as resource and quality\r\ninformation about such channels. The researchers address four major challenges faced in the design of such a solution.\r\n\r\n1) Channel Discovery:  The researchers propose the design of intelligent service discovery protocols based on the requirements of the user and the tradeoff between having current\r\ninformation about the availability of communication channels with the overhead in\r\nresources (i.e. bandwidth and power) used to acquire that information.\r\n2) Resource Monitoring: The researchers propose the design of a distributed resource information\r\nrepository, which is a database internal to the MOPED. The algorithms governing the\r\ndissemination of resource information to devices in the MOPED must take into\r\nconsideration the topology of the network, the energy and bandwidth availability of each\r\ndevice, and the priority at which each device actually needs the information.\r\n3) Resource Allocation: The researchers propose the design of intelligent transport and routing\r\nprotocols able to use the resource availability information to determine which and how\r\nmany of the MOPED's external channels to use to complete a specific connection.\r\n4) Mobility Management: The researchers propose mobility management techniques to provide the ability for external users to communicate with the user, and so the devices of the\r\nMOPED, wherever it is currently connected to the Internet and propose the design of\r\nmobility management protocols based on the current technology for host mobility.\r\n\r\nThe results of the research will enable simultaneous connections through all available\r\ncommunication channels. This creates a very robust environment, where it becomes easier to\r\nguarantee complete communication coverage. It allows using MOPEDs for critical tasks such as\r\npatient monitoring where it is important to maintain connectivity at all time, through there may be\r\nsome flexibility in the amount of data that is transferred as well as the importance of that data. If\r\nthe communication patterns of such a MOPED are not well monitored, certain devices may\r\nunacceptably lose power due to inefficient connection management.\r\n",
