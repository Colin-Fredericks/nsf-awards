 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21), Computer Science (31), Engineering Technology (58) This project is providing scholarships to economically disadvantaged students in the disciplines of Computer Science and Mathematics. Since Applied Physics majors experience a curriculum that is oriented towards engineering technology and/or computer technology, these students are also receiving support. The project builds upon the institution's Research Career Integration Program (RCIPro), which is an NSF Minority Institutions Infrastructure (MI-I) award, as well as other programs such as the Student Assistance in Learning (SAIL), Alliance for Minority Progress (AMP), and McNair Scholarship. The program is serving as a pipeline between the University and the regional community colleges and high schools. A number of community colleges have direct coordinated participation in the project, along with the San Bernardino Superintendent of Public Instruction who oversees all of the regional high schools. In addition, local companies and industries such as Packet Engines are contributing four scholarships each of equal value to each of the approximately 40 scholarships being supported NSF funds. Senior personnel on the project include chairs of all involved Departments, the Director of the University AMP program, and the Vice President of Student Services. Through the University Career Center and vendor partners, meaningful workplace career opportunities are available for all of the CSEMS scholarship recipients. Additionally, personnel both from Academic Affairs and Student Services are involved in all aspects of the program, including recruiting, evaluation, mentoring, support, and dissemination. The University is a member of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) and has earned recognition as a Hispanic-serving institution.",
