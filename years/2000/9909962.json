This workshop follows the successful first workshop in Hanoi in 1998, where we recognized the need of continuing the workshop until the relation between Vietnam, Japan and USA matures to the stage where exchange programs and collaborations become easily accessible to students, researchers and educators of all the three nations. The second workshop serves as a milestone of our efforts toward that common goal by bringing together educators and researchers from these three countries to study and discuss ways of integrating research and education in systems, computation and control engineering. The Engineering Systems Research Center (ESRC) at UCB will administer the distribution of funds.\r\n",
