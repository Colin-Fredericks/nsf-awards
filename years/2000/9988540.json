This research will seek to provide\r\na theoretical framework for understanding the contextual and\r\ndomain-based factors that mediate between success and failure for\r\ndifferent software development contexts.  Particular emphasis will\r\nbe placed on tools and techniques that allow organizations to\r\nsystematically accumulate and improve knowledge of effective software\r\ndevelopment practices within an organizational context.  Methods\r\nfor empirical observation based on ethnomethodology and activity\r\ntheory will be developed to establish and validate a scientific\r\nbasis for understanding critical success and failure factors.\r\nResults of this research will be used to 1) Develop methods for\r\nscientific inquiry that will lead to engineering disciplines for\r\nsoftware development based on domain and context analysis, 2) Better\r\nunderstand the knowledge-intensive nature of software development\r\nactivities and how past experiences can be used as the basis for\r\nimprovement, and 3) Development of methodologies that integrate\r\nmodern, component and framework-based techniques, with contextual\r\nfactors that match application problems to specific techniques with\r\nthe highest probability of success.",
