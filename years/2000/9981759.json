 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support for the work of Dr. Peter P. Gaspar in the Department of Chemistry at Washington University in St louis.   The goal of the work is to understand the factors that control the reactions of electron deficient and multiply bonded organic molecules containing the elements Si, P, S and Sn, in addition to the more common elements like C, N, and O.   It is believed that by making these novel molecules, and studying the mechanisms of their reactions, it will be possible to extend the powerful mechanistic ideas of organic chemistry to the prediction of bond-making and -breaking processes throughout the periodic table.   A powerful new apparatus has been developed which will simplify the identification of new reactive species which may lead to new materials with unusual and useful properties.\r\n\r\nSome of the molecules to be investigated are (iPr3Si)2Si, which is analogous to a carbene and may have either a singlet or a triplet electronic ground state, PCSiMe3, with a triple bond between the P and the C, analogous to an organic nitrile, and BN, an unstable molecule which has been detected spectroscopically but whose chemistry is unknown.   BN will be generated in the new supersonic flow pyrolysis nozzle apparatus, and detected by FT ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy after charge exchange or other ion-molecule reactions.",
