 "awd_abstract_narration": ".With National Science Foundation support Dr. Robert Tykot will conduct two field seasons of geoarchaeological research and follow each with laboratory analysis of the materials collected. He will carry out  survey to document obsidian flows and outcrops on the Mediterranean islands of Palmarola, Pantelleria and Lipari and characterize them both physically and chemically. Physical properties including color, translucency and density will complement major/minor element data from electron microprobe analysis and trace element and isotope ratio data from ICP mass spectrometry. He will conduct similar analyses of a large number of obsidian artifacts recovered from archaeological sites. Obsidian, a form of volcanic glass can be easily modified to produce a sharp cutting edge and therefore was widely used and broadly traded in prehistory. It is an ideal material for reconstructing trade since it occurs geologically in a limited number of locations, is frequently found on archaeological sites even great distances from a source and may be chemically 'fingerprinted' allowing definitive source attributions of artifacts. For these reasons it has been widely used to reconstruct prehistoric trade and exchange. While some sources in the Mediterranean region have been carefully studied and well characterized, others have not and Dr. Tykot's work will constitute a significant addition to this growing body of knowledge. The data will be used to address a number of specific anthropological questions. It will provide insight into the earliest settlement of the Mediterranean islands, the transition from hunting and gathering to an agricultural way of life, the development of long distance exchange networks, craft specialization and the emergence of social differentiation. The data will also be used to test explicit models of presumed prehistoric navigational and maritime transport capabilities, to reveal specific connections between island and mainland populations and to define the important sociopolitical and economic role of obsidian in many prehistoric Mediterranean societies.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental research will provide a data base which will be widely utilized by prehistorians to address a range of scientific questions. It will also yield new insight into the rise of complex societies.\r\n",
