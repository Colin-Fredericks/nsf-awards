The Rustbelt RNA Meeting (RRM) is the only major Midwest regional meeting of RNA researchers. Last year the RRM was attended by 103 individuals including principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students from Ohio State University, Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University, the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Michigan, Indiana University, Purdue University, University of Delaware, SUNY Albany and the University of Illinois. Attendance in the previous year had been 77 individuals, and we anticipate between 100 and 120 participants in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the RRM is to provide an inexpensive, high caliber, interdisciplinary regional meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest with an emphasis on participation by undergraduate, and graduate and postdoctoral trainees. The meeting is open to principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students who are interested in RNA in its many aspects. The meeting format is designed to foster interaction between trainees at the participating institutions with each other and with the participating principal investigators. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
