 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nImplementation of undergraduate science education reform in the past decade has been very slow despite extensive publicity about the need to increase scientific literacy and problem-solving skills. One reason for the slow progress appears to be a lack of widely-disseminated curriculum materials designed to support these goals. This project is creating the first of four modules for teaching integrative physiological concepts. The modules emphasize active learning and inquiry approaches and include pedagogical information to help faculty with their implementation. The project is a collaboration of the American Physiological Society (APS), composed primarily of research faculty at medical schools and major universities, and the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS), composed largely of people teaching anatomy and physiology or physiology at smaller schools. The latter group forms the target population for dissemination of the material and for faculty development efforts. Project team members drawn from APS and HAPS are developing each module. The modules are being presented at HAPS meetings to ensure that faulty are appropriately trained in its content and pedagogy. Volunteers from APS and HAPS are site-testing the modules on student populations that include significant numbers of women and underrepresented minorities. An independent evaluation team is monitoring adaptability and effectiveness of the curriculum materials in the modules. Draft and final versions will be disseminated through a web page sponsored by APS and linked to the home page of professional societies such as the American Institute of Biological Sciences. Once all four modules are complete, Prentice Hall College Publishers will publish them as part of their Series in Educational Innovation.\r\n",
