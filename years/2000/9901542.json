 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue the successful mission of the Laboratory for Advanced Manufacturing and Control (LAMC) funded through a previous NSF grant.  The project will focus on the reviewing of international research and development specifically in the areas of manufacturing sensing and control and assess its applicability to manufacturing machines, equipment and systems.  The investigator's experience will enable him to serve as a point of contact, especially for the younger members of the research community by helping them establish strong international networks.  The on-going work will entail four important aspects:  (1) to review the state of the art of this activity worldwide; (2) to make a critical assessment of it; (3) to prepare written yearly summaries of the findings; and (4) to assist young investigators, on an individual basis, desiring to establish international networks.  Papers will be presented at future National Science Foundation Design and Manufacturing Grantees Conferences as part of the traditional poster sessions held at these Conferences.  They could also be the keynote presentation at a workshop held in conjunction with the Conference.  The workshop will be of one-day duration and likely held the day prior to the beginning of the Conference.  Duplicate workshops could be scheduled at alternative events, i.e., at NAMRC or ASME activities.  The location(s) and related logistics would be worked out with the Conference host(s) and the relevant NSF Program Director.",
