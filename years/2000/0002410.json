These experiments will geophysically extend observations from direct core description, direct core measurement, and borehole logging into the surrounding sediments, thereby provide 3-D coverage of inferred gas hydrate and free gas occurrence over a much larger sediment volume.  The experiments include: 1) constant-offset vertical seismic profiling (VSP) with a fixed source receiver, coordinated with zero-offset VSP's, which will result in vertically continuous shear-wave velocity (Vs) profiles; 2) walkaway VSP's, acquired by shooting over the borehole with a second ship to a receiver at fixed depth within the borehole, thereby acquiring high-quality Vs and compressional wave (Vp) data to calibrate rock physics models of gas-hydrate bearing sediments; 3) deployment of ocean bottom seismometers in a dense array around one of the boreholes for dense 3-D seismic coverage to examine an area of inferred focused fluid flux and its relationship to a gas hydrate cap; and 4) using the ODP Advanced Piston Corer (APC) as a seismic source during piston deployment for a larger array of measurements using the OBS array.  These geophysical results will be directly tied to drilling results to constrain relationships between fluid flux, free gas, and hydrate formation in a convergent margin setting.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
