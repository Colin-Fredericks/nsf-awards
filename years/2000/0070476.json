 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will try to generalize the well-known Kronecker's\r\nfirst limit formula to `holomorphic' Eisenstein series with characters\r\nand study the tangent line of the Eisenstein series. He will then apply\r\nthe results to study the central derivative of automorphic L-functions.\r\nIn the second project, He, Kudla, and Rapoport will continue Kudla's \r\nfundamental work on the the central derivative of incoherent Eisenstein \r\nseries. In particular, they will prove that the central derivative of\r\ncertain incoherent Eisenstein series is the generating function of zero\r\ncycles on an arithmetic Shimura surface. He is also working with M. Stoll\r\non the arithmetic nature of a very nice genus two curve in relation with\r\nthe Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Finally, he is studying the\r\nexterior cube automorphic L-series of GU(3, 3) in relation with the \r\nassociated Shimura variety. \r\n  Number theory has been one of the most amazing subjects to study for \r\nmore than two thousand years and will continue to be so. Even more so \r\nis its surprising and beautiful applications to communications and\r\ncryptography discovered during last 20 years. Automorphic forms and \r\nEisenstein series the investigator is working on is at the heart of\r\nthe modern number theory. Its advances would not only further our\r\nunderstanding of the deep and beautiful subject of number theory but \r\nalso find its way to improve our daily life in the e-world.",
