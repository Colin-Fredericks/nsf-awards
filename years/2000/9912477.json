 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for NSF co-sponsorship of an international workshop with the European Science Foundation (ESF) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). The workshop will be held December 3-5, 1999 in Laxenburg, Austria. The objectives of the workshop are threefold: First, it will identify the main critical issues within this broad area and delineate the interrelationships among them; second, it will take stock of the present state of knowledge and of ongoing research concerning collaboration technologies and factors affecting their deployment and use; and third, it will provide a forum for discussion about further research on the co-evolution of technological, institutional and organizational infrastructures affecting the conduct of collaborative science on a global scale.  Three substantive themes will be addressed: 1) how to characterize the technological opportunities encapsulated by the concept of a virtual laboratory; 2) the practical issues involved in organizing and conducting scientific work at a distance; and 3) the interaction between intellectual property issues and access to virtual libraries and data archives.  NSF sponsorship will enable the participation of non-European experts in this workshop by funding US and Russia participants' travel to Europe. It will also enable the workshop organizers to commission revised and expanded papers for a post-workshop publication. \r\n\r\n",
