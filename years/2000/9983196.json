 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award seeks to build meaningful interconnections among the various\r\neducational and research components of the mathematics enterprise at Stony\r\nBrook.\r\nThe Departments of Mathematics and of Applied Mathematics and Statistics have\r\ndeveloped strongly but in largely divergent directions.  This joint proposal\r\nenhances the instruction and research training in both departments through (i)\r\ncooperation in areas where the strengths of one department can benefit the\r\nother, and (ii) new initiatives that will benefit both departments. The proposal's\r\nemphasis on expanding research teams to include undergraduates ties in with the\r\nuniversity mandate to develop opportunities for undergraduates to participate in\r\nresearch.  Its emphasis on developing pedagogy ties in with the university\r\nmandate to revitalize undergraduate education. The proposal has four components:\r\nA. Broadening the Research Training of Undergraduates, Graduate Students and\r\nPostdocs;\r\nB. Developing Vertically Integrated Research Teams;\r\nC. Strengthening the Educational Experiences of Undergraduates, Graduate\r\nStudents and Postdocs;\r\nD. Promoting Greater Interactions Among Students, Postdocs and Faculty in The\r\nTwo Departments\r\n\r\nThe proposed initiatives in the Stony Brook VIGRE project will strengthen the\r\neducation and research training of undergraduate and graduate students and\r\npostdocs in both departments with better classroom learning, new opportunities\r\nfor research, and broadened career opportunities.  Undergraduates will have a\r\nvariety of new experiences involving independent thinking, culminating in the\r\nopportunity to participate in vertically integrated research teams.  Graduate students and\r\npostdocs in Mathematics will have an exposure to the types of mathematics\r\nresearch that reach out to other disciplines and to industry with involvement in one such\r\nresearch project.  While most recent Mathematics Ph.D.'s have been successful in\r\nfinding academic employment at leading institutions, it still makes sense for\r\nall Mathematics Ph.D.'s to be aware of a wider range of career opportunities.\r\nApplied Mathematics graduate students will develop a better appreciation of, and\r\npreparation for, academic careers in (unified) mathematics departments.  The\r\nemployment of Applied Mathematics Ph.D.'s has swung too far in the direction of\r\nnon-academic careers.  As a result of this trend, liberal art colleges have\r\ngreat difficulty hiring qualified U.S.-citizen faculty in statistics and applied\r\nmathematics.  The summer internship program will build valuable ties with local\r\nindustry and business along with directly benefiting the training of the student\r\ninterns.  VIGRE Postdoctoral Fellows will share in the exposure of broadened\r\nresearch and career opportunities.  Some will also become involved in\r\ninstructional reform, particularly in the arena of teaching preparation.  All\r\npostdoctoral Fellows will have extensive mentoring in launching their own\r\nresearch programs.\r\n\r\nFunding for this award is provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\n",
