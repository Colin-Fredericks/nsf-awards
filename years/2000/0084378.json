 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops, assesses, and provides convenient tools for implementing parametric modeling of processes that are driven by point sources. The project uses a hierarchical Bayesian approach to an extension of a process decomposition model that was recently introduced in the context of modeling the effect of point sources.  The process decomposition model decomposes the observed process into a trend surface, a baseline error process, and additional error processes (one for each point source) that may be viewed as shocks to the baseline. This approach allows flexibility and autonomy to modeling the individual sources. The Bayesian approach properly accounts for uncertainty in parameter estimates when evaluating prediction uncertainty, easily incorporates prior information, and is more flexible for assigning ranks according to the impact of several point sources. A Markov random field or conditional autoregressive model based on a distance-to-source neighborhood structure is used for the error processes. A multivariate distribution of weights describes the relative ranks of the sources.  Because all models are parametric, significance testing is easily accomplished. The project accomplishes the following technical goals: A. test the impact of several point sources, where exact locations of the point sources are known; B. rank several point sources according to impact; C. provide models that are useful for determining appropriate corrective action for altering an observed process or for optimizing a designed process; D. provide predictions, and appropriate measures of prediction uncertainties, at unsampled sites by accounting for the effects of point sources.  The educational component of the project involves teaching high school students the rudiments of the methodology developed and its relevance to major issues such as environmental equity.\r\n\r\nThe Clean Air Act of 1970 and its 1977 and 1990 amendments defined a pollution source as \"any place or object from which pollutants are released. A source can be a power plant, factory, dry cleaning business, gas station or farm. Cars, trucks and other motor vehicles are sources, and consumer products and machines used in industry can be sources too.\"  The effects of these sources on human health are well-documented, as is the importance of modeling these effects. This project responds to this need by developing, assessing, and providing convenient tools for modeling processes that are driven by point sources. The resulting methodology is applied to address a public health and welfare concern of the Environmental Protection Agency, namely to determine which nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission sites are most responsible for site-specific ambient concentrations far from the emission sites. These site-specific ranks will help determine which emission sites require stricter regulations for controlling their impact at different spatial locations. More generally, project results may impact the regulation of point sources, the assignment of equitable consequences to several point sources within the vicinity of an ecological or environmental disaster, and help in determining appropriate corrective actions. Furthermore, the creation of teaching modules aimed at high school students will improve the readiness of these students for studies in the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the Statistics Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS.\r\n",
