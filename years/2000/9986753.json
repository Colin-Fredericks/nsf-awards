 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nThis systemic reform initiative focuses on the science and math teacher preparation programs of the 14 campuses of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (SSHE). In 1998, these universities prepared 35% of the science and 29% of the math teachers certified in PA. In 1998, the SSHE was also responsible for 39% of the PA elementary certifications. This project is facilitating implementation of systemic reform in the SSHE system. During this project, scientists, mathematicians, and educators from SSHE campuses are collaborating to: (1) change selected university content courses taken by education students to reflect research-based effective pedagogy; (2) supplement the math and science content of science and math education courses; (3) introduce the paired supervision of science and math student teachers by content and pedagogy specialists; (4) provide consistency in experiences received by science and math education majors between their revised university courses, their field \r\nexperiences, and induction period; and (5) increase efforts at recruitment of underrepresented public school students to pursue careers in teaching science and mathematics. The SSHE universities are collaborating with nine community colleges and over 50 public schools in this project. However, system universities and partner community colleges interact with most of the state's 501 school districts in their normal course of operation. The extensiveness of these contacts offers high potential to improve both teacher preparation and the professional development of teachers in Pennsylvania. Induction of new teachers is very important in establishing how new teachers actually do teach and how many teachers remain teaching in Pennsylvania after the first several years of teaching experience. The CETPPA is establishing a strong induction program that provides first class mentoring of new teachers, supports new teachers for multiple years, is funded adequately to support all eligible new teachers, is linked to district and state standards, provides the means for sustained communication, and is evaluated for effectiveness. Statewide activities being implemented include teaming K-16 faculty to revise and/or develop selected science, math, and education courses to include technology and reflect strong content and pedagogy components, creating science and math centers, offering professional development symposia for K-16 faculty, strengthening field experiences, and developing mechanisms for recruiting students into math/science education programs. External evaluation is being conducted by NCISE. Strong assessment and dissemination components accompany a comprehensive program of cultural change that can serve as a national model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
