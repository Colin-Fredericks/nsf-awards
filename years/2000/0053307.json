 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMt. San Antonio College is developing a histologic technician program designed to educate and train students to efficiently prepare tissue samples for microscopic examination by a pathologist or research scientist. The project is developing this program as an alternate path for students enrolled in the Biology curriculum for university transfer or technical programs. Existing supporting curricula include Anatomy, Physiology and Microbiology from the Biology Department and Introductory and General Chemistry from the Chemistry Department 1-4 . Histology, Laboratory Basics for Histotechnicians, and Histotechniques 1-4 are being developed as new curricula through the Department of Biological Sciences. Histochemistry and Immunohistochemistryly curricula are being developed in collaboration with the Department of Chemistry. A program of this type does not currently exist in California and supports a variety of disciplines. \r\n\r\nLocal employers express a critical need for this program and are participating in its development. Employers are donating equipment, forming partnerships, and recruiting students. Mt. San Antonio College is providing funds for the purchase of half of the equipment required for the program, funds for supplies, and faculty salaries. National and California Societies of Histotechnology, and directors from programs across the US have guided development of this program which is being evaluated by The National \r\nAccrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Standards and The American Society of Clinical Pathologists (ASCP) Board of Registry.",
