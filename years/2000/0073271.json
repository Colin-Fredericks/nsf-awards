 "awd_abstract_narration": "0073271\r\nGrant & Gee\r\n\r\nThis study will investigate the causes and consequences of hybridization, the interbreeding of different species, in Gambel's and California Quail (the California State Bird). The consequences of hybridization range from extinction of one hybridizing species, when one species genetically swmps out the other, to the formation of an entirely new species. The outcome of hybridization depends on two factors, 1) the frequency of interbreeding between individuals, and 2) the survival and successful reproduction of hybrid offspring. This study will therefore explore what conditions lead to interbreeding between Gambel's and California Quail. Further, this study will compare the number of young born to interbreeding quail versus the number born to same-species pairs, and it will compare the survival of those hybrid and pure-species offspring. This current picture of hybrid survival will be paired with an investigation of the historical pattern of gene exchange between quail types, which will be accomplished by examining DNA sampled extensively through each quail range.\r\n\r\nAlthough low rates of hybridization are widespread in nature, its incidence may be increasing due to human landuse patterns. This human-caused increase in hybridization may be contributing to species extinction, making further research of hybridization increasingly important. This study will strengthen our understanding of the factors responsible for interbreeding between individuals, gene flow between species, and ultimately, speciation and extinction through hybridization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
