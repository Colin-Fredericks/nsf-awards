It would be extremely\r\nuseful to have an accurate, computationally efficient method of\r\nphylogenetic analysis, but no such method is yet known.  The\r\nmethod of phylogenetic invariants theoretically has these\r\nadvantages.  Modern phylogenetic methods analyze the mathematical\r\nand statistical similarities between the nucleotide sequences of\r\ndifferent species.  By modeling the evolution of the sequence for\r\na proposed evolutionary tree T as a Markov model, one can obtain\r\npolynomials specifying the frequencies with which certain\r\npatterns should occur in observed sequence data.  These\r\npolynomials parameterize a high-dimensional real algebraic\r\nvariety X.  Finding the equations that implicitly define X is\r\ntheoretically equivalent to knowing how to determine whether T is\r\nthe \"true\" evolutionary tree.  These equations have been\r\npreviously found for special evolutionary models such as the\r\nKimura 3-parameter model.  The investigator studies the\r\ninvariants for the most general Markov model of nucleotide\r\nsequences and uses a combination of combinatorics and non-abelian\r\nFourier analysis to find a complete set of invariants.  He also\r\nexplores ways to reduce the method's sensitivity to evolutionary\r\nnoise and raising its accuracy.  Advances on these issues are\r\nessential to make implementations of the invariant method\r\npractical for phylogenetic analysis.\r\n     The investigator develops better methods to construct\r\nbiological trees explaining the evolutionary relationships\r\nbetween species.  Understanding evolutionary relationships is an\r\nimportant biological question, whose applications range from\r\naiding the discovery of the origin of life to helping the medical\r\ncommunity research possible vaccines and treatments for pathogens\r\nsuch as the H.I.V. virus.  It would be extremely useful to have\r\nan accurate and computationally efficient method of phylogenetic\r\n(or evolutionary) analysis, but no method is currently known to\r\npossess both qualities.  The project seeks to improve the\r\naccuracy of the tree reconstruction method using phylogenetic\r\ninvariants.  The method of invariants is a computationally\r\nefficient method, which is known to theoretically give correct\r\nanswers.  However, in practice, the method is very susceptible to\r\nthe presence of noise in the data.  The investigator aims to\r\nminimize this problem by eliminating several assumptions that\r\ncurrently must be met to use the method of invariants.\r\n",
