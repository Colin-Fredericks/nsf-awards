 "awd_abstract_narration": "High throughput automated nucleotide sequencing is critically important for genomics research.  A wide array of research projects at Auburn University requires extensive DNA sequencing and fragment analysis.  These projects include development of molecular markers, genetic mapping, marker-assisted selection, genetic resource analysis, germplasm conservation, molecular ecology, population genetics, phylogenetic studies, molecular evolution, gene discovery and cloning, molecular detection, environmental genomics, and functional genomics.  This award will support the acquisition of high throughput DNA analysis equipment that will greatly increase the capacity of Auburn's research community. \r\n     The ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer is a high throughput machine with a capacity of 96 samples per run.  It is easier to use than the capillary-based DNA sequencers and, therefore, is more suitable for a core facility with multiple users.  Its acquisition will meet the current and growing needs in DNA analysis at Auburn University and in the region.\r\n     The instrumentation supported by this award will address a critical aspect of research need in the region.  It will dramatically enhance research capacity, efficiency, precision, and output.  Application of the information obtained from accelerated research, research training, and outreach will have a large economic impact in Alabama. Acquisition of this equipment will represent an important step toward improving the research infrastructure at Auburn University.  A large number of graduate and undergraduate students will benefit by their involvement in research projects using the equipment or from course offerings providing hands-on experience and workshops on advanced technologies in genomics.  The equipment will also be made available to researchers and students at Tuskegee University. \r\n",
