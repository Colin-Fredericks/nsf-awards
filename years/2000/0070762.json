 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his collaborators study several problems in the\r\nrepresentation theory of reductive groups and its applications to number\r\ntheory. The first problem is to prove the Kirillov conjecture which states\r\nthat every irreducible unitary representation of Gl(n,R) or GL(n,C)\r\nremains irreducible when restricted to a certain subgroup. The second\r\nproblem is to find a formula relating fourier coefficients of half\r\nintegral weight modular forms with special values of L-functions of\r\nintegral weight modular forms. This formula generalizes a classical\r\nformula of Kohnen and Zagier and is different from a formula given\r\nby Waldspurger. Other problems which are considered are the study of\r\nBessel distributions and Bessel functions for quasi-split groups and the\r\nstudy of Fourier Jacobi models for representations of symplectic and\r\nunitary groups. The line of attack on these problems is to study certain\r\ninvariant distributions and the spherical functions associated to them via\r\nregularity theorems. \r\n\r\nUnitary representations of semisimple Lie groups were studied by the famous \r\nphysicists Wigner and Dirac among others in an attempt to understand and\r\ndevelop the theory of quantum mechanics. Later, mathematicians such as Gelfand\r\nand Harish Chandra developed and rigorized this beautiful theory. Many\r\napplications were found to physics, geometry, number theory and other\r\nfields. The purpose of the current proposal is to advance the understanding \r\nof representation theory and to continue to explore the connections\r\nbetween representation theory and number theory.",
