 "awd_abstract_narration": "Autoadaptive media are systems, materials, and/or devices that respond to external stimuli by changing their characteristics.  This change in characteristics or properties can be used to modify the response of the system, or to monitor the health or condition of the system.  Currently, autoadaptive media are used in the aeronautical, automotive, and medical industries.  Although researchers have pointed to the many opportunities for using autoadaptive media in civil engineering, little research has focused on civil engineering applications, and virtually none has been directed to geotechnical engineering.  This lack of applications in civil engineering is a reflection of the lack of information within this community regarding available autoadaptive media and their possible applications.  Consequently, the major goals of this workshop are to introduce the concept of autoadaptive media to leading researchers in the field of geotechnical earthquake engineering, to describe some of the current applications of autoadaptive media, and to stimulate creative discussions on possible uses in geotechnical earthquake engineering.\r\n\r\nExamples of autoadaptive materials are shape-memory alloys whose properties change based on temperature and stress; piezoelectric composites that convert electric current into mechanical force or vise versa; magneto-rheological and electro-rheological fluids that change from a viscous liquid to a solid in the presence of a magnetic or electric field, respectively; magneto- and electro-strictive solids that change properties in the presence of the same fields; and micromechanical systems (MEMS), which are small electomechanical machines that fit on a microchip.\r\n\r\nThese innovative materials and systems have the potential to make a significant impact in earthquake engineering research and practice in two distinct ways.  First, new sensor technologies will affect the way experimental research is performed: small, inexpensive, and robust sensors -- that are perhaps wireless -- will permit accurate measurement of more material and system parameters with a smaller disturbance to the system being monitored.  Second, both new sensor technologies and new autoadaptive materials and systems will affect the performance and monitoring of civil engineering systems during and after earthquakes: new sensors will permit the health of systems to be assessed quickly and accurately after an earthquake.  Further, data from these sensors during an earthquake will allow significant insights to be gained into the dynamic response of these systems under strong earthquake shaking.  The results from the workshop will be distributed widely throughout the earthquake engineering community and fields related to autoadaptive media, and will be available on the World Wide Web.\r\n",
