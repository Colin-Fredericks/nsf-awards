 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cox\r\n0077728\r\n     Information processing along and between nerve cells is\r\nachieved via electrodiffusion along branches and across cell\r\nmembranes.  The relatively poor axial conductance of the branches\r\nis offset by the myriad of ion channels that perforate the cell\r\nmembrane.  A nerve cell's salient physical, as opposed to\r\ngeometrical, properties are then its axial conductance, its\r\nmembrane's capacitance and permeability to one or more ionic\r\nspecies and the kinetics (rules that govern its open/closed\r\nstate) of the underlying channels.  The predictive utility of a\r\nmathematical model of course hinges on the accuracy to which\r\nthese physical properties are known.  Unfortunately, the\r\nexperimental determination of each of these quantities is a\r\nformidable task that, in light of recent data suggesting that the\r\npermeabilities vary with position in the dendritic tree, requires\r\ngreat investment for all but the simplest geometries.  The\r\ninvestigator and his colleagues therefore determine the extent to\r\nwhich the neuron's physical properties may be inferred from more\r\nreadily available indirect measurements.  These indirect\r\nmeasurements are recordings of somatic and distal membrane\r\npotential following a known current stimulus to the soma.\r\nAssuming current seals at the distal ends, these two potential\r\nrecordings result in lateral overdetermination of the underlying\r\ndegenerate-parabolic system of Hodgkin-Huxley equations.  The\r\ninvestigator and his colleagues deduce from this overdetermined\r\nsystem a number of well posed problems, and associated algorithms\r\n(based on moment, fixed-point and output least squares methods),\r\nfor the recovery of one or more of the neuron's physical\r\nproperties.  They test these algorithms on data recorded from\r\npyramidal neurons drawn from the rat's hippocampus.\r\n     In order to repair or reproduce the brain one must have a\r\nparts list and a blueprint specifying how the parts are to be\r\nconnected.  At the coarsest level there are but two types of\r\nparts, nerves (neurons) and nerve glue (glial cells).  Though the\r\nhuman brain has more of each than the Milky Way has stars, it is\r\nnot their sheer number but rather a subtle combination of\r\ninterconnectedness and variation in electrical properties that\r\nrender the brain so powerful.  The term `variation' is meant to\r\nexpress the realization that a neuron is not simply a switch\r\nwithin a certain brain center or a wire connecting two such\r\ncenters, but rather is a tree of wires with electrical properties\r\nvarying along each of its branches.  It is this local variation in\r\na neuron's ability to conduct the brain's principal ions that is\r\nthought to be responsible for an individual neuron's ability to\r\nperform tasks reminiscent of rudimentary computers.  Given however\r\nthe minute size and variegated nature of a single neuron, the\r\ndirect experimental determination of its electrical properties\r\nhas yet to be achieved.  The investigator and his colleagues\r\ntherefore pursue the mathematically challenging task of\r\ndetermining these properties from more readily available, though\r\nindirect, experimental measurements.  This process is akin to\r\ndetermining the size and location of a leak in a transatlantic\r\ntelephone cable by comparing what the American said to what the\r\nEnglishman heard.  The success of their endeavor, coupled with the\r\nincreasingly fine resolution of images of neuronal\r\ninterconnections, will permit the investigator and his colleagues\r\nto produce models of sufficient veracity to be of use by the\r\nmedical community from construction of prosthetic neuronal\r\ncircuits to the design and testing of drugs and better\r\ntreatments.\r\n",
