 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tin-Lead (Sn-Pb) solders are widely used as soldering\r\nmaterials in semiconductor devices.  The as-solidified structure\r\ncan naturally change over time; however, the evolution can also\r\nbe driven by thermal or mechanical loads.  Changes in\r\nmicrostructure, in particular, locally coarsened regions, have\r\nbeen observed as precursors to the formation of cracks, and\r\nultimately of failure.  Time-dependent, microstructural changes,\r\ncoupled to mechanical straining and damage evolution, must be\r\nconsidered for realistic mathematical models and numerical\r\nsimulations.  The investigator and her colleague study, through\r\nmathematical modeling and numerical simulation, the fundamentals\r\nof microstructure evolution and its influence on material failure\r\nin Sn-Pb solder joints.  In the process, they develop the\r\nmathematical model and numerical capability more generally to\r\ntreat the many coupled processes that influence the overall\r\nstrength and integrity of a binary alloy.\r\n     Microelectronic components are generally attached to printed\r\ncircuit boards using solder.  The solder joint can serve as the\r\nmechanical as well as the electrical connection.  It has been\r\nestimated that on the order of 10,000,000,000,000 solder joints\r\nare produced each year.  Damage to solder joints is a primary\r\nfailure mechanism in electronic components.  Even on the shelf,\r\ndaily or yearly temperature cycles, physical handling, occasional\r\nbumps, chemical reactions or radiation can cause damage.  Under\r\noperating conditions, thermal fluctuations or mechanical\r\nvibration can be even more severe.  For expensive devices, in\r\ncritical applications, improved joint integrity can have\r\nenormously beneficial consequences, both economically and in\r\nterms of reliability of components.  The modeling undertaken here\r\ncan play a crucial role in providing guidance for maintenance of\r\ncritical components because it is practically impossible to\r\nexamine microscopically individual, in-service joints for\r\npotential failure.  The theoretical framework developed here will\r\nalso be readily applicable to analyzing self-assembling behavior\r\nand degradation in some nano-scale materials and devices.",
