 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will contribute mathematical services in signal and image processing for distributed Java computing.  A major component of internetworked information is digital images and audio signals. Current vector, signal, and image processing standards are evaluated to achieve advanced signal processing for Java. Phase I emphasized the design, algorithms, and Java relevance.  VSIP (vector signal and image processing) constitutes a viable option for commercialization in the distributed Java environment. This Phase II effort seeks to bridge the gap between the theoretical and the commercial for VSIP in Java, while identifying operational modes and service requirements for this non-traditional programming environment. If successful, a huge community of Java programmers in academia, industry, and government could be enabled, as well as all the service recipients whose applications exploit such as library.\r\n\r\nStandardization for platform independence is a critical issue for Internet applications.  An advanced commercially DSP toolkit would provide for a greater level of portability for signal-processing-intensive Internet applications. This would provide for better support for processing audio/visual information in valuable application settings. Embedded Java applications will make use of the toolkit to provide advanced signal analysis capabilities with mobility, portability, and high quality.\r\n",
