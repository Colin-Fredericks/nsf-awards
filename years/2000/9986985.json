 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science program seeks $154,000 from the Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship Program for academic years 2000 and 2001 to provide scholarships for 30 high-achieving Computer Science students and to support the implementation of a formal student-support system for all Computer Science students in a project whose goals are: \r\nTo improve the education of Computer Science students; \r\nTo increase the retention of Computer Science students; \r\nTo improve Computer Science students' preparation for employment or graduate school; \r\nTo strengthen the Computer Science program's ties to business and industry sectors. \r\n\r\nTo attain these goals, the Project Director will work with a Task Force to identify and recruit high-achieving, low-income students and implement plans to support students through the use of cohorts, mentors, and an internship program.  The scholarships will relieve students of some of the burden of funding their education and thereby provide them more time and energy to focus on a rigorous and challenging course of study.  Class cohorts mentored by upper-level scholarship recipients will provide students a support group to whom they can turn for assistance.  Faculty advisors will serve as mentors and provide students guidance with regard to academic issues or performance, including but not limited to, focus, motivation, communication skills, or career decisions. The support system will help assure that students remain \"on track\" and complete degrees in a timely manner. The Internship Program will assist students in understanding workplace needs and in strengthening the links between the University and business and industry. \r\n",
