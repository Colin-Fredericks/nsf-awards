New technologies have created engineering problems where successful controller designs must account for nonlinear effects, yet existing theory for general nonlinear systems often proves insufficient.  Examples include autonomous vehicles in air, land, space and underwater, smart materials for actuators, sensors and control devices, robotics for manufacturing and medicine, micromachines, electrical networks, power electronic devices, control of fluids and fluid-structure interactions, molecular control and vibration suppression in engineering structures.  It is expected that the workshop will have a significant impact in both theory and application as the discussions and interactions among the researchers will lead to new developments, collaborations and merging of ideas that further the field.\r\n\r\n",
