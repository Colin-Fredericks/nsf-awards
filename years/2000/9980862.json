 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) The project is developing a prototype for a multimedia disc (DVD,CD) that is allowing students in physical chemistry to see the practical, experimental applications of the concepts they are learning in the lecture course. This upper-division course is traditionally very abstract and mathematically oriented. The multimedia supplement is helping students to make a connection between the symbolic and theoretical material and how those concepts are put into practice. In lower level chemistry courses it is often possible for an instructor to carry out classroom demonstrations but in physical chemistry this is much more difficult. The proposed multimedia companion for physical chemistry is allowing instructors to demonstrate phenomena using graphics, animations, video and interactive activities of real instruments and showcase research currently being conducted in the field of physical chemistry. The Physical Chemistry in Practice (PCIP) digital videodisc (DVD) is a multimedia resource for both instructors and students. The DVD contains several 'programs', which are tied to traditional physical chemistry topics. Each program consists of 1) Description: An interactive description of an apparatus or experiment that illustrates a particular Physical Chemistry topic. The interactive description has photos, drawings of internal parts, computer animations and text/narrated discussions of the device 2) Video Tour: A videotaped tour of the apparatus or experiment that includes a brief interview with an expert in the field describing the device and its application. Video footage of the instrument in use and the collection of typical data follow the interview 3) Interactive Data: Typical data from the apparatus or experiment is being used in a tutorial program in which students can interpret, manipulate and analyze the information. The prototype DVD contains two complete programs. One illustrates the application of atomic force microscopy (AFM) in determining certain thermodynamic properties of polymers; the other describes the use of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The prototype project is also resulting in a complete list of programs for the full-development DVD and a description of the traditional physical chemistry course topics to which these programs correspond.\r\n",
