 "awd_abstract_narration": "Build Information Technology Resources project is achieveing five main objectives:\r\n1. Expand and improve leaning opportunities for students enrolled in CSEM.\r\n2.  Increase retention of CSEM students to associate degree achievement. \r\n3. Improve placement of CSEM students in baccalaureate transfer education programs and in related employment. \r\n4. Expand partnerships between College of DuPage and the employment sector to include mentoring. \r\n5. Implement recruitment strategies for groups underrepresented in CSEM. \r\n\r\nThrough the CSEM project, students areain information about CSEM careers; will receive mentoring and other support services to succeed in studying math, computer science and engineering; and will receive financial aid. All scholarship students will benefit from mentoring by faculty and representatives of business and industry, peer tutoring, academic and career counseling, and support services such as childcare for children while parents attend school. Anticipated outcomes to be accomplished are: (1) Increased self-confidence and motivation to pursue a CSEM education and career, (2) Improved performance in academic coursework and related employment opportunities; (3) Increased use of support services. Retention in the program; (4) Increased retention rate for CSEM scholarship students; (5) Increased transfer and employment placement rates; (6) Institutional capacity to develop a pool of professional mentors for CSEM students; (7) Increased enrollment of underrepresented groups in CSEM.\r\n\r\nThe target audience is (1) high achieving high school students who begin in calculus; (2) marginal high school students who demonstrate an exceptional interest in the science or engineering fields; (3) adult learners who are already enrolled in programs at the college; and (4) returning adult students who have been away from mathematics study for several years. Students will be selected from multiple sources of referral both internally within the College, and externally through local high schools and organizations. A faculty and staff panel will interview potential candidates for the program. Students who require remediation will have a special program established to accelerate their learning; however, once they enter the program, all students will be expected to maintain high academic standards. The College expects to enroll forty students in the CESMS program. Scholarship recipients will be expected to provide peer tutoring to other students entering the program. \r\n",
