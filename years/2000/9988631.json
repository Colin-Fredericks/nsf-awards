Co-organizers, Gabor Forgacs of Clarkson University and Tamas Vicsek of Eotvos University will bring together junior and senior physicists and biologists who use quantitative tools for studying multiple aspects of biological motion.  The overall objective is to improve our understanding of the biological, mathematical and physical principles behind various manifestations of motion involving living organisms.  Specifically, participants will consider biological motion at three scales: 1) the molecular level; 2) the cellular level; and 3) the tissue and organismal level.  Results are expected to help focus and interpret recent experimental and theoretical work in this cross-disciplinary topic by producing and publicizing an agenda of recommended next steps for progress in the emerging field.\r\n\r\nThe \"Biological Motion\" workshop fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts from the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  Ideas brought forth at the workshop should form the basis of new collaborative research efforts that seek to understand the creation, organization and coordination of motion in biological systems.\r\n",
