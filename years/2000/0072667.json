 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0072667\r\nAllen I. Knutson\r\n\r\nAllen Knutson's proposed work is about Schubert calculus \r\non flag manifolds, which combinatorially is about counting \r\nthe (obviously nonnegative) number of flags satisfying a \r\nlist of intersection conditions with other flags, and is \r\ncomputable as a (not obviously nonnegative) integral over \r\na flag manifold.  The main question in the field concerns \r\nfinding a totally-positive combinatorial formula rather than \r\nthe alternating sum.  His work with Dr. Terence Tao on the \r\ncase of single subspaces, refining totally-positive formulae \r\nalready known and solving long-standing conjectures in that \r\nrelatively simple case, has suggested new lines of attack \r\non the general problem.\r\n\r\nGiven four straight lines (picture them as blue) drawn in \r\nspace, in generic directions, how many other straight lines \r\n(picture them as red) touch all four?  In special cases \r\nthere are many, but generically there are exactly two\r\nsuch red lines. This is the first interesting case of a \r\ngeneral problem counting the number of flat subspaces \r\n(in this case one-dimensional) intersecting a number of \r\nother subspaces (which can even be curved).  Computers \r\ncan determine this obviously nonnegative number in any \r\ngiven case, but do so by adding many large positive and \r\nnegative numbers together -- in particular it is difficult \r\nto determine easily if the number is zero.  Also many \r\ninteresting cases in engineering are beyond the reach \r\nof computers.  Dr. Knutson's work concerns the search for \r\na manifestly positive formula for these (no cancelation), \r\nwhich in particular would make it much more straightforward\r\nto determine which such problems have any solutions at all. \r\nUnder previous NSF support he and Dr. Terence Tao already\r\ndetermined this positivity criterion in a famous subcase \r\nof the general problem.\r\n",
