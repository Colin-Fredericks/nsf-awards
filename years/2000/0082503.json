 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of  this project is to demonstrate a new paradigm for wireless network services.  The\r\nmotivations for this project are the f ollowing:\r\n     (1) Today, wireless service is either local to an institution (as in wireless LANs) or is provided as part of\r\na regional or national service (as in cellular).  But there could be other models. Individual providers of\r\nwireless service could put up a base station and o er service locally. Users could move among these\r\nproviders and select a service based on requirements and prices. Just as we have over 5000 wireline\r\nInternet service providers today, many only serving a small area, we could have wireless coverage\r\nbuilt bottom up.\r\n     (2)Today, we see a restricted range of  wireless devices - a laptop PC with a wireless card, a cell phone\r\naugmented with data capabilities, a highly integrated device such as a pager. There is not an open\r\nmarket  for new wide-area wireless devices, because such devices today are tightly bound, both\r\ntechnically and through service contract, to a particular wireless service provider. But there could be a\r\nwide range of  new consumer devices if  the proper interfaces and modules were available.\r\n     For this to work, two things are necessary. First, each of the broad mix of competing wireless services\r\nmust be accessible to a wide variety of devices. What is needed is an overall system architecture that\r\nallows cheap, small, low-power consumer-level objects to access a wide variety of technically\r\nincompatible wireless services with ease, using open interfaces. Second, selection of a service among\r\ncompeting alternatives must be easy. For example, a manual process of selection and entry of a credit\r\ncard would be too burdensome to succeed. What is needed is a model for automated dynamic negotiation,\r\nbased on rules provided by the users and providers, together with a workable economic model and a\r\nsimple micro-payment scheme.\r\n     The goal of this research is to demonstrate two related innovations. The  irst is a framework for\r\nautomated negotiation  for access to wireless services. The second is a small hardware device that the user\r\ncan carry, a personal router, which contains the necessary wireless transceivers, implements the access\r\nnegotiation protocol, and provides a network connection for the other devices and appliances that a person\r\nmight choose to carry. By creation of an open interface between this personal router and other devices a\r\nuser might carry, an environment can be created for the development of new devices and applications.\r\n     The intellectual merit of this project is embodied in: a) the automated service negotiation framework, b)\r\nexperience with systems that use policy constraints to guide automatic configuration; c) the related\r\nprotocols for security and billing; d) the demonstration of the new application user interface paradigms\r\nimplied by the personal router; and e) identification and definition of the interfaces between this device\r\nand the other consumer devices that can be connected to the Internet using it. The broader impacts are the\r\npossibility of creating a new market model  or wireless service, based on small business investment and\r\nlocal competition, rather than service provision (only) by large, national-level corporations, and the\r\ndevelopment of  an increased understanding of user pricing preference for communication services.\r\nResearch that explores technology supporting alternative economic models is not likely to be done in\r\nprivate industry, and is thus especially appropriate for public-sector support.",
