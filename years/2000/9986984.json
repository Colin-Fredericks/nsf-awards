 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31), Engineering (59), Mathematical Sciences (21) \r\nThis CSEM Scholarship Program is providing scholarship support to 40 academically talented, but financially disadvantaged students that will allow them to attend school full-time and complete degrees in computer science, engineering technology and mathematics in a timely fashion. Undergraduate or graduate students who have a chance to complete their degree in two years are being selected from a pool of eligible students at the university or at four \"feeder\" community colleges in middle Tennessee.  Students enter the program at the end of their sophomore year and participate in a two-year program designed to graduate highly competent, competitive professionals.  To achieve this goal, faculty are stressing academic excellence with high standards and realistic expectations of participants whose needs are assessed at admission and continuously monitored and met throughout the program.  Students are  involved in disciplined inquiry and research under the direction of faculty mentors, and they spend one day a semester in the work environment of the corporate world or a graduate school depending on their goals.  In addition to academic counseling and guidance, CSEMS students are receiving career, financial aid, and personal counseling as needed, and assistance in such critical areas as writing, study skills, tutoring, preparation for exit exams and the GRE, resume writing, job interviewing, and selecting a graduate school.  The project expects to increase the number of graduates with degrees in computer science, engineering technology, and mathematics to help meet the country's shortage of technical professionals in areas of national need.",
