 "awd_abstract_narration": "NEW STATISTICAL CHALLENGES POSED BY MULTISCALE AND ADAPTIVE\r\nREPRESENTATIONS  D.L. Donoho & I.M. Johnstone, PI's.\r\nProject period: 07/01/00 -- 06/30/05\r\n\r\nThe project will address the following specific topics:\r\n1. Estimation in tomography: the curvelet tight frame of\r\nrepresentation seems, according to preliminary calculations, to\r\nachieve faster rates of convergence than traditional tomographic\r\nmethods.\r\n2. Estimation and testing in time-frequency analysis: a new tight\r\nframe of chirplets has been built by deploying curvelets in the\r\ntime-frequency plane.  The new representation has promise for detection and\r\nestimation of chirps in the presence of noise.\r\n3. Recent work in computational vision asks ``what is the best basis\r\nfor representing natural images?''  It is proposed that many empirical\r\nresults in the rapidly growing literature on this topic might be\r\nexplained and improved using analytically-constructed representations:\r\nridgelets and curvelets.\r\n4. Geometry-driven diffusions are popular in applied image processing\r\n-- but their quantitative performance is not well-understood. It is\r\nproposed to develop a quantitative statistical theory using recent\r\ntools such as multiscale ridgelets.\r\n5. Extensions of Sparsity-Based ideas. Problems of finding `edgels in\r\nwhite noise' and `subspaces in white noise' offer challenging and\r\ntimely directions in which to generalize existing sparsity ideas.\r\n6. Testing Sparse Means.  An adaptive approach is suggested for\r\ntesting if the mean of a random vector is nonzero, when the vector\r\nmight exhibit an unknown degree of sparsity.\r\n7. Asymptotics of top eigenvalues of large covariance matrices.\r\nA program is set out to develop statistical theory for principal\r\ncomponents of large data matrices based on recent progress in\r\nrandom matrix theory.\r\nConsistent with the principle of ``reproducible research'', software\r\nand figures from this project will be made available in future\r\nreleases of the public domain WaveLab system.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent years, research in wavelets and time-frequency methods has\r\nbroadened to construct new systems of representation, including\r\nsystems custom-tailored for specific phenomena.  Examples include\r\nwavelet packets and cosine packets, and very recently, systems like\r\nedgelets, ridgelets, chirplets, warplets, and curvelets.  In parallel,\r\nresearch in statistical analysis and cognate fields allows data\r\nthemselves to dictate the design of their own optimal systems of\r\nrepresentation.  Principal components (i.e.  Karhunen-Loeve\r\ndecomposition) is the oldest example of such data-adaptive\r\nrepresentation; many newer ideas have been proposed recently, such as\r\nindependent components analysis.  The proposers have been\r\nactive in both domains, creating new image and signal\r\nrepresentations and developing statistical theory to underpin adaptive\r\nsignal representations.  The current project will (a) pursue two\r\nopportunities arising from the recent introduction of curvelets, (b)\r\naddress two active applied research areas, computational vision and\r\ngeometry driven diffusions, and (c) attack some issues which are\r\nargued to be at the core of new developments in statistical decision\r\ntheory. Topic (a) may have implications for applied work in\r\ntomography, image and signal processing, and (c) may impact applied\r\nuses of principal components in domains such as climate and global\r\nchange studies.\r\n\r\n",
