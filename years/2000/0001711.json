 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the study of multi-player cooperative games by the means of reducing them to non-cooperative games, that is, the \"Nash program.\"  It is based on some newer ideas and methods that favor its feasibility.  The current approach is partially inspired by that used in evolutionary games, where strategies are selected from a class of types based on their outcomes in actual play.\r\n\r\nThe other important basis for the project is a new approach for providing a means for the elimination of coalitions as such and their replacement by \"agencies.\"  The usual approach based on formation and dissolution of coalitions is avoided by studying a transformed game, where each player can designate or elect another to act as his/her agent.  This is very simplifying because a priori there is no limit to the complexity of the relevant interactions of coalitions and their members.\r\n\r\nIn studying the transformed game we allow the players to employ \"reactive strategies\" of specific forms.  This is directly analogous to the phenotype strategies studied in evolutionary games.  Thus how a player will allocate the possible gains in a playing of the game, if he/she has become elected to be the effective general agent, can be a function of an allowed form that depends on the previous history of the playing of the game.\r\n\r\nThe fulfilled expectations equilibrium of such strategies is explored.  Numerical calculations with two and three players show that the approach can give results interestingly relating to various standard cooperative solution concepts such as the Nash-Zeuthen and the Kalai-Smorodinsky solutions for two-person bargaining and the nucleolus or the Shapley value in three-person games.  It is proposed to more carefully study the relatively simple three-person game examples that seem to effectively feature all of the basic difficulties of extending cooperative theory beyond the level of 2-player games.\r\n\r\nThis project is intrinsically theoretical, in relation to economics, but it can be observed that understanding of cooperative games enables applications to many economic and political contexts, where some players do act as agents for others.  For example, in mergers and acquisitions one bank or underwriting firm takes the lead role, and international trade negotiations the major countries represent regional blocks.\r\n",
