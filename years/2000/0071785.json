 "awd_abstract_narration": "An international conference on functionally-graded materials (FGM) will be held September 10-14, 2000 in Estes Park, Colorado.  This conference will bring together scientists and engineers on a commonality of themes related to spatial variations of material properties.  With a continuing emphasis on mechanics, the FGM concept has been extended into nearly all applications of materials as well as into other types of materials, such as polymers and bio-materials. Holding this meeting in the United States affords an opportunity for many domestic researchers to become more familiar with this highly interdisciplinary topic in North America.  Approximately 200 people will participate in this conference.  They will come from 22 countries around the world and be have industrial, national laboratory, and academic backgrounds.  Support for this conference will be used to enable students of participating faculty to attend the meeting.\r\n\r\nFunctionally gradient materials are of increasing importance since today's devices and those of the future will increasingly use materials integrated with another material.  This conference will expand the boundaries of the knowledge on FGMs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
