Tile\r\n\texistence of individual differences in judgment and decision making has been widely\r\n\tnoted but riot many previous studies have focused on identifying the antecedent\r\n\tconditions. Tin this proposal we focus on stable person characteristics that relate to the\r\n\tmanner in which information is processed in arriving at a judgment or decision. The\r\n\tproposed experiments will provide links between individual difference indices and\r\n\tmeasures of the process by which a decision maker reaches his or her final choice.\r\n\tIndividual difference measures to be used in the proposed research include personality\r\n\tfactors such as extraversion and neuroticiscn which have been shown in previous research\r\n\tto account for significant variance in various tasks in memory and cognition, measures of\r\n\taffective state, and most notably, a measure of cognitive style widely and successfully\r\n\tused in the areas of persuasion and attitude change but only recently used in the area of\r\n\tjudgment. and decision making. Such measures should provide us with new insights into\r\n\twhy, in the same situation, one person will decide one way and another person will\r\n\tdecide the other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
