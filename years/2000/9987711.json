The ISDCI major objective is to foster and maintain international scientific cooperation as well as communication between individual scientists, regional groups, and National Societies interested in developmental and comparative immunology. This objective is achieved by organizing an International Congress every three years. The Congress provides a variety of formats for the presentation of results and scientific discussions and an excellent forum in which younger Society members are encouraged to present their own results and to interact with senior Society members.  Participants of the Congress will cover recent advances in the field: advances in the evolution of the immune systems at the cellular, molecular and genetic levels as well as advances in the adaptation of the immune defense system of various organisms in different environments.",
