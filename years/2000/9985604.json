 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF/EPA Technology for Sustainable Environment project investigates an innovative technique of using an atmospheric pressure plasma for pretreatment of metal surfaces before application of protective coatings.  A non-thermal atmospheric plasma is a clean source of reactive radicals (H and OH) that can modify surface properties and improve the wettability of metals. A novel method is used to generate uniform non-thermal plasma in argon/hydrogen/H2O mixtures. This technique leaves no toxic residues or waste, unlike conventional methods such as sand blasting, alkaline and acidic treatment. A three phase research plan will investigate (1) the generation of the appropriate atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma, (2) the nature of chemical and physical changes on the surface of steel that take place upon treatment with non-thermal plasma, and (3) the effectiveness of anti-corrosive coatings such as adhesion, adsorption or chemical reactivity of the coating material to steel surface.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project period, the viability of the technique for pretreatment of metal surfaces for industrial application will be demonstrated.  This non-polluting alternative to treating surfaces with chemicals also has the advantage of providing better binding of the surface and the coating due to the uniform hydroxylation of the surface. This is significant to the potential adoption by industry, with both environmental and economic impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
