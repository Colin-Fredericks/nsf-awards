The radiocarbon is measurable only with very sensitive techniques and the investigators state that it is not associated with environmental risk. Dr. Trumbore is investigating how long it takes for the excess 14C fixed by trees in July/August 1999 to move through leaf, roots and woody plant tissues, soil organic matter, fungi and decomposer organisms, and CO2 produced in the soils.  The work is being performed in collaboration with a group of researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The understanding of rates of carbon uptake and release by ecosystems gained from this study will be relevant to basic ecosystem science (understanding tree physiology and carbon allocation) as well as to predictions of the capacity of forest ecosystems to sequester carbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
