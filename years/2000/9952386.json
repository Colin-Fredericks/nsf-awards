 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nThe development of new guided inquiry-based lab activities which utilize computerized data acquisition instrumentation is providing students with the opportunity to become more involved in the process of science and perform computer-assisted analysis of data. The activities being provided by this project are an adaptation of innovative teaching strategies and activities from several institutions, most notably CSU Fullerton, Hampshire College and Butler University. Students are being introduced to basic physiological experimental procedures using the requested equipment. Collaborative student groups are then being presented with experimental questions to which they must discover the answers. With guidance from the instructor, student groups are forming a testable hypothesis, designing the experiment and analyzing the data. These activities are building the necessary skills for students in the advanced physiology labs to conduct independent projects. Written lab reports and group presentations, are incorporated into the labs. This new approach is promoting the development of critical and analytical thinking, increasing student comprehension of physiological concepts, and introducing students to the usefulness of computers as biological and analytical tools.  Expected outcomes include: summative evaluations to measure student learning in the targeted courses; the development of a web page to disseminate the developed activities and procedures; and a workshop to promote inquiry-based learning in two year colleges. The project is impacting approximately 350 students each year and emphasizes two DUE themes: diversity and integration of technology to improve learning.\r\n\r\n",
