The PI's are utilizing recent research on cognition and effective science instruction to develop three module types: an integrated basic math/graphing skills module for biology, chemistry and physics; a module on atomic absorption spectroscopy for biology and chemistry; and a module on biotechnology procedures for biology and physics. \r\n\r\nMedia-rich interactive material is being deployed on CD-ROM's linked to a web-based shell to provide material that can be easily updated and linked to a database. A team consisting of an instructional designer, a graphic artist, computer programmers, and content experts is being organized to design and implement the materials. Faculty from other institutions are involved in evaluating the prototypes. During beta testing, student performance on selected segments is being monitored. Once the materials are completed and tested, they will be made available to be disseminated on CD-ROM and over the web through a central repository. Presentations about the project are planned for national and regional science education meetings.\r\n",
