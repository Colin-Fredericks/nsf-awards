 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an instrument acquisition award to Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. A Fatigue Crack Growth/Fracture Toughness System will be purchased. The instrument will be used to study Stress-Corrosion-Crack (SCC) growth rates of various aluminum alloys.  Specifically, the Fatigue Crack Growth/Fracture Toughness System is a critical piece of equipment which, in combination with other equipment, will be used to study the effect of retrogression and re-aging on 6xxx and 7xxx series aluminum alloys in muffle furnaces.  Successful results will produce weight savings, a great benefit to aluminum industries.\r\n\r\nThis is an instrument acquisition award to Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. A Fatigue Crack Growth/Fracture Toughness System will be purchased. The instrument will be used to study Stress-Corrosion-Crack (SCC) growth rates of various aluminum alloys.  Undergraduate students will be taught the background of fracture mechanics and how to use the Fatigue Crack Growth/Fracture Toughness System.  Additionally, the undergraduate students will learn the background of retrogression and re-aging and the significance of the success of this work.  After completing the curriculum and sample experiments, the students will then incorporate the results of testing on this system with the results of other experiments, namely, heat treatments, tensile testing, and electrical resistivity determination. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
