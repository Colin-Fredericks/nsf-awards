 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Studies in Ceramics will focus on interfacial networks, their structure, dynamics, and control. This subject lies at the heart of the emerging ability to design ceramic materials with specific microstructures and properties.  Recent research activities among ceramists and the growing number of publications in this area indicates that a meeting on this topic is especially timely.  Key researchers in the field have committed to attend this meeting and describe their most recent findings (see http://mimp.mems.cmu.edu/~grc/ for a schedule). To augment the traditional technical presentations, four additional program initiatives have been incorporated into the meeting.  First, a scientific panel discussion is will be held to address the important issue of how we conduct interface studies. The expert panel (and audience) will address the question of how one selects an appropriate length scale for the study of grain boundary networks; the advantages and disadvantages of atomic and microscopic observations will be debated.  An online, web-based discussion of the question will be initiated to foreshadow the proceedings at the meeting.  At the conference, the forum will involve a moderated panel of experts in the area who will each be given 15 minutes to present a viewpoint.  Comments will then be invited from the audience so that all of the participants can engage in the discussion.  Second, an education forum is planned.  A panel of educators has been invited to present strategies for the co-existence of ceramics education within a materials science curriculum. The panel will meet with interested conference participants during an afternoon session and the panel leader will present a synopsis of the findings during a meeting of all conference participants.\r\nThird, an invited poster session has been arranged to accommodate a higher fraction of young professionals in the program.  This poster session is meant to provide an opportunity for young scientists and engineers at the start of their independent research careers to describe their most recent results.  Fourth, graduate students working on thesis topics relevant to the conference will be encouraged to submit abstracts for poster presentations and, based on the merit of the abstracts, will be offered funding for their conference registration. \r\n\r\nThis Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Studies in Ceramics will focus on interfacial networks, their structure, dynamics, and control. This subject lies at the heart of the emerging ability to design ceramic materials with specific microstructures and properties.  The conference will gather scholars and educators at all career levels in an atmosphere conducive not only to making technical progress, but also for establishing sustainable collaborations and professional relationships. \r\n",
