 "awd_abstract_narration": "9985194  Boll  Successful watershed restoration requires an understanding of the complex interaction between climate, land use, hydrology, water quality, ecology and the human behavioral and economic considerations of those living in and interacting with the environment.  In individual watersheds, landowners, municipalities, state and federal agencies are seeking information and tools to evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to improve water quality.  At the research level, tools and models are being developed to represent more accurately a region's water and pollutant transport processes, but applications to situations having a significant impact are limited.  The purpose of this grant is to  better educate future hydrology and water quality experts and those individuals needing to improve water quality, and to gain a better understanding of water and pollutant transport in the watersheds of the Northwest Wheat  and Range Region (NWRR) in the Pacific Northwest.  This grant has the following purposes:\r\n1. To initiate and develop a process to develop a Discipline in Hydrology and Water Quality for studies at the undergraduate and graduate levels; \r\n2. To establish an Education and Research Watershed;\r\n3. Research objectives: (a) To develop a field data collection program for model development and evaluation of watershed restoration activities; (b) to develop a family of GIS-based distributed water and contaminant transport models applicable to the NWRR; and (c) to determine the level of complexity required to evaluate watershed restoration activities using uncertainty analysis in model predictions; \r\n4. Education objectives: (a) To improve and expand courses in Hydrology and Water Quality through integration with data collection efforts in Paradise Creek Watershed; (b) To collaborate with local organizations, state and federal agencies and university extension agents to enhance education of land owners and local residents with respect to environmental aspects of Paradise Creek watershed; and (c) To involve land owners and local residents in the collection of climate data in Paradise Creek watershed.\r\nThe education and research objectives will be achieved in collaboration with the Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, and assistance and support from the Latah Soil and Water Conservation District, the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the University of Idaho Extension System. ***\r\n",
