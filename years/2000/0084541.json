Together with partners and cooperators in state and local government agencies, academia and non-profit organizations, and private industry, these agencies have a need for advancing the development of a national data and information infrastructure to better support the collection, management, dissemination and application of biodiversity data and information.  To a great extent, the vision of this enhanced 21st century biodiversity data and information system is described in the 1998 Teaming with Life report of the President's Committee of Advisory in Science and Technology (PCAST) which called for developing the \"Next Generation\" of the National Biological Information Infrastructure of NBII.  The development of this next generation NBII has also been endorsed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy's Committee on Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) as a key component of the multi-agency science strategy called \"Integrated Science for Ecosystem Challenges.\"  The need now is to convey the informatics research issues and requirements involved in developing the next generation NBII to computer science and information technology researchers and developers in academia, industry and government laboratories.  This workshop will bring together a broad spectrum of people from the CS/IT community in pursuing the research agenda and applying that technology.\r\n",
