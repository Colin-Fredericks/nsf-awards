 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe underlying purpose of the AK RSI has been to implement a set of initiatives to document\r\nthe indigenous knowledge systems of Alaska Native people and develop pedagogical practices\r\nand curricula that appropriately incorporate indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing into\r\nthe formal education system. The systemic reform focus of the AKRSI reform strategy is the\r\nfostering of connectivity and complementarity between two interdependent but historically\r\ndisconnected, alienated complex systems - the indigenous knowledge systems rooted in the \r\nNative cultures that inhabit rural Alaska, and the formal education systems imported to serve \r\nthe educational needs of rural Native communities. Within each of these evolving systems is \r\na rich body of complementary scientific and mathematical knowledge that can serve to \r\nstrengthen the educational experiences and improve the academic performance of students \r\nthroughout rural Alaska. The following initiatives constitute AKRSI educational reform strategy: \r\n\r\nCulturally Aligned Curriculum/Cultural Standards\r\nVillage Science Applications and Careers/ANSES Chapters, Camps and Fairs\r\nIndigenous Science Knowledge Base/Multimedia Cultural Atlas Development\r\nNative Ways of Knowing/Parent Involvement\r\nElders and Cultural Camps/Academy of Elders\r\n\r\nThe initiatives above will be implemented on a region-by-region basis, building on Phase I\r\nto integrate the reform process into the everyday workings of the schools and districts\r\nto a sustainable level by the end of Phase Il.  Also an array of statewide intiative will be \r\nimplemented to support the activities at the local and regional levels.\r\nFollowing is a summary of the statewide initiatives relative to the implementation of the \r\nRegional initiatives during Phase II.\r\n\r\nMath/Science Performance Standards and Assessments\r\nAlaska Standards for Culturally Responsive Schools\r\nCultural Frameworks for Curriculum\r\nNative Educator Associations\r\nAlaska Native Knowledge Network\r\nConsortium for Alaska Native Higher Education\r\n\r\nThe experience and academic achievement successes gained during Phase I, are \r\nthe basic strategy for Phase II, but will be continued with greater intensity and delineation. \r\nof emphases. The locus of activity will be in the same 20 rural school districts as partners \r\nin those schools with the primary differences during Phase II being the concentration of \r\neffort and increased emphases on sustainability of the initiatives.\r\n",
