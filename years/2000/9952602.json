 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe project integrates an automatic polarimeter into courses including Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic and Biochemistry for nursing majors, research-oriented General Chemistry laboratory, Chemistry for non-science majors, and undergraduate research. Experiments from standard research and industrial literature are being adapted.  The purpose of this integration is three-fold:  to promote student awareness of and participation in green chemistry, or the reduction of adverse environmental impact in an economically responsible manner, to facilitate student understanding of stereochemical concepts, and to increase student exposure to modern instrumentation that is used in industrial and academic research laboratories.  These purposes complement the goals of an ongoing Institution-Wide Curriculum Reform Project in science.  \r\n\r\nThe polarimeter is used in combination with other instruments to characterize optically-active products.  The objectives of this project are to train students to eliminate waste proejcts before they form, use water as a reaction medium, switch to biodegradable and non-toxic reagents, replace stoichiometric methods with catalytic alternatives, and understand stereochemistry as a classification scheme.  This latter objective falls under the rubric of a campus-wide NSF-supported curriculum reform grant that is already underway and will culminate in the year 2000 with the publication of a laboratory manual of modules suitable for nonscience majors.  Over 100 students per year are impacted by this project.",
