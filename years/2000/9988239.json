 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the original theory for hazard elimination in combinational circuits is being expanded to also accelerate circuit speed while reducing power consumption.  This method relies on transistor timing adjustments to eliminate hazards, and also on transistor resizing to speed up multiple circuit paths.  One method being investigated is to enumerate path delays in the circuit, and use them as non-linear programming constraints.  This will be feasible if the circuit is partitioned.  Another method being investigated is a different formulation that does not require path enumeration.  Experiments on both formulations are being conducted using linear and non-linear programming solvers.  Since it is not clear which method is superior, both will be tried using AMPL, which is a widely used mathematical programming package.\r\n\tHazards account for 60% of the power used in certain arithmetic circuits.  Hazards are eliminated with either the balanced path delay method or by an original method of increasing logic gate inertial delays so that gates do not respond to hazard-creating input conditions.  Agrawal and Bushnell have proven the minimum transient energy conditions necessary for a circuit to use minimal energy, and developed the first optimal linear programming method for transistor resizing to minimize transient energy. They use a simultaneous application of both the balanced path delay method, and the method of increasing logic gate inertial delays to make logic gates filter out hazards.  The balanced path delay method frequently requires the insertion of buffers to balance path delays, or decreased transistor sizes on fast paths to achieve the same effect.  Hazard filtering, instead, merely requires that logic gates be slowed down so that they cannot react to hazard-producing conditions at their inputs.  The project is developing a non-linear programming method to adjust path delays by transistor resizing to simultaneously lower power and speed up the circuit, while limiting the increase in chip area.  This beneficial method substantially reduces power while speeding up the circuit, which lowers chip packaging, cooling, and silicon costs.\r\n",
