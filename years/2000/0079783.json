Overzet\r\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\r\nMRI: Acquisition of a Plasma Science Research and Research Training Laboratory\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe acquisition and development of a plasma science teaching and research laboratory is a joint effort among 5 faculty members in the Schools of Engineering and Computer Science and Natural Science and Mathematics at the University of Texas at Dallas. The laboratory development provides five distinct plasma stations with related diagnostics on each system. The five plasma-generation systems and the diagnostics for them offer a diverse research-training experience for students. As these plasma systems were chosen to reflect the research interests of the faculty, this laboratory also provides a fertile research environment for the PIs. The facilities installed are the following: 1] an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system with a residual gas analyzer, a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, and an Absorption Spectroscopy (AS) system; 2] a dc/pulsed magnetron source for sputter deposition of films with optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and deposited film analysis; 3] a hollow cathode discharge source with a microwave interferometer and Langmuir probes; 4] a dc/rf parallel plate plasma source with an FTIR spectrometer, deposited film analysis, Langmuir probe and current-voltage probes; and 5] various lamps with OES, AS, and current-voltage measurement capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe plasma science laboratory provides a research training capability at UTD for both undergraduate (upper level) and graduate students in Engineering and the Natural Sciences.  It encompasses a strong teaching component, resonates with the needs of local industry, and can potentially address needs of further removed industry. It will undoubtedly be used to train non-traditional students as well. The extensive research backgrounds and interests of the investigators in semiconductor processing (etching deposition and doping), lighting plasmas, and space plasmas allow students, as well as technical and research staff from local industry, to learn about basic plasma processes and diagnostics in the expanding fields of plasma science and technology. The Laboratory also enhances the research capabilities and teaming of the five collaborating researchers along with other investigators in both academe and industry. The lab is housed in modern clean room facilities, and consequently the equipment is suitable for both research training and for advanced research programs in materials processing, device manufacturing, and lighting. \r\n",
