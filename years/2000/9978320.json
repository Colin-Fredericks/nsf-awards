 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Coker is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on the development of semiclassical methods for treating quantum dynamics in condensed phase systems.  New methods for computing real time correlation functions in condensed phase quantum systems based on semiclassical expressions for the propagator will be developed and applied to model solution phase systems where nuclear interference and tunneling effects play a crucial role in determining spectroscopy, transport and other dynamical solute properties in solution.  The semiclassical approach employs a propagator method using a swarm of weighted classical trajectories, each multiplied by a phase factor. The time correlation function contains two of these propagators and thus includes interference effects between pairs of phase weighted classical trajectories.  Combined nonadiabatic MD and semiempirical electronic structure methods will be extended to study photodissociation and geminate recombination dynamics of triiodide anion  in solution. Quantal interference effects in the intramolecular vibrations of this molecule in solution will be explored with this new semiclassical approach.\r\n\r\nSince most industrial synthetic processes occur in solution, it is important to gain an increased understanding of the influence that solvent has on fundamental chemical processes in solvated systems including molecular transport, proton transfer, and electronic excitation.  This theoretical research will lead to an improved understanding of the factors which influence chemical reactions in solution.",
