This award provides supplemental funding to PHY 9528844 to allow addition of an international component, collaborative work with Australia. The proposed collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to combine the knowledge of both groups to further enhance the understanding of magnetic properties of nuclei far away from stability.  \r\n\r\n The U.S. PI, Paul Mantica, has arranged an opportunity for work with ANU to perform measurements with stable beams during the period that the accelerator facilities at Michigan State are shut down. Researchers at ANU have a well-established and internationally recognized program that provides complementary experimental opportunities for the MSU group.  This supplemental funding will support travel to Australia by the PI and two US graduate students to plan and perform experiments using the 14-UD accelerator in the Department of Nuclear Physics at ANU.  Complementary measurements with unstable beams would be performed at MSU once the upgrade of the accelerator facility is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
