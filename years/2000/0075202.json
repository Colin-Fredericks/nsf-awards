 "awd_abstract_narration": "0075202\r\nLavin and Weeden\r\n\tBotanists Matt Lavin and Norm Weeden, with Mexican collaborator Alfonso Delgado-Salinas, are studying the taxonomy and evolution of the legumes traditionally treated in the large genus Vigna, the Old World members of which include azuki bean and mungbean. Their preliminary molecular (DNA sequence data) and morphological studies show that New World species treated as Vigna in fact are more closely related to other New World legume genera like Dolichopsis, Mysanthus, Phaseolus, and Strophostyles than to the Old World Vigna. The study proposes to analyze the genetic and morphological variation of 140 or so species in Vigna and these other closely related genera, emphasizing in particular DNA sequence data from nuclear and chloroplast genes and adding morphological characters studied from herbarium specimens and field collections. One product of this study will be a taxonomy based on evolutionary relatedness, which plant breeders will be able to use as a guide for most efficiently selecting which species or races to use in experiments involving hybridization.  Currently, this is not available to plant breeders for this group of plants. Genetic analysis of the species of Vigna also has biogeographic importance.  Again, preliminary evidence reveals that all of the New World species form a genetically distinctive group that is most closely related to another genetically singular group centered in Africa and Asia. Over-water migration is one possible explanation for this disjunct pattern of split ranges, but it is also possible that a once-widespread, ancient range has been split by extinction events or by continental drift between Africa and the Americas. The investigators hope to identify \"genetic footprints\" in the DNA data they accumulate from the studied species, that may indicate which species are ancient (i.e., dating back to about 40 million years) on their respective continents, and which species are recent arrivals from another continent. \r\n\r\n",
