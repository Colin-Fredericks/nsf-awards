In particular the role of\r\nthese constructions will be considered in two areas:  In 3-dimensional\r\ntopology, they arise in the guise of of perturbative and non-perturbative\r\ninvariants of Chern-Simons field theory.  There is a good chance that such\r\ninvariants are related to the Thurston Geometrization Program, at least for\r\nhyperbolic manifolds.  In quantum computation, the same non-perturbative\r\nChern-Simons field theory produces an interesting method for fault tolerance,\r\none which needs to be developed further.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the project is to develop and apply certain areas of algebra in\r\nwhich formulas have a geometric structure.  Two famous examples of this are a\r\nlinear algebra, in which matrices have some geometry, and Feynman diagrams,\r\nwhose geometry is physically meaningful. Geometrization of algebraic formulas\r\nhas been influential in enumerative combinatorics, in non-commutative algebra,\r\nand in geometric topology in the last 15 years.  One of the first and most\r\nimportant representatives of this recent trend is the Jones polynomial, an\r\ninvariant of knots.  Although the Jones polynomial arose in algebra and\r\nmathematical, it and its generalization are at least as important in topology,\r\nand recently also in quantum computation.  These applications of the new trend\r\nin algebra will be investigated.\r\n\r\n",
