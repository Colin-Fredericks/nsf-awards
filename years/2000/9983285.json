 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individual neurons in the nervous system use electrical impulses or action \r\npotentials to communicate sensory information from one region of the brain \r\nto another region.  This project is concerned with determining how neurons \r\nin the somatosensory part of the thalamus communicate with neurons in the \r\nsomatosensory part of the cerebral cortex during tactile stimulation.  More \r\nspecifically, we wish to measure how the relative timing of action \r\npotentials among neighboring thalamic neurons might alter the \r\nresponsiveness of neurons in the cerebral cortex.  Many neuroscientists \r\nbelieve that cortical neurons are likely to respond with an action \r\npotential when they receive communication from multiple thalamic neurons at \r\nthe same time but are less likely to respond if they receive communication \r\nfrom only one thalamic neuron.  We will directly test this hypothesis by \r\ninserting multiple electrodes into both brain regions and recording the \r\nprecise times of their neuronal action potentials when the skin is touched \r\nby a computer controlled air puff.  We will use statistical analysis to \r\ndetermine if the probability of a cortical action potential is highest when \r\npairs of thalamic neurons discharge at the same time (in synchrony) or at \r\ndifferent times (asynchronously).  We will also use our computer controlled \r\nair puffer to stimulate the skin in a variety of spatiotemporal \r\nconfigurations to determine which types of tactile stimuli are best for \r\nactivating pairs of thalamic neurons at the same time.  We will also use \r\nthis method to determine which tactile stimuli activate pairs of cortical \r\nneurons at the same time.  This research project is important because it \r\nwill determine if neuronal synchronization is a mechanism used by the brain \r\nto communicate information from one brain region to the next.  This project \r\nwill also provide evidence suggesting whether neuronal synchronization \r\ncould be used by the brain to represent certain types of sensory \r\nstimuli.  Hence, when this project is completed, we will know how \r\nindividual cortical neurons respond to simultaneous inputs and this will \r\ngreatly increase our understanding of how neuronal circuits operate in the \r\nmammalian brain.\r\n\r\n",
