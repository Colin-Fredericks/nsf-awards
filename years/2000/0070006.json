(BBSR) will operate the R/V Weatherbird II during 2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-supported research projects.  The Weatherbird II is a 115 ft. vessel, constructed in 1982 and converted in 1993, and is owned and operated by BBSR.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 132 operational days during 2000, of which all days are in support of NSF-supported investigators. The projects scheduled on the vessel represent several oceanographic disciplines and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel.  The Weatherbird II continues to support such programs as the JGOFS sponsored BATS Program, the Hydrostation S time series, deep sediment trap work and atmospheric lead work.  Operations will take place around Bermuda, most approximately within 6 hour transit time.  New main engines, installed during shipyard visit in 1999, are operating satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe Weatherbird II is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
