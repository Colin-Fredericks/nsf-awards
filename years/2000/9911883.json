The reform effort grows out of a comprehensive planning process led by the five core districts and with Colorado College, Pikes Peak Community College, the Hewlett-Packard Company and the United States Space Foundation.  The project will impact 47,000 kindergarten through fifth-grade students and their 1,300 teachers in 74 schools.  Implementation of the science program will be accomplished through a three-tiered staff development model: Induction and Mentoring efforts; courses in Science Content, Pedagogy and Assessment; and Leadership Development programs.  Tier one is designed to meet the needs of teachers new to the kit-based science approach, while tier two is aimed at introducing experienced teachers to unifying concepts that blend science content and pedagogical understanding.  The third tier impacts selected teachers and administrators by providing them with long-term advanced programs in science and science education to further ensure a new culture of reflective teaching and sustainable reform.  \r\n",
