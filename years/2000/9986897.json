 "awd_abstract_narration": "(31) This project enables talented but financially disadvantaged students to pursue an undergraduate degree in computer science on a full-time basis. Special emphasis is placed on the recruitment of two classes of students underrepresented in computer science, namely, women and ethnic minorities, with particular emphasis placed on Native Americans. A collaborative partnership between the Department of Computer Science at the university, Minnesota's tribal college and several northeastern community colleges, and the regional computer industry supports this endeavor. The project results in an infrastructure that attracts talented students in northeastern Minnesota and prepares them for careers in computer science. Although this project centers on computer science, the model to be implemented is applicable to any area of science and engineering. The infrastructure emphasizes academic preparation in computer science, encourages student achievement, and provides scholarships, mentoring programs, transition programs, and opportunities for internships and collaborative research with Computer Science faculty. The project focuses on the retention of students in the program, ensuring their continued academic success, and professional placement on receipt of the baccalaureate. \r\n",
