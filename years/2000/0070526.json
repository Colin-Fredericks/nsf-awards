 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe main theme of the project is to develop the theory of fourth order\r\nequations arising from conformal geometric considerations. The first\r\npart of the project seeks to apply the fourth order equation as \r\nregularizing equations of the more natural but more difficult fully\r\nnonlinear partial differential equations in conformal geometry.\r\nThe first consequence will be natural conformal criteria for the\r\nexistence of a conformal metric of positive Ricci curvature. The second\r\npart of the project seeks to widen the set of conformal classes to which\r\nour theory of fourth order equations may be applied. A concrete problem\r\nwould be to find saddle point solutions of the fourth order equations\r\non a large class of four dimensional conformal structures of negative\r\nscalar curvature. The third part of the proposed project is to develop\r\nthe theory of biharmonic maps in four dimension. It is proposed to\r\ndevelop a classification of biharmonic maps of special conformal\r\nstructures. \r\n\r\nThe several parts of this proposal share a common novel feature to\r\nconsider a fourth order nonlinear differential equation that relates\r\nfourth order term of a scalar quantity to the scalar quantity itself.\r\nThe equation came from geometric considerations for a four dimensional\r\nspace that are natural from topological perspective. The project\r\nwill have an impact on the development of higher order differential\r\nequations in several ways. First it will introduce new techniques\r\nto study the solutions of such equations. Secondly, it will yield new\r\nmethods to solve the more traditional second order equations of geometric\r\ninterest. Thirdly, the results have aleady yield application to the\r\ngeometry of four dimensional space.\r\n",
