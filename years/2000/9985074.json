 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's research plan consists of theoretical development and a collaboration between the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to develop the next generation dynamic fault monitoring and control framework for semiconductor processing.  AMD has an award from NIST to develop an advanced process control framework (APCFW) jointly with Honeywell.  The PI is collaborating with AMD to develop a new generation of monitoring and control methodologies using equipment tool measurements, wafer state measurements, and lab-based wafer electrical tests (WET).\r\n\r\nThis research plan consists of two parts.  Part one aims to develop a new dynamic fault monitoring framework using error-in-variables model identification and dynamic structured residuals with maximized sensitivity for fault identification.  Part two applies the fault monitoring framework to semiconductor  processing and develop a run-to-run control methodology using equipment measurements, optical emission spectroscopy (OES), and WET properties from laboratory tests.  Non-intrusive OES sensors developed at Sandia will be used to collect data at very high resolution over a wide spectrum of wavelengths at sub-second sampling intervals.  The collaboration with AMD allows the PI to access their manufacturing equipment and real-time data that are not available in a university environment.\r\n\r\nThe education plan emphasizes the integration of research and education in semiconductor processing and fault monitoring and control.  Specific tasks will be:\r\n1. Develop an undergraduate/professional text on \"Unit Operations and Control of Semiconductor Processes\" based on this research.\r\n2. Develop an internet-based multimedia teaching package to provide students with live demonstrations of engineering concepts and self-paced interactive learning.\r\n3. Establish a bi-directional education infrastructure to educate students with practical experience at AMD and educate practicing engineers with modern control.\r\n4. Encourage female graduate students to pursue research in process control as women engineers are historically underrepresented in the process control field.\r\n",
