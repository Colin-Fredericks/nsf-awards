 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary The goal of this project is to enrich a vital yet historically neglected  segment of the science and technology education community. Rooted in a collaborative effort among Alfred State College, Jamestown Community College, Corning Incorporated, and Brookhaven National Laboratory  (BNL), the intent is to create an accessible, self-perpetuating, 'real world' capstone experience for students in isolated, rural two-year colleges. The four institutions will partner to develop lead teams composed of student and faculty collaborators who will participate in two consecutive summer internships at  BNL. The various teams, drawn from the participating colleges, will work on problems selected by staff members at both Corning and BNL. Problems will span the gamut from computer science to biotechnology and will take advantage of capabilities unique to BNL or Corning: notably a scientific  visualization facility, advanced scientific instruments, and cutting edge material science. Following internship, the lead teams will transmit and transport these projects to their home campuses, and will involve other faculty and students. This project will represent a next step in distance education. It creates an extended learning community which emphasizes campus-based, real time interactions among participants at different sites. The early projects will involve construction of scientific visualization facilities at the two campuses and mastery of selected measurement techniques at BNL.  Later projects win focus on problems for which a combination of measurement capabilities and visualization technology are uniquely helpful. The project addresses the DUE themes of technical experiences for students and faculty in a real world setting, faculty development, and integration of technology in education.",
