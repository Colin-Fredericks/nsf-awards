The participants will be chosen from the areas of  Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania which are in proximity to the University of Pennsylvania's campus.  The participants will work over three summers and two academic years to reach the goal of a Masters degree.  The chemistry department is working with the School of Education to develop and maintain the program.  The project will provide tuition and fee scholarships to the participants, including parking.  At the conclusion of this five-year program it is expected that 60 teachers will have received their Masters degree with another two cohorts having nearly completed it.  The university is committed to institutionalizing the project, and will provide the necessary support for the last two cohorts in particular.",
