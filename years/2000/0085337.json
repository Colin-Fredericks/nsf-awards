 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nResponse of Precast Construction in Turkey during the 1999 Earthquakes\r\n\r\nThe 1998 Turkish Seismic Code permits four types of precast construction:  moment-resisting frames, single-story hinged frames, structural wall panels, and combinations of precast moment-resisting frames with cast-in-place structural walls (solid or coupled).  Single-story hinged frames are used throughout Turkey for industrial facilities.  This type of structural system has not performed well in recent earthquakes, including the 1992 event in Erzincan, the 1998 event in Ceyhan, and the recent events near Izmit and Duzce.\r\n\r\nRecent experience has shown that precast structures in the U.S. are also vulnerable to earthquake damage.  Parking structures were sustained damage at higher than anticipated levels during the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  Only after detailed evaluation of precast parking structures in the Los Angeles area were the causes of the damage identified.  Many factors that contributed to the observed response were not considered in the governing building codes.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed work is to collect detailed information about the structural configuration and connection details from damaged and undamaged precast buildings in the region of Turkey affected by the 17 August and 12 November 1999 earthquakes.  Data collected will be evaluated with the goal of reducing the seismic vulnerability of precast construction in both the U.S. and Turkey.\r\n",
