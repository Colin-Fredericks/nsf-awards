 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research on understanding the nature and applications of ultrasound in chemical reactivity by Professor Kenneth Suslick of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  The specific studies include the performance of mechanistic and spectroscopic investigations of the cavitation event in sonochemistry, the preparation of novel inorganic materials and heterogeneous catalysts, and the synthesis of biomaterials. In addition, sonoluminesence will continue to be developed as a spectroscopic probe of the conditions created during bubble collapse. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to understand the complex events taking place in sonochemistry, which is the use of ultrasound for chemical reactions. The work will focus on the preparation of nanostructured and amorphous metals, alloys, carbides oxides and sulfides and their applications as catalysts for a variety of industrially important reactions. In addition, a sonochemical synthesis will be developed for the preparation of biomedical microstructures for use as MRI agents and other applications. The students involved in this project will be well prepared for careers in both chemical and related areas.\r\n",
