 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis conference will focus on the structures, mechanisms, biological roles, and practical applications of enzymes that act on DNA and RNA. The meeting aims to attract a broad cross-disciplinary group of scientists with expertise in structural biology, biochemistry, and cell biology. This meeting will be the fourth sponsored by the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) in the areas of nucleic acid enzymology; the most recent in this series was held in 1998, with support from the National Science Foundation. \r\n\r\n\tThe explosive pace of discovery of new enzymes that act on nucleic acids, the wealth of mechanistic information emerging from high resolution structural analysis, and the central role of DNA and RNA enzymology in biotechnology are factors that make this next FASEB 2000 meeting extremely timely and topical.  \tThe scientific program will consist of nine sessions of oral presentations by distinguished invited speakers.  The subjects of the sessions include the following areas: (1) DNA repair enzymes; (2) DNA and RNA polymerases; (3) Transposition and recombination; (4)  DNA and RNA modification enzymes; (5) Helicases and nucleic acid-dependent NTPases; (6) RNA and DNA catalysts; (7) Cleavage and degradative enzymes; and (8) New applications for nucleic acid enzymes and new insights from genomics into the evolution of enzyme systems. The organizers have recruited leading investigators to serve as discussion leaders for these sessions. The program will also include daily poster sessions. \r\n\r\n \tThe conference aims to highlight the parallels and differences between enzymes involved in DNA metabolism and those of the RNA world. Hence, the program has been configured so that most sessions will include talks on both RNA and DNA transactions. The intimate format of the conference is designed to promote free exchange of information and ideas among researchers who work on RNA and DNA enzymes - thereby expediting research in both fields.  Such research enhances our understanding of the natural world and thus our ability to use it for the greater benefit of society.   \t\r\n\r\n\tAll attendees will be asked to present posters on their research. To encourage career development of junior scientists, six outstanding posters from the ranks of graduate students and post-doc attendees will be selected for oral presentations. Financial support from NSF will be  targeted specifically to the six junior scientists and will also be used to defray expenses for the sessions listed above.",
