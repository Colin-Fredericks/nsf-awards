The program's awards provide\r\nopportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or\r\ncomplementary facilities, expertise and experimental\r\nconditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Christopher Klausmeier with support for 12 months to work \r\nwith Drs. Peter Bossard and Elena Litchman at EAWAG/ETH Limnological Research \r\nCentre in Kastanienbaum, Switzerland, Dr. Tadeusz Kawecki at the University of Basel, \r\nand Dr. Ulf Dieckmann at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis \r\n(IIASA) in Vienna, Austria.  The topic of his research is the theoretical approach to \r\nunderstanding the structure of ecological communities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop flexible theoretical techniques which would allow \r\ncommunity structure to self-organize from a range of potentially interacting species.  \r\nThese approaches have been pioneered by Dr. Dieckmann's group at IIASA for use in \r\nevolutionary studies.  With collaborators at EAWAG, Dr. Klausmeier will apply these \r\ntechniques to mechanistic models of a particular kind of ecological system:  lake \r\nplankton communities.  He will determine how community structure depends on \r\nenvironmental parameters such as nutrient loading, then test these predictions against \r\ndata from a range of lakes.  He expects to develop new general mathematical techniques \r\nfor studying community assembly.  By applying them to lake plankton communities, he \r\nhopes to expand understanding of how the structure of these communities depends on \r\nenvironmental parameters and how they will respond to human impacts.\r\n",
