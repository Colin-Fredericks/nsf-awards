Young (Calvin College) \r\nThe History of Igneous Petrology\r\n\r\nDespite a wide range of studies in the history of geology, no comprehensive survey of the history of igneous petrology, one of the fundamental geological disciplines, has yet been written. The investigator has been working on such a survey since 1995 and will complete writing the history of igneous petrology during a year-long sabbatical leave in Academic Year 1999-2000 and Summer 2000.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental objectives are to discover the ways in which scientific, technological, social, geographical, institutional, educational, philosophical, personal, and political factors have influenced the overall development of the discipline and to write a narrative, Mind and Magma, addressed to petrologists, mineralogists, geochemists, and historians of geology that analyzes the interplay of these factors on the unfolding of igneous petrology. The text will contribute to our understanding of early ideas about volcanoes, the origin of basalt controversy, early views on plutonism, early petrographic concepts, the advent of microscopic petrography, the role of geologic age in early petrographic classification, spatial aspects of igneous petrology, nineteenth-century theories of igneous petrogenesis, early experimental petrology, Bowen's theory of fractional crystallization, the reaction to the theory of fractional crystallization, the discovery of layered igneous intrusives, the granite controversy, the mechanics of igneous intrusion, the development of trace-element geochemistry, plate tectonics in relation to igneous petrology, isotopic geology in petrology, magma dynamics, igneous petrogenesis in the latter twentieth century, recent petrographic classification, and planetary igneous petrology.\r\n\r\nBecause a comprehensive history of igneous petrology has never been written, the investigator will base the survey primarily on published sources including technical petrological articles; monographs; petrology textbooks; histories of geology departments, government surveys, and research institutions; personal memoirs of geologists; and historiographic literature pertinent to igneous petrology. The investigator will spend Fall 1999 and January 2000 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, examining the geological literature in the library of the University of Michigan. The investigator will also spend one month during Summer 1999 in the library of the University of Cambridge examining geological literature and archival materials pertaining to Cambridge petrologists.\r\n\r\nThe library phase of the project should be essentially concluded by February 2000. The investigator will devote February through Summer 2000 to writing the manuscript.\r\n",
