 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves studies of the mechanisms of carbon nanotube formation using selected precursors.  Two approaches will be taken: the solid-state synthesis and the vapor phase processing.  In both cases the project will involve the study and the identification of parameters that are important to the synthesis of high quality nanotube formation.  From these investigations, new ways to produce large quantities of carbon nanotubes will be developed.  In the area of application, design and construction of a proto-type triode flat panel display will take place.  In addition, copper composites using nanotubes will be formed and their properties studied.  Education will be emphasized as a research program.  Graduate students, postdocs, undergraduates college teachers, and high school teachers will participate in this project.\r\n%%%\r\nCarbon nanotubes offer significant advantages to various potential applications areas due to their superior mechanical, electronic, and chemical properties.  This research area is viewed as excellent for the integration of education goals with research goals that focus on one of the most interesting new materials being investigated by the materials research community.\r\n",
