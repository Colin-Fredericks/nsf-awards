 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, there has been an explosive growth of new process technologies, new device concepts, and new markets for integrated sensors and actuators, also referred to as micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). This growth has led to new challenges for computer-aided-design (CAD) of MEMS, with the ultimate goals being accurate, easy-to-use behavioral models that capture all the essential behavior, and permit predictable design modifications and optimization. This research investigates the lack of design guidelines for reliability with regard to dynamic (shock) loading. Such loading can occur either by choice (for example, MEMS launched on satellites), or by accidental drops onto hard surfaces. There is evidence that the small moveable parts of MEMS devices, such as suspended proof masses in accelerometers, experience fracture from dynamic loading levels which the devices are expected to withstand based on quasi-static loading models. It is hypothesized that the inertia of a packaged MEMS, when subject to even modest acceleration, provides a reservoir of kinetic energy which can then be transferred to the mechanical elements as acoustic waves, and cause fracture due to stress wave loading. This project examines the validity of this hypothesis by using numerical analyses to establish expected behavior. For confirmation, experimental studies of subjecting Si microstructures to stress-wave loading are being made. Modeling procedures to anticipate such failures, and by proper design, prevent them are being developed.\r\n\r\n",
