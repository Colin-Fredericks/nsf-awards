The funds would support the development of 3 workshops on methodology, would support junior faculty attending the meeting, and would provide support for graduate students to attend at a reduced price.  Also, the conference will hold a consortium for graduate student research at which students would present summaries of their research in process and receive comments from nationally recognized faculty.  \r\n\r\n",
