 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is addresses the feasibility of an ultrasensitive device for quantitative determination of trace gas species. It is based on fundamen-tal new design for cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). Notably, present-day CRDS devices have limited spectral coverage; their mirror reflectivity is high for only a few percent of the design wavelength. The proposed device differs from conventional CRDS in that it is a broadband in-strument and useful throughout the UV to IR spectral region\r\nfor multi-species detection. In addi-tion, the CRDS sensor offers fast response times, requires no calibration, and is compatible with corrosive gases. We will design and build the new CRDS device, and test its sensitivity and capa-bility over a wide range of wavelengths. If feasibility is proven, a very sensitive, broadband, trace gas analyzer will be developed.\r\n\r\nThe principal applications for CRDS include spectroscopy, environmental monitoring, chemical analysis, and advanced process control. CRDS sensors can serve as on-line process monitors that reduce waste and increase product quality and yield. They can be used as a laboratory instru-ments, as well as for moisture and other trace gas detection in corrosive gases. By the same to-ken, CRDS sensors work in hostile environments such as combustion and discharge processes. Other potential applications include medical diagnostics, like neo-natal or asthmatic breath analy-sis, and antiterrorism devices (both explosives and nerve gases).\r\n",
