The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis is a practical route for the conversion of synthesis gas to gasoline, diesel oil, wax and alcohols.  Because an array of products is synthesized, the product separation and upgrading of lower-grade fractions limit the commercial application of FT syntheses.  Ruthenium clusters supported on alkali earth, metal-promoted zeolites, which have been successful in ammonia synthesis, will be evaluated and characterized.  Issues to be investigated include metal particle size and location influences, metal reducibility, metal-zeolite interactions, cation type and concentration effects, pore structure influences, and acidity effects.  A mechanistic study of the FT synthesis will also be performed.  This project will involve undergraduates from Hampton University and will be performed in collaboration with the University of Virginia. Because established gas reserves have increased over oil reserves in the past two decades, a shift towards gas as an important feedstock for fuels and syntheses may occur.  If successful, this work will aid in the design of new catalysts for the production of valuable chemical products.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
