 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Focused Research Group project aimed at the synthesis and possible novel applications of new p-type transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) with superior properties.  The three primary thrusts of the proposed program are: Selection and evaluation of new p-type TCOs exhibiting superior performance; Thin-film  synthesis of new p-type TCOs; Demonstration of new p-type TCOs in novel applications.  The exploratory synthesis of bulk p-type oxides will be guided by mobility trends.  The properties of the bulk form will be evaluated, and substitutional doping and oxygen intercalation will be explored.  The most promising materials will be identified and transferred to thin-film research.  Thin films will be synthesized by a variety of physical vapor deposition methods including sputtering, activated thermal  coevaporation and electron-beam evaporation.  The films will be extensively characterized in an effort to understand the optimization of conductivity and transparency.  The availability of both n-and p-type transparent devices suggests novel opto-electronic devices are possible.  Simple devices will be demonstrated using the best materials generated from the thin-film studies.\r\n\r\nTransparent conductive oxides (TCOs) constitute an unusual class of materials with high transparency and high electrical conductivity, materials properties necessary for the design of novel opto-electronic devices.  The program exhibits a strong integration of research and education and is inherently multidisciplinary in nature and scope.  The research environment will provide an enriched educational experience for students who will be exposed to multidisciplinary perspective and will need to communicate and collaborate across traditional discipline boundaries.  This Focused Research Group project is a multidisciplinary activity jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research, The Chemistry Division, and The Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n",
