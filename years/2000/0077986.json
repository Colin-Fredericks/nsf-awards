An emphasis is placed on methods that are\r\nrobust to structural perturbations of the population equations\r\nand that apply to systems with nonlinear dynamics (e.g.,\r\nperiodicity, quasiperiodicity, and chaos).  The methods involve\r\nthe use and development of techniques from smooth ergodic theory.\r\nApplication of these methods to models of host-parasitoid\r\ninteractions and tritrophic food webs is pursued.  Two aspects of\r\nhost-parasitoid interactions are examined.  First, because\r\nparasitoids experience egg limitation when released in systems\r\nwith highly variable host densities (the typical situation when\r\nan exotic insect has reached pest status), a model of\r\nhost-parasitoid interactions that incorporates this\r\negg-limitation is considered.  As successful biological control\r\nonly occurs after a parasitoid population has established itself,\r\nthe proposed analysis of the model intends to determine how\r\nvariability in the dynamics of the host population influences the\r\ninvasion rate of the parasitoid population.  Second, previous work\r\non the coevolution of patch selection strategies in\r\nhost-parasitoid systems is extended to include two important\r\nbiological factors, the sex-allocation strategies of parasitoids\r\nand plant dynamics.  The key issue is whether the manipulation of\r\ncrop heterogeneity can lead to the coevolution of behavioral\r\ntraits that simultaneously stabilize the system and increase crop\r\nyields.  Third, to better understand how ecological communities\r\nassemble due to invasions, this proposal undertakes the study of\r\ntritrophic systems with more than one species at each trophic\r\nlevel.  In these systems, three ecological forces (apparent\r\ncompetition, resource competition and intraguild predation) play\r\nan important role and can lead to successional intransitivites\r\n(e.g., a sequence of invasions that takes community A to\r\ncommunity B, B to C and C back to A).  Emphasis is placed on the\r\ninfluence of habitat productivity and the timing of invasions on\r\nthe community assembly process.  In addition, the project includes\r\na program designed to stimulate undergraduate research.\r\n     Invading non-native species in the United States cause\r\nestimated economic losses of 138 billion dollars annually in\r\nagriculture, forestry and several other segments of the U.S.\r\neconomy.  Exotic insect species alone are estimated to cause 13\r\nbillion dollars in crop losses annually and approximately 42% of\r\nthe species on the threatened or endangered species lists are at\r\nrisk primarily because of nonnative species.  As biological\r\ninvasions often involve nonlinear interactions between several\r\nspecies, mathematical models, as simple caricatures, allow one to\r\ninexpensively answer questions such as: What characteristics make\r\na species a successful invader?  Which ecological communities are\r\nmost susceptible to large long-term changes following an\r\ninvasion?  How can crop heterogeneity be manipulated to minimize\r\nthe economic impact of non-native pests?  The project proposes to\r\ndevelop analytical methods, and to apply these methods to models\r\nthat address these and other questions of current interest to\r\ncommunity ecology, restoration ecology, biological control, and\r\nevolutionary biology.\r\n",
