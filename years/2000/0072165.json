 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:  DMS-0072165\r\nPI Scot Adams\r\n\r\nThe study of Lorentz manifolds may be motivated by physical\r\nconsiderations, since the Einstein field equations determine Lorentz\r\nmetrics on space-time. Following F.~Klein's Erlanger program, one\r\nmethod of approaching a geometric object is to study its group of\r\nisometries, and it has long been known that the isometry group of a\r\nLorentz manifold is a Lie group. Moreover, any Lie group acts on\r\nitself (by left translation) preserving any left-invariant Lorentz\r\nmetric.  However, as originally noticed by R.~Zimmer, M.~Gromov, and\r\nN.~Kowalsky, if one requires even a small amount of complication to\r\nthe dynamics, then the list of Lie groups admitting a Lorentz action\r\nbecomes quite restricted.  My work over the last few years has focused\r\non quantifying exactly which connected Lie groups admit a complicated\r\naction by isometries of a connected Lorentz manifold. As the\r\ndefinition of ``complicated'' varies, the answer varies, and I intend\r\nto look at a few more of these variations over the coming years. In\r\nparticular, I would like to determine the collection of connected,\r\nnoncompact, simple Lie groups admitting a locally faithful, nontame,\r\nisometric action on a connected Lorentz manifold. I believe it should\r\nbe true that any such group either has infinite center or is locally\r\nisomorphic to the Lie group of 2 by 2 real unimodular matrices.\r\n\r\nA Lorentz manifold, or ``space-time'' is one of the basic object of\r\ngeneral relativity. Some of these objects have many symmetries, while\r\nmost have none at all. Fix a space-time having a large collection of\r\nsymmetries. For any point in this space-time, if we move it around by\r\nall the symmetries under consideration, the collection of image points\r\nso obtained is called the ``orbit'' of the point.  A number of\r\nresearchers have noticed that it is difficult to construct a\r\nspace-time with chaotic orbits, by which we mean, broadly speaking,\r\nthat some orbits repeatedly return (or nearly return) to the\r\nsame place. There are, in fact, many ways to define precisely the word\r\nchaotic, and this means that a number of different theorems have been\r\nobtained. I intend to continue developing results along these lines.\r\n",
