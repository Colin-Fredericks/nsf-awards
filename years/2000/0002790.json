Smith, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill\r\n\r\nSpatial statistics is one of the major methodologies of environmental \r\nstatistics; its applications include producing spatially smoothed or \r\ninterpolated representations of air pollution fields, calculating \r\nregional average means or regional average trends based on data at a \r\nfinite number of monitoring stations, and performing regression \r\nanalyses with spatially correlated errors to assess the agreement \r\nbetween observed data and the predictions of some numerical model.  \r\nHowever, the most commonly used spatial statistics methodology, also \r\nknown as geostatistics or kriging, is essentially based on the \r\nassumption of stationary and isotropic random fields. Such \r\nassumptions cannot be expected to hold in large heterogeneous fields. \r\nThe research described here concentrates on nonstationary spatial \r\nmodels. Some new models are introduced, as well as new fitting \r\nmethods based on spectral analysis. The applications include three \r\nreal data sets: (i) monitoring data for nitrate fields compared with \r\nModels-3 output as part of the process for assessing compliance with \r\nthe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; (ii) modeling the spatial \r\ndistribution of particulate matter fields, as one of the components \r\nneeded for an improved risk assessment of human health effects of \r\nparticulate matter; (iii) developing statistical models for spatial \r\ntemperature fields and applying them to the attribution of various \r\n\"signals\" produced by climate models - in particular, this \r\nmethodology will permit improved assessment of the extent to which \r\nobserved global climate change may be attributed to anthropogenic \r\ninfluences.  \r\n\r\nIn more detail, the new statistical methodology concentrates on two \r\napproaches to nonstationary models: a spatial deformation approach \r\ndue to Guttorp and Sampson, and an approach where the field is \r\nrepresented locally as a stationary isotropic random field, but the \r\nparameters of the stationary random field are allowed to vary \r\ncontinuously across space. Kernel functions are used to ensure that \r\nthe field is well-defined but also continuous. Some combination of \r\nthe two approaches may be needed for fields with are neither \r\nstationary nor isotropic. New fitting algorithms are developed, using \r\nboth space domain and spectral approaches; in cases where the data \r\nare distributed exactly or approximately on a lattice, it is argued \r\nthat spectral approaches have potentially enormous computational \r\nbenefits compared with maximum likelihood. The methods are extended \r\nto prediction/interpolation questions using approximate Bayesian \r\napproaches to account for parameter uncertainty.  We develop \r\napplications to obtaining the total loading of pollutant \r\nconcentrations and fluxes over different geo-political boundaries, to \r\nrisk assessment for particulate matter random fields, and to the \r\nattribution of an observed climate record to various components \r\nproduced by numerical climatic model, the latter forming a new \r\napproach to the fingerprint estimation technique developed by \r\nclimatologists.  \r\nThis program is being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities from the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
