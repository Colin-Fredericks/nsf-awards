The overall goal of this project is to set up a near-millimeter and far-infrared spectrometer, a dedicated high-sensitivity detector for the spectrometer, and the associated accessories for temperature dependent measurements over the frequency range of the instrument. Acquisition of this spectrometer will impact on-going programs in magnetic oxides, fullerene polymers, molecular magnets, and organic superconductors. It will also provide an important experimental compliment for the other spectroscopic capabilities that currently exist in my lab. In addition to supporting the low-energy spectroscopy of the aforementioned novel electronic and magnetic materials, the equipment will aid in the training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in the area of materials spectroscopy. \r\n***\r\n\r\nThis is an instrument acquisition award to State University of New York at Binghamton.
