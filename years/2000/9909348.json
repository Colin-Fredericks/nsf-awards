The researchers will be undertaking a study of the evolution of evolutionary rates: a genomic perspective.  Estimating times since common ancestry of DNA and protein sequences (i.e. divergence times) is typically accomplished by assuming that all evolutionary lineages change at identical rates.  In reality, closely-related evolutionary lineages are more likely to experience similar rates of evolution than distantly related lineages.  The researchers are developing statistical methods for estimating divergence times that lack the restrictive and implausible assumption that rates of evolution have been constant over time.  Future directions will include incorporation of  fossil information into the method and its extension to data sets containing information from multiple genes.  Other plans include simulation studies of proposed and existing methods and a careful statistical treatment of prior information regarding divergence times and other model parameters.\r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. Results of the research will have important applications in evolutionary biology (estimating species divergence times) as well as in epidemiology.  For example, it will help in estimating the times at which different strains of a pathogen arose.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  A web page will be constructed at http://statgen.ncsu.edu/thorne/divtime.html.  This page will have a brief description of the methodology being supported by this project as well as directions for downloading the resulting software.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
