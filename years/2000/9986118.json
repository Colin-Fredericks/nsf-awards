 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel photonic ModeRouting networks containing many nodes for monitoring and controlling the structural health and function of complex systems.  Each node is, in general, a microsystem that combines sensing, computing, and actuating functions.  The microsystems may contain many Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) with aggregate data rates approaching gigabits-per-second.  This research addresses the enormous challenge for interrogating, activating, and controlling all microdevices through a high-capacity interconnection system.  Wire-based and wireless approaches cannot handle such data rates.  Further problems include operation in electrically noisy and potentially explosive environments.  The innovative IFOS solution offers high-efficiency, ultra-high capacity, electromagnetic-interference-immunity, electrical-passivity, and expendability.  Phase II will optimize, fabricate, and test several MEMS array nodes, MEMS fiber interfacing, and PhotoPowering, as well as design and build an expandable, ModeRouting network of MEMS nodes.   \r\n\r\nCommercial applications of the IFOS photonically-interconnected MEMS array networks include civil, mechanical, aerospace, chemical, and marine engineering, particularly monitoring and control of programmable structures by microsensors and microactuators for mechanical systems, electrical power plants, automobiles, materials processing, and medicine.\r\n",
