 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nDMS-0070714\r\n\r\nIn earlier work, I observed that the functional equation for L-functions\r\nattached to Maass modular forms can be derived by taking the Mellin \r\ntransform of their (distribution) boundary values along the real axis, \r\nrather than the traditional way of integrating the modular forms along\r\nthe imaginary axis. My method appears likely to apply also to higher\r\nrank groups which, until now, have resisted the usual arguments. I intend\r\nto extend the idea to higher rank cases. This involves a number of \r\nrepresentation theoretic sub-problems, several of which are interesting\r\nin their own right. I also plan to continue my joint work with Vilonen,\r\non characteristic cycles of representations of real reductive groups. \r\nSuch representations are attached to constructible sheaves on the flag \r\nvariety, via the Beilinson-Bernstein construction and the Riemann-Hilbert \r\ncorrespondence. These sheaves, in turn, have characteristic cycles\r\nwhich encode deep information about the representations. By studying the\r\ncharacteristic cycles, we intend to obtain geometric invariants of \r\nrepresentations which clarify the meaning of unipotence, and possibly\r\npoint to ways of constructing unipotent representations geometrically.\r\n\r\nThe overall theme of the proposal is representation theory. Felix Klein,\r\nlate in the eighteenth century, enunciated the principle that the notions\r\nof a group and group action formalize the idea of symmetry. The laws of\r\nclassical mechanics, for example, are invariant under rotations and \r\ntranslations, which together form the symmetry group of Newtonian\r\nmechanics. Special relativity -- discovered after Klein -- has a different \r\nsymmetry group, and this difference explains the fundamentally different \r\nbehavior relativistic mechanics; indeed, the difference in symmetry groups\r\nwas well understood even in the infancy of the theory of relativity. The \r\nsymmetries of mechanics lie very much on the surface. Less obvious -- \r\nsometimes deeply hidden -- symmetries arise in many contexts, not only \r\nphysics, but also geometry, number theory, and differential equations. \r\nRepresentations are the \"atoms\", i.e., the most basic ingredients, of group\r\nactions. Representation theory studies both the representations themselves, \r\nand applications of the idea of symmetry where the less obvious properties\r\nof certain representations lead to new insights. The second part of my\r\nproposal is of the former type, and the first part, of the latter. \r\n\r\n",
