 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Dr. Karin Ruhlandt-Senge and other members of the Chemistry Department at Syracuse University in establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002 36 undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting summer research under the supervision of Chemistry faculty. The theme of the project will be Molecular and Biomolecular Electronics, in which most Syracuse chemistry faculty will participate, and will encompass projects in organic, inorganic and physical as well as biological chemistry.  In addition to individual research projects students will attend faculty seminars reviewing frontier research in the theme area, weekly faculty tutorials on the participant's research project, weekly student presentations, workshops on specialized research techniques, weekly research group meetings and mini courses on topics of interest in chemical research such as the use of X-ray crystallography and construction of glass apparatus. Each student will present a poster and prepare a paper for submission to the Journal of Student Research on her/his project.",
