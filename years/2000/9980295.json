 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to fabricate new nanoscale devices and to study electrical transport properties. The approach involves the use of tunneling microscopy(STM) with an atomic hydrogen resist to provide high resolution. The difference in chemical reactivity between hydrogen terminated (passivated) areas and bare (reactive) Si surface areas provides high selectivity in adsorption and growth processes.  Feature sizes less than 3 nm are anticipated. The STM will be used to fabricate and image nanowires with atomic resolution. 1D nanowires and nanoboxes will be fabricated and their electrical transport properties studied in situ. Additionally, these nanolithographic fabrication techniques allow the creation of devices with a single molecule as the active element. STM will be used to image devices during fabrication with atomic resolution. Molecular nanodevices will also be fabricated and their electrical transport properties studied in situ; substrate will provide an independent gate contact. The relationship between nanometer structure, molecular orbitals, electrical properties, and contacts will be investigated.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. The studies are expected to improve our fundamental understanding of possible future nanodevice/transistor technologies. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. \r\n***\r\n",
