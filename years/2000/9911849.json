The Madison District, in collaboration with Arizona State University, will provide professional development for all K-8 teachers over the life of the project.  The TREASURmath project will assist teachers in implementing the NSF-funded curricula (Connected Mathematics Project and Investigations in Number, Data and Space) adopted in the district.  \r\n\r\nDuring the project each participant will take either an algebra or geometry course provided by Arizona State University.  This content course will broaden and deepen participants' understanding of mathematics.  All participants will also take part in a weeklong curriculum-specific summer institute, which will help them develop the content, pedagogical, technological, and research knowledge to teach reflectively.  The institute will be offered at three levels to accommodate teachers who have had differing levels of experience and participation in prior professional development.  Also, all teachers will take part in grade level meetings one half-day every two weeks. Thirteen Mathematics Teacher Leaders (MTL) will be released half time to provide ongoing support and direction to the teachers in their schools.  \r\n\r\nThe impact of this project will be on 347 teachers in seven schools who serve over 5,000 students. \r\n",
