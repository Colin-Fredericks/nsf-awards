Kockelman\r\nThe University of Texas at Austin\r\nAbstract\r\nThis research seeks improved methods for assessing the evolution of urban transport and land use systems; such methods are a critical component of transport-infrastructure planning and urban systems engineering. By emphasizing long-term development decisions that are the foundation for travel demand, this project will attempt to identify optimal investments in transport infrastructure and effective, coordinated transport and land use strategies to meet the needs of a region.  This objective will be pursued by advancing the principles of integrated transport system analysis in two ways: (1) development of a systems-explicit model of travel demand and location choice founded on behaviorally rigorous, simultaneously estimated equations; and (2) communication of the tools used and results achieved to students, practitioners, and colleagues across the United States and around the world.\r\n The proposed approach combines surplus maximization theory with behaviorally flexible sub-models, and relies on regression models and system simulation.  Through improvements in the characterization of processes which underlie the dynamics of transport and related urban markets, the model is intended to reliably predict optimal sites and sizes of transport infrastructure; assess the energy-consumption, noxious-emissions, and location-choice impacts of different traffic-management policies; and draw general conclusions about the long-run development and travel-demand effects of various transport design strategies. Identification of advantageous network investments and effective, coordinated transport and land use strategies to meet the needs of regions are the work's ultimate objective.\r\n\r\n",
