 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project expands the magnetic-field sensor system developed in Phase I into an optimized system containing an array of multiplexed two-dimensional sensors using mode-routing architecture for industrial process control systems, including physical-vapor-deposition (PVD) reactors containing magnetic orientation devices which are used in the manufacture of magnetic storage disks and recording heads.  The uniformity  and orientation of these magnetic fields need to be measured and controlled with high accuracy.  In Phase I, IFOS demonstrated devices that virtually eliminate power losses that are characteristic of other known fiber-optic magnetic sensor arrays.  IFOS has fabricated novel photonic mode-routing components, built a feasibility system prototype with new sensing materials and ultra-high-resolution demultiplexing, and conducted preliminary tests.  IFOS, in collaboration with a federal laboratory, identified another appllication involving cryogenic systems to avoid thermal-leakage problems of electronic sensors.  The IFOS solution enables achievement of the necessary accuracy and cost goals.  The Phase II objective is to design and construct an optimized 5-point vectorial magnetic-field-sensor system for PVD reactor installation, as well as a 2-sensor system for cryogenic applications.  IFOS' strategic partners will provide Phase-II and Phase-III-kind and cash contributions. \r\n \r\nCommercial applications include measurement of magnetic orientation and confinement fields for PVD systems, cryogenic systems, electric power utilities, hydrogen fusion chambers and linear acccelerators.  Improving PVD industrial process control, will yield higher sensitivity and reliability.  It will enable storage densities exceeding 60 Gbit/inch2 on rigid media.  This is a significant market opportunity identified by IFOS and its strategic partner, the market leader for data-storage PVD systems.  Other applications exist in the measurement of leakage current and line sag in high-voltage transmission towers, and complex stresses in automotive, aerospace, and civil structures.   The technology will have an impact in a wide variety of optical fiber sensor systems and optical components and subsystems, such as magnetically-actuated tunable optical filters and switches, add-drop multiplexers as well as mode-routing components.  IFOS magnetic sensor systems are immune to electromagnetic interference, elecrically and chemically passive, compact, light weight and suitable for use in explosive environments\r\n",
