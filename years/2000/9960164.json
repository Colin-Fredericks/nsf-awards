 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is based on the observation that ozonation of the facultative zone in organically overloaded hog waste lagoons renders the top waters nearly odor free.  This technique has lead to two further technical surprises:  (1) The low dose of ozone used is much less than the chemical demand and (2) Decreases in the depth of the accumulated sludge are observed. Ozone is suspected to be interacting synergistically with the lagoon microorganisms, especially the non-sulfur purple bacteria,\r\nto restore balance to the system ecology. Waste volume reduction, fertilizer value, and pathogen control have environmental and health implications far beyond odor control.  This STTR will confirm the observations concerning ecological changes in ozonated lagoons, slurry stabilization, and pathogen control.  The U.S. production of hogs in the first quarter of 1999 was 25.3 million head with an inventory of 59.9 million head. The annual rate of hog manure generated 117 million dry tons. There are approximately 70,000 hog farms \r\nand many of these farms use lagoons for waste storage. The ability to provide a simple, effective, inexpensive means of improving the stabilization potential of swine waste lagoons is a primary focus of the 17 major hog producing States.\r\n",
