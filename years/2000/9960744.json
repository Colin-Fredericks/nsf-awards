 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will apply CVD (chemical vapor deposition) diamond chemical sensor technology to petroleum exploration. This project will be performed by Physitron, in conjunction with Vanderbilt University, Microsensor Systems Inc. (MSI), and New Paradigm Exploration, Inc. (NPE),    NPE is currently using an MSI developed hydrocarbon sensor to detect single and multi-ring aromatics in soil samples from 30 inches below the surface to locate oil reservoirs. It has been demonstrated that these hydrocarbons are also present immediately above the surface in somewhat reduced concentrations.\r\nPhysitron and Vanderbilt have previously developed solid state chemical sensors, which detect minute quantities of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide. With modifications these detectors can be tailored to detect aromatic hydrocarbons and used as the detecting element in the MSI system. The resulting system will be much more sensitive and faster to respond and recover than the current system.  During Phase I, Physitron and Vanderbilt will fabricate test structures, perform experiments, and conduct analyses to demonstrate the sensitivity and responsivity of our technology. Meanwhile, NPE will be completing the verification of the correlation between subsurface measurements and surface measurements. Near the end of Phase I, MSI will place a hydrocarbon sensor into a gas chromatograph to demonstrate the applicability and operability of the detector. \r\n\r\nThe most obvious application of this technology is the identification of oil reservoirs by making surface measurements of the aromatic hydrocarbon density. This would be done by driving a vehicle across the surface while taking measurements. The major oil companies expend more than $3 Billion annually to locate oil reservoirs using 3D seismic techniques.  Other applications of this technology include detection of explosives, detection and mapping of chemical warfare agents, mapping of chemical contamination, measurement of\r\nspraying density for fertilizer, weed killer, and insecticide and monitoring indoor and outdoor air quality.\r\n",
