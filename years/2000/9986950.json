 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, which is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program focusses on increasing the understanding of detailed molecular dynamics of chemical reactions that occur on solid surfaces.  This project, conducted by Dr. Andrew Bocarsly and his group at Princeton University is composed of four interrelated sub-projects.  The first sub-project examines the internal state distribution of the product of platinum catalyzed oxidization  reactions.  Sub-project 2 uses scanning tunneling microscopy in conjunction with ab initio calculations to explore the detailed dynamics of the dissociation of CO on the Fe(100) surface.  In the third sub-project, the effect of internal energy on the probability of dissociative chemisorption of methane on the Pt(111) surface is probed. The final sub-project examines the interaction of polyatomic organic ions with hydrocarbon covered surfaces in order to obtain mechanistic information about the ion-surface reactions that occur.  \r\n\r\nThe research in this proposal will result in a deeper understanding of elementary chemical processes that occur on solid surfaces.  Such information will improve our knowledge of a number of  important technological processes such as heterogeneous catalysis and the manufacture of electronic devices. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n",
