 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will advance the theoretical foundations and \r\nexplore practical implementations of dependable distributed \r\nsystem technology. A distributed system is dependable, when \r\nit provides guarantees regarding its performance, fault-\r\ntolerance, correctness and compositionality.\r\nThe research objectives will be achieved through synergy \r\nbetween the research in distributed systems with its focus \r\non fault-tolerance and correctness, the research in \r\nparallel computing with its focus on speed-up and \r\nefficiency, and the practical engineering considerations of \r\nspecification, development, deployment and performance of \r\nsystems. This proposal envelops three investigation areas:\r\n(1) Robust Algorithmics: Development of fault-tolerant and \r\nefficient distributed algorithms and exploration of \r\nlimitations on achieving robustness in distributed \r\ncomputing.\r\n(2) Building Blocks: Definition and analysis of dependable \r\ndistributed building blocks needed by applications \r\nrequiring precise guarantees; and design of specification \r\nframeworks for capturing designs and optimizing distributed \r\nsystem deployment.\r\n(3) Distributed Implementation: Development of exploratory \r\nimplementations of compositional building blocks and robust \r\nalgorithms, and evaluation of their performance in \r\nrealistic and simulated settings; empirical evaluations \r\nwill complement the analytically established efficiency \r\ncharacterizations.\r\nThe educational component includes: developing and \r\ndelivering new courses in distributed computing in support \r\nof undergraduate and graduate programs in computer science; \r\nand, building a research group that attracts graduate \r\nstudents and postdoctoral researchers.\r\n",
