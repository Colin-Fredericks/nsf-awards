 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  A 300 MHz NMR spectrometer is allowing integration of high-field NMR spectroscopy throughout the undergraduate chemistry curriculum and offers expanded opportunities for undergraduates to participate in faculty-directed research.  Instrument features critical for the innovations include: (1) the increased ability at 300 MHz to resolve peaks of similar chemical shift, (2) a broadband probe for multinuclear NMR experiments, and (3) the ease of going beyond standard I-D 'H and 13 C NMR to include 2-D homo- and heteronuclear experiments in an undergraduate laboratory setting.  A number of experiments from the education literature and from the research literature are being adapted to provide appropriate experiences for undergraduates in a range of courses.  In the organic course, 19F NMR is being introduced in a new laboratory on asymmetric synthesis, and 2-D techniques are being applied to determining the structure of a Diels-Alder reaction product.  Biochemistry students use highfield NMR to probe sugar structures, while in the physical/inorganic chemistry laboratory a new experiment highlighting heteronuclear coupling is being implemented. Broad use of the NMR spectrometer throughout the Chemistry Department's courses is preparing students to undertake independent work in faculty laboratories, where research projects in organic, inorganic, and biochemical systems demand application of state-of-the-art NMR technology. The 300 MHz NMR spectrometer is a centerpiece of the College's steadily improving infrastructure for learning and research, contributing to the larger goal of encouraging our best and brightest women to enter careers in the chemical sciences.\r\n",
