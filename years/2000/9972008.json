 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972008\r\n\r\nOne of the most central ideas of multivariate statistics is the modeling of dependencies among a set of stochastic variables. The aim of such an analysis is often to try to provide some insight into the process which generated the data. Graphical Markov models (GMMs) use graphs to represent multivariate statistical dependencies in a parsimonious and computationally efficient manner. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) also provide a natural formalism for representing data generation mechanisms.  In the case of observational data it is often not known whether all of the relevant variables have been measured, or whether unmeasured 'confounding' variables are present. Since the class of DAG models is not closed under marginalization, if a subset of the variables involved in a data generating DAG are observed, then the resulting statistical model for the observed margin will not necessarily correspond to a DAG. This project will develop graphical Markov models that can represent the conditional independence relations imposed by a DAG model on an observed marginal.  This involves parametrizing distributions described implicitly via a set of conditional independence constraints; developing techniques for estimating these models, and formulating computationally tractable algorithms for performing model selection.\r\n\r\nAmong their many applications, GMMs have become prevalent in statistical science for the analysis of categorical data in contingency tables, for the modeling of spatially-dependent processes such as the spread of epidemics in human and animal populations, and for the development of early warning systems for severe weather conditions.  They are used in computer science (as Bayesian networks) for information processing and retrieval, for robotics, computer vision, and pattern recognition, for the debugging of complex programs (such as Windows 95), and for the representation of expert systems for medical diagnosis.  In decision science (as influenced diagrams) as models for information flow and control and for combining the opinions of many decision-makers.  Similar models have long been used infield such as genetics, sociology, econometrics, and cycle metrics.  A crucial feature of all these models is that they represent complex networks of causal dependencies.  In addition, these models allow for fast computational implementation.  These features have led directly to their central role in the development of software that can \"reason\" about real world problems.\r\n",
