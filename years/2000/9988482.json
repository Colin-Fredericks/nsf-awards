 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wide-area distributed computing systems represent the future of scientific\r\nand commercial computing. Such systems will enable a wide range of futuristic\r\napplications with the potential for enormous economic and social impact\r\napplications such as distributed multimedia services, Web-based collaboration,\r\ndistributed supercomputing, and teleimmersion. Before this vision can be\r\nrealized, however, extensive research will be required in virtually all\r\naspects of software system design, implementation, and evaluation.\r\n\r\nDiscrete-event simulation has been an essential tool for the design and\r\nanalysis of traditional computational systems and applications. Realistic\r\nsimulation of applications executing on wide-area distributed systems,\r\nhowever, is a challenging task because of the scale of the software, hardware\r\nand network subsystems that must be simulated. Nevertheless, the intricacy of\r\nthese components and their complex, closed-loop interactions require the\r\ncomponents and their interactions to be modeled in sufficient detail to\r\nappropriately predict their impact on overall system performance.\r\nIn recent work, the PIs have collaboratively obtained some exciting but\r\npreliminary results showing that specific compiler information can greatly\r\nenhance the efficiency and scalability of simulation of message-passing\r\nprograms. For instance, it was shown that simulation of a scalable ASCI kernel\r\nbenchmark application called SWEEP3D executing on up to 128 processors could\r\nbe simulated faster than real-time by using parallel simulations together\r\nwith the type of compiler optimizations that are the subject of this proposal.\r\nAlso, the compiler-optimized simulation can evaluate very large data\r\nsets on thousands of processors: it was possible to simulate the performance\r\nof a 40 million-problem size Sweep3D for up to 10,000 processors. There are\r\npotentially a number of other strategies to dramatically improve simulation\r\nscalability and performance by using compiler information, none of which have\r\nbeen studied so far. A comprehensive program of research is required to\r\ndevelop their potential and evaluate their impact on simulation of real world\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the current proposal is to develop compiler-based techniques for\r\nimproving the efficiency of parallel discrete event simulation, and to use\r\nthese techniques to evaluate application and system software performance for\r\nwide-area distributed systems. There are three key components to this\r\nproposal:\r\n1. To explore a range of compiler-supported strategies for highly efficient\r\nsimulation of dynamic, large-scale systems and applications.\r\n2. To implement and evaluate these strategies for wide-area distributed\r\nsystems, by extending our existing compiler and simulation infrastructure.\r\nThis requires addressing additional challenges raised by the dynamic nature\r\nof these systems and the lack of well-defined metrics to measure effective\r\napplication level performance in such environments.\r\n3. To evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies for real world \r\ndistributed\r\napplications that have already been developed, such as a distributed \r\nmultimedia\r\napplication and distributed versions of tightly coupled applications such as\r\nSweep3D and the NAS parallel benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research program builds on a collaboration of several years \r\nbetween\r\nthe PIs' research groups, and brings together key strengths in parallel\r\nsimulation of large-scale parallel programs, parallel simulation of wide-area\r\nnetworks, and in parallelizing compilers and their use for supporting\r\nperformance evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis program of research also complements the ongoing software efforts for\r\nwide-area systems that are aimed at developing operating system services\r\n(e.g., Globus, Legion, and WebOS) and programming environments (e.g., Legion,\r\nGlobe, and GrADS). As such, the proposed research program represents an\r\nessential third leg of software support for the development and deployment\r\nof successful wide-area distributed systems.\r\n",
