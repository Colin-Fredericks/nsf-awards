 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will model and analyze a class of physical\r\nproblems arising in microwave processing of ceramics.  These problems\r\ngive rise to challenging nonlinear initial boundary value problems\r\nfor partial differential equations. Their mathematical formulation involves \r\none or more nonlinear parabolic equations, governing  the diffusion of heat and\r\nthe diffusion of a chemical concentration, and the time harmonic\r\nversion of Maxwells equations, governing the propagation of electromagnetic waves.  \r\nThese equations are coupled together in a nonlinear fashion and, in \r\naddition, nonlinear heat balances are required in certain applications \r\nwhere surface temperatures produce significant thermal radiation.  \r\nKriegsmann will develop and use asymptotic methods, dictated \r\nby certain physical limits, to simplify the mathematical systems and \r\ndevelop and use numerical methods to solve the reduced problems.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the work supported with this award are twofold.  The first is \r\nthe mathematical understanding of the basic physical mechanisms which \r\nmake microwave processing work.  Such an understanding will give scientists \r\nand engineers involved in microwave processing of ceramics more basic scientific\r\nunderpinnings to judge and interpret their experimental findings.\r\nThe second goal is the development and application of asymptotic, numerical,\r\nand other approximate methods required to obtain an accurate description\r\nof more realistic and complicated processes. The successful completion\r\nof the planned research will allow engineers and scientists to design\r\nmore efficient sintering and joining processes for ceramics which will allow \r\nthem to produce higher quality materials.   It will also help in the design\r\nand implementation of microwave assisted vapor deposition processes\r\nwhich are highly promising in the construction of composite ceramic\r\nmaterials\r\n",
