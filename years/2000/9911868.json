The partnership includes the Schenectady City School District, Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake central Schools, Watervliet City Schools and Bethlehem Central Schools, a combination of high poverty urban and suburban districts.  All the districts have implemented the instructional materials, Science and Technology for Children (STC) in grades K-6 and MS/STC units are currently being field-tested.  The professional development program for teachers includes the use of formative assessment in the service of teaching.  Central to the partners' belief is the tenet that recognizes assessment not only as a means to measure student achievement but also as a catalyst for effective contemporary science education reform.  An applied research component will study and evaluate the effectiveness of this unique approach to professional development and materials for use by professional developers nationwide will be produced.  The project will involve all 427 teachers of science grades K-8 in 28 schools in the four districts.  \r\n\r\n",
