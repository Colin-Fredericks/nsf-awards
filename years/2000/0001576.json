They plan to seek a design scheme for specialty industrial yarns in which cotton fibers and synthetic fibers will be used.  They will study several different possibilities of making synthetic-core/cotton-sheath yarns using friction spinning.  Modification of the spinning system will be made to establish optimum production conditions and to overcome many of the obstacles associated with using this system for a wide range of end products.  Specialty yarns will be designed to meet the criteria required by a number of categories of industrial fabrics.  \r\n\r\nScope: The US and the Egyptian collaborators have significant experience in the area of textile research, especially in the design of yarn-making and fabric production.  The production of synthetic core/cotton sheath yarn is an objective of manufacturers and users for many specialty applications.  The project deals with some of the significant problems that still make the process of production difficult and unpredictable.\r\n The two plan to use Egyptian cotton (primary fibers and fiber by-products) and Synthetic fibers mostly provided by US manufacturers.  They will collaborate on the design of the system and the analysis of parameters' effects.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual scientific interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.",
