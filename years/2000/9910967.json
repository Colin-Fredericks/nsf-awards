 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Inside the Classroom\" study will involve classroom observations of approximately 600 elementary, middle school, and high school mathematics teachers in 150 schools in 50 districts throughout the United States.  This study is to be conducted in conjunction with the 2000 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education and will add to our knowledge of the frequency of class activities as reported by teachers with an understanding of the quality of instruction as assessed by knowledgeable observers.\r\n\r\nData will be collected by observers experienced in the use of the Classroom Observation Protocol developed by Horizon Research, Inc. for the evaluation of NSF's Local Systemic Change Initiative.  Additional training will be provided, including the rating of videotaped lessons and classroom visits by teams of observers to maximize interrater reliability.\r\n\r\nResults of the study will be presented in a complete technical report, a highlights report aimed at policymakers, and a book suitable for a general audience.",
