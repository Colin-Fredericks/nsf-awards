 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) This project is incorporating modern instrumentation for elemental analysis throughout the basic science curriculum at Earlham College in chemistry, biology, and geology. The PI and team have chosen an inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) for its rapid capacity to perform multi-elemental analysis, which will permit a larger student population to use the instrument. Three expected outcomes guide this project. One, chemistry majors and minors are gaining exposure to usage of the ICP-AES through laboratory experiments in their standard courses which use the instrument, and through student-faculty research projects. Two, students from other disciplines - in particular biology and geology - are gaining experience with the fundamental role that chemical information plays in science, by analyzing samples obtained from work in their own discipline. Third, non-science majors at Earlham are using the instrumentation to analyze data obtained in a study of environmental issues. The project team expects to positively influence the disposition of these non-science majors towards science. Source material to support the use of this instrumentation is being adapted from several sources. These include the American Chemical Society's book, \"Chemistry in Context\" (for the introductory course for non-science majors), the work of Webster et al., DUE award #9751439  (for investigating the presence of trace metals in pure and contaminated soil samples in an Environmental Chemistry course), and the work of Downey et al., DUE award #9750867 (adaptations of ICP-MS experiments to ICP-AES experiments).\r\n\r\n",
