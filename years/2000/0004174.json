 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the activities of the Construction and Building subcommittee of the National Science Foundation and Technology council. Thirteen federal agencies including, NSF participates in the subcommittee meetings. The subcommittee holds meeting monthly at the White House Conference Center in Washington, D.C. The subcommittee secretariat coordinates federal participation in the presidential initiative-partnership for the Advancement of Technology in housing (a partnership between the public sector, industry, and academia). A strategic plan for the Construction and Building Subcommittee is under development by the subcommittee. The plan identifies a number of options under the following four strategic directions:\r\n\r\nFocus and prioritize federal R&D and coordinate with private R&D to accelerate technical development in construction and building\r\n\r\nDevelop multiagency support for specific research projects of interest to the public and private sectors\r\n\r\nProvide vehicles for information exchange that support and promote acceptance of new technology in construction and building\r\n\r\nDemonstrate actions that will lead to achieving the National Construction Goals.  \r\n\r\nNSF has supported the activities of the Construction and Building Subcommittee since 1994.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
