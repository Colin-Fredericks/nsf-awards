 "awd_abstract_narration": "A \"software component\" is any code that a programmer can use as part of a larger piece of code.  Components may be classified along three dimensions:  (1) Source-level components are delivered as source code, while binary-level components are delivered as executables.  (2) Lightweight components extract little run-time cost, while heavyweight components extract a large run-time cost.  (3) Generative components create new code fragments at the time that the component is used, while non-generative components simply copy code from the component.  Subroutine and class libraries are binary-level, medium-weight, and non-generative; macros and C++ templates are source-level, lightweight, and generative.  Broadly speaking, binary-level components are more convenient, while generative components are more powerful.  The goal of this project is to produce a technology for lightweight, generative, binary-level components.  It is based on two principles: Higher-order macros, used as a powerful component language, and compositional semantics, to permit macros to be rendered as executables.  The goal of the research is to raise the level of programming by allowing programs to be built from more powerful and general components than current component technologies admit.",
