To evaluate the properties of spontaneous mutations for life-history characters, long-term mutation accumulation experiments are being applied to initially identical lines. To evaluate whether the most extreme phenotypes observed within species are constrained by the availability of mutations, experiments will be performed to determine whether extreme phenotypes tend to mutate back towards the mean of the species-wide phenotype distribution. The role of natural selection in defining population mean phenotypes will be evaluated through temporal collections of clones assayed in a common-garden experiment. Comparison of the phenotypic means and genetic variances of these collections will reveal: 1) whether the mean phenotypes of populations are defined by local selective conditions or by other nonselective events (such as founder effects), 2) the extent to which the response to directional selection is thwarted by the breakup of adaptive nonadditive gene interactions following recombination, and 3) the degree to which selection encourages the production of hidden genetic variation.\r\n\t\r\nA fundamental goal of evolutionary genetics is to understand the mechanisms that define the levels of genetic variation for quantitative traits within and among populations. Such variation provides the substrate for the operation of natural selection, which in turn molds populations in response to local environmental challenges. This work will provide an unprecedented level of understanding of the relative and interactive roles that mutation and natural selection play in defining the range of phenotypic variation at the species-wide level, and should enhance our understanding of the genetic flexibility of species in the face of changing environments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
