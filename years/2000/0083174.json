Attendees will include geneticists, biochemists, physical chemists, and molecular biologists. Recent examples in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided increasing evidence that links between recombination and replication are widespread. It is now clear that replication forks frequently stall or break, and that recombination enzymes forestall cell death by rescuing those forks. These findings have important implications for biology, medicine, industry and agriculture. A full understanding of the functions of recombination in the repair of damage to DNA will provide further insights into cell division, the multifarious response to DNA damage, and the mechanisms that limit carcinogenesis. Clues may be found as well for the biotechnology of gene targeting. In bacteria, the repair of collapsed replication forks has a dramatic impact on viability, the further study of which may suggest new targets for therapy directed at bacterial infections. The goal of the Colloquium is to stimulate further research on the connections between DNA recombination and replication, and to increase awareness of this developing area among colleagues and students throughout the biomedical community. Toward the achievement of that goal, an entire issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences will be devoted to research reports emanating from the Colloquium.\r\n",
