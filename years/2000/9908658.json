 "awd_abstract_narration": "This extension of the Borough of Manhattan Community College's (BMCC's) highly successful NSF Gender Equity grant, Portfolios to Increase the Number of Women in Mathematics, will increase interest, retention and achievement of women in SMET.  BMCC is one of the largest producers of associate degrees for African-American and Latino students in the country.  An important part of the education of a mathematical scientist is the opportunity to try on the persona of a mathematician.  Research is a key part of this persona, and we want to get more women involved.\r\n     Project objectives are to improve the technological skills of our women research fellows, increase the number of women taking advanced mathematics courses, and to increase the number of women mathematics majors.  To achieve these objectives, WARM:  Women's Animated Research in Mathematics will:  provide mathematical summer and academic year mathematical research fellowships; run one academic year and two summer workshops for these women research fellows; and develop both a print and web manual of projects for mathematical research that have been successful for community college women.\r\n",
