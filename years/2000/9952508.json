 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social Sciences - Other (89) The major objective of this project is developing a computer laboratory for use in psychology and sociology undergraduate courses. This laboratory is filling a critical need, offering undergraduates the opportunity to learn through applied experiences in research design and statistics. The overall emphasis of the laboratory is on active student learning and enhanced instruction. Previously, students in the social and behavioral sciences learned statistics by taking courses from the mathematics department. Now they are exposed to many examples of statistical analysis in social and behavioral science research, indicating its importance and relevance within those disciplines. Building on the experiences of former NSF grant recipients, this laboratory is designed to meet three objectives. \r\nFirst, we are designing a new course in computer-based statistical applications. This course provides students with knowledge of SPSS applications, particularly how to use descriptive and inferential statistics in data analysis, based on:\r\n o M.A. Kelley, \"Creation of a New Social Science Computer Laboratory,\" NSF-ILI 9351007,\r\n o J.L. May, \"A Multidisciplinary Computer Laboratory for the Social and Behavioral Sciences,\" NSF-ILI 9252354,\r\n o J.C. Raymondo, \"Behavioral Sciences Computer Laboratory,\" NSF-ILI 9250330, \r\n o J.C. Raymondo and J.R. Garrett, \"Assessing the Introduction of a Computer Laboratory Experience into a Behavioral Sciences Statistics Course,\" Teaching Sociology, Vol. 26 (1998), pp. 29-37, \r\n o J. Towey, \"Mobile Psychology Laboratory for Mercy College's Bronx Majors in Psychology, Sociology, and Behavioral Science,\" NSF-ILI 9551942, and\r\n o S. Wright, \"A Social Science Information Systems (SSIS) Laboratory for Undergraduate Education,\" NSF-ILI 9651363.\r\nSecond, the laboratory is being used for hands-on research in a methods courses in which SPSS and Ethnograph are integrated with research design, following Raymondo (above),\r\n o H.W. Fischer III, \"Teaching Statistics from the Users Perspective,\" Teaching Sociology, Vol. 24 (1996), pp. 225-230, and\r\n o J. Rudmann, \"Development of a Social Science Computer Laboratory to Improve Undergraduate Science Instruction,\" NSF-ILI 9350962.\r\n Third, the laboratory is being used as a basis for a sequence of core courses where computer technology is central. This adds a laboratory component to introductory and research methods courses. For example, students in Introductory Psychology are introduced to behavioral observation and data gathering with a software program called \"Sniffy the Virtual Rat.\" Another course on Race and Ethnic Relations employs SPSS in conjunction with a workbook, following the work of Fischer (1996) and Raymondo & Garrett (1998) cited earlier. \r\n\r\n",
