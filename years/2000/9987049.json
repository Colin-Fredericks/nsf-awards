 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the scholarship program in computer science and mathematics at Hampton University (HU) is to significantly increase the number of underrepresented minorities completing the baccalaureate degree and then pursuing graduate degrees in these fields. The Computer Science and Mathematics Scholarship Program (CSMS) provides an educational environment and support that prepares students for graduate studies. This is accomplished by exposing selected low-income students to a unique series of experiences during their final two years at Hampton University. A graduate component of CSMS provides tuition assistance for students who wish to matriculate in established Master's degree programs in Computer Science and Mathematics at HU.\r\n\r\nThe CSMS project is closely aligned with an on-going eleven-year program at HU (Student Enhancement in Mathematics and Science (SEMS)) funded by the Office of Naval Research that has proven successful in meeting its goals of preparing minority students for graduate school and subsequently, the nation's workforce. The primary focus of the CSMS project is the student- providing the student with all the tools, personal assistance, and skills needed to successfully matriculate at any graduate degree granting institution in the nation.\r\n\r\nThe specific components of the CSMS program are: (1)A Scholarship Program for current high performing students that are able to establish financial need; (2) A Research Participation Program; (3) An Academic and Mathematics Tutorial Program; (4) A Student Assessment Program; (5) Summer internships; and (6) A Visiting Lecturers Program.\r\n\r\nCSMC graduate students work closely with the undergraduate component of the program. Their duties are to serve as tutors, advisors, and research mentors to augment the experiences provided by faculty researchers for the undergraduates.\r\n\r\n",
