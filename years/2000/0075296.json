 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of multicellular organisms is the premier example of the integration of lower levels of function and selection into a single, higher-level individual or unit of fitness. Explaining the transition from single cells to multicellular organisms is a major challenge for evolutionary theory. We approach the origin of multicellularity through the understanding of cooperation and conflict among cells in cell groups. Coping with mutation is a critical factor during evolutionary transitions, since mutation enhances the scope for selection both within and between evolutionary units leading to conflict between levels of selection. We will study the evolution of the basic reproductive modes used in multicellular organisms from the point of view of coping with mutation. The way in which mutational variation is organized by the reproductive biology is a fundamental problem for the emergence of new evolutionary units. \r\n\r\nThe general objective of this grant it is to understand the emergence of complex evolutionary units. The organization of the living world is hierarchical-lower level units group together and cooperate to form higher level units of organization (genes, chromosomes, bacteria-like cells, eukaryotic-like cells (cells in cells), multicellular organisms and societies). While it may be easy to agree on the basic role played by cooperation in the diversification of life, it remains a difficult interaction to understand. Cooperation has traditionally been approached from two different perspectives-within species and between species. The proposed work aims to bridge these different traditions.\r\n",
