Semi-structured HTML documents are characterized by a\r\nrich data model, i.e., they contain both structured values and unstructured\r\nconcepts.  Exploring the semantic knowledge about the relationships among\r\nthese unstructured concepts is important but costly as an on-line process.\r\n\r\nThe postdoctoral associate will assist in developing a prototype Web mining\r\nsystem that will allow its users to specify a set of constraints, either\r\ndata values or concepts, and obtain a set of rules that contain the given\r\nconstraints and other items related to the constraint set.  In order to\r\nderive these rules, the system makes use of a concept library that\r\ndifferentiates between general concepts and concepts associated with\r\nspecialized domains.  Specifically, the associate will 1) develop new\r\nmethods for generating partially constrained association rules and\r\nclassifications rules that make use of the extended concept hierarchies\r\nkept in the library, 2) investigate the various lexical tools available and\r\nsee how to integrate them into Wordnet (which forms the basis of the\r\nconcept library), 3) explore various heuristic methods for deciding when a\r\ngiven concept belongs to a specialized concept library or to the general\r\nconcept library, and 4) explore the use of sampling techniques in reducing\r\nthe search space of rule generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
