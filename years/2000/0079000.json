 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nowak\r\n0079000\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues develop new theories for\r\nthe emergence of communication and cooperation among individuals.\r\nThey focus on theories to explain the evolutionary transitions\r\nfrom simple indexical signals through to iconic and referential\r\nsigns and finally to symbols and syntax in human language.  These\r\ntransitions are related to increases in fitness brought about\r\nthrough natural selection acting on communication strategies.\r\nThey approach these problems using evolutionary game theory and\r\npopulation dynamics.  The technical objective is to discover\r\nevolutionarily stable solutions to language games, such that when\r\nall individuals adopt these solutions, no mutant behavior can\r\ninvade the population under the influence of natural selection.\r\nThe challenge is to characterize the dynamics of the language\r\ngame by specifying a realistic set of strategies and payoffs, and\r\nthen to analyze the stability properties and accessibility of the\r\nequilibrium solutions.  The mathematical equivalence of the\r\ngame-theoretical replicator equation to the Lotka-Volterra\r\nequation offers a large tool box of techniques from nonlinear\r\ndynamics with which to explore the games.  They also aim to relate\r\nthese results to findings in information theory, in particular\r\nthe formulation due to Shannon and Weaver (1949).  Theoretical\r\nstudies of language therefore provide a set of fascinating\r\nconceptual and technical challenges, as the strategies described\r\nwith the models must be rich enough to capture the symbolic and\r\nopen-ended properties of signals.\r\n     While cooperation and animal communication are both areas in\r\nwhich much important theoretical work has been conducted, few\r\nattempts have been made to bring them together.  The study of\r\nlanguage provides an important focus for such a synthesis.\r\nTheoretical studies of the evolution of animal communication have\r\nstressed extravagant and costly ornamentation, using Darwin's\r\ntheory of sexual selection, whereas evolutionary approaches to\r\nlanguage tend to be represented by studies in historical\r\nlinguistics within human societies.  It is the objective of this\r\nproject to occupy the center ground and provide a theoretical\r\nbridge between these two disciplines.  Thus the work is neither a\r\nstudy of animal signals and cooperation nor a mathematical\r\ninvestigation of human syntax and grammar, but rather an attempt\r\nto reconstruct the continuous series of stages through which\r\nevolution might have proceeded from one to the other.  The project\r\ndoes not not attempt to explain the glorious intricacies of human\r\ngrammar studied by linguists, such as in X-bar theory.  Instead it\r\nfocusses on simple design features of animal communication and\r\nhuman language and attempts to describe their evolution in\r\nmathematical terms.  These probably antedated grammar, phrase\r\nstructure, anaphora and related linguistic constructs, and\r\nthereby provide some biological foundations upon which these\r\nlater concepts might rest.\r\n",
