 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from PhRAM Inc. ITAL will produce a working and testable prototype of a comprehensive educational tool and it will obtain initial evidence of how the proposed software works with students and how it is accepted by teachers.  ITAL's software is designed to create educational modules and tools that will help teachers assemble a single computer-based learning environment from heterogeneous educational resources and the WWW.  The proposed open-ended package will include an Active Shell, Modeling Activities, Problem Solving Tutor, Interactive Lessons and a tool to design them, Tools for Assessing student progress, and more. Virtually everything in the software can be controlled from a script.  The proposed software package employs a 'learning situation-focused' approach.  The Simulation module is based upon a 'real-life situation'.  It enables learners to actively participate in modeling and virtual experimentation and observe the physical processes from macroscopic to microscopic levels.  The software allows students to assemble various functioning systems from intelligent components and link science content and technology education with real life technical problems and thus to cross a gulf between applied knowledge and fundamental science.  The software may be used in classrooms equipped with stand-alone computers or local networks or it may be used over the Internet for distance learning.\r\n     PhRAM's software is designed to address high, technical and vocational school and college students and teachers as well as people engaged in any kind of distance learning, including those with disabilities.  The product can be used by companies for training technicians.  It will also target the marketplace of computer-based design and engineering, and it will be useful for presenting household hardware to the customers.\r\n\r\n",
