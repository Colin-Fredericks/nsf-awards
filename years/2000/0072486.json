Hardt\r\n\r\nThis project lies in the area of geometric variational calculus,\r\ntreating the behavior of singularities and energy concentration\r\nfor various optimal or stationary functions, fields, or geometric\r\nstructures subject to geometric or analytic constraints. Specific\r\ninvestigations focus on the relation between energy and\r\ntopological obstruction in mappings between manifolds,\r\nferromagnetic and liquid crystal materials, improper slicing of\r\npolynomial varieties, compactness of currents in Carnot groups,\r\nand the regularity of relaxed energy minimizers. We will\r\ninvestigate the energy concentration along area-minimizing sets\r\nfor limits of singularities of p-energy minimizing maps as p\r\napproaches a critical power.  In various higher dimensional\r\ncases, energy concentration of limits of smooth mappings may\r\noccur along sets of infinite measure and is related to\r\nhomotopically nontrivial mappings of spheres. Singularities in\r\nferromagnetic and liquid crystal materials will be also studied\r\nin both stationary and dynamic contexts. The theories of improper\r\nintersections of polynomial zero sets from algebraic geometry\r\nwill be investigated to understand related behavior in analysis\r\nand partial differential equations. A theory of currents in\r\nCarnot groups will be studied with an eye on applications to\r\nvariational problems.\r\n\r\nUnderlying many physical phenomena is a least-energy principle\r\nwhereby certain configurations or fields or geometric shapes are\r\ndistinguished by their property of having less energy or area\r\nthan competing objects. The external constraints often lead to\r\nsingularities, which are special points characterized by rapid\r\nchanges of structure occurring in very small spatial regions. For\r\nexample, one observes dislocation faults in solids under stress,\r\ndomain walls in magnetized materials, vortices in superconducting\r\nmaterials, liquid edges and corners in soap films, and point,\r\ncurve, and surface defects in various liquid crystal\r\nmaterials. We deal with new mathematical structures and theories\r\nnecessary to explain and predict such phenomena.  In these\r\nproblems, the theoretical studies of pure mathematics, the\r\nnumerical computational studies of applied mathematics, and the\r\nphenomenological studies from physics all benefit each other and\r\nall have a crucial scientific role.\r\n",
