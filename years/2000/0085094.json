 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Phoenix area is comprised of one 9-12 high school district with 23,000 students, and 13 K-8 elementary districts with over 100,000 students.  The Phoenix Union High School District proposes the implementation of the Phoenix Pilot 2000 project, an outgrowth of the Phoenix Urban Systemic Program proposal (NSF-0085094), to enhance the existing K-12 science and mathematics learning infrastructure by effectively integrating the 14 school districts into a structure with the greatest potential to improve student achievement.  The goals of the proposed 12-month effort are:\r\n\r\n1. To increase enrollment and student success in college preparatory mathematics and science.\r\n\r\n2. To provide K-12 standards-based staff development opportunities for mathematics and science teachers in collaboration with the Arizona State University.\r\n\r\n3. To implement K-12 standards-based mathematics and science curricula.\r\n\r\n4. To increase parent involvement and awareness of the importance of student success in mathematics, science, and technology.\r\n\r\n5. To evaluate program implementation and student achievement in mathematics and science.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish these goals, the 14 school districts will be organized into five clusters for effectiveness and efficiency.  Each cluster will consist of a high school and its nearest elementary schools.  Although the cluster formation will provide all school districts with opportunities to address each of the project goals, Phoenix Pilot 2000 will focus on the following three clusters:\r\n\r\n1. Alhambra High School with the Alhambra Elementary District\r\n\r\n2. Camelback High School with Balsz, Creighton, and Madison Elementary Districts\r\n\r\n3. Carl Hayden High School with Isaac, Murphy, and Riverside Elementary Districts\r\n\r\nHigh school and elementary science and mathematics teachers will participate in seminars and discussions with emphasis on the implementation of high-quality, standards-based instructional programs and the delivery of effective curricula.  A total of four lead teachers (two mathematics and two science lead teachers), in conjunction with the Arizona State University, will provide support to classroom teachers, ensure the K-8 to 9-12 transition of mathematics and science curricula, and conduct staff development activities that focus on standards-based curricula, instruction, and student performance assessment.\r\n\r\nAdditional major components of the Phoenix project include a three-week algebra summer program eight grade students; and parent involvement through quarterly meetings, newsletters, and workshops.\r\n",
