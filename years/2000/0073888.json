These models differ mainly in the timing of accretion and particularly in the subsequent northward terrane translation along the continental margin.  This project will take a new tack and focus on a innovative detrital provenance analysis of basin sediments that were deposited along the margin during this time period is the hopes of pinning the source terranes and therefore the locations of terranes at various times.  Results should help break the impasse in understanding the tectonic history of terrane accretion along the pacific margin of North America during mesozoic and tertiary time.\r\n",
