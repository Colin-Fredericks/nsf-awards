 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a fiber sensor system to be embedded in Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) during their fabrication. During use of the CMC component, a fiber failure could be unambiguously detected. The status of all CMC components could then be examined in real time by a system control hierarchy so that the applied load to the component can be reduced, or if that is not possible, the component could be replaced. Phase I will utilize electrically conductive elements of the load bearing fibers and sense the electrical continuity of these conductive elements to establish the mechanical integrity of the fiber. The sensing technology provides a clear, digital, on/off signal regarding the integrity of each and every fiber or strand. Because the concept is simple and direct, the method is expected to be highly reliable and sensitive.\r\n\r\nSpecific military and commercial use will potentially be found in: commercial engines for air and space, land-based radiant burners and heat exchangers, power generation and industrial gas turbine systems, hot gas filters for environmental applications, and high temperature industrial processing equipment and fixtures.\r\n",
