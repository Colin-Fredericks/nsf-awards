 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interconnect has been recognized one of ten hardest problems in nano technologies. A basic observation underlying this project is that nano-interconnect issues are much similar to that in real-world communication. Much research has been conducted to ensure the reliable, fast and secure communication over a noisy and stochastic environment. Therefore, the research is exploiting communication-theoretic principles and developing innovative signaling concepts in solving the stochastic nature of nano interconnect. The primary focus is on nano silicon technologies in CMOS with feature sizes below 100nm, and the goal is to explore ways to achieve reliable and fast signaling over the noisy and stochastically limited nano-interconnect environment. The specific objectives are\r\n1.\tto develop realistic-yet-simple communication models for various nano interconnect scenarios,\r\n2.\tTo study fundamental signaling limits dictated by communication theory (estimates of achievable rates indicate up to Tbits/sec.),\r\n3.\tto demonstrate interconnect design techniques for nano-signaling that can potentially approach the theoretical signaling limits\r\nThis is being made possible by a combination of several innovations that include (i) multi-wire (differential) full-duplex signaling, (ii) signal modulation, coding and equalization, and (iii) utilization, instead of avoiding, very-deep-submicron (VDSM) effects such as wave transmission for potential signaling.\r\n",
