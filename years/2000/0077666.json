 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research looks at what happens when light hits the eye.\r\nResearch will examine what happens when the eye adjusts to changing light\r\nlevels and how that information is transmitted between the retina and the\r\nretinal pigment epithelium (RPE). It will zero in on tiny chemical\r\nmessengers used by the retina to communicate with the RPE.  The RPE is a\r\nthin layer of tissue located next to the retina.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will use fish eyes as a source of tissue for these studies.\r\nUnlike human eyes, fish eyes have pupils of fixed diameter.  Fish don't\r\nadjust to changing light by dilating or constricting their pupils the way\r\npeople do.   Instead they rearrange their light-sensitive photoreceptors and\r\nthe pigment granules in the RPE to get just the right amount of light to the\r\nphotoreceptors, rods or cones, best suited for the job.  In the light,\r\npigment granules in the RPE spread out into finger-like extensions that\r\ninterlace with the rods and cones. These rearrangements let the RPE shade\r\nthe rod photoreceptors, which are specialized for night vision, while still\r\npermitting the cone photoreceptors, bright light and color vision\r\nspecialists, to detect light.\r\n\r\nThis study will examine the receptors through which acetylcholine, one of\r\nthe tiny chemical messengers, operates.  Receptors are like little antennae\r\nfound on the surface of cells, and they detect specific chemicals in their\r\nenvironment.  There are many different types of receptors for acetylcholine.\r\nEach detects acetylcholine, but each has a different effect on molecular\r\nsignals inside the cell.  This study will use chemicals that either mimic or\r\nblock acetylcholine to figure out what type of receptor is involved in\r\npigment dispersion.  This research will illuminate a novel signaling pathway\r\nfor light adaptation, enhancing understanding of how the eye works.\r\n",
