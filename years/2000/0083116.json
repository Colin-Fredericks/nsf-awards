 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, building upon and seeking to substantially accelerate the recently established momentum in nano and microscale research at the University of Kentucky, enhances the device fabrication capabilities to include clean room, MEMS fabrication, chip processing and microscale package integration or connection to macroscale devices.  Added to a Class 10 Clean Room funded by the state, and to the LIGA microfabrication and testing equipment provided by DARPA, the several key pieces of device fabrication equipment enabled by this award contribute to establish an advanced micro/nano-scale fabrication facility, capable of making both 2-D and 3-D structures.  The microdevice-MEMS fabrication facility will support and strengthen multiple ongoing research projects, facilitating synergistic multi-disciplinary research.  The project blends the skills of the Electrical, Mechanical, Chemical, and Materials Engineering Departments with those of the Chemistry and Physics Departments.  Thirty-two faculty members have identified on-going research projects that will be significantly strengthened.  This project substantially bolsters state capabilities for fabrication of the sensing 2-D microdevices, and interfacing/ packaging technologies by enhancing the capability to fabricate 2-D and 3-D micro/nano scale device assemblies from silicon, ceramics, and metals; thus, complete systems may be fabricated, encompassing integrated circuit micro-systems interfaced with macro scaled components such as pumps, heat sinks, etc. that are able to operate in harsh industrial or biomedical environments.  Optimizing finite state resources, the Device Fabrication Facility will be open to all state researchers.  The infrastructure fosters collaborations with regional industries that require robust microdevices in their manufacturing processes, providing the basis for enhanced economic development and growth in the state.  The work also contributes to enhance the educational experience of a substantial number of students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
