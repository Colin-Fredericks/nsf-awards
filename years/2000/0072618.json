 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award is to a senior professor at Harvard University for research that will probe the electrical properties of normal and superconducting structures fabricated at the nanometer length scale, at which quantum mechanical effects may modify behavior in a crucial way.  Such structures are of interest because they may make possible the further miniaturization of digital circuits. Specific attention will be paid to the following structures: (1) Superconducting nanowires fabricated by sputtering a superconducting metal onto a carbon nanotube template; here the basic issue is to understand the fundamental principles which limit how long and thin such wires can be made without losing the essential superconducting properties. (2) Carbon nanotubes themselves; these can be either metallic or semiconducting, and the planned research will study possible nanoscale devices made by manipulation of individual single-walled nanotubes. (3) Metallic nanoparticles, which make possible experimental probes of the interactions and quantum states of electrons inside a metal, and may have applications in compact memory structures. This project will provide training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in a field that is critical for maintaining national technical\r\nleadership.\r\n%%%\r\nOne of the most urgent technical problems facing our high-tech economy is finding a way to continue the miniaturization of electronic components, as described by \"Moore's Law\", beyond the limit projected on the basis of foreseeable improvements of current technology. This will\r\npresumably require invention and testing of new concepts and new physical structures which take account of the crossover from classical to quantum physics as things are made smaller. This individual investigator award is to a senior professor at Harvard University for research that will focus on three such ultrasmall systems: superconducting nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and metallic nanoparticles. All have potential importance for devices, and the work will provide training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in this field, where the availability of trained personnel is crucial for maintaining our national technical leadership.\r\n***\r\n",
