 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIt is objective of this research to investigate the behavior of post-tensioned clay masonry walls under in-plane lateral loads. In so doing, it is envisioned that such walls could then be utilized to construct efficient, high performance housing that would achieve goals of improved performance in natural hazards, improved durability, reduced environmental impact, and increased economy.\r\n\r\nThe research described is comprised of three primary tasks: (1) Experimental studies, (2) Analytical Studies, and (3) Web-based technology dissemination. Experimental studies will consist of large-scale reversed cyclic as well as real-time dynamic testing of post-tensioned clay masonry walls. Variables to be considered in the experimental studies consist of pre-stress level and the effect of grouting, bonding, and confining post-tensioned walls. Analytical studies will be geared towards development of design and analysis algorithms for the full non-linear behavior of post-tensioned clay masonry incorporating the effects of bonding, grouting, and confinement. Analytical studies will be performed utilizing dynamic inelastic time history analysis and finite element analysis in addition to simplified displacement-based techniques. Web-based technology dissemination will provide the engineering community access to the research results in the form of test databases and other algorithms developed as part of the research.\r\n",
