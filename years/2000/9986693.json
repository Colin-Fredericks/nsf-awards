 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the static and dynamic properties of the optically excited states of activated luminescent crystalline materials will be investigated.  The project encompasses three main aspects: 1) completion of studies of cooperative processes in the excited state of ion pairs which lead to luminescence upconversion and photon avalanching; 2) investigation of the optical and transport properties of the high lying energy states of activator centers and their interactions with the conduction band of the host; and 3) a search for a localization/delocalization (Anderson) transition of the excitations residing in the high lying states of the materials.  Students will participate in this project and will be trained in all aspects of experimental research on light emitting diodes and thus be prepared to enter the scientific/technical workforce.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project deals with investigations of the optical properties of materials that luminesce, or emit light.  Substances of this type are important to variety of technologies ranging from solid state lasers to optical displays.  The aim of these investigations is to obtain a better and more fundamental understanding of the physical processes which determine  the performance characteristics and efficiencies of these materials.  Such knowledge is the basis for the design and tailoring of materials to suit specific technical and physical needs and requirements. These investigations will be carried out with the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students.  The students will gain experience in an important area of forefront experimental and theoretical materials science. This will enable them to be productive members of the scientific/technical workforce.\r\n\r\n",
