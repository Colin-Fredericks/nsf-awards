Through this collaboration, researchers and students at Virginia Tech will have access to a very advanced microelectronic fabrication facility at HKUST and a state of the art clean room facility for their work on fabricating a new class of power semiconductor devices.  Semiconductor power devices form the heart of power electronics and are very important to the U.S. economy.  More specifically, they form the heart of the Power Electronics Building Block (PEBB).  The objective of the proposed research is to develop a new class of power semiconductor devices, the emitter-controlled thyristors (ECTs) for the PEBB.\r\n\r\nThis award adds an international dimension to planned educational activities in the original CAREER award, and will help equip students to develop international competence.  The collaboration with Hong Kong will contribute to technological innovations that will serve our societal and national goals.  \r\n\r\n",
