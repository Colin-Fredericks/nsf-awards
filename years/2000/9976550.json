It assists in establishing a  Materials Computation Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for interdisciplinary materials research. The award is jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials Research, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Division of Advanced Computational Infrastructure and Research in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.  The Center will provide a stimulating environment for state-of-the-art computational materials research and for development of new algorithms and computational approaches. The intellectual thrust of the research will be organized around broad research themes that will be coupled to experiment. The PIs will develop and maintain well-structured modular codes, educate students in the most modern computational materials science techniques, and apply computational methods to important materials problems.   Algorithmic developments will span the range from programs for teaching to forefront programs for research. Included are programs for molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, density functional theory calculations, and linear-scaling algorithms for large complex systems.  The PIs aim to work toward defining common analysis tools, input/output data structures, and well-defined interfaces between programs written by different people.  This helps enable compatibility and coupling in multi-scale applications, as well as heterogeneous computing via portable browser-type interfaces. The PIs intend to benchmark results on test problems and compare results with experiments.  The Center will have a core group of faculty from different disciplines committed to a program of collaborative research with shared postdoctoral associates and students. The Center will provide educational training and thesis research themes that address national needs for computational scientists with experience in applications to real problems and materials research.   In conjunction with the Computational Science and Engineering program at UIUC, students will acquire comprehensive computer science experience as well as basic science and engineering training, and they will gain valuable experience working in teams across disciplines. \r\n\r\nThis award supports research and education in computational materials theory and associated algorithm development.
