 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is implementing a professional development model created to increase the successful participation of community colleges and community college faculty in NSF programs. The Council for Resource Development (CRD) is building in the project upon existing regional conferences to offer a series of three workshops designed to familiarize faculty with NSF programs, showcase regional NSF projects and the faculty conducting those projects, and conduct a workshop on proposal development strategies specific to NSF. In order the achieve the goals, CRD is: (a) providing coordination for workshop development and implementation at the regional level; (b) recruiting faculty to attend the workshops who have not yet received awards from NSF; and (c) evaluating the workshops with particular emphasis on longitudinal outcomes. Evaluation of project outcomes includes looking for increased rates of proposal submissions to NSF as well as an increase in the success of those submitted.\r\n",
