 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project concerns the development of a unique characterization system for the enhancement of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) that rely on microflows or nanoflows.  The proposed Microflow and Nanoflow Characterization System (MINCS) incorporates a suite of laser-based microfluidcharacterization techniques that will be demonstrated during the Phase I program.  Important quantities such as velocity and species concentration will be determined simultaneously by acquiring two-dimensional images using multiphoton confocal microscopy.  A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code including chemical reactions will be incorporated into the instrument.  The fusion of the instrumentation and CFD code into the MINCS package will improve the characterization of MEMS devices based on either technique alone.  Upon validation using the MINCS instruments, the CFD code will be more applicable to the prediction of microflow characteristics, thereby enhancing the design of future MEMS devices.  This Phase I program has important secondary benefits; MEMS-based devices will benefit from improved designs as a result of improved instrumental and computational characterization.  This secondary benefit will have a larger economic impact through enhanced manufacturing of MEMS devices. For this reason, the research partners are a consortium possessing MEMS manufacturing facilities and design facilities for MEMS instruments for analytical-chemistry applications.\r\n",
