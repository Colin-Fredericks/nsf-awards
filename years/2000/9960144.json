 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the development of electrochemically regenerable ion-exchange resins.  Electrochemical regeneration offers significant advantages in reduction of the volume of secondary waste generated during target ion recovery.  The technology targets the recovery of bichromate from industrial process waste and hazardous waste sites.  The proposed technology will dramatically decrease disposal costs for chromium waste in the targeted industries. In this phase, synthesis and characterization of the proposed ion-exchange materials will be carried out utilizing established techniques. Preliminary evaluation of the proposed materials in the removal of bichromate will be performed for a variety of waste simulate compositions to establish selectivity, efficiency, and stability.  Electrochemical activation and regeneration of the proposed material will also be demonstrated prior to Phase II scale up and optimization.\r\n\r\nThe proposed ion-exchange resin will reduce raw materials and disposal costs for a number of industries currently using bichromate.  These industries include leather tanning, pigment production, wood preservatives production and metal treatment. The proposed technology is aimed toward waste reduction, resource recovery and toxic waste cleanup with a potential market of $60 million.\r\n\r\n",
