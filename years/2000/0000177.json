 "awd_abstract_narration": "Balll State University will provide ten-week summer research experiences during this three-year project to a total of eighteen undergraduates from primarily small universities and colleges.   Research opportunities are offered in theoretical condensed matter physics (quantum wires and superlattices), experimental high energy physics (charmed baryons) , nuclear physics (nuclear reactions in astrophysics) and observational astronomy (binary stars and galactic structure).  The primary goal is to promote and intensify undergraduate interest in training and careers in physics and astronomy, especially for students who have limited research opportunities at their home schools.  A multiplier effect is sought by including teaching majors in physics in a balanced mix of participants.  The personal interactions, guidance, tutorials, and supporting activities assist participants to become progressively more independent as they learn about the nature of research and the research process.",
