 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\nDigital Signal Processing (DSP) is a rapidly growing field that is creating a high demand for DSP-trained professionals. Industries such as the automotive, digital and wireless communications, digital control, imaging, video, medical, and data acquisition systems are in increasing demand for engineers with training in DSP. \r\n\r\nThe project is establishing an undergraduate DSP Laboratory to provide students with hands-on experience in DSP. The project is adapting concepts and ideas from the North Carolina State University. The students are getting the practical hands-on experience in manipulating real signals in this instructional DSP laboratory. The laboratory is composed of PC-based workstations equipped with specialized DSP hardware and software. It is providing a real-time DSP environment for actual system design, implementation, and evaluation experiences. Allowing the students to handle real signals that they can hear and/or visualize is helping them better understand these concepts. The principal activities consist of a sequence of supervised experiments and design projects. These are being permanently integrated into the current DSP course. These activities are providing the students with invaluable hands-on-experiences and practical DSP skills. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
