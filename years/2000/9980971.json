The goals of the project are: 1) To emphasize the application of human factors and ergonomics course material to real-world problems through integrated, design oriented laboratory experiences; 2) To ground the study of HFE within the context of industrial engineering, using a manufacturing case study to motivate the laboratories; 3) To provide students with laboratory experiences in which they can obtain skills in the identification of research or design questions, and the development of methodologies to investigate those questions; 4) To provide students with exposure to and skills in using current technologies and techniques in interface prototyping and industrial ergonomics work analysis; and 5) To motivate students of different learning styles to master course material. The project includes the development of an automotive manufacturing case study to be used in two required HFE courses, in cooperation with HFE personnel from two large automotive manufacturing facilities. The case material includes a description of the overall manufacturing system, seven multi-period laboratories across the two courses, and computer modules designed to support the design and analysis activities in the laboratories. Case material is being developed, the courses are being taught using the modified laboratories, and an evaluation is being conducted to compare student performance in the courses before and after the proposed laboratories are implemented. Among other methods, a web site is being developed to disseminate the case material.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
