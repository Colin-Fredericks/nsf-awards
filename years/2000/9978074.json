 "awd_abstract_narration": "9978074\r\nSondhi\r\nThis theoretical research involves several topics brought together by an overarching theme of understanding condensed phase systems exhibiting strong electron correlations.   In particular, investigations are unified by their connections with quantum systems in the vicinity of zero temperature continuous phase transitions.  These quantum critical points can be studied using generalizations of scaling and renormalization ideas developed in classical critical phenomena. Topics to be studied include nonlinear electrical response near quantum critical points in charged systems; dynamics near avoided critical points; and studies of possible quantum phases and phase transitions in quantum Hall and other strongly correlated systems.\r\n\r\nThis grant supports theoretical research in strongly interacting electron systems.  Although simple quasi-particle approximations have been very successful in describing materials properties, many other materials such as quantum Hall systems, cuprates, and heavy fermion systems are not well described by these models which assume weak electron corrrelations.  The research in this grant will study novel strongly correlated electron systems near a \"quantum phase transition.\"  Strongly correlated systems in this regime can be treated using many of the same tecniques which have been applied so successfully to classical thermal critical phenomena.\r\n\r\n",
