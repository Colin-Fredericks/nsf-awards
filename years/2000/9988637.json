 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses two important high-level issues -- reliability and performance -- in the development of quality software components that store and manipulate persistent data, where that data may be shared and accessed concurrently on behalf of principals that may be acting either cooperatively or competitively. The objective of the research is to design, implement and evaluate techniques that allow application developers to compose the competitive concurrency model of traditional database systems, namely transactions, with the cooperative concurrency model of traditional programming languages - namely, threads -- without sacrificing performance. The resulting fusion, so-called transactional threads, encourages development of more reliable applications that manipulate large amounts of shared, structured data. This project is developing specifications and implementations of integrated compiler/run-time and data storage techniques that enable transactional threads to perform efficiently. These techniques are being evaluated experimentally through execution and measurement of benchmark transactional persistent programs. Concrete research products include the development of prototypes of transactional threads for persistent extensions of the Modula-3 and Java programming languages. The experimental approach to this research offers a rich environment for training of experimental computer science students, for further experimental research applications, and for development of reliable persistent application systems. \r\nhttp://www.cs.purdue.edu/~hosking\r\n\r\n",
