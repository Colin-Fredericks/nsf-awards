 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Prashant Shenoy\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of the Internet coupled with advances in computing\r\nand communication technologies has led to the emergence of a variety\r\nof distributed multimedia applications. Realizing such applications\r\nrequires the development of large-scale information servers that can\r\nefficiently manage heterogeneity in data characteristics and\r\napplication requirements.  The main objective of the proposed research\r\nis to develop scalable, high-performance information servers to enable\r\nInternet-based multimedia applications and utilize the results of this\r\nresearch to enhance the effectiveness of imparting education.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will address three key issues: (i) the design of\r\na scalable, general-purpose multimedia file system based on\r\nnetwork-attached storage, (ii) the design of a coordinated resource\r\nmanagement framework for efficiently managing resources on large\r\nservers, and (iii) the design of a multimedia proxy cache architecture\r\nfor efficiently delivering data to applications over wide area\r\nnetworks.  The research methodology for addressing these problems is\r\neclectic, relying on a combination of analysis, simulation, and\r\nprototype implementation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed teaching efforts will focus on the development of a\r\ncurriculum in multimedia systems and the use of multimedia technology\r\nto improve the effectiveness of distance and classroom education.  The\r\nproposed effort will: (i) lead to development of hands-on,\r\nlaboratory-based graduate and undergraduate courses in multimedia, and\r\n(ii) explore the use of multimedia technology to develop more\r\neffective pedagogical aids.\r\n",
