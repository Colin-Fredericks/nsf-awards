The linkage between different projects on properties of various quasi-2d physical systems is a study of the effects of surface roughness.  This is based on a novel formalism developed by the PI.  Different projects include: (1) Transport and dissipation in ultra-thin systems with quantum size effect, (2) accommodation on rough surfaces and slip length, (3) Surface roughness and friction in quantized systems, (4) time dependent roughness and finally ( 5) periodically modulated walls with or without random roughness.\r\n%%%\r\nIn a film so thin that the size effects are quantum mechanical, there are a variety of possible novel effects related to disorder.  For example, the external surfaces may be rough and lead to additional resistance to the motion of electrons in a metal.  The grant here continues to support the work of this midcareer PI, who has developed a novel formalism to study precisely these effects.  The effects appear in transport phenomena, e.g. flow impedance or electrical resistance of nanoscale thin metallic films.  They might appear in properties of friction or accommodation (sticking of fast moving particles near a surface).  Finally there are conditions where the surface may be periodically moving or it might have roughness which varies in time.  These ideas have application in a wide variety of areas, ranging from properties of ultra-thin films to flow of classical gases past rough walls, and to propagation of waves past rough walls.\r\n*** \r\n",
