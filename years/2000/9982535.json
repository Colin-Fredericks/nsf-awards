 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent experiments suggest that gradients of regulatory molecules are\r\nimportant for establishing the body plans of multicellular animals.\r\nHowever, little is known about the mechanisms whereby target genes respond\r\nto changes in the concentration of regulatory molecules.  This application\r\nproposes to study these mechanisms in Drosophila, which is ideal for this\r\npurpose because the early embryo is a syncytium of nuclei that do not\r\npossess cytoplasmic membranes.  This permits the study of transcription\r\nmechanisms directly, without complications from cell-cell signaling\r\nprocesses.  The work will focus on four gap genes, hunchback, giant,\r\nKruppel, and knirps, whose overlapping protein gradients form an integrated\r\nsystem that establishes striped patterns of gene expression in middle\r\nregions of the embryo.  This work is driven by the hypothesis that these\r\ngradients establish positions of gene expression borders by acting as\r\nconcentration-dependent repressors.  For each gradient, the borders of\r\nseveral target genes are set at different positions with respect to the\r\nsource.  This suggests that each target gene responds to a different\r\nconcentration threshold of repressive activity.  To test this hypothesis,\r\npreviously characterized enhancers and the yeast FLP-FRT recombination\r\nsystem will be used to ectopically express different levels of each gene\r\noutside its normal domain.  These experiments will test whether expression\r\nof a given gap gene is sufficient for a particular response, and identify\r\npotential new target responses.  The misexpression system will also be used\r\nto dissect regions of the gap proteins that are required for repression.\r\nInitially, the focus will be on evolutionarily conserved domains that have\r\nbeen previously implicated in repression.  Together these experiments will\r\nhelp clarify the genetic circuitry that controls the positioning and\r\nspacing of gene expression boundaries in the early embryo, and provide\r\ninsights into general mechanisms that control how different target genes\r\nrespond to different combinations and concentrations of regulatory\r\nproteins.  They will also provide a firm foundation for studies designed to\r\nunravel the mechanisms that change body plans during evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
