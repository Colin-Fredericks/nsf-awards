 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a comprehensive effort to develop a nationally recognized interdisciplinary research and graduate training program in air quality.  It emphasizes physical, chemical, and biological characterization and control of particulate matter.  This effort will involve researchers at Kansas State University, Kansas University, and the University of Nebraska joined by an active Internet link.  The project will examine the science and engineering of indoor and outdoor air quality with special attention given to sampling and analysis of air, including research on processes to remove volatile compounds and particulates from air as well as methods to reduce contaminant generation in production processes.  Major Kansas and Nebraska industries depend on advances in air quality control technology to remain competitive and in compliance with regulations (e.g. production agriculture, aircraft manufacturing, grain handling and processing, building systems, bioprocessing, and microelectronics).  Graduate students will be trained in three major air quality areas: indoor air quality in buildings, particulate sampling, characterization and control, and bioaerosol science and engineering.  Students in toxicology, biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering will participate in interdisciplinary research efforts.  The project represents a major step towards the establishment of an Environmental Air Quality program that will play a significant role in both the technological and economic development of Kansas and Nebraska.  \r\n",
