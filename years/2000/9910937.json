 "awd_abstract_narration": "9910937\r\nVan Sciver\r\n\r\nThis award supports the participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Innovative Management Techniques in Cryogenics, to be held in Tallahassee, Florida, from December 4-7, 2000.  The co-organizers are Professors Steven Van Sciver at Florida State University and Professor Tomiyoshi Haruyama at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Tsukuba, Japan.  The topic encompasses many of the measurement issues involved in superconducting magnet and cryogenic systems.  Three main topic areas will be discussed:  1) recent developments in measurement devices for pressure, temperature, level and flow at low temperature;  2) measurement techniques in technical systems such as superconducting magnets and space cryogenic systems;  and  3) innovative measurement techniques of potential interest.  Specific topics include flow metering techniques, pulse tube refrigeration, particle image velocimetry, low temperature pressure transducer, acoustic emission/friction, low temperature machines, low temperature heat transfer, space cryogenics measurements, high resolution temperature and pressure, detection of second sound in He II and generating high Reynolds number He II.  The goal of the seminar is to encourage closer cooperation between the researchers developing new devices and the more goal-oriented applications, which could utilize these new techniques.  They also hope to provide an overall view of the state-of-the-art in the field for young scientists and engineers.  \r\n\r\nThere has been considerable progress in this field over recent years.  Some of this progress has been driven by applications such as superconducting magnet systems and space based technology.  Other major applications are in development of refrigeration, particularly small-scale cryocollers.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Dissemination plans for the seminar proceedings include publication in the journal \"Cryogenics.\"\r\n",
