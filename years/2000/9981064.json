 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) \r\n\r\nIn response to the rapid economic development in Southeastern Massachusetts, Bridgewater State College has made strong efforts to strengthen its science programs due to the increasing need for trained environmental professionals.  An Environmental concentration in Chemistry is being implemented to join concentrations in Biology, Earth Science and Geography, and Management Science in order to prepare teachers, technicians, and graduate researchers capable of dealing with the current and future environmental issues. This provides students with extensive hands-on experience in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation for environmental analysis. To provide the necessary instrumentation for this program the Chemistry and Biology Departments are establishing a laboratory with an HP 6890 gas chromatograph/HP 5973 mass selective detector tandem, and Lachat Ion Chromatography unit, powerful instruments for environmental analysis.  A set of laboratory experiments that adapt active learning pedagogies are being developed within the different disciplines to provide students with collaborative, hands-on experience using the new instruments.  \r\n\r\nThe benefits of this project extend to students from all science disciplines, strengthening the links between the Environmental Concentrations in Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences and Geography, and Environmental Management. This project benefits faculty development by catalyzing the adoption and implementation of enhanced laboratory curricula, incorporating active-learning pedagogy, and thereby energizing the present undergraduate research program. Furthermore, this project advances teacher preparation by improving the laboratory skills and understanding of current technology for preservice teachers in chemistry and biology, as well as in-service teachers supported through the Bridgewater State College Watershed Access Lab Professional Development program.           \r\n\r\nEvaluation is being conducted by an expert in environmental programs to assess the effectiveness of the hands-on lab in improving student learning and interest in the subject.  The results of the development of the new laboratory experiments are being reported at seminars and workshops and in the relevant journals.  They are also being posted on the websites of the various disciplines involved.",
