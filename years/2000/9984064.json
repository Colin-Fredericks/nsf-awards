 "awd_abstract_narration": "9984064  Burken  Phytoremediation is a natural systems-based engineering application that has the potential of removing or destroying organic contaminants in the environment.  The uptake, translocation and volatilization of organic contaminants are not well understood and these issues currently serve as a point of uncertainty, limiting regulatory acceptance.  The objectives of the research component of this project are: (1) to elucidate contaminant translocation and potential volatilization pathways in field-representative conditions that include plants with vascular root systems in the vadose and saturated zones, (2) to ascertain the impact and survivability of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) in the poplar rhizosphere, and potentially advance a new application of phytoremediation, and (3) to continue development of a screening procedure for organic contaminant phytoremediation.  Phytoremediation/GEMs combinations will be developed and evaluated in conditions and with methods that mimic full-scale practices.  \r\nThe objectives of the education component of this project are: (1) to arouse students' interest in environmental engineering and enhance their professional development through undergraduate research, teaching, student activities and field observations of current civil and environmental engineerign applications and practices, (2) to improve and enrich the environmental engineering program at UMR by revising the existing curriculum and teaching methods and by increasing numbers of non-traditional students and (3) to enhance instructional skills through training workshops on teaching methods and techniques.  This is a continuation of the PI's work in the education field that will include founding a national student chapter of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors, with associated UMR student chapter, integration of WebCT into curricula, participation in teaching workshops, implementation of a student project as a full-scale waste treatment facility and continued development of a student Stream Team.  These activities are expected to directly and immediately impact the science and engineering education of approximately 110 undergraduate and graduate students per year.  ***\r\n",
