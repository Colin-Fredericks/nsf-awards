 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\nThe ability of an engineer to visualize and reason about geometric aspects of physical objects and processes is crucial to the success of the activities of the engineer.  The visual reasoning capability forms the essential foundation for engineering education in all disciplines.  The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent instructional software system for visual reasoning which can adaptively support different student learning needs, track students' progress and give an active critique.  The intent is to provide a learning system with which a student can develop visualizing and spatial reasoning capabilities in a self-paced series of exercises related to solid modeling.  A comprehensive set of visual and spatial reasoning problems is being developed where a combination of visual analysis and visual synthesis is required.  The intelligent tutoring module provides a step-by-step critique in solving individual problems as well as properly routing the student through a series of problems with varying difficulties and different types.  The software system significantly expands both the scope and depth of the visual reasoning instructional software system which has already been developed and tested by the principal investigator of this project.  The educational materials developed will be tested at two University of Wisconsin campuses: Milwaukee and Madison, as well as at St. Martin's College and Northern Illinois University.  The software system and pedagogical materials will be disseminated nationally using the University of Wisconsin's Learning Center for distribution.",
