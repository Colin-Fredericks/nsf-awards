 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nLittle Big Horn College (LBHC) proposes to build upon Phase I activities to develop and maintain a comprehensive and sustainable reform effort in mathematics, science and technology education for schools on or adjacent to the Crow Tribe Reseravtion in southeastern Montana.  LBHC will utilize the lessons learned from Phase I activites and continue to promote the NSF drivers while implementing strategies to assist in their effort to provide a program that will catapult the schools serving their students to meet the National standards.  Special emphasis will be placed on a holistic approach to community reform using RSI activities to promote a comprehensive approach for systemic reform.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is recognized that the vision held by stakeholders must be changed to accomplish systemic reform.  Through the stages of implementation, the various groups must be increased to shape the purpose and goals of the new system.  LBHC will invite all stakeholders to participate in this process.   As the vision develops and is translated into practice, the support of the public and of the political leadership at all levels of the system must expand.\r\n\r\nSeveral isssues will be addressed during Phase II to ensure that the stakeholders are in careful collaboration.   The following will guide this effort:\r\n\r\nA common language and purpose will be develop and will resonate for the RSI to all stakeholders.  Training and orientation will help all sites to envision the total picture and each will be better positioned to take action and support the reform effort.\r\nA strategy will be implemented to move reform forward with a clear plan and related objectives.\r\nAn evaluation process will be implemented to measure the progress and guide the project.\r\n\r\nFor systemic change to occur,  key participants will be included in all activities throughout the reform process.  The proposed systemic reform effort will impact the required fundamental, comprehensive and coordinated changes for MST systemic change.  The changes will reflect policy, financing, governance, management, content and conduct.  All essential features of the school systems and LBHC will be engaged and operating as a seamless entity in promoting a comprehensive, standards-based curriculum and instructional materials for all students.  Special emphasis will be placed on assessment of effort and on assessment practices.  Activities will be aligned with the NSF drivers.\r\n",
