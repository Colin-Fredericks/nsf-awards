A mediator-aim, for the attainment of the above goal, consists of enhancing and institutionalizing, systemic mentoring, student research participation, and a reform-imbued instructional infrastructure at LS-LAMP institutions, in collaboration with other systemic programs in the state, national laboratories, and professional organizations.\r\n\r\nLS-LAMP began in 1995 with a five-year objective of doubling, by the end of 2000, the number of minority SMET students receiving BS degrees from partner institutions (from 500 to 1,000) and of sending 20% of these graduates to enroll and succeed in SMET graduate school programs in Louisiana and elsewhere.  Indicators of the attainment of the objectives of Phase I are presented farther below.  By the end of the five-year period of Phase II, LS-LAMP proposes not only to maintain the gains of Phase I but also to increase the number of high-quality SMET BS degree production to 1600 per year while institutionalizing its entire operation.  No fewer than 40% of these graduates will successfully pursue SMET graduates degrees.  The basic strategies of LS-LAMP are a comprehensive collaboration, the statewide replication and expansion of exemplary, systematic mentoring and outreach programs, including the Timbuktu Academy and others, and institutionalization.  A notable feature of LS-LAMP Phase II resides in the coordinated approach to complete institutionalization of our activities that are focused on increasing minority participation in SMET.\r\n\r\nSouthern University and A&M College serves as the lead institution for LS-LAMP program with the active input and advice of an array of collaborating public and private sector entities including the LS-LAMP Governing Board, chaired by the Commissioner of Higher Education, Dr. E. Joseph Savoie.  Currently, there are eleven (11) Louisiana higher educational institutions and one research organization participating in LS-LAMP.  They are Dillard University (DU), Grambling State University (GSU), Southern University and A&M College (SUBR), Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO), Southern University at Shreveport (SU-S), Tulane University (TU), the University of New Orleans (UNO), the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL), and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON).  The grantee and fiduciary agent for Ls-LAMP is the Louisiana Board of Regents.  The Board of Regents, in consultation with the lead institution, issue contracts to LS-LAMP partner institutions as per the cooperative agreement between the Regents and the National Science Foundation (NSF).\r\n",
