 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971432\r\nWeitz\r\n\r\nThis project will develop experimental probes leading to an understanding of the elastic properties of \"soft\" materials on a local scale, where the structure of the material directly influences its elasticity. The types of materials that will be studied include colloidal suspensions, gels, concentrated emulsions, and a variety of biologically important materials including actin networks, vesicles, model cells, and cells themselves. Many of these materials are structurally inhomogeneous, and thus their elastic properties can vary significantly in different regions of the material. Traditional bulk elastic measurements probe only the average properties; the methods to be developed here will probe local properties to differentiate the function and purpose of the different components of the material. The probes to be developed rely on the study of the motion of probe particles embedded within the medium; this motion will either be thermally induced, or driven with an external field. The motion of the probe will provide important information about the elasticity of the material on the length scale of these probes. The study will involve a post doc and several graduate students. \r\n%%%\r\nMany important materials can be highly inhomogeneous, and their properties can vary significantly within different regions of the material. The relationship of this inhomogeneous structure to the properties of the material can be crucial for its functioning. For example, an object as fundamental as a cell, is comprised of a wide variety of components, each with its own structure and each with its own function and each with its own properties. However, knowledge of the mechanical or elastic properties of such materials is typically obtained by measuring the response of a large collection of them; this provides some average information, but obscures important variations across the individual objects. The goal of this work is to develop new methods for making very local measurements of the elastic or mechanical properties of such inhomogeneous materials. The results will provide important insight into the function and role of the components of the material, and will assist in the rationale design of new materials that share or even improve upon the function of the material under study. This work will provide support and important education for both graduate students and post docs.\r\n",
