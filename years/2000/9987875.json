 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal goal of the Summer Undergraduate Research Program in Physics at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility is to provide promising undergraduate physics majors with a meaningful, exciting and challenging experience in scientific research.  We propose to sponsor the participation of at least 12 students per year in experimental and theoretical research projects at IUCF and the Nuclear Theory Center for 10-week summer terms.  We will recruit excellent students from colleges and institutions throughout the U.S.,with preference to institutions within the Midwest as well as small institutions where research opportunities for undergraduates may be limited.  It is expected that 90% of the students will come from institutions other than Indiana University at Bloomington, and that at least 25% of the students will be women.  The participants will gain direct research experience by working on projects in nuclear physics, accelerator physics, and medical physics under the supervision of faculty members and senior scientific staff.  Special programs for the students will be arranged, including orientation sessions, weekly seminars on current research in physics, and machine shop and scientific computer programming mini-courses.  At the end of the summer term, the students will submit research papers based on their work, and will present their results in seminars at a closing symposium.\r\n",
