 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research proposed here deals with the problem of reliable control of geographically distributed complex real-time systems over a heterogeneous communication network. It is aimed at developing thefoundations of network-based control, from theory to applications. The overall objectives are: \r\n\r\n the design, analysis, implementation, and performance characterization of distributed and decen-\r\ntralized control algorithms and middleware that are affected through hierarchical and heteroge-neous networks comprised of wired and wireless subnets, and\r\n the specification and implementation of network services and support required for the development and deployment of distributed control algorithms over hierarchical heterogeneous networks, and demonstration of efficient and fault tolerant remote control using such networks for a number of emerging commercial and scientific/engineering applications.\r\nOur research agenda will cover the following domains:\r\n Research toward a network based control theory that emphasizes and accounts for decentralized, distributed and delay aspects of information transmission dictated by speciffic network structures, and bandwidth limitations.\r\n Basic research to leverage the latest developments in distributed robust fault-tolerant control, and to build a new theory for multifaceted control of remote objects over heterogeneous networks, using also the framework of dynamic games.\r\n Development of dynamic and adaptive methods for representation of large systems and computation of associated control strategies, using of hierarchical, adaptive graphs and distributed agents.\r\n Design and implementation of algorithms and middleware that will interact with the host-node communication protocols and provide the necessary support for the implementation of coordinated distributed control applications. Furthermore, design and implementation of an embedded real-time operating system kernel which will support hard deadlines and stringent QoS guarantees.\r\n Development of a demonstration prototype to be deployed on a small-scale heterogeneous hierarchical network comprised of a wireless subnetwork and campus-wide nodes of local area and Internet hosts.\r\nIn addition to the development of new analytical paradigms and approaches, a component of the research program is the development of reusable simulation and design software, so that the research output can be parlayed to other researchers, practitioners, and industry. We envision numerous future scenarios where the results from this research program will apply. Among these are satellite control, air traffic control, congestion control over highways, remote guidance of airplanes, power networks, electronic commerce, and remote surgery.\r\n",
