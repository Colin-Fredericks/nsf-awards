 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Materials Science (57)  This project is adapting a course, originally developed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in materials chemistry, to fit the needs of freshman engineering students at Virginia Commonwealth University's new School of Engineering. This course is being designed to provide students the fundamental knowledge required to perform materials selection and is key to integrating design in upper level courses. Rensselaer had changed the mode of delivery in this multidisciplinary course from the traditional lecture-recitation format to an interactive studio format that integrated lecture, recitation, team problem solving, and experimentation into a single learning experience. As a small engineering school, VCU cannot completely adopt the studio model; therefore, the plan is to create studio recitations, integrate the laboratory into the class sessions, and develop an effective text with internet based supplemental material.\r\n\r\nFocus is on the studio-based recitation as the key learning experience. The course format is being modified such that there are two one-hour lectures and two ninety-minute recitations each week.  VCU is integrating the laboratory into the studio-based recitation. Student teams are typically conducting similar experiments on different materials. Their results are the subject of class discussion, and students are being asked about the laboratory as part of their homework assignment or individual test questions.  Emphasis is being placed on a higher level of learning. The goal is to have students be able to make design decisions based upon experimental data, consider alternative processes or materials, and effectively communicate these opinions.  VCU is disseminating via a textbook being prepared exclusively for use in a first-year common engineering course, and supplemented with an internet-based CD containing hints, narrative solutions to homework problems, lecture overheads including speaker notes and animations, and virtual laboratories.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
