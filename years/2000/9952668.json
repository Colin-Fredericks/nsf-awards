 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) The University of New England is engaged in adapting and implementing interactive engagement strategies into its introductory physics sequence. This three-year project is serving a large undergraduate life and health sciences student body through a two-semester service course in physics that will have impact across the life science curriculum at his university. The proposal provides a set of integrated concepts wedding physics with other undergraduate departments participating in this project -- anatomy, biology, chemistry, and microbiology. The project involves instructing UNE faculty and in-service high school science teachers in the Portland Maine locality to use proven instructional tools. These faculty will play an essential role in continued adaptation and implementation in both the lab and lecture sequence. At the core of this teaching approach is David Hestenes' \"Modeling Instruction for High School Physics,\" a nation-wide NSF-funded effort housed at Arizona State University. Modeling includes descriptive, graphical, mathematical, and diagrammatic representations, as well as laboratory and demonstration-based constructivist learning methods, adopting many of the best elements from physics education research groups around the US. Students are engaged in Socratic dialog both in lecture and laboratory to address their misconceptions and promote more accurate physical pictures. Hands-on, guided laboratory activities first introduce simple models that are later reinforced in lecture. \r\n\r\nLaboratory improvement is being implemented through the installation of microcomputer-based laboratory equipment for improved student learning. This project will also achieve improvements in the curriculum by implementing an education program for summer laboratory instructors, overhauling introductory laboratories, and keeping abreast of technological developments. As an example of technological integration with introductory course content, students in the second semester will examine the atomic nature of matter through remote operation of an atomic force microscope. The PI is educating laboratory instructors from a pool of interested faculty and in-service high school physics instructors both during the academic year and the summer. Evaluation is being conducted by a quantitative comparison of student learning under different teaching methods. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
