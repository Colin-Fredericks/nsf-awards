 "awd_abstract_narration": "RUI: Acquisition of Automated DNA Sequencing Equipment for East Carolina University. \r\n\r\nThis award, combined with matching funds from East Carolina University, will be used to purchase an Applied Biosystems 377 automated DNA sequencer, a Silicon Graphics 2000 parallel processing computer system, a gradient programmable thermal cycler and an automated plasmid DNA purification system for revitalization and expansion of the  centralized DNA sequencing facility.  Seven principal and several minor investigators, as well as their students, will use the centralized facility for sequencing intensive research covering diverse aspects of the biological sciences. In specific, this DNA sequencing intensive research includes molecular phylogenetics and biogeography, character evolution, evolution and function of the teleost immune system, vertebrate evolutionary developmental biology, organellar-nuclear genome gene regulation, gene regulation of stress response in plants and structural organization of photosynthetic membrane protein complexes. \r\nThe Department of Biology at East Carolina has a strong research program that places a heavy emphasis on training undergraduate and Master's level graduate students in research. The department offers Bachelor's degrees in Biology and Biochemistry and Master's degrees in Biology and Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.  The number of undergraduates electing the molecular biology and biotechnology areas of concentration and the number of Master's degrees in Molecular Genetic and Biotechnology has  increased significantly.  The University is adding courses in bioinformatics, molecular biology, molecular genetics, and protein purification and structure analysis.  This award will facilitate these course offerings by allowing the Center to provide access to state-of-the-art equipment in these courses.   \r\n",
