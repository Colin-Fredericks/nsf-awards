The researchers will be undertaking a study of the characterization of alkaloid biosynthetic genes in Nicotiana Tabacum.  Tropane alkaloids are important secondary plant metabolites involved in plant chemical ecology.  Despite the importance of plant alkaloids little is known about the molecular biology of alkaloid biosynthetic genes or their regulation.  The goal of this research project is to use an advanced transcription profiling method, called Fluorescent Differential Display (FDD), to identify and isolate tropane alkaloid biosynthetic genes in Nicotiana Tabacum (tobacco).  The researchers will perform several large-scale FDD screens to identify alkaloid biosynthetic genes in tobacco.  They will attempt to identify genes that are differentially expressed between a wild type tobacco accession and mutant tobacco accessions that have defined double and single mutations that greatly reduce tropane alkaloid levels.  By utilizing specific root culture conditions and defined mutations in near isogenic backgrounds they will identify differentially expressed genes specifically involved in alkaloid biosynthesis.  This approach overcomes the difficulties inherent with traditional biochemical and genetic methods in Nicotiana species.  \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  The research should provide important information on alkaloid biosynthesis in plants, which should then result in potential applications in plant biotechnology.  The research will also be of interest to the pharmaceutical industries.  The project advances international human resources through the participation of a postdoc and a graduate student.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.   Results of the research will be published in international scientific journals and will also be presented at scientific meetings in the U.S. and abroad.\r\n",
