 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project aims to design advanced power conversion circuit schemes to meet the increasingly stringent power requirements for future computers. This includes development of optimized power system configurations, efficient power stage topologies and high performance control techniques. The design schemes will meet the industry requirements in terms of total harmonic distortion and power factor as well as EMI requirements. In Phase II, advanced packaging techniques and components and device optimization will be carried out. Using high-speed computers has become mandatory in all fields of application. The increasing desire for quick response, fast processing capability and for the multi-functioned features of computer systems drives the computer hardware design engineer to develop high-speed microprocessors. Meeting present and future power requirements for high-speed computers poses a real challenge to the technical community. Today's microprocessor technology enables the new generation processors operate as high as 500MHz. Designs for 800MHz and 1GHz are under way. The new generation integrated circuits are developed based on low-voltage (typically 2.6V to 3.3V) operation. Also the semiconductor companies are targeting chips running at 1.5V to 2V to operate at the GHz. speeds. The technical difficulties facing design engineers are numerous. As the voltage supply decreases, higher currents are needed to meet the required power rating, resulting in high power losses and thermal management problems. Due to the high load current requirements and wide current changes, technical challenges in designing fast dynamic response, low voltage ripple tolerance and short circuit current protection need to be addressed.\r\n       Potential users of the new designs are computer manufacturers and low voltage IC manufacturers that are used in communication equipment, consumer electronics, etc. The new power supply conversion technique will impact the entire computer industry. The next generation of computer speeds will be in the MHz range with voltage power supplies as low as 1.5volts at 100A. Even in today's computers at 200-400Mhz speeds, power losses are significant and suffer from slow dynamic response. As a result, computer power supplies are inefficient, bulky and expensive. Unlike the existing power conversion methods that based on the conventional scheme that uses voltage regulator modules from a 5V out put to the desired low output voltage, the proposed conversion scheme will be based on new topologies that will directly step down the voltage from line to the desired levels. We believe the new system configuration and topology selection will lead to a low-cost and improved power quality power supplies.\r\n",
