 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez (SUAGM) is comprised of three\r\ninstitutions: Universidad Metropolitana (UMET); Universidad del Turabo (UT);\r\nand the Colegio Universitario del Este (CUE). SUAGM presently enrolls 19,600\r\nstudents and is the second largest private university on the Island. SUAGM\r\nserves principally economically and educationally disadvantaged students.\r\nIn October 1995, UMET competed and won an NSF Model Institutions for\r\nExcellence (MIE) Program Award.  To date UMET has used the MIE program to\r\ndramatically improve its educational infrastructure in science and\r\nmathematics (S&M) and to increase the quantity and quality of minority\r\nstudents who earn SEM baccalaureate degrees. This proposal sets forth a plan\r\nfor Phase II that will improve upon Phase I accomplishments, raise UMET to\r\nthe next level of capability, and begin the process of disseminating its\r\nmodel to other institutions including UT and CUE.\r\n\r\nThe four \"cornerstones\" of the Phase I MIE are: (1) curriculum, instruction\r\nand assessment; (2) faculty development; (3) student recruitment, retention,\r\nand graduation; and (4) physical and administrative infrastructure. Phase II\r\nwill further improve each \"cornerstone\" of the MIE framework established\r\nduring 1995-1999 and build  synergy across the \"cornerstones\" to ensure an\r\nintegrated and systemic improvement effort. During Phase II, UMET will\r\nconcentrate to a greater degree on bringing its increased SEM student body\r\nthrough graduation and onto graduate school.\r\n \r\nTo improve curriculum, instruction, and assessment, UMET will increase the\r\neffectiveness and efficiency of its 10 SEM academic programs and disseminate\r\nthe MIE curriculum development process to UT and CUE science departments and\r\nother UMET departments, using institutional resources.\r\n\r\nUMET will develop faculty by hiring additional faculty with advanced degrees\r\nin selected areas; enhancing existing faculty<B9>s content knowledge in SEM\r\nareas; delivering improved student centered instructional programs;\r\nstimulating faculty research capability and involvement of students in\r\nresearch; developing an improved infrastructure for proposal development,\r\nimproving its ability to assess faculty performance; and providing financial\r\nsupport to faculty completing doctoral degrees.\r\n\r\nTo improve student  recruitment, retention, and graduation, UMET will\r\ndevelop a highly effective program for accelerating student learning,\r\ncritical thinking skills, and content knowledge; provide pre-college\r\nstudents with a greater appreciation of the benefits of careers in S&M and\r\nthe skills needed to pursue S&M studies; and conduct a coordinated set of\r\nactivities to attract better prepared students and provide sufficient\r\nacademic support services to retain them through graduation.  These\r\nobjectives will be achieved through a comprehensive  Science  Support Center\r\n(SSC).\r\n\r\nUMET will improve its physical infrastructure by better equipping the UMET\r\nScience building; building a new science laboratory building  with\r\ninstitutional funds; and enhancing the computer networking capability of all\r\nSEM faculty in SUAGM. To further improve the administrative infrastructure,\r\nUMET will build on the policy changes that were developed during the initial\r\nMIE period, continue the development of UMET and initiate a transformation\r\nat both the UT and CUE campuses by extending the UMET MIE administrative\r\npolicy changes across the System.\r\n\r\nThe project is managed under the direction of Dr. Juan F. Arratia who\r\nreports to the Chancellor of UMET.\r\nsupport to faculty completing doctoral degrees.\r\n\r\nTo improve student  recruitment, retention, and graduation, UMET will\r\ndevelop a highly effective program for accelerating student learning,\r\ncritical thinking skills, and content knowledge; provide pre-college\r\nstudents with a greater appreciation of the benefits of careers in S&M and\r\nthe skills needed to pursue S&M studies; and conduct a coordinated set of\r\nactivities to attract better prepared students and provide sufficient\r\nacademic support services to retain them through graduation.
