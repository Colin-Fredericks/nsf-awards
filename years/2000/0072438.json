Stanley\r\nDepartment of Mathematics\r\nUniveristy of Montana\r\n\r\n\r\nEngineers, mathematicians and other scientists who use mathematical \r\nmodels to describe physical systems often need to answer the question: \r\n``How does the system response change as system parameters change?'' \r\nFor example, how does the airflow around an airplane wing change as\r\nthe shape of the wing changes, and how does this affect drag? \r\nSensitivity analysis seeks to answer such questions.  The sensitivity\r\nprovides quantitative information which can be useful as a \r\nmathematical tool to gain insight into the behavior of a system.\r\nThis proposal deals with the analysis and design of\r\ncomputational methods for approximating sensitivities for a very specific \r\nclass of problems.  The research focuses on shape sensitivity calculations\r\nfor interface problems.  These problems arise in the analysis\r\nof a variety of physical systems such as groundwater flow through \r\ndifferent types of sediment as well as manufacturing processes such as die \r\ncasting problems and alloy solifidification problems.\r\nIn die casting, for example, there is an interface\r\nbetween the solidifying part and the mold itself.\r\nWhen analyzing such a process, the mold and the part may be considered \r\nas one composite material, and in order to optimize the casting process, \r\nthe designer needs to determine the sensitivity of the temperature \r\nthroughout the composite material to small changes in the thickness \r\nof the respective component materials.   Since the mold and the \r\nmanufactured part consist of different materials which have different \r\nheat conductivity properties, the mathematical equation governing \r\nthe cooling process has a solution which lacks smoothness at the \r\ninterface.  For these types of problems, computing the sensitivity \r\nrequires a different, and more clever, approximation scheme than \r\nthat which is typically used to determine the temperature.  The \r\ncurrent research attempts to analyze and exploit the mathematical \r\nstructure of these problems and to modify existing numerical methods \r\nin order to develop a computational algorithm which is accurate, \r\nefficient and reasonable to implement.  Estimates regarding inclusion \r\nof such techniques in the design of rocket engines show that design \r\ncycle time could be reduced from one year to one month.  Results\r\nof this magnitude make the development of such \r\ncomputational tools critical for the national interest\r\nboth in cost savings during the design stage and in remaining\r\non the forefront of new technology.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the use of\r\ndomain decomposition techniques for the development of \r\naccurate and efficient computational algorithms for shape \r\nsensitivity calculations.  Specifically, the work involves\r\nthe implementation of Continuous Sensitivity Equation\r\nMethods (C-SEMs) in order to derive infinite dimensional\r\nsensitivity equations which usually take the form of\r\npartial differential equations.  The research focuses\r\non elliptic interface problems containing \r\nparameters which determine the spatial \r\nlocation or the shape of the interface.  The  resulting shape \r\nsensitivities exhibit discontinuities across the interface.  \r\nEfficient computational algorithms for this\r\nclass of problems rely on two essential components.  The first \r\nis the mathematical analysis needed to establish fundamental \r\nproperties such as existence, uniqueness and regularity.  \r\nThe second component is \r\nthe clever choice of a numerical method which is suitable\r\nfor solving the equations.  The theoretical analysis guides\r\nthe construction of a computational method which exploits \r\nthe problem structure.  Specifically, an iterative, nonoverlapping\r\ndomain decomposition algorithm is used to accurately capture \r\ndiscontinuities in the sensitivity variable.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
