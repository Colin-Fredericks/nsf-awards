Lutz are the organizers of the \"San Diego Symposium\r\non Asymptotics and Applied Analysis\" from January 10 - 14, 2000 at San\r\nDiego State University, California.  The proposed conference will have\r\ntalks falling under the following three categories in asymptotics and\r\napplied analysis: difference equations, ordinary differential equations,\r\nand functions defined by integrals.  The first of these would emphasize\r\nasymptotic methods involving special functions.  Included in the second and\r\nthird categories would be new results related to exponentially-improved\r\nasymptotics and hyperasymptotics, summation of divergent solutions,\r\nconnection problems, error analysis, and applications to special functions.\r\nThe following eleven leading experts in the above fields have indicated a\r\nwillingness to participate as principal speakers in the proposed symposium:\r\nF. W. J. Olver (Maryland), R. Askey (Wisconsin), W. Balser (Ulm, Germany),\r\nC. Bender (St. Louis), M. Berry (Bristol, UK), B. Braaksma (Netherlands),\r\nP. Pham (Nice, France), R. Schaefke (Strasbourg, France), Y. Sibuya\r\n(Minneapolis), N. Temme (Netherlands), and R. Wong (Hong Kong).\r\nPost-doctoral and graduate students, and especially those from\r\nunder-represented groups in mathematics, are strongly encouraged to attend.\r\n\r\nThe broad area of this conference is asymptotics of special functions.\r\nAsymptotics is defined to mean, for example, the approximation of a given\r\nfunction in terms of a function whose properties are better understood, or\r\nwhich can be more readily computed.  Special functions are solutions of\r\ncertain equations which appear in many areas of physics, engineering and\r\nmathematics.  This is a very classical branch of mathematics that has\r\nalready contributed much to our understanding of the physical world.\r\nHowever, during the past decade there have been a series of new and\r\nexciting ideas leading to significant improvements in the accuracy of\r\nasymptotic methods, with the main contributors coming from the US, Europe,\r\nand the Fareast.  But since 1989 (Winnipeg, Canada) and there have been no\r\nmajor conferences in North America on the theme of this symposium, even\r\nthough there have been many conferences on similar themes in Europe and\r\nAsia.  This symposium will bring experts and younger researchers together\r\nto disseminate these new ideas to a wider audience and lay the groundwork\r\nfor future studies and collaboration, new applications, and insight into\r\nmore complex problems to be yet solved.\r\n",
