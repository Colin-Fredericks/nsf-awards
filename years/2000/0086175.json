 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Rural Systemic Initiative proposed by Fort Peck Community College for the \r\nnext five years will build on the accomplishments of the previous High Plains program.\r\nFort Peck Community College will serve as the catalyst for establishing common goals for the\r\nnew program. Systemic change in science, mathematics and technology education will be\r\nimplemented throughout the reservation school system K-12 and Fort Peck Community\r\nCollege. Members of the collaboration include the five public school districts, Fort Peck\r\nCommunity College, the Fort Peck Tribal Education program, the Montana Office of\r\nPublic Instruction and other collaborators.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\r\nObjective 1. By August 2000, each of the five reservation schools will implement\r\nvigorous, standards-based instruction for all students and the curriculum, professional\r\ndevelopment and assessment systems to document systemic change.\r\n\r\nObjective 2. By June 1, 2001, each leadership team will establish a unified set of\r\npolicies to facilitate and enable Objective 1.\r\n\r\nObjective 3. By July 1, 2001, each instructional leadership team will insure that\r\nall resources (school and grant funded) are uniformly applied.\r\n\r\nObjective 4. By September 2001, the Project Coordinator and leaderships teams\r\nwill mobilize the full community stakeholders in order to facilitate Objective 1.\r\n\r\nObjective 5. By August 2002, the instructional leadership teams will insure that\r\nall schools increase student attainment in science, mathematics and technology.\r\n\r\nObjective 6. By August 2005, the systemic approach will result in a reduction in\r\nattainment differences between those traditionally underserved and their peers.\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator and Project Coordinator will administer the project.\r\nThe Project Advisory Committee composed of major stakeholders, will be responsible\r\nfor policy development, change process, dissemination of information about the project\r\nto the community, strategic planning and project evaluation. The instructional leadership\r\nteams, composed of all Fort Peck public school teachers who regularly teach\r\nmathematics, science and technology, school administrators, and Fort Peck Community\r\nCollege advisors, will be responsible for systemic change in instruction, curriculum and\r\nevaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential Impact\r\n\r\nThe project will result in a reduction in attainment differences between students\r\ntraditionally underserved and their peers. The degree of student attainment will be\r\ndocumented by the Core Data Elements. Project achievement will be measured by\r\ndocumenting the degree to which the objectives have been achieved.\r\n \r\n\t\r\n",
