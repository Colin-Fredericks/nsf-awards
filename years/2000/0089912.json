 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) is developing a pilot project focused on improving undergraduate mathematics instruction for prospective elementary school teachers. The project design is based on the hypothesis that changing university teaching strategies is best accomplished when both faculty and the senior academic leadership of a university work together to develop and implement activities supporting comprehensive reform. The proposed project involves several key elements: the active leadership and involvement of the president and chief academic officer, including the participation of the chief academic officer on campus teams of faculty and administrators; individualized campus plans tailored to and responsive to the unique context of specific campuses; an initial week-long summer teaching seminar for teams of faculty and administrators from AASCU campuses in the summer of 2001, focusing on research-based best practices in teaching mathematics; a year-long implementation process on individual campuses; and a concluding two-day follow-up seminar the subsequent summer to discuss successes and challenges.",
