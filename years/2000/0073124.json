With nearly 50% of the human population in urban areas, it is imperative to understand what determines the location and size of human settlements (cities and towns). This project will document the global pattern of human settlements and explore the possible causes of pattern. A combination of satellite imagery and census data will be analyzed to quantify the spatial distribution of settlements and the relative frequencies of settlements of different sizes. To investigate possible ecological causes of these patterns, a computer simulation will then be developed that incorporates essential components of modern global human behavior (urbanization, reproduction, food and water consumption, and trade) and ecological factors (arable land and fresh water availability, climate, and accessibility).\r\n\t \r\nResults of this study should identify basic, worldwide patterns of human settlement that are indicative of both fundamental human behaviors and ecological factors that limit and facilitate urbanization.  Determination of the human and ecological controls of urbanization should inform public and economic policy.  This research will be crucial for understanding and managing urban growth and ecological resources in an era of increasing globalization and urbanization.\r\n\r\n",
