 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project establishes a program that will provide scholarships to outstanding undergraduate and graduate students in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. This is the largest university in the United States with a student population that is majority Mexican-American and a national leader in the preparation of Hispanic scientists and engineers. It is also a commuter institution that draws approximately 85 percent of its students from El Paso County, the fourth poorest Metropolitan Statistical Area in the United States in terms of per-capita income. Approximately 40 percent of this university's students are the first in their families to attend a university, and most students must work on- or off-campus to pay for their education and assist their families. \r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of Principal Investigators, this project will offer 44 scholarships each year for two years, beginning in August 2000, to 22 upper-division undergraduate students in computer science, engineering, and mathematics; 11 master's level students in those programs; and 11 doctoral students in three programs (Computer Engineering, Environmental Science and Engineering, and Materials Science and Engineering) who are at the dissertation writing stage of their graduate careers. \r\n\r\nAll individuals selected as CSEM Scholars must: be United States citizens, nationals, or aliens admitted as refugees at the time of application; demonstrate financial need, defined as eligibility for U.S. Department of Education Pell Grants or Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need fellowships; and enroll full-time in computer science, engineering, and/or mathematics degree programs at the baccalaureate or graduate level. \r\n\r\nCSEMS Scholars will complete outstanding and innovative undergraduate and graduate programs that will prepare them for the 21st century. They will receive mentorship from faculty who combine outstanding teaching with research programs funded by agencies such as NSF, NASA, EPA, the Department of Defense, and other federal, state, and corporate sources. In addition, through the Model Institutions for Excellence program, students will participate in innovative programs to support their retention in their degree programs and increase their professional skills. When they complete their degrees, they can expect to be highly competitive for major graduate schools and to be actively recruited by major industry employers.\r\n",
