 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project proposes the development of reduced models for large-scale\r\nlinear time invariant (LTI) systems of the form\r\n \r\n   dx/dt = Ax + Bu, y = Cx\r\n\r\nthrough low rank approximation of certain system Grammians. Complex systems \r\nof this form arise in circuit simulation; they also arise through spatial \r\ndiscretization of certain time dependent PDE control systems.\r\n\r\nA new approach to model reduction will be studied, that will address some \r\nfundamental difficulties with existing dimension reduction techniques. \r\nThese issues are central to the potential development of robust and widely \r\napplicable software. We intend to develop a computational methodology that \r\nwill:\r\n\r\n(1) Provide rigorous bounds on the response error of the reduced system; \r\n(2) Naturally preserve fundamental system properties such as stability;\r\n(3) Be fully automatic once a desired error tolerance is specified. \r\n\r\nWe propose to investigate subspace projection methods of Krylov and \r\nnon-Krylov type.  Our primary goal will be to develop implicit restarting\r\nmethods that will iteratively produce low rank approximations to \r\ncontrollability-, observability-, and cross-Grammians which are near best \r\napproximations of reduced rank to the full Grammians.\r\n\r\nThe methods proposed will provide balanced partial realizations of large \r\nstate space systems. Our computational experience with model problems \r\nindicates that the Hankel singular values of many systems decay extremely \r\nrapidly. Hence very low rank approximations to the system Grammians are  \r\npossible and accurate low order reduced models will result. \r\n\r\nWe expect to find important applications in circuit simulation and in \r\nthe control of systems governed by partial differential equations,\r\nparticularly parabolic equations subject to boundary control. There is \r\ngreat potential in such problems for extensive dimension reduction. This \r\nwill enable the design of real-time controllers for complex systems.\r\n",
