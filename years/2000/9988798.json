 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nIn my thesis and in extensions I have made over the past year and a half, I \r\nhave studied variants of Radon transforms known as singular Radon\r\ntransforms, generalizing earlier work of Christ, Nagel, Stein and Wainger. \r\nIn my proposed research, I intend to extend my methods to include a broader\r\nclass of operators, which would include fractional and more traditional smooth \r\nRadon transforms, proving boundedness properties on Sobolev and L^p\r\nspaces. I also intend to research possible applications to partial differential\r\nequations; there is a similarity between concepts that I use and results of\r\nFefferman and Phong in subelliptic PDE theory that might lead to interesting\r\nresults in that direction. Further, I would like to generalize my work in more\r\napplied directions. For example, tomography, an important tool in medical \r\nimaging and related areas, requires the inversion of Radon transforms. Due to \r\nthe close relation between PDE's and inverse problems, I hope to be able to \r\napply my methods to help solve inverse problems such as those in tomography.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent work, I have studied mathematical objects known as singular Radon\r\ntransforms. They are variants of standard Radon transforms, which have\r\nimportant applications in both mathematics as well as the sciences. For\r\nexample, in medical imaging one frequently uses X-ray tomography to generate\r\nan image of an internal organ that one can not easily analyze through other\r\nimaging techniques. X-ray tomography involves inverting a Radon transform\r\noperator, in other words, the determination of an image from the Radon\r\ntransform of this image. In my proposed research, in addition to extending my\r\nearlier results to strictly mathematical questions, I hope to be able to \r\nextend my research to help tackle more applied problems such as these. Ideas \r\nfrom disparate areas of mathematics and science might be needed.\r\n\r\n",
