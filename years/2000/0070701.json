The aim of the conference is to bring together several of the world's leading researchers with research interests in groups and semigroups and their connections with topology, geometry, symbolic dynamics and symbolic computation. Emphasis will be on asymptotic properties and algorithmic problems.\r\n\r\nThis conference is in a field that is at the interface between group theory and semigroup theory (the mathematical  study of global and local symmetry) and computation.  The study of algorithmic problems in these settings is closely related to the understanding of \"complexity of computation\".  The conference will be held on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln during the period May 15 - May 19, 2000.  There will be around 20 invited one hour lectures and several contributed talks. Special efforts will be made to support participation by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.\r\n",
