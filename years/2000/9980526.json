 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will investigate a number of problems in the efficient support of different qualities of service (QoS). Due to the scarcity of network resources and the emergence of new applications, it is considered crucial that the current internet evolve from a best effort service to one that supports different QoS. This problem was explored in the IETF first in the context of integrated services and more recently in the context of differentiated services. One of the key problems with the work in integrated services was the lack of scalability of per-microflow scheduling in the core of the network, and the basic tenet of differentiated services has been to move per-microflow operations to the edge of the network and deal with only macroflows in the interior of the network. Nevertheless, some of the key traffic elements such as regulators (to shape, police, and mark microflows at the edge as well as macroflows at the boundary of different subnetworks) and schedulers (across different macroflows and service classes) are still needed to provide the different QoS. Higher multiplexing gains are also sought by looking at flows statistically rather than in the worst case. Moreover, schemes that use a combination of end-to-end flow control and policing/marking at the microflow level and dropping (RIO)/scheduling at the macroflow level have also been proposed to provide a combination of assured QoS along with the ability to use additional available bandwidth. The objective of this proposal is to engineer these key traffic control elements - regulators, schedulers, and flow control mechanisms - so as to not only deliver the different QoS desired, but to do so in a manner that maximizes the network utility.\r\n     In order to accomplish this objective, the project will rely on a modeling and analysis framework that has recently been developed by the researcher and his collaborators. This framework provides a unified mathematical model (based on the notion of traffic envelopes/ service curves / service processes) for regulators and schedulers as well as an easy way to analyze fork-join networks of such elements with (or without window/rate flow control). In particular, the researcher's prior work has shown how the impact of the entire network may be reduced to that of an equivalent single element with an (end-to-end) service curve given in terms of the service curves of the individual elements using an easy composition rule. Furthermore, the worst-case and probabilistic end-to-end performance for such networks is then easily obtained in terms of this end-to-end service curve. Since the framework is analyzable, one can \"invert\" the results of the analysis to derive rules for the design of efficient traffic control elements. More interestingly, the framework allows for the representation of a sophisticated service curve for a single traffic control element, as a network of simple service curves.  This representation can then be exploited to synthesize complex but highly efficient regulators and schedulers. This modeling framework therefore provides a systematic way to analyze, design, and synthesize traffic control elements for differentiated services networks.\r\n     In particular, the proposed project will lead to the following: It will result in the synthesis of more efficient regulators and schedulers. It will develop other guaranteed services (besides leased line emulation) in the context of differentiated services networks. It shall produce better admission control schemes for probabilistic service. For both guaranteed and probabilistic service, it will also lead to efficient allocation of network resources into service curves for different flows via pricing. In the case of adaptive service with certain minimum requirements, it will lead to a better understanding of the interplay between the in-profile and out-of-profile traffic, and how this interplay may be exploited to enhance existing adaptive mechanisms such as TCP.\r\n",
