 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jack Pladziewicz of the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program for research in an undergraduate institution dealing with self-exchange electron-transfer rate constants and related reorganization energies. Particular attention will be devoted to: a) measurements to make possible comparison of self-exchange rate constants in the gas phase and in solvents (hydrazines in acetonitrile, etc.); b) couples with high redox potential; c) new systems of fundamental importance.\r\n\r\nElectron-transfer reactions are of crucial significance in  chemical areas of great practical importance (industrial catalysis, biological respiration, neural functioning, for example). Although substantial progress has been made in recent decades in theoretical understanding of such processes, major unsolved problems remain. Further scientific  advance in this important area will depend on the availability of extensive data-sets based on careful measurements of judiciously selected systems. Measurement of such data provides an excellent introduction to scientific research for undergraduate students.",
