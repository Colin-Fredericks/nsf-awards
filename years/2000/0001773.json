One is to develop the study of regulatory lawyering across different types of regulatory agencies.  A second objective is to generate new evidence of how American law is understood and practiced by attorney overseas.  A third objective is to build on existing literature regarding process of corporate regulatory decisionmaking.\r\n\r\nData will be collected through approximately 150 interviews with attorneys in law firms, corporate general counsel, and corporate and government officials.  These interviews will include a representative sample of both American and British lawyers practicing law in London.  The research also includes a survey of securities practitioners and general counsel in both countries.\r\n",
