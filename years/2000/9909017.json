 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the synthesis and properties of polythioether macrocycles which have considerable potential use as ligands for transition metal ions.  Historically, these molecules have been difficult to make.  However,  new procedures for synthesizing these molecules have recently been discovered.  These procedures center around a metal-catalyzed ring opening reaction of smaller sulfur-containing molecules in which the metal can act as a template for construction of the cycle.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Richard D. Adams of the University of South Carolina.  The research project that Professor Adams will conduct under the auspices of this Award involve the creation of molecules that are molecular rings and in which sulfur atoms are placed at regular intervals.  Such molecules interact with metals as though they were a crown of thorns, with the sulfur atoms connecting the crown to the metal.  In this way the properties of the metal are modified, potentially in such a way that the usefulness of the metal in chemical reactions is enhanced.\r\n\r\n",
