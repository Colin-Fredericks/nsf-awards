The PI will investigate the connections between foundational issues in the computer and\r\ninformation sciences and different branches of mathematics in a series of four \"working\" workshops\r\ninvolving both mathematicians and computer scientists, two per year in each of two years. The PIs \r\nwill de-emphasize formal talks and emphasize discussion time and opportunities to explore new\r\npotential collaborations between computer scientists and mathematicians. The workshops  willbe followed  followed  up  with opportunities for participants to meet at DIMACS to pursue the research direc-\r\ntions identified. The workshops will cover the topics\"Algebra and the Theory of Computing,\"\r\n\"Computational Complexity, Entropy, and Statistical Physics,\" \"Wavelet Analysis and Digital Ge-\r\nometry Processing,\" and \"Algorithmic and Quantitative Aspects of Real Algebraic Geometry in\r\nMathematics and Computer Science.\"\r\n",
