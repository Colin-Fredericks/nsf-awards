 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much natural resource policy work stresses the importance of involving lay and expert stakeholders in a dialogue about environmental values so as to inform decisions about land management. This proposal tests and develops the technique, narrative valuation, which is designed to address a problem basic to value elicitation contexts: The fact that discussions about values and land management are challenged by the simultaneous need to consider pragmatic and technical concerns (e.g. cost or inventories of threatened species) alongside ethical or spiritual concerns (e.g. the notion that nature has intrinsic value or forests inspire awe).  The researchers posit that narratives offer a viable means for discussing and eliciting different values because they enhance information processing which in turn helps people manage cognitively complex problems, and because they employ a storied and descriptive language well-suited to describing states like awe or lay expressions of ethical concern.  They will conduct a set of experiments meant to balance diverse expressions of value. Narrative valuation tools will be tested (against nonnarrative conditions) for their ability to address (a) the representation of technical and social variables; (b) the coexistence of numeric and nonnumeric expression of value (biological health can be measured as the number of returning salmon but how does one measure greater or lesser degrees of intrinsic value); (c) the linking of ethical values to  appropriate policy actions; and (d) the use of verbal versus linguistic quantifiers and probability estimates.  Further experiments will carefully examine problems of bias or persuasion potentially introduced by this method.  These include narrator bias, the influence of different affective tones, and/or the ability for narrative frames to emphasize some expressions of values at the expense of others.  The project is expected to support the applicability of narrative valuation tools and to result in several papers published in peer reviewed journals covering environmental ethics and values, judgment and decision making.",
