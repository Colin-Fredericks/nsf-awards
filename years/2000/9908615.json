 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CASES-99 field program of October 1999 has the goal of providing the most comprehensive characterization to date of the evolution and dynamics of turbulent mixing processes in the stable nocturnal boundary layer.  In support of the observational program there will be numerical modeling studies on scales ranging from mesoscale models, through large eddy simulations (LES), to direct numerical simulations (DNS).  The motivations for the field program and the associated modeling include (1) the lack of understanding of boundary layer dynamics, turbulence intermittency, and mixing in stable and very stable conditions; (2) the inadequacy of existing parameterizations of mixing and transport processes in these conditions; (3) the crucial importance of improved parameterizations for large-scale atmospheric models.  This grant supports modeling by DNS of the smallest scales of motions.  Observational data and the outputs of larger-scale models (mesoscale or LES) are used to define the initial conditions.  DNS is then performed for a small domain of interest (for example, the region of strong shear at the top of the boundary layer) to define the dynamics, mixing, and transport processes in that region.  Phenomena important for mixing processes, such as intermittent turbulence, shear instabilities, and vortex production by surface irregularities can thereby be studied in great detail.  Results will assist in physical interpretation of the observations and are essential to improving the parameterization of processes that cannot be resolved in larger-scale models.",
