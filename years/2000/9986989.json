 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (31), (59), (21) The university is selecting forty (40) students for a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics (CSEM) Scholarship Program. The program has two goals:\r\n\r\n1) To provide educational opportunities to low-income academically talented students through scholarships that promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement\r\n\r\n2) To increase the number of women, under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities completing a baccalaureate degree\r\n\r\nIn support of these goals, students are selected on the basis of financial need, academic merit, and ability to complete a degree within two years. Preference criteria related to gender, ethnicity, and disability status are applied, and educational level is a consideration. The emphasis on undergraduate students grows from the conviction that many university graduates are well prepared to go on to advanced degrees and to excel in leadership positions in academia and in industry, if, early in their education, they experience support to internalize this aspiration and to build confidence in their own abilities to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe university mission focuses on high quality educational programs and the promotion of diversity. These strengths can be applied to help address the national problem of under representation of women, minorities, and students with disabilities among computer science, engineering, and mathematics degree recipients.\r\n\r\nThe CSEM Scholarship Program benefits from the many campus services and activities that promote cultural sensitivity and support minority students. Students selected for the program receive a high degree of personal attention and undergo individualized application oriented experiences. They are given high priority for partial tuition waivers to supplement support available through NSF funding.\r\n\r\nProgram success is guaged on quantifiable outcomes: degree completion, post-graduation placement in either graduate school or employment. Evaluation also examines the effectiveness of recruitment efforts and program components such as support networks and special activities.",
