 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops efficient algorithms, as well as\r\nadditional techniques and methodologies, that can be used to\r\nsolve the noncommutative algebraic components of problems in\r\nanalysis and engineering.  The noncommutative algebraic component\r\nof such a problem consists of solving a collection of equations\r\nwhere each of the variables represents a matrix or bounded linear\r\ntransformation.  Solving such problems involves manipulating this\r\ncollection of equations until it is amenable to numerical\r\nsolution or until the manipulated collection has some desirable\r\nproperty.  Methodologies based on noncommutative Groebner basis\r\nwere developed in a paper by J.  William Helton and the\r\ninvestigator in 1998 and these techniques are effective for\r\nsolving a short list of problems.  Several directions of study\r\nfor the current project include removing the need for additional\r\n\"invertibility assumptions,\" removing redundant equations, and\r\nfinding appropriate changes of variables.  The new approaches\r\nshould widen the range of problems that can be solved.\r\n     Ordinary arithmetic is commutative: 2 times 5 is the same as\r\n5 times 2, and in fact A times B is the same as B times A for any\r\nnumbers A and B.  The arithmetic of matrices -- rectangular arrays\r\nof numbers that can represent, for example, the forces on\r\ndiferent parts of a bridge or airplane -- is not commutative: A\r\ntimes B is not always the same as B times A.  The development and\r\nimplementation of algorithms for solving collections of\r\npolynomial equations spurred a great amount of activity in\r\ncommutative algebra.  In an analogous way, the development of\r\nalgorithms and methodologies for solving collections of matrix\r\nequations can have a dramatic impact on solving engineering and\r\nanalysis problems that have noncommutative algebraic components,\r\nwhere the order in which components of the calculation are\r\narranged can change the answers.  With currently developed\r\ntechniques, some computations that arise commonly in engineering\r\nrequire a considerable amount of time to perform by hand, but can\r\nbe done very quickly on a computer.  The development of new\r\nmethods for noncommutative algebra should significantly increase\r\nthe number and types of problems that can be solved efficiently\r\nwith the assistance of computers.",
