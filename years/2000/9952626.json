 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) Superposition lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and is a difficult concept for students. Non-local \"spooky action at a distance,\" as Einstein called it, occurs as a consequence of what are called \"entangled states.\" Recently there have been significant advances in the experimental production and study of entangled states. There are exciting prospects that such states can be used for unbreakable cryptography, innovative parallel computation, and for transferring the properties of a quantum state from one object to another some distance away - so called \"quantum teleportation.\" Advances in single photon detection and the development of bright sources of entangled photons make this an opportune time to prepare students to understand these remarkable developments. The project is implementing five undergraduate laboratory experiments that clearly exhibit the quantum nature of the photon, the existence of single-photon interference, the nature of two-photon interference and the so-called quantum erasers, and an experiment that demonstrates nonlocality by the violation of Bell's inequalities. The goal is to create experiments and supporting textual materials that help students to better understand the ramifications of the superposition principle in quantum mechanics and that also serve as a model for making significant changes in the syllabus of undergraduate quantum mechanics.\r\n",
