Udwadia, and up to 15 other researchers to attend a workshop on Dynamics and Control to be held October 9-11, 2000 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Special emphasis will be given to the topics of the use of analytical mechanics in control theory, control of uncertain systems, and applications to control of nonlinear dynamical systems.  U.S. participants will be chosen from a broad range of universities and geographic locales.  The workshop will bring together expert senior and junior researchers from Europe, the United States, and the Americas and answers a need for increased interaction in this field between scientists from those areas.  It also addresses a need to bring pure and applied mathematicians together to combine their approaches to particular problems that will require a combined effort if they are to be solved.  The workshop is also expected to lead to new collaborations between scientists from the participating regions.  The government of Brazil also intends to support participation by providing travel for a selection of European participants and lodging for all participants.\r\n",
