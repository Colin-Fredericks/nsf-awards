Nicolaescu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project involves topological  and geometric aspects of the\r\n\r\ntheory of three-dimensional Seiberg-Witten monopoles and it\r\n\r\naddresses two general guiding questions. The first question is\r\n\r\nabout the topological significance of  the  monopole count. Meng\r\n\r\nand Taubes have shown that   on a three-manifold with nontrivial\r\n\r\nhomology this count is given by  Reidemeister-Turaev torsion. In\r\n\r\nthe case of rational homology spheres numerical experiments with\r\n\r\nSeifert manifolds suggest that a suitably altered  monopole count\r\n\r\n determine in a very elegant fashion both\r\n\r\nthe Casson-Walker invariant and the Reidemeister-Turaev torsion.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the project is devoted to proving this. The\r\n\r\nsecond question is about the geometric meaning of\r\n\r\nthree-dimensional monopoles. The link of a complex surface\r\n\r\nsingularity is  endowed with a natural CR geometry and it is\r\n\r\nnatural to ask how much of it does a monopole capture. More\r\n\r\nprecisely we  address the following fundamental question: how do\r\n\r\nmonopoles \"look like\" as  the link of the singularity collapses\r\n\r\nonto the exceptional divisor of a resolution of the singularity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three-dimensional world    has been a source of inspiration\r\n\r\nfor many important developments in algebraic topology.  It is\r\n\r\nwithin the reach of our physical intuition   so some visualization\r\n\r\nis possible (think of a cube) yet there is plenty of room for\r\n\r\nsurprises (think of gluing in pairs the opposite faces of the\r\n\r\ncube). One modern point of view is that, if presented in a\r\n\r\nfavorable light, the three-dimensional world will reveal its\r\n\r\nmysteries. The mathematicians   phrase this in a more sober way.\r\n\r\nIf  one can find a nice geometry on  a three-manifold then one can\r\n\r\nunlock some of its topological features. The monopoles are\r\n\r\ngeometric objects introduced to the mathematical world by\r\n\r\nphysicists. One could think of them as \"signals\" produced by a\r\n\r\nthree-dimensional space. These ``signals'' depend on  how we look\r\n\r\nat the manifold.  Since they appeared on the mathematical scene\r\n\r\nthey have provided us with surprising insights about the structure\r\n\r\nof low-dimensional worlds. This project is about counting these\r\n\r\n\"signals\" in a meaningful way and then understanding the\r\n\r\nsignificance of each one of them individually when observed under\r\n\r\na favorable light.\r\n\r\n",
