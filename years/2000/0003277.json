 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant provides funding to cover participant costs and support costs for a workshop to identify research issues and opportunities in the area of electronic product realization.  In e-product realization, customers participate in the product design process.  This workshop will bring together about 50 researchers and practitioners from the field to discuss current issues and impediments to development of the field.  The workshop will produce a white paper detailing the workshop findings and presenting a suggested research agenda.\r\n\r\nE-product realization is an emerging practice in engineering design and product realization that gives customers freedom and access to obtain products that are more suited to them as individuals.  This is an emerging area of product design and realization, and one that holds the potential to become a major segment of product realization in the future.  This workshop could provide the basis for NSF funding in this area.\r\n\r\n",
