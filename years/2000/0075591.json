These include eutrophication (or nuisance algal blooms), the strength of interactions between different levels in the food web (i.e. plants and herbivores), biomass accumulation at each trophic level, and fisheries production.  The objective of this research is to determine the role essential fatty acids and elements such as phosphorus and nitrogen play in regulating these processes.  Experimental and modeling results suggest that when algal essential fatty acid content is high, zooplankton grow rapidly and build up a biomass sufficient to suppress plants.  This results in relatively high water quality (high water clarity due to low algal biomass) and high fisheries production. Alternatively, algae with low essential fatty acid content will result in poor water clarity and zooplankton growth, and reduced fisheries production.  The investigators plan to use fatty acid analyses to examine energy flow through aquatic food webs: from plants to herbivores to carnivores to economically important fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n00-75591\r\nGoldman\r\n\r\nCollaborative Research - The Role of Fatty Acids and Limiting Elements in Biogeochemical Cycling and Food Web Dynamics\r\n\r\nThe food quality of plants for herbivores may have profound impacts on a wide variety of processes.
