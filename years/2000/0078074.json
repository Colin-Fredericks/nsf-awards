For instance, a semiconductor laser\r\narray generates greater collective power when it synchronizes,\r\nbut such phase-locked operation is notoriously difficult to\r\nachieve in practice.  The investigator studies the nonlinear\r\ndynamics of oscillator networks, using mathematical methods of\r\ndynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, and statistical\r\nmechanics, along with numerical simulation.  Three projects\r\nexplore how synchrony emerges in a group of dissimilar\r\noscillators, motivated by both biological and laser applications.\r\nAreas of investigation include the stability of partial locking\r\nin the Kuramoto model of coupled biological oscillators; the\r\ndynamics of biological oscillators coupled by phase-response\r\ncurves; and phase-locking in slightly detuned laser arrays.  Two\r\nother projects address the relation between the connectivity of a\r\nnetwork and its ability to synchronize.  Small-world networks,\r\nwhich combine small diameter with large clustering, are\r\ninvestigated to test whether they synchronize more readily than\r\nlattices.\r\n     The goal of this project is to develop a deeper\r\nunderstanding of complex systems that are made of many\r\noscillating parts and that manage to synchronize themselves.  For\r\ninstance, the thousands of pacemaker cells in the heart always\r\nfire in unison, even though they are all slightly different from\r\none another.  Unfortunately, a similar kind of coordination\r\nsometimes happens in the brain, where it leads to epilepsy.  In\r\nboth cases, nature has provided us with examples in which\r\nmillions of cells begin to act in unison.  By understanding\r\nbetter how this synchrony is achieved, it should be possible to\r\ndesign arrays of technologically important devices that can\r\nsynchronize themselves.  Such self-synchronizing systems would\r\nhave important technological applications in many areas of\r\nnational interest, including environment (atmospheric pollution\r\nmonitoring uses sensitive detectors based on arrays of\r\noscillators), civil infrastructure (the proper functioning of the\r\nnational power grid depends on self-synchronization of the\r\ngenerator network), and nanotechnology (where arrays of millions\r\nof microscopic mechanical oscillators are being used in new\r\ndevices).\r\n",
