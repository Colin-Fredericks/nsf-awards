 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis equipment award from the Engineering Research Centers Program provides funding to the Engineering Research Center on Reconfigurable Machining Systems at the University of Michigan to build as proof-of-concept a new type of CNC machine, called the Reconfigurable Machine Tool (RMT).  The RMT has two new characteristics:  a spindle until that can be added and subtracted from the machine in response to changing demand and design features that are built around a part family to allow cost-effective response to product changes.  The ERC holds a patent on this RMT design.  The RMT will be used for machinin a part family that contains angled surfaces.  This novel 3-axis RMT machine will have the following characteristics:  the angle of the cutting tool will be perpendicular to the angled machined-surfaced of the part, the angle of the cutting tool will be adjustable to fit a new part with a different angled surface, and an additional second spindle unit could be integrated into an existing machine in order to double the production rate of the machine exactly when needed.  The RMT has been designed as a part of the ERC's research on machine-level design.  This proof-of-concept RMT will be used by faculty and students for further research in the design of reconfigurable machine tools and in the ERC's test bed for systems-level design.  The ERC is providing cost sharing for this equipment request in the amount of $120,000.\r\n",
