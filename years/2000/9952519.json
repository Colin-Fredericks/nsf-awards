 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\rThis project is introducing the use of a state-of-the-art inductively coupled \r\nplasma - optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) as part of an interdisciplinary effort to incorporate analytical chemistry techniques into the earth sciences curriculum. Students in several departments access the equipment, including those in geology, chemistry, and environmental studies programs. The introduction of these new analytical techniques complements an existing hands-on field-oriented approach in the earth and environmental sciences. Student research opportunities are also being supported, and access to the instrumentation is shared with other institutions with which W&L has had previous collaborative agreements, including members of the Keck Geology Consortium. Materials and approaches from several institutions are being adapted and/or implemented including an environmental program at Duquesne University that emphasizes atomic spectroscopic techniques, problem-based class and laboratory approaches developed by a Dept. of Chemistry team at Bates College with NSF/DUE funding in the ILI and CCLI programs (#9950314 and #9850730), and multi-element analyses approaches in mineralogy and petrology developed by members of the Dept. of Earth Science at Minot State (NSF #9751439).",
