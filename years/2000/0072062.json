Two types of questions will be investigated. The first of\r\nthese is a study of hyperbolic cone-manifolds. Finite volume\r\ncone-manifolds arise naturally as a link between cusped hyperbolic\r\n3-manifolds and closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Bromberg's goal is to\r\nparameterize spaces of infinite volume hyperbolic cone-manifolds and use\r\nthis parameterization to understand non-singular hyperbolic structures.\r\nThe second question involves the topology of deformation spaces of\r\ncomplete, infinite volume metrics on open 3-manifolds. Anderson and Canary\r\nhave shown that the space of such metrics on a manifold of fixed homotopy\r\ntype has a very complicated topology akin to that of the Mandelbrot set\r\nstudied in complex dynamics. In joint work with J. Holt, Bromberg has\r\nshown that this complicated behavior persists even if the deformation\r\nspace is restricted to metrics on a 3-manifold of fixed homeomorphism type\r\ngeneralizing work of McMullen. Complex projective structures naturally\r\nappear in both of these topics. Bromberg also plans to study projective\r\nstructures with a given discrete holonomy representation. \r\n\r\nThis project lies in the field of low dimensional topology and geometry.\r\nThe main objects studied are three-manifolds which are spaces with one\r\nmore dimension than a surface (a 2-manifold). Three-manifolds,\r\nsuch as the space that we live in, are some of the most basic\r\nobjects in mathematics yet there are many simple questions about them that\r\nwe cannot answer. A metric is a way of measuring distance on a 3-manifold\r\nand a hyperbolic metric is one of a special class of metrics such that at\r\nevery point and in every direction the geometry locally looks the same.\r\nThe work of W. Thurston has shown that \"most\" 3-manifolds carry a\r\nhyperbolic metric and earlier work of Ahlfors, Bers and others has shown\r\nthat an open 3-manifold that has an infinite volume hyperbolic metric will\r\nin fact have many hyperbolic metrics. There is a vast program to\r\nunderstand all such metrics of which this project is a piece.\r\n",
