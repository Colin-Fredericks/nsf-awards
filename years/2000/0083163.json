 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tThe complex social lifestyles of ants are based on their ability to perform\r\ndifferent tasks during an individual's lifetime (e.g. brood-care, guarding, foraging)\r\nand on learning and memory. These behaviors are controlled by the brain and \r\ndepend on brain plasticity. The aim of the project is to study the causal relationship between the structure and function of the brain and the complex behavior that it\r\ncontrols. Particular brain regions and individual nerve cells that generate complex behavior will be analyzed in different ant species using diverse anatomical techniques. Morphological differences will be correlated with the behavioral performance of the\r\nrespective species or guild member (e.g. forager versus nurse ant). The \r\nbehavior and learning ability of each ant will be quantified in\r\nstandardized tests (e.g. maze performance), the effect of brain lesions on\r\nthe ant's behavior will be assessed, and the electrical activity of\r\nprominent nerve cells in the ant brain will be correlated with behavioral\r\nchanges. Together, these techniques will help to understand how a small\r\nbrain with a limited number of nerve cells can yet generate the behavioral\r\nplasticity required for the survival of the colony.\r\n\r\n\tAnts have to cope with the same general problems and physical constraints as larger animals and humans. Their brains function by the same\r\nprinciples and their nerve cells rely on the same cellular mechanisms and\r\nnetwork properties. Unlike vertebrates including humans, where populations\r\nof thousands or millions of nerve cells control each small behavioral\r\ncomponent, in ants much fewer cells orchestrate the behavior. Hence the\r\neffect of a single nerve cell's activity on behavioral changes is much\r\nstronger and can be studied much more directly in ants than in larger\r\nanimals. This and their complex behavior and high learning capacities makes\r\nthe ants particularly well suited as model systems for research on brain\r\nplasticity. Studying the changes that occur in the brains of ants that\r\nlearn a simple task may help us to better understand how our own brains\r\nacquire new capabilities and optimize our behavioral output.\r\n\r\n",
