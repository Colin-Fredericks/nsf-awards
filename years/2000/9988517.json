 "awd_abstract_narration": "The amount of work required to keep software artifacts consistent contributes significantly to the time and costs of a software project.  In particular, it is difficult to share and integrate information between artifacts due to the bewildering number of tools and data formats used to create and maintain them. This project performs basic research on the issue of information integration to enable development of techniques and mechanisms that reduce the time and costs associated with performing this task in large-scale software development projects. The chosen approach develops an environment that provides first-class support for information integration. New experimental XML-based data formats are designed to facilitate integration. An environment of generators and translators are designed and developed to translate information into the new data formats, making that information available for integration. New hypermedia services are developed to capture and specify artifact relationships. Finally, infrastructure for addressing these issues in heterogeneous software development environments, where multiple organizations may be involved in a software development project, are designed and experimentally prototyped.\r\n\r\n",
