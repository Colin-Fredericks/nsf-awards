 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid growth in the number of experimentally determined protein structures has accentuated\r\nthe need for theoretical and computational methods that can make this data useful. The proposed\r\nresearch aims to provide tools for important applications in computational molecular biology, such\r\nas protein engineering and structure-based drug design, as well as scientific explorations of\r\nstructure-function relationships. This goal can be achieved through the ability to predict the\r\nconformational changes that occur when proteins and ligands interact. Protein engineering to alter\r\nenzyme specificity or to enhance stability under adverse conditions can also benefit from a\r\npredictive understanding of the motions involved in protein folding, unfolding, and catalysis. An\r\nattack on this wide range of challenging problems requires algorithmic breakthroughs, enormous\r\ncomputing power, and powerful techniques for visualization.\r\n\r\nComputational molecular biology uses information at the atomic level to study biologically\r\nrelevant phenomena. Interpolating from the behavior of individual atoms to the collective behavior\r\nof complex biological molecules such as proteins presents a significant theoretical and\r\ncomputational challenge. Unfortunately, the available computational methods to study protein\r\ndynamics over long ranges of time are far from satisfactory due to a number of severe difficulties,\r\nincluding: (1) The time scales involved in theoretical/computational prediction span an enormous\r\nrange: about fifteen orders of magnitude. (2) The conformation space of relevant protein shapes has\r\nvery large dimension (> 10000) and the corresponding energy functions are quite jagged, making\r\ncalculations expensive and difficult. (3) Algorithms for comparing/manipulating molecular shape\r\nare expensive in terms of both implementation difficulty and computational time.\r\n\r\nTo resolve these difficulties the investigators are applying a variety of ideas centered on the\r\ntheme of multiscaling: for time scales, for energy landscapes, and for measuring structural\r\nsimilarity at different levels of resolution. Algorithm development in the proposed area requires a\r\nunique blend of interdisciplinary expertise that is found within this team of investigators. The team\r\nincludes a theoretical chemist who is an expert in protein dynamics, a theoretical physicist who is an\r\nexpert in molecular biology and biophysics, and three computer scientists who bring expertise in\r\ngeometric and combinatorial algorithms at both theoretical and experimental levels. This combined\r\nexpertise is reinforced by a supportive interdisciplinary environment and excellent parallel\r\ncomputing resources.\r\n\r\nThis research has three primary goals: (1) to broaden the range of time-scales for which\r\nmeaningful Molecular Dynamics simulations of proteins are possible; (2) to improve our\r\nunderstanding of protein conformation space and the associated energy functions through the use\r\nof hierarchical multiscaling techniques; and (3) to enable the processing of proteins-as-shapes to\r\nproceed as easily as proteins are now processed as strings (over the 20-symbol alphabet of amino\r\nacids). Advances in these areas will significantly improve protein understanding, allowing\r\ncomputational experiments involving protein dynamics over wide ranges of time. Such improved\r\ncomputational abilities can potentially lead to important advances in the understanding of biology\r\nand the design of medicinal drugs.",
