 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe major issues to be addressed by the life scientists of the 21st Century will\r\nrequire both the admixture of life science disciplines that have traditionally been separate\r\nand the inclusion of disciplines that have traditionally fallen outside the life sciences.\r\nAchieving these goals is largely a matter of social engineering: getting isolated scientists\r\nto interact with one another, shifting the training of pre-and post-doctoral students from\r\nan oligodisciplinary to a multidisciplinary mode,instituting mechanisms for the sharing\r\nof scientific resources, forming interactive scientific communities around major topics or\r\nproblems,and so on. For some key communities, this social engineering is already well\r\nunderway,but for others it is not. For this reason we propose a series of 'incubation\r\nactivities' for a potential community we will name 'evolutionary and ecological functional\r\ngenomics'(EEFG). The proposed incubation activities have two main goals:\r\n1. Physical coalescence of this potential community\r\n2. Strategic planning by this community,which will identify its scientific,\r\nprogrammatic, and educational goals; and formulate workable structures for achieving\r\nongoing interaction and attaining these goals.\r\nThe two goals of the incubation activities would be achieved first by a\r\nplanning/organizational meeting to be held at the National Science Foundation, and then\r\nby a series of outreach meetings that would be embedded in the annual meetings of\r\nexisting scientific societies on an international scale.\r\n\r\n",
