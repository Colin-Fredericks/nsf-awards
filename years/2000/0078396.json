Specifically, Stone seeks training in crop biotechnology, a first step in a larger agenda for cross-cultural research on genetically modified crops (GM crops). Genetically modified crops are becoming an important component of crop regimes not only in the industrialized countries, but also in the developing world. Anthropologists are seeking to make contributions to various debates about GM crops, specifically concerning the social and political implications and ramifications of these new crops and their agricultural sustainability. The PI is a specialist in agriculture who seeks to gain invaluable training in the biological aspects of GM crops. He will undertake a traineeship and do directed readings at the International Laboratory for Tropical Agricultural Biotechnology at the University of Missouri, as well as work with Professor Ralph Quatrano, Chairman of the Dept. of Biology, Washington University.\r\n\r\n",
