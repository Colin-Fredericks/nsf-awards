 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric methods in the theory of automorphic forms.\r\n\t\tAbstract.\r\n\r\nThis proposal consists of 2 parts. In the first (and main) part\r\nwe introduce certain functions on the set of\r\nisomorphism classes of irreducible representations of a reductive\r\ngroup over a local field. We call them gamma-functions. The existence\r\nof such functions is a corollary of the local Langlands conjecture.\r\nWe formulate some conjectures about explicit construction of these\r\ngamma-functions and explain how they can be applied to study the\r\nproblem of Langlands lifting itself (both locally and globally).\r\nIn the second part we suggest how to generalize the results of\r\nauthor's joint paper with D.Gaitsgory entitled \"Geometric\r\nEisenstein series\". In particular we plan to study intersection\r\ncohomology sheaves on parabolic Drinfelds' spaces and also generalize\r\nour previous results to the case of tamely ramified Eisenstein series. \r\n\r\nThis proposal is in the part of mathematics known as the Langlands program.\r\nThe Langlands program is part of number theory. Number theory is the study\r\nof the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of\r\nmathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have furnished a\r\ndriving force in creating new mathematics in other  diverse parts of the\r\ndiscipline. The Langlands program is a  general philosophy that connects\r\nnumber theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the study\r\nof whole numbers. One aspect of this proposal is to explore the\r\napplications of geometric techniques within the Langlands program.\r\n\r\n",
