The ion transporter protein plays an important role in salt reabsorption and secretion in kidney.  It also functions in control of cell volume in many types of cells.  Brain cells, particularly neurons (nerve cells), express an abundant level of the ion transporter protein.  However, little is known why nerve cells express the ion transporter protein and what its function is.  The objectives of this project are to study whether the ion transporter protein regulates nerve cell Cl- concentration, and whether the ion transporter is involved in control of nerve cell volume.  Moreover, we want to understand how the ion transporter activity is controlled in nerve cells. \r\nThe cellular ion homeostasis (balance) in the brain is a general prerequisite for adequate neuronal function.  Disturbance of ion homeostasis would lead to cessation of functional activity of nerve cells.  In addition, nerve cell volume needs to be tightly regulated because of a restrict volume of the skull. Therefore, it is important to understand whether the ion transporter contributes to control ion homeostasis and cell volume in brain.  The results of this project will significantly enhance our knowledge about the role of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter in nerve cells and may provide insights to understand causes of the breakdown of ion homeostasis under pathological conditions, such as epilepsy (brain seizure) and brain edema (swelling).\r\n",
