 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the creation of a common core facility for DNA sequence analysis at the University of Wisconsin.  The main component of this facility is a state of the art instrument for determining the sequences of the nucleotide bases in the DNA or RNA genetic material for any organism.  The participating faculty are involved in a broad range of research projects related to biodiversity and biotechnology.  The main projects include: sequencing and mutational analysis of insect and mammalian poxvirus genomes; analysis of genes involved in the photosynthetic pathways of cyanobacteria and green algae; and charting the evolutionary history of parasites and fungi.  These projects will identify countless new genes and greatly expand the understanding of genome organization.  It is anticipated that the new sequences will inc rease our understanding of evolutionary relationships, and the development of new products in biotechnology such as improved plant factories.  \r\n\r\n     The following equipment will become part of the new core:  a LI-COR 4200S-2 Gene ReadIR DNA sequencing system, a MJ Research PTC-0200 DNA engine thermocycler, and two G4/450 Power Macintosh computers for DNA analysis.\r\n\r\n     The shared facility is aimed to foster the integration of education and research. The centralization of sequencing operations will enhance existing interactions among a number of research groups and will be vital in attracting new faculty and students to pursue degrees in the sciences.  It will promote collaborations with other institutions within the community.  Aside from individual research programs, several faculty members will develop laboratory exercises using this instrumentation to provide training for undergraduate and M.S. students by incorporating genomics training into such courses as the Biotechnology laboratory course, a Systematic Biology course, and the Combined Immunology/Virology laboratory course. \r\n",
