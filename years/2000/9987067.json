 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (31), (21), (59) The college is establishing a scholarship program for 40 of its students per semester majoring in the computer science, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics fields.  The program consists of three major components:\r\n1.\tRecruitment with an emphasis on those populations typically underrepresented in CSEM career fields. Current pre-college programs in the college's service area have already identified a significant number of potential students from these underrepresented groups.\r\n2.\tAcademic support to provide program participants the tools necessary to succeed at the college as well as those tools necessary to seek, obtain, and retain a career in a computer science, engineering and mathematics field.\r\n3.    A retention program which relies heavily on the positive impact mentors have.\r\n     Students desiring entrance in the CSEM Scholarship program must demonstrate that they are financially disadvantaged, but academically prepared for the rigorous curriculums in the CSEM area.  Upon graduation, the employment status of each individual in the CSEM program is monitored for at least six months to determine the numbers and percentages of CSEM students who find employment in their career field or who transfer on to a four year college or university.\r\n\r\n",
