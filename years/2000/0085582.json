 "awd_abstract_narration": "0085582\r\nNomanbhoy\r\n\r\nSeismic data recorded at PEPP (Princeton Earth Physics Project) seismograph stations in Colorado and existing seismology resources on the World Wide Web will be used to meet the Colorado Model Content Standards in earth sciences for grades 9 to 12.  Teachers will be trained in both content and use of curricular materials so that they can use real-time seismic data to engage students in real world research.  The training will enable teachers and students to access seismic data from the Internet and to use those data to solve real problems in seismology.  This will provide teachers with the opportunity to experience a hands-on, project-based approach to learning science before implementing this approach in their classroom.  The training will be done in collaboration with the Center for Science, Math and Technology (CSMATE) at Colorado State University.  During the first phase the PIs will: (a) visit each PEPP seismograph station in Colorado to ensure that the seismometers are running and data are being archived; (b) prepare the seismic data collected at local PEPP seismograph stations for dissemination by the Internet; (c) research the Internet for appropriate seismology resources and activities for classroom use; (d) design a website that will act as a gateway for teachers to access the seismic data, activities, and support from team members; (e) train a small group of teachers in summer 2000 to use the seismic data so that they can in turn act as trainers during a weeklong teacher-training workshop during the following summer; and (f) design and begin implementation of an evaluation plan and initiate organization and recruiting for the teacher-training workshop.  During the second phase they will: (a) train 45 more teachers to use these resources during a weeklong workshop at Colorado State University; (b) provide follow-up through on-site visits by a project team member; (c) complete assessments and finalize evaluation of the project; (d) disseminate project outcomes through the Internet, presentations at conferences, publications in journals and newsletters, and contributions to the Digital Library for Earth Science Education (DLESE).  The on-site visits will serve two purposes: (1) to assist teachers in the transition from the workshop laboratory to their own working environment, and (2) to ensure that all hardware, software and resources are readily available and functioning in the participant's schools.  There will be two lasting outcomes of this project.  First, the PIs will establish and maintain a web site at the Colorado Geological Survey for archiving PEPP data, posting instructional materials, and providing on-line support for teachers.  Second, they will have provided up to 48 teachers (who teach at least 5000 students) with the content knowledge, confidence, and instructional materials they need to teach earth science content through active research, using real quantitative data and interacting with scientists through the Internet.  With the focus on web-based activities and dissemination through DLESE, the project has the potential to serve a far larger, essentially global audience.\r\n",
