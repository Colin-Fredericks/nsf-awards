The tests will be carried out during the course of the currently scheduled November,1999, dives involving the deep sea submersible, Alvin, at the 9 Degree North site on the East Pacific Rise.  The expedition plans to shoot approximately 20,000 feet of 15 perforation, 70 mm film resulting in approximately 10 to 20 minutes of footage.  The objectives of this research are to confirm the feasibility of lighting and filming the deep sea volcanic vents in the large film format from Alvin, and to develop and optimize the deep water, large-format filming capabilities of Alvin.\r\n\r\nThe research effort is proposed on behalf of a consortium of US based organizations now forming for the production of a 40-minute, large format film, Volcanoes of the Abyss.\r\n\r\nKey production personnel involved in this research will be:  Stephen Low, Director/Producer; Pietro L. Serapiglia, Producer; William W. Reeve, Camera Specialist; and Alexander Low, Project Manager.  Scientists working with the production crew in this phase are:  Richard A. Lutz, biologist from Rutgers University; Fred Grassle, Director, Institute of Marine & Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University; Dave Gallo, Director, Special Projects, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; and Emory Kristof, Deep Sea Imaging Specialist, National Geographic Society.\r\n",
