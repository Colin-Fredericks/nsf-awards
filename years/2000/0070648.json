 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis mathematical research focuses on problems for nonlinear\r\nequations of Monge-Ampere type and also for homogenization of\r\nlinear and nonlinear equations. For Monge-Ampere type equations,\r\nthe problems concentrate on the study of geometric properties of\r\ntheir solutions and regularity. In particular, a question proposed\r\nis to establish Holder regularity of derivatives of generalized\r\nsolutions for an equation that appears in geometric optics for the\r\nsynthesis of reflector antennas. The methodology that will be used\r\nto solve this set of problems is using appropriate maximum\r\nprinciples, localization and nonlinear variants of the\r\nCalderon-Zygmund decomposition. Concerning homogenization, we\r\ndeveloped an abstract scheme that yields convergence in $L^p$\r\nspaces of correctors for a large class of equations and\r\nsystems. We propose to investigate the validity of results of the\r\nsame nature for problems of homogenization in perforated domains.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mathematical research is in the field of partial differential\r\nequations, linear and nonlinear. These equations are the principal\r\nclassical tool of the applications of mathematics to the physical\r\nworld. The project has a strong connection with Harmonic Analysis\r\nin Euclidean space, a subject that has flourished during the\r\nsecond half of the twentieth century and that has become an\r\nindispensable tool to provide qualitative and quantitative\r\ninformation about the solutions of partial differential equations.\r\nThe problems proposed in the first part are motivated from the\r\nengineering problem of construction of reflector antennas. The\r\nsecond part of the project is related with the description of the\r\nbehavior of transmission of heat or electricity in materials with\r\nperiodic structure such us polymers, crystals and layered media.\r\nIn particular, we are interested in obtaining accurate\r\napproximations of the solutions that describe these phenomena.\r\n",
