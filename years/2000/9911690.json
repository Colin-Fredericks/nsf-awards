 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Ann Stahl and her collaborators will continue a program of archaeological research in the Banda region of Ghana. While anthropologists have generally conceptualized such rural regions as relatively self contained units, largely understandable through examination of local context, it has become increasingly clear that changes on broader regional and international levels have direct affects on daily life and social organization. In her past work, Dr. Stahl has focused on two village sites which span the period from ca. 1,300 to 1825 AD and related changes in pattern to larger external factors. During this ca. 500 year span, the region was affected first by trans-Saharan trade, then incorporation into the larger Asante empire and finally contact with British colonialists. Changes in settlement pattern, village abandonment, centralization and control of craft production, subsistence and exchange all show the influence of this broader political and economic context. Dr. Stahl and her team will conduct additional work at one previously tested site to increase artifact sample sizes and then excavate at a number of previously identified locales to establish a broader regional picture. She wishes to determine whether chronological patterns observed to date reflect a broader pattern. A range of standard and specialized laboratory analyses will be conducted. Ceramics will be studied macroscopically to refine the chronological sequence and also at a trace element level to match finished product with clay source to determine patterns of manufacture and trade. Metallurgical analysis will permit reconstruction of both copper and iron smelting techniques while a range of faunal and floral analyses will provide insight into changing subsistence practice.\r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to understanding of social development and change in West Africa. Equally important, it will help to develop methodologies which integrate ethnographic, archaeological and textual data  and facilitate understanding of how regional and extra-regional forces combine to affect change in traditional rural societies.\r\n",
