 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research described in this proposal is on a class of linear and nonlinear \r\npartial differential equations (PDE)which share the property that they can be \r\nwritten in the form of a Hamiltonian system with infinitely many degrees of \r\nfreedom. Principal examples include nonlinear wave equations, nonlinear \r\nSchroedinger equations and Euler's equations for water waves.  The analogy \r\nwith dynamical systems motivates a number of basic questions. (1) The \r\nexistence of invariant tori for the nonlinear partial differential equations \r\ninvolves extensions of KAM theory to infinite dimensional settings. \r\nImplications of these results include the existence of solutions of nonlinear \r\nevolution equations which exist for all time and are recurrent. Techniques \r\nthat have been developed for PDE also have bearing on several open problems in \r\nclassical dynamical systems concerning the persistence of resonant tori. \r\n(2) A normal forms transformation of a Hamiltonian PDE gives details of its \r\nessential nonlinearities, and it has applications to Nekhoroshev stability \r\nresults and to a proof of the Arnold condition of genuine nonlinearity. \r\n(3) Starting from a normal forms transformation, long time existence results \r\nfor nonlinear PDE are important in a mathematically rigorous analysis of the \r\nclassical asymptotic regimes of mathematical physics. In addition the proposer \r\nwill address a number of related questions in the theory of PDE. (4) Estimates \r\nof dispersive smoothing for linear and nonlinear Schroeinger equations depend \r\nupon the scattering properties of bicharacteristics, and estimates of this \r\nform play a role in the study of the initial value problem for data of low \r\nsmoothness. (5) The classical problems of standing waves in two dimensional \r\nwater waves and traveling waves in three dimensional water waves are instances \r\nof problems in PDE which exhibit small divisors, and analytic results involve \r\ndelicate questions of convergence. \r\n\r\n     Celestial mechanics, the problem of describing the motion of planetary \r\nbodies, has always intrigued mathematicians and motivated their discoveries. \r\nAt the beginning of this century, the French mathematician H. Poincar' and his \r\nAmerican contemporaries G.D. Birkhoff and G.W. Hill, essentially revolutionized\r\nthe subject with their work, bringing it conceptual clarity and introducing \r\npowerful new analytic techniques. This work gave rise to a new paradigm in its \r\nfield, and contributed to the birth of many modern branches of mathematics. An \r\nimportant question was and remains the n-body problem; the problem of stability\r\nof the motion of n planets in their mutual gravitational attraction. Indeed in \r\nthe 1960's, 50 years after the death of Poincar'e, the development of a theory \r\nby three mathematicians, A.N. Kolmogorov, V.I. Arnold and J. Moser (it is now \r\ncalled KAM theory) made a significant contribution to the field. At the time of\r\nits development there were physical applications to the stability of high \r\nenergy particles in a cyclotron, as well as to the classical questions of the \r\nstability of our solar system or to other important systems in mechanics. The \r\nequations which describe the motion of n bodies are examples of ordinary \r\ndifferential equations. It was a question at the time of the development of \r\nKAM theory whether such stability results could be extended to partial \r\ndifferential equations. These describe the evolution in time of a continuous \r\nmedium such as a fluid, a gas, and electromagnetic field or an elastic solid. \r\nThe analogy between mechanics and the motion of a continuum is mathematically \r\nquite elegant. However the n-body problem is a finite dimensional one, while \r\nproblems of partial differential equations viewed with this analogy in mind \r\nare inherently infinite dimensional, and this summarizes the essential \r\nmathematical difficulty of extending the methods. The principal content of \r\nthis research program is the extension of some aspects of the analytic \r\ntechniques of Hamiltonian mechanics to physically important partial \r\ndifferential equations. These results will have some significant consequences \r\nin a variety of diverse physical applications, including the study of ocean \r\nwaves, the propagation of signal pulses in optical fibers, and in the \r\n",
