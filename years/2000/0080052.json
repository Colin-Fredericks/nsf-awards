 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Africa Materials Workshop, an international workshop on materials\r\nResearch, education, and technology, is being planned for August 6-9, 2000 in Pretoria,\r\nSouth Africa.  This workshop will be the fifth in a series involved NAFTA countries\r\n(1995), European countries (1996), Pan-American countries (1998), and Asian Pacific\r\ncountries (1998).  All of these workshops shared the common goal of fostering greater\r\ninternational cooperation and collaboration in materials research, technology, and\r\neducation.  Participants in these workshops have expressed the desire to establish a \r\nMaterials World Net, which would link materials scientists and engineers around the \r\nworld by providing them with access to comprehensive databases and data warehouses.\r\nThe workshop program will focus on discussions of topics already selected by the \r\nOrganizers from the participating countries.  These topics are Education and Training,\r\nCivil Infrastructural Materials, Materials Value-Chain, Advanced and Emerging\r\nMaterials, and Application of Polymers and Composites.  The goal of the workshop is to \r\nEnhance international collaboration in materials research, technology, and education \r\nBetween US and Africa.\r\n%%%\r\nA potential outcome of the proposed US Africa Materials Workshop, is the \r\nContinued pursuit of the goal of creating this Materials World Net to foster greater\r\nCooperation and collaboration in the field of materials research, education, and\r\nTechnology worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Africa Materials Workshop is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Mathematical \r\nand Physical Sciences, The Directorate for Engineering and the International Division of the\r\nDirectorate for Social and Behavioral Sciences.\r\n***\r\n",
