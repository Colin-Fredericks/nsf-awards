These equations are the laws of \r\nmotion of their respective physics. The turbulent nature and/or defects in \r\nthe materials make the solutions of the equations singular, unstable, and \r\nhard to calculate.  It is planned to use advanced analytical tools to study \r\nthe structures of the singular solutions. In the case of the liquid crystal \r\nwave equation, for example, the plan is to study it as one of the simplest \r\nexamples of nonlinear generalizations of the basic linear wave equation. It \r\ncan be seen from its elegant form that there will be many applications of \r\nthe equation in the future. Singularities of its solutions have been shown to \r\nexist recently by the principal investigator and his collaborators. It is these \r\nsingularities that block the establishment of a general theory of existence, \r\nuniqueness, and stability of solutions. It is planned to do detailed estimates \r\nand analysis on the singularities and improve current compactness \r\narguments to form an existence theory of solutions. The result of the \r\ninvestigation will be a clear understanding of the worst possible solutions, \r\nand thereby quantify our knowledge of the physics and offer guidance in \r\nnumerical computations of general solutions.\r\n\r\nThe research will involve the study of some applied mathematical \r\nproblems in the fields of fluid dynamics (which includes motion of the air \r\nand water) and liquid crystal physics in material science.  Scientists and \r\nengineers have used mathematical equations, called partial differential \r\nequations, to model the motions. The turbulent nature and/or defects in the \r\nmaterials show up in the form of singularities and instabilities in the \r\nsolutions of the equations. It is these singularities and instabilities that \r\noften spoil accurate numerical computations of the solutions. It is planned \r\nto use the state of the art analytical tools to study the structures of the \r\nsingular solutions.  In the case of a compressible gas such as air, for \r\nexample, the principal investigator plans to isolate typical singularities \r\n(hurricanes, tornadoes, shocks, etc.) and investigate their individual \r\nstructures. The result of the investigation will be a clear understanding of \r\nthe worst possible solutions, and thereby quantify our knowledge of the \r\nphysics and offer guidance in high-performance numerical computations \r\nof general solutions.\r\n",
