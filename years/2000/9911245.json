 "awd_abstract_narration": "Likelihood judgment plays a critical role in decisions that are made in\r\nalmost all of life's domains.  Often, people must judge the likelihood of\r\none event when more than one alternative event is known to be possible\r\n(e.g., the likelihood that a patient has condition A rather than condition\r\nB, C, or D; the likelihood that a contract for a construction project will\r\nbe awarded to bidder F rather than G or H; the likelihood that a friend is\r\narriving on airline K rather than M or L).  The proposed research will\r\nexamine fundamental processes underlying such likelihood judgments.  Recent\r\nresearch by the primary investigator suggests that judgments of likelihood\r\nare often mediated by a distinct comparison heuristic; such judgments are\r\nlargely dependent upon a comparison between the strength of the evidence\r\nfor the focal event and the strongest alternative event, rather than a\r\nweighing of the evidence for the focal event versus the aggregate of the\r\nevidence for all alternative events.  The comparison heuristic is very\r\nefficient and generally produces reasonable judgments of likelihood.\r\nHowever, the heuristic can also underlie patterns of perceived likelihood\r\nthat are not consistent with the normative dictates of standard probability\r\ntheory.  Nine experiments will investigate the nature, strength, and scope\r\nof the comparison heuristic.  They will also examine how task conditions\r\nthat vary under everyday judgment situations--time pressure, the type of\r\nresponse being solicited, and the quantifiability of the available\r\nevidence--influence likelihood judgments.  The experiments will involve a\r\nwide range of paradigms and judgment types.  Various methodological tools\r\n(e.g., manipulations to the distributions of alternative outcomes, process\r\ntracing) will allow for an assessment of the relative influence of\r\ndeliberative versus heuristic processes within manipulated conditions of\r\nthe experiments.  This research should substantially advance the\r\nunderstanding of processes mediating judgments of likelihood as well as\r\nenhance researchers' abilities to predict judgments (and decisions and\r\nbehaviors) that are based on perceptions of focal events that have multiple\r\nalternatives.\r\n",
