The participants will come from four universities in the U.S. and include at least three women.  The students will participate in a special symposium on the conservation and ecology of seabirds of the southern oceans.  The topic is very timely and important. Long-lived seabirds such as albatrosses and petrels in these oceans have been impacted by human activities, such as long-line fishing, tourism, oil spills, introduction of non-indigenous disease, etc.  The symposium will provide a unique educational opportunity for these students to learn from and interact with well-respected experts in the biology and ecology of seabirds.  This symposium  will also provide the students with first-hand knowledge of the importance of international collaborations in science and may lead to future collaborations. \r\n",
