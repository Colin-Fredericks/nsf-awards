 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore a unique and ingenious use of solder to 'self-assemble' two-dimensional surface micromachined Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) structures into useful three-dimensional structures.  With this combined joining and assembly approach, surface tension forces in molten solder serve to assemble 3D MEMS structures.  A number of promising commercial applications have been identified. Most promising of these applications involves MEMS corner cube reflectors for communication and identification.  Current work on MEMS solder self-assembly has yet to provide the level of understanding needed to fully define the capabilities and limitations of the process.  Further studies of the fundamental issues are needed to understand these capabilities and limitations so that the process can be made commercially viable.  Key research personnel from industry and education and state-of-the-art equipment are in place. This project will develop the solder self-assembly process and contribute to engineering knowledge by answering the following questions:\r\n What are the performance limits of MEMS solder self-assembly?\r\n What are the commercial applications within these limits?\r\n",
