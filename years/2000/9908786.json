 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Girls Research Opportunities in Computing (Girls R.O.C.) project exposes girls, especially those from rural schools and minorities, to career opportunities in computer science.  Girls R.O.C. is targeted at girls while their interest in computers is high and their enthusiasm can be encouraged through female role models, a non-competitive environment, group research, evening speakers, and field trips.  In this project, middle-school girls are involved in a variety of classroom and hands-on activities that will expose them to ways that computers are used in research, business, and the home.  \r\n     The project consists of two three-week summer sessions with three follow-up campus visits during the following school year to continue research projects.  Twenty-four girls will participate in each summer session for a total of 48 participants.  Recruitment is limited to a 50-mile radius of  Northern Louisiana University in order to make follow-up visits feasible.  Each participant will be required to enter her research project in a local science fair.\r\n     The project is led by three female project directors with the assistance of six female undergraduate computer science majors.  The participants and the undergraduate assistants will live on campus during the three-week sessions. \r\n",
