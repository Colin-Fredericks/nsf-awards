The funds will be used to support a planning visit by the three PIs and one graduate student.\r\n\r\nConsumption of contaminated fish is a public health concern because fish are known conduits of exposure to contaminants such as PCB's and mercury by humans and wildlife.  Fish accumulate contaminants over their lifetime, so their body burdens build up to levels significantly greater than those in the water. A mechanistic understanding of movement through the food chain in aquatic food webs is lacking for most contaminants but is urgently needed to predict the types of lakes and food webs that present the greatest risk to humans via fish consumption. Through this collaboration with China, there will be opportunities to combine interests and expertise to try to better understand the potential for human exposure to contaminants via the aquatic \r\nfood chain.",
