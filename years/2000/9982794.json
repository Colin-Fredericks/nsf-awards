 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds for a symposium on Marine Plant-Animal Interactions to be held at the Society for Intregrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) meetings in Atlanta, Georgia from January 4-8, 2000.  Plant-animal interactions are fundemental importance to all areas and subdisciplines in Ecology.  They have been a rich area of study and the focus on many innovative areas of research in terrestrial systems.  Although many areas of research that have been used by terrestrial scientists are appropriate for marine systems, there are other areas of research that are uniquely marine because the marine environment is physically different from the terrestrial environment and because differenttypes of organisms inhabit it.  Therefore, some questions are more amenable or difficult to answer in marine systems than terrestrial systems, and often the types of research approaches appropriate to marine systems differ from research approaches in    terrestrial systems.                                                                                                                                                  The PIs goals are to use this symposium to provide a platform that will focus attention on new, innovative areas of marine plant-animal research that will carry the PIs into the next century.  The PIs propose to have researches who have worked from both the prespectives of the plants and the animals put forward new ideas and proposed directions for future study that are ripe for development.  In addition, the PIs will include areas of ecological dynamics, where process based questions are most often studied.  The researchers who will contribute to this symposium include a mix of older, established scientists whose works are viewed as classic in the field, and younger scientist who have already demonstrated the ability to take the field into innovative new directions.  This symposium will help to a rejuvenation of the field of marine plant-animal interactions and provide a path for new research into the next century.",
