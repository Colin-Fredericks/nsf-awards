The major aspect of the upgrade is to acquire a state of the art spectroscopy platform which integrates data acquisition and reduction into a single computer system.  In addition, a Ge semi-conductor will be acquired as well as improvements to the sample preparation facilities.  The facility is supervised by Professor F.A. Frey and Dr. P. Ila.  It is principally used to determine abundances of trace elements in volcanic and mantle rocks.  Specifically gamma ray spectroscopy following neutron irradiation in the MIT Nuclear Reactor is used to determine abundances of 10 to 25 elements in 0.1 to 0.5 grams of powdered rock.  This facility is used by MIT undergraduates and graduate students in the MIT and joint MIT-WHOI programs as well as researchers from other universities in the northeast U.S. (e.g., University of Massachusetts at Amherst).  Two ongoing major projects are: (1) Studies of lavas recovered by the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project whose goal is to sample the entire growth and evolution of a Hawaiian volcano; and (2) studies of lavas related to the 115 Million year volcanic history of the Kerguelen plume in the eastern Indian Ocean.  This project includes geochemical research on igneous rocks recovered from the Kerguelen Plateau by Ocean Drilling Program Leg 183 and basalts from the Kerguelen Archipelago obtained in a collaborative effort involving scientists from the USA, France and Belgium. \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
