The conferences also facilitate important productive communication between engineers and clinicians that stimulates relevant research and development. Participants have found the meetings to be particularly helpful because of the manageable size, and the commonality of interests of attendees which fosters interpersonal interaction outside the formal sessions. For these reasons, Computers in Cardiology has proven to be a major world forum for presentation of new research over a wide spectrum of computer applications in cardiology. The conference has been the prime site for gestation and early nourishment of a number of fundamental technologies that have led to major improvements in the practice of cardiology. \r\n\r\nThe Proceedings of the conference is to be published by the IEEE press and copies distributed to the attendees and a number of libraries. \r\n",
