 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides academically and financially qualified students majoring in mathematics or computer science with the financial assistance to complete their studies in a timely manner. The project has three objectives: to provide financial opportunities to enable qualified students to pursue a baccalaureate degree in computer science or mathematics to complete their education in a timely manner; to increase the number of graduates who find immediate employment in their field of study; and to increase the number of students who, upon graduation, seek a higher degree in mathematics and computer science. Junior, senior, and graduate students who meet the criteria both academically and financially have the opportunity to apply for the scholarships. The selected students are assured of cooperative positions during the school year and summer employment at companies with which the department has collaborative agreements. Upon graduation, scholarship recipients are expected to be employed in positions in their majors or to be admitted into a graduate program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
