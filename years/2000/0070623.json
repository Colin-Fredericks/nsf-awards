 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is concerned with the investigation of certain classes \r\nof nonlinear partial differential and integral equations, and\r\nrelated weighted norm inequalities. A systematic use will be made of \r\nfunction spaces intrinsically connected with the problems involved, dyadic \r\nlinear and nonlinear models, nonlinear potential theory, quasimetrics on \r\nspaces of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous type (without the doubling \r\nproperty), and other means of modern analysis. The main goal is to \r\ncharacterize completely the solvability problem (i.e., find necessary and \r\nmatching sufficient conditions), and obtain sharp estimates for solutions of \r\nnonlinear elliptic and parabolic\r\nPDEs with very general coefficients at the lower order terms and data, as \r\nwell as for nonlinear integral operators with general kernels.\r\nLinear problems for operators of Schrodinger type with general potentials \r\n(possibly complex valued distributions) will be considered as well. A good \r\ncontrol of the constants involved is an essential part of this study. In \r\nparticular, a special attention will be paid to best constant inequalities \r\nwhich appear in related problems of harmonic analysis and operator theory.\r\n\r\nMany questions considered in the proposed research are motivated by\r\nstudies in mathematical physics, control theory, and stochastic processes. \r\nAs a result, sharp inequalities and criteria of solvability will be found \r\nfor equations and operators which describe important phenomena with linear \r\nand nonlinear sources appearing in quantum physics, fluid flow, heat \r\ntransfer, and electromagnetism problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
