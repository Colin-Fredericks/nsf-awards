Virtually every branch of mathematics,\r\nfrom algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry to applied analysis,\r\nFourier analysis, and computer science, has its corpus of theory arising \r\nfrom the study of polynomials. This project intends to study polynomial  \r\ninequalities and their applications in classical analysis, approximation \r\ntheory, orthogonal polynomials, and number theory. The proposed research \r\nis about polynomials in a general sense, so it includes Chebyshev spaces, \r\nMarkov spaces, Descartes systems, Muntz polynomials, rational function \r\nspaces, as well as polynomials with various constraints such as restricted \r\nzeros, integer coefficients, and nonnegative coefficients in various bases.  \r\nThe project continues several years of successful work on a variety of \r\ntopics and describes various new directions.        \r\n\r\n   The polynomial is one of the most basic concepts of mathematics. Throughout\r\nhistory people have found problems concerning polynomials especially fascinating.  \r\nEach of the ``three famous problems'' in the ``Heroic Age'' dealt with zeros of \r\npolynomials: squaring the circle, duplicating the cube, and trisecting an  \r\nangle. Historically, questions relating to polynomials, for example, the solution\r\nof polynomial equations, gave rise to some of the most important problems of\r\nthe day. Besides the natural intellectual interest in them, polynomials, and in\r\nparticular extremal problems involving polynomials, arise not only in\r\nalmost every field of mathematics, but also in other sciences, especially \r\nin engineering. However, it is often the case that polynomials related to a practical \r\nproblem belong to a restricted class. Depending on the nature of the \r\nproblem, some additional pieces of information on the polynomial may be known. \r\nFor filter design, polynomials with coefficients from {-1,0,1} are very useful, \r\nbecause, if they are used, then the filter can be implemented without  \r\nthe use of multiplications; their implementation requires only additions \r\nand subtractions. This reduces the cost of implementation. The problem is \r\nto find such polynomials which have a ``lowpass'' behavior on the unit \r\ncircle of the complex plane. Roughly, that is, they approximate 1 in a \r\nneighborhood of 1 and approximate 0 in a neighborhood of -1. The project plans  \r\nto study extremal properties of polynomials with coefficients from {-1,0,1}\r\n{0,1}, and {-1,1}. Unimodular polynomials (when the coefficients are complex numbers \r\nof modulus 1) are also important in engineering. In some other problems related \r\nto physics, in particular electrostatics, information about the distribution of  \r\nthe zeros of the polynomial is known. ``Gaped'' polynomials (polynomials\r\nwith a large number of zero coefficients) are used to analyze, for example,\r\nthe time-optimal boundary controls for the one-dimensional heat equation. \r\nThe proposal intends to explore further applications of polynomial inequalities\r\nas well as to offer a systematic study of naturally arising questions regarding \r\npolynomials subject to various constraints.  \r\n\r\n",
