Ramdas and a graduate student from Purdue University in a collaboration with Harald Pascher of the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Bayreuth, Germany.  The collaboration studies the collective and localized excitations in the ternary and quaternary alloys of II-VI diluted magnetic semiconductors.  Experimental investigations involve spontaneous Raman scattering and coherent Stokes-Raman studies supplemented with modulation techniques, photoluminescence, and Fourier transform spectroscopy.  Magnetic interactions in the diluted magnetic semiconductors, controlled by the concentration of the magnetic ions or by the dimensionality in sub-micron quantum well structures manifest themselves in a spectacular manner in numerous phenomena, such as the Faraday and Voigt effect, Raman-electron paramagnetic resonance, and Raman-anti-ferromagnetic resonance.  This award adds a third year of research to a two-year award that has already produced significant results, several publications, and excellent experience for several Purdue graduate students.\r\n",
