We live in an increasingly technological society where the majority of discoveries that make life safer and more convenient result from work in the sciences. A foundational understanding of scientific processes and concepts is essential if citizens are to intelligently assess matters of scientific importance related to their health, the environment and other technological accomplishments with the propensity for great societal impact (i.e., reproductive research and cloning are just two examples). The goal of this project is to develop a core of four laboratory-based courses for non-science majors, which integrate themes common to the physical and natural sciences. Mathematics is being integrated into the courses and all of the courses have a discovery-based laboratory experience. Nine hundred and thirty-eight non-science majors, including 82 elementary education majors are taking these courses. The program's objectives are as follows: First, to adapt from model curricula developed elsewhere, an integrated set of four science content courses that are fulfilling the science requirements of the University's general education curriculum. Second, to develop a general science major that provides opportunities for direct application of science theory for students, particularly those majoring in elementary education. Finally, to develop an in-service program that provides opportunities for direct application of science theory for current elementary educators.\r\nFifteen members of the science faculty and eight members of the education faculty are participating in the development, implementation, and piloting of courses and laboratories. The program directors have also convened a steering committee comprised of science faculty and an advisory board comprised of local experts in science education that is assisting with the developing curricular model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
