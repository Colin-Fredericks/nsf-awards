The first \r\ntwo of these models (1-dimensional and 2-dimensional respectively) have \r\nbeen developed in the Flight Systems Research Center (FSRC) at UCLA \r\nin collaboration with NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, \r\nCA. The designing of the 3-dimensional model is in progress. Among the \r\nwing models existing in the extensive modern literature on aeroelasticity, \r\nthe aforementioned ones are most physically complete. In November \r\n1999, the 1-dimensional model was tested in a series of four flight \r\nexperiments at Edwards Airforce Base, CA. The experimental results are \r\nin excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of the model at \r\nleast for low - energy aeroelastic modes. Currently, the collaboration is \r\nsupported by NSF Grant DMS-9972748 (Interdisciplinary Grants in the \r\nMathematical Sciences). This grant provides the support for a one year \r\nvisit (Fall 1999 - Spring 2000) of the principal investigator to the Center in \r\norder to study in depth the engineering and physical principles of aircraft \r\nwing modeling and to continue work on the joint project with the \r\nresearchers of the Center. During recent years, the investigator's research \r\nhas been focused on two main directions: (a) spectral and asymptotic \r\nanalysis of non-self-adjoint operators in a Hilbert space, operators which \r\nare the dynamics generators of hyperbolic equations and systems \r\ncontaining damping terms and subject to dissipative boundary conditions; \r\n(b) applications of the results of this analysis to the control of distributed \r\nparameter systems governed by those equations and systems. The series of \r\nresults and methods, developed in this research, has now culminated in the \r\nwork on the aforementioned 1-dimensional model of a vibrating aircraft \r\nwing. Substantial progress has been made: the PI was able to obtain first in \r\nthe literature explicit asymptotic formulas for the high-frequency \r\naeroelastic modes and mode shapes. The objectives of this project include: \r\n(a) obtaining space-time domain representations for the solutions of the 1-\r\ndimensional model; (b) obtaining spectral asymptotics and representations \r\nfor the solutions of most recent 2-dimensional model; (c) applying \r\nasymptotic and spectral results to the flutter suppression problem; (d) \r\nparticipating in the designing of a 3-dimensional model of a wing and \r\nextending the above analysis to this model.\r\n\r\nThe present project can be considered as a theoretical part of the broad \r\nwing modeling project conducted by the researchers at the aforementioned \r\nCenters. The ultimate goal of the entire project is to give specific practical \r\nrecommendations to aircraft industry engineers working on flutter \r\nsuppression in aircraft wings and tails. Flutter is a dynamic instability \r\noccurring in an aircraft in flight at a specific speed which is called a flutter \r\nspeed. Damage inflicted by flutter results in significant cost to the aircraft \r\nindustry. The objective of this project is to carry out a rigorous \r\nmathematical analysis of the aircraft wing model and to apply the results \r\nof this analysis to the problem of flutter control. It has been recognized in \r\nthe engineering community that the results of such an analysis can provide \r\nnew insights which are not available from experiments or from numerical \r\nsimulations. In addition to the above technical objectives of the project, \r\nthe principal investigator is planning to develop a new graduate program \r\non mathematical methods in aircraft engineering for both mathematics and \r\nengineering students.\r\n",
