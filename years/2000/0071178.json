The Symposium has a unique focus:  the importance of supercritical fluids in meeting the challenges of sustainable development.  No previous meeting of this kind has been devoted exclusively to this important field.  In addition, the meeting will cut across many areas, and will bring together people from the separations, thermodynamics, analytical chemistry, environmental sciences, and process engineering communities.  Past Symposia were held in:  Nice (France) in 1988, Boston (USA) in 1991, Strasbourg  (Germany) in 1994, and Sendai (Japan) in 1997.  The Symposium will therefore return to the USA after nine years.  As mentioned above, the 2000 meeting, in keeping with the advent of the new millennium, will differ from previous meetings and will focus on challenges associated with sustainability and the environment.  It will also have a greater interdisciplinary focus, brining together engineers and scientists with diverse backgrounds but complementary interests.  Yet another innovation will be the inclusion of scientists working in analytical applications of the technology.   \r\n",
