 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Science  (61)  This new laboratory course in cell biology, part of the recently approved major in Cell Biology and Neuroscience, consists of three inter-related modules. The modules are designed to develop essential laboratory skills in cell biology, as well as more general skills emphasized in both the Rutgers University learning goals and the new curriculum, including critical thinking and problem solving. Participants acquire key skills in cell biology, including bacterial and mammalian cell culture, organelle isolation, recombinant DNA methodology and fluorescence microscopy.  Green fluorescent protein (GFP), the basic research material of the modules, provides a unifying theme throughout the course. After an introduction to cutting-edge methods in cell biology, undergraduate students undertake a guided research project.  They are prepared for this endeavor by reading assignments, discussion of research papers, and group meetings with guest faculties, who bring individual insights in their areas of expertise. From this experience, the students design and then complete the guided project, utilizing GFP as a research tool. Final reports are delivered orally, written up as if for publication, and revised versions published on the Internet. By participating in hypothesis-driven and inquiry-based laboratory projects, with communication skills linked to the course projects, students increase their ability to think logically, write clearly, and speak coherently.  The project adapts and implements, and is based on, a number of studies showing the need for and effective incorporation of research into undergraduate courses (Brown, 1988 and Kenny, 1998).  The modules described adapt and implement techniques outlined in research articles citing the ease of use of Green Fluorescent Protein as a marker and research tool (Misteli, 1997 and Conn, 1999).\r\n",
