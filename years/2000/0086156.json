The quality and quantity of the\r\nlearning experiences in science, mathematics and technology within and beyond the school\r\nwalls will be enhanced by professional development for teachers, adoption of effective\r\nstrategies, and promotion of parental and community involvement in the educational\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nAn advisory committe to the principal will provide input on program direction, objectives\r\nand activities, policy decisions and special requests by program participants.\r\nThe creation of fonnal \"personal professional growth\" plans for each individual teacher will \r\nbe initiated with plans that are reviewed and updated annually but extended forward for\r\na five-year period.  Professional development activities will be structured around cohorts \r\nteachers based on closely related job and interest factors that the teachers identify and \r\na regional professional development committee will be formed to make training programs\r\nself-determined by the area teachers.  Emphasis will be placed on making the school site\r\na place to learn for teachers and parents as well as students.\r\n\r\nAlternative assessment methods and implementation will be included as a component\r\nof the professional development for school administrators and teachers.  Staff will include\r\na local community member who will be employed to actively seek public and political support\r\nfor educational priorities within the reservation community, one educational professional in\r\nmathematics/physical sciences and one in biological sciences who will work with area K-14 \r\nteachers. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
