 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  In its recent call to arms in Shaping the Future, the National Science Foundation articulates the need to strengthen the pedagogical quality of introductory courses for all undergraduates by fostering active learning experiences, promoting collaborative learning, and increasing the inquiry-orientation of science education, facilitating student experience in the process of science.  With this in mind, the Department of Biological Sciences is adapting the BioQUEST \"3 Ps\" philosophy and elements of the University of Hartford's NSF-funded program to renovate its freshman biology experience to reappraise and redesign Quinnipiac's undergraduate biology curriculum while promoting learner-centered and inquiry-oriented principles. Both lecture and laboratories are undergoing major overhauls regarding content, pedagogy, and the integration of advanced educational technology.  The laboratory experience is being redesigned to center on problem-based learning, with special attention to fostering student-originated research and peer persuasion experiences (mini-conferences in which students present their research) that force students to grapple with epistemological issues, exposing students to the process of science experientially.  Lecture content is being revised to focus on an evolution theme, with emphasis on molecular and cellular biology, ecology, evolutionary mechanisms, phylogeny, and the history of life.  More importantly, the phenomenological approach to the course content (description of biological phenomena) is being complemented by inquiry-oriented content and learning-centered pedagogies (e.g., problem-based learning exercises, case studies, and attention to the history of science to illustrate principles of scientific inquiry).  We are also developing educational technology learning modules that will assume the role of routine homework assignments. These web-based learning environments are interactive to foster active learning styles and incorporate powerful assessment tools that provide students with real-time feedback and incentive to strive for high proficiency, as well as collect diagnostic clues about individual learning needs and enhance student engagement with the learning process.  Our core learning principle is to intersperse the delivery of content with routine opportunities for students to use the new information and to test their understanding.\r\n\r\n",
