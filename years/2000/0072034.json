 "awd_abstract_narration": "While metal clusters, metal colloidal particles and semiconductor nanocrystals have been very attractive subjects of research work for several decades, the last few years have witnessed a clear upsurge of interest in metal and semiconductor particles with nanometer dimensions.  The rapidly increasing number of research publications in this field correlates with the recent development of methodology to chemically modify the surface of these particles with organic monolayers, which can stabilize and modulate the physical and chemical properties of the nanoparticles.  This research project concentrates on the preparation and characterization of metal (gold, platinum and palladium) nanoparticles modified with monolayers of molecular receptors.  The key concept driving this research work is that the molecular recognition properties of the surface-immobilized hosts may be combined with the intrinsic properties of the nanoparticles to yield materials with novel and interesting properties.  For instance, the catalytic ability of platinum and palladium surfaces may be modulated by the binding properties of the hosts to produce new catalysts with enhanced or modified selectivity.  Surface modified nanoparticles can also be utilized for the preparation of novel composite materials and for  the development of new types of sensors.\r\n%%%\r\nThe proposed research work will increase our fundamental knowledge of these inorganic/organic composite materials.  The initial stages of the work will focus on the characterization of gold nanospheres prepared by methods already developed in the P.I.'s laboratory.  As this work moves forward, efforts will gradually turn to the preparation of platinum and palladium nanoparticles modified with molecular hosts, their characterization and their use as new catalysts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the scientific significance of the proposed work, funding of this proposal will allow the continued training and development of underrepresented scientists in the P.I.'s group.  During the 1990's, five out of a total of eight Ph.D. graduates from the group were of Hispanic origin.  The only two students obtaining a M.S. degree for the group were also Hispanic.  Currently, four out of a total of nine graduate students in the group are also Hispanic.\r\n",
