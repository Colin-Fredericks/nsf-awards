 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria in the ocean play a key role in transforming dissolved organic matter into C02 through respiration and into biomass that is available to higher trophic levels within the microbial food web. They are the dominant form of biomass in the ocean. From highly productive coastal and upwelling regions to extremely oligotrophic waters, bacteria abundances range only between about 10 to 10 ml, respectively. The activity of these bacteria, however, varies much more widely. Typically examined spatial scales of meters to kilometers may not be appropriate for cells that are smaller than 10-6 in and may occur in patches on the scale of 10-5 to 10-3 M. Microscale patchiness can provide concentrations of organic nutrients to cells much higher than those measured by bulk methods, leading to very different predictions of bacterial responses to physical and biogeochemical perturbations. In this project we propose to use automated flow and imaging cytometry combined with sensitive -fluorescence methods to measure the single-cell composition and activity of marine bacteria at small spatial and diel temporal scales. A variety of single-cell fluorescent probes will be used to indicate cell composition such as protein and nucleic acid content, and physiological processes such as respiration, membrane potential, and enzyme activity. These single-cell responses will be quantified using automated flow and imaging cytometric methods for increased sensitivity and count precision, quantitative fluorescence per cell measurement, and objective detection - all improvements over visual microscope methods. Our laboratory is uniquely equipped and experienced in these approaches. Bulk and single- cell methods will be compared. Microscale patchiness of bacterial activity (as ell as abundance) will be examined over a range of spatial scales and natural turbulent mixing conditions. The size distributions of active and total bacterial populations will be measured over seasonal cycles and across trophic gradients providing a variety of regimes of plankton community structure. Short time variations in bacterial activity will also be studied to determine how bacterial activity varies over diel cycles. Experiments will be conducted over seasonal time scales and on cruises from productive, coastal waters to oligotrophic, blue water sites. By measuring single-cell activities at appropriately small spatial and short temporal scales, but across the dominant ecological gradients of the temperate ocean we will gain significant insight into the mechanisms controlling bacterial biogeochemical processes.",
