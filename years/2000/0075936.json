The purpose of the conference is to encourage communication and the discussions to be conducted in an atmosphere conducive to open interactions between the scientists, provoking new and even speculative ideas for future research.\r\n\tTo accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the\r\nconference activities of a significant number of leaders in the\r\nfield.  However, the field invites and needs cooperative efforts on\r\nall levels with a range of expertise for its growth.  Therefore,\r\nyounger scientists from all countries are encouraged to participate\r\nin the conference and to present their ideas.  In particular, in\r\nanticipation of the future need of manpower and of a growing\r\nimportance of international cooperative scientific ventures, it\r\nappears necessary to expose selected advanced graduate students from the major international research universities to the new\r\nopportunities and techniques in nuclear science.  This award will\r\nfacilitate participation from these junior scientists.\r\n\r\n",
