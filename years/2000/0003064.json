 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Purdue proposes to establish a multi-university National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Pharmaceutical Processing.  Partner universities are the University of Connecticut and the University of Puerto Rico.  The purposes of the Center are to explore and develop new technology for pharmaceutical processing, to foster collaborative research projects between industrial and academic scientists, and to promote an interdisciplinary approach to training students in pharmaceutical process research and development.  The organizational structure of the Center comprises an Industrial Advisory Board, consisting of one member from each participating company, establishes research priorities and approves all spending by the Center.  The Center Director manages day-to-day operation of the Center and acts as liaison with member companies as well as the University administration.  The University Policy Committee assures that graduate student research is appropriate for the degree objective, that faculty development is not adversely affected by participation in the Center, and that Center activities are carried out in accordance with University policy.  Dr. Ken Hemilich, retired Executive Director of Pharmaceutical Research and Development at Merck, will serve as external evaluator for the Center",
