 "awd_abstract_narration": "Near field scanning optical microscopy is used in this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to obtain information on the relationship between the morphology of organic thin films and their physical properties.  Professor Barbara and his colleagues at the University of Texas-Austin address issues of charge injection, charge migration, and energy migration in organic thin film materials with applications in organic light emitting diodes and related devices.  Method development carried out in the previous award period resulted in approaches which are now focussed on understanding the spatial extent of energy migration in these materials, and the nature of energetic interactions in the layers.  Information obtained from these studies is useful in the design and fabrication of state of the art optoelectronic devices. \r\n\r\nIn order to understand the operation of organic thin film light emitting devices, and related optoelectronic materials, high resolution spatial information about physical processes and morphology in the films must be obtained.  This research project uses near field scanning probe microscopic methods developed by the P.I. to examine these questions.  Information from this research is clearly applicable in electronic and photonic device fabrication problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
