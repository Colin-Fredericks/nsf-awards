The device, known as an Electro-Optic Frequency Shifter  (EOFS) provides an all optical way to rapidly shift a bitstream from one optical channel to another in a high-bandwidth wavelength division multiplexed network.  The EOFS uses a traveling wave electro-optic interaction between a microwave control signal and the optical bit stream.  The microwave signal co-propagates with the optical bit stream through a LNO waveguide, and shifts frequency of the optical pulses via the linear electro-optic effect.\r\n\r\nTuning in this device is accomplished by changing the microwave power level, keeping the microwave frequency fixed.  All of the light is shifted in frequency, so there is no need to filter unshifted light.  A single-stage device should have a tuning range of over 2 THz, which would encompass many optical data channels.  Since there is no second optical source needed, there is no settling/control time required for tuning a second optical frequency;  the device can change frequency shifting as quickly as the amplitude of the microwave signal can be changed, which should be on the order of the inter-pulse time spacing.\r\n",
