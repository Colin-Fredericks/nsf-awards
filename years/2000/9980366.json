 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands an existing networking laboratory to allow extensive remote access and control and adapts a set of laboratory modules for use in this context. Materials from current on-line curriculum repositories as well as recent data communications texts will be adapted for remote and asynchronous accessibility. By providing remote access, the laboratory becomes available to students working asynchronously or at remote locations. This has the added benefit that the laboratory is available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week thereby maximizing utilization.\r\n\r\nAssignments are stand-alone and tutorial so that they can be used independently of the lectures in a class. This allows equipment to be reused repeatedly in a sequential manner in the same course greatly reducing the need for duplicate equipment.  This approach should provide a model for other institutions wishing to introduce telecommunications instruction with a laboratory-based component. This project addresses the challenge of providing meaningful, hands-on instruction in data communications in a manner that is both cost efficient and compatible with the needs of students in asynchronous and distance learning programs.\r\n\r\n",
