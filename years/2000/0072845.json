 "awd_abstract_narration": "0072845\r\n\r\nThe Institute of International Education (IIE) seeks funding to assess its Global E3 program, a network of more than 75 universities in 14 countries that has explored barriers that have prevented US undergraduate engineering students from going abroad during their academic careers.  During its first five years, more than 160 students and over 200 international students have participated in the program through academic study abroad and overseas internships.  The number of participants continues to almost double annually.  IIE is proposing a follow-up study to track Global E3 US alumni to learn what added value their experience abroad has brought to their careers and to their employers.  The resulting outcomes data will enable IIE to document the program's impact on its alumni that will encourage private sector partnership and participation in the Global E3 program and provide partial scholarships for US students who engage in research or internships overseas.  This effort will maximize the value of NSF's earlier investment in Global E3 and contribute to the program's long-term sustainability.\r\n",
