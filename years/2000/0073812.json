 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe Novikov conjecture is one of the fundamental unsolved problems of manifold theory. \r\nIts history is a fascinating journey through a remarkably varied mathematical landscape. \r\nThe conjecture has provoked vigorous exchanges of ideas between widely separated subjects, \r\nand (like other famous unsolved problems) it has generated lively new mathematics of its \r\nown. The Baum Connes conjecture transports the fundamental aspects of the Novikov \r\nconjecture to operator algebra theory, and makes new contacts with representation theory,\r\nspin geometry and other areas.\r\n Very recently, striking progress has been made on the both conjectures. Methods and ideas \r\ninvolving dimension theory, amenable actions of groups, Banach space geometry and combinatorics have played essential roles. An unusually exciting opportunity has arisen to\r\nspark interaction among some quite widely separated fields. Some of the core questions are so \r\nbasic that one can even expect important exchanges at the student level. The issues are so \r\nbroad that the ordinary mathematical scheme of small, two or three person, collaborative \r\nefforts will not give the most rapid and efficient progress. \r\nThe key objectives of the proposed program are as follows: \r\n Marshall forces from topology, analysis and from several less apparent areas for a general \r\nattack on the Novikov and Baum Connes conjectures. \r\n Create a rapid and effcient means of providing the essential tools for continuing research \r\nin this broad area. \r\n Broaden the communication and cooperation between US and foreign mathematicians \r\nthrough a coordinated program of visits. \r\n Offer effective training opportunities for graduate students, giving them exposure to an \r\nunusual breadth of mathematical ideas and expertise. \r\n\r\n",
