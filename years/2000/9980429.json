 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nHigh speed, high volume cryptographic systems will\r\nform the basis for the security of video, wireless,\r\nand computer communications of the next decade.  This\r\nresearch involves the design and development of such\r\nsystems, especially that of hardware-based stream\r\nciphers.  High speed hardware-based stream ciphers can\r\nbe easily manufactured, programmed, and implemented.\r\nThey can be used to encrypt data (such as voice or\r\nvideo) in real time and are used as embedded\r\ncomponents in cellular telephones, GPS satellites,\r\nradar, and radio systems.  Most stream ciphers,\r\nhowever, have been found to be vulnerable to various\r\ncryptoanalytic attacks.  This research involves the\r\ndevelopment and analysis of new architectures for\r\nsequence generators which have all the above\r\nadvantages but which are much more secure than\r\ntraditional architectures.  They are also potentially\r\nuseful for a variety of other applications such as\r\nsonar systems and Monte Carlo integration.\r\n\r\nLinear feedback shift registers have proven especially\r\nuseful for the generation of pseudorandom sequences\r\nfor high speed communications.  They have been\r\nintensively studied for over forty years and their\r\nusefulness does not appear to have any end in sight.\r\nRecently a fundamentally new architecture for feedback\r\nshift registers was discovered, the so-called\r\nfeedback-with-carry shift register or FCSR.  This\r\narchitecture shares all the advantages of the linear\r\nfeedback architecture such as high speed and ease of\r\nimplementation and significantly expands the class of\r\neasily generated and useful sequences.  This research\r\ninvolves a number of implementation issues for the new\r\narchitecture including (1) the development of parallel\r\ncircuitry for high speed generation of pseudorandom\r\nsequences, (2) the design of combiners and feedforward\r\nfunctions to increase the security of FCSR sequences, \r\n(3) the design of clock-controlled FCSR circuits, and \r\n(4) the analysis of the cryptographic security of the \r\nFCSR sequences which are generated in this way.",
