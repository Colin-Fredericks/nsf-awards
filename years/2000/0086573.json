 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vestibular research has seen recent major advances with the advent of new tools,\r\ntechniques and ideas.  These advances have been realized in studies of both the\r\ncentral and peripheral vestibular systems and in studies performed in both\r\nterrestrial and micro-gravity.  Advances have been made in the understanding of\r\nthe contributions of biomechanics, including intralabyrinthine pressure and the\r\nstiffness and elastic restoring forces of the stereocilia and cupula to the\r\nformation of the response dynamics of the semicircular canal nerves\r\n\tThe conference should be of interest to broad areas of neuroscience,\r\nincluding developmental biology, physiology and pharmacology, space biology,\r\nbioengineering, and the medical fields of neurology, otolaryngology, and\r\nneurosurgery. The conference will be held in the Eric P. Newman Center for Continuing\r\nEducation of the Washington University School of Medicine from Thursday November\r\n16 through Saturday November 18, 2000 under the direction of Drs. Stephen M.\r\nHighstein, Chair and Joel Goebel, Co-Chair.  Speakers have been chosen by Drs.\r\nHighstein and Goebel with the advice of the advisory panel and others prominent\r\nin vestibular research.  While many of the speakers have national and\r\ninternational reputations as leaders of their fields, an emphasis has been\r\nplaced on the contributions of younger workers wherever possible.  Women are\r\nalso represented to the maximum extent possible.  We are interested in bringing\r\nexisting controversies to light, and adequate time will be provided for\r\ndiscussion and resolution of differing viewpoints.  An effort has been made to\r\nprovide an outlet for research that is new and on the cutting edge in a poster\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n",
