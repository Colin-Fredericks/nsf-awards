 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tRecent  normative political theory suffers from a deficit of empiricism.  The project aims to correct this shortcoming, with respect to the study of contemporary liberalism, by testing the theory in a real-world political context.  The research assesses specifically the success of liberal principles in addressing challenges facing a polity that straddles the fence of liberal democracy and religiosity:  the State of Israel.  By examining the historical, religious, and legal foundations of Israel's precarious balance, the research illuminates and scrutinizes today's prevailing faith in liberalism as a political doctrine, and it pinpoints the role, if any, that religious faith has in a liberal state.  Central to the research are in-depth interviews with Israelis belonging to divergent religious groups.  In elucidating the links between Israeli citzens' religious beliefs and their political attitudes --and the ways in which the attitudes of various groups conflict or cohere --the project considers opportunities for social consensus in a polity split by inter-and intra-religious cleavages.  Beyond its concern with questions of religion and state in Israel, the dissertation presents a challenge to modern accounts of liberalism, and it presents a model for new interdisciplinary research in the fields of comparative politics and political theory.  The project aids scholars who study the role of religion in modern polities while highlighting the importance of context in the study of political theory.",
