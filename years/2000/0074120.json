Iran \r\n\r\nGhazi and Pessagno\r\n\r\nThis proposal is a collaborative investigation that focuses on the planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy, radiolarian biostratigraphy, choronostratigraphy and microfacies analysis of sedimentary rocks occurring within and above the extrusive member of the Khoy ophiolite.  The Khoy ophiolite of northwestern Iran is one of the largest and least studied Iranian ophiolites.  Moreover, it is superbly exposed with most geologic elements representing pre-, syn-, and post emplacement events (units) well preserved.  The Khoy ophiolite is located at a junction where the Iranian and other Middle Eastern ophiolites are connected to the Turkish and Mediterranean ophiolites.  The integration of the data resulting from the proposed collaborative effort coupled with geochemical, Pb-Nd-Sr isotopic and 40Ar-39Ar results generated by the Co-Principle investigator A. Mohamad Ghazi (EAR-9903249) should lead to a better understanding of the tectonogenesis of the Khoy ophiolite and to determine whether it is indeed a part of the Tethyan oceanic crust and is a part of the postulated ridge-transform fault system spreading axis that existed in Cretaceous southern Tethys ocean.  The project is funded with participation from the Division of International Programs.\r\n",
