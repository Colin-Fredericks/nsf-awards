 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Professor Brian Cooper of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division. The primary research objective is to separate  fluorescently labeled proteins using microbore liquid chromatography and to use a novel form of single molecule channel electroproresis to detect the separated proteins. This online detection technique will provide high throughput, excellent sensitivity and when coupled with size exclusion chromatography provides a second potentially othogonal dimension to the separation.  The educational aspect of the effort consists of a series of hands on workshops in the use of bioanalytical instrumentation. These interdisciplinary workshops will be aimed at undergraduate students, graduate students and their advisors from the University's new interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in biotechnology and biomedicine.   \r\n\r\nThe project supported by this program focuses on development of a high throughput method to separate and identify proteins.  Results from this work could lead to improved analysis of proteins and will be very useful for workers in the University of North Carolina at  Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
