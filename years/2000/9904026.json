 "awd_abstract_narration": "9904026\r\nMilligan\r\n\r\nMost traits of medical, physiological, or ecological importance are influenced by many genetic and many environmental factors. Quantitative genetics seeks to unravel the importance of the different factors by decomposing the resemblance of relatives into genetic and environmental components.  Traditional quantitative genetics involves controlled breeding coupled with careful phenotypic measurements in common or controlled environments.  For most organisms, including humans and the vast majority of natural biological resources, these techniques are impossible because of technical, ethical, or resource limitations.  Consequently, application of quantitative genetics to a diversity of organisms is severely limited.  This project seeks to overcome such limitations by developing statistical methods to integrate molecular and phenotypic data, thereby differentiating among the genetic and environmental factors affecting quantitative traits.  A robust and flexible set of software will be developed to implement\r\nthe statistical methods so that they will be widely accessible.  This project lays the statistical foundation for a much more general means of estimating the quantitative effects of genes in natural populations than exists to date, and produces software to make its application\r\npractical.\r\n\r\nA number of future studies will be enabled by this project such as nondestructive samples from populations of rare or endangered species.  Analysis and elucidation of complex, multifactorial diseases will be aided by broad population samples and integration of molecular genetic and phenotypic data from natural human populations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
