 "awd_abstract_narration": "An NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) program is being implemented within the College of Sciences and Engineering and targets academically talented but low-income students pursuing Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Because the student population at the institution is nearly 50% minority, the university is in a unique position to use the UTSA-CSEMS program to broaden the opportunities of underrepresented minorities in the fields of computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Forty students are receiving support under the program, and the program provides faculty mentors, academic enhancement opportunities, career planning assistance, and other activities designed to increase employment opportunities and encourage students to pursue advanced graduate study. Faculty mentors are advising the students on career opportunities and opportunities in graduate school in their fields of study and introducing the students to research. Local organizations which hire a significant number of computer science, engineering, and mathematics majors are arranging visits to the companies' facilities by the students, and representatives of various companies are also meeting with the scholars to make presentations about aspects of their organizations. The outcomes of the program are being tracked, with the goal being to implement the successful aspects of the program on a college-wide and university-wide basis. \r\n",
