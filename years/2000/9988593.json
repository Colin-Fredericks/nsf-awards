The goal of UNOLS is to assist in the coordination and scheduling of facilities and shared-use equipment to provide efficient use of finite resources.  The UNOLS Office is the focal point for planning, coordination and reporting of UNOLS activities.\r\n\r\nThe UNOLS office provides administrative support services, supports ship scheduling through an electronic data base, disseminates ship request and schedules, analyses ship use, prepares committee reports, distributes marine regulations and other related information as necessary.  Support for special studies, Medical Advisory Service for ship's crew and scientist, travel expenses for UNOLS Committee members and consultants is also provide through UNOLS.\r\n\r\nMoss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) will host and staff the office of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) in Moss Landing, California.\r\n\r\nMLML will meet the needs of the marine scientists for ship operating institutions and ensure that the appropriate mix of the best facilities are available to scientist conducting marine science research and educational programs for UNOLS Vessels.\r\n***",
