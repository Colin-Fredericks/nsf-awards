 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  Typical community college students are over 25, working while attending classes, and are enrolled in introductory biology as their only science course after high school.  By 2001, this population will make up more than half of all undergraduates in the U.S. and will represent more minorities, women, and adults returning to education than the population of students in four-year institutions.  The goal of this project is to encourage these adult learners to use problem-solving strategies informed by science and to value science as private citizens and workers.  The challenge with respect to meeting this goal is to develop educational materials that put biology into meaningful contexts, that help students develop problem-solving and information management skills, and that are pedagogically consistent with adult learning strategies.  To accomplish this goal, Southeast Missouri State University and the BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium are collaborating with community college faculty to extensively field test and further develop problem-based, technology-rich curriculum modules and teaching strategies in the LifeLines OnLine project.  A robust faculty development program that includes ongoing peer and expert mentoring is preparing community college biology teachers to implement LifeLines OnLine materials and teaching strategies within their current courses.  Each LifeLines OnLine module (available on the Internet) includes:  (a) an electronic newspaper interface whose items are points of access into materials that include a case to be investigated and case-related tools and resources, and (b) extensive notes to instructors about using these materials in a variety of community college settings.  While targeted to the community college, this approach to biology should be widely applicable in undergraduate biology education because the problems addressed are generally reflected in the dynamics of post-secondary science education. \r\n\r\n",
