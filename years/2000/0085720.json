 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will develop a multimodal network analysis to simulate\r\nthe effects of e-commerce and different freight supply chain costs on the\r\nmovement of goods. Major physical actions, including information exchange,\r\nand decisions required to move goods from source to destination will be\r\nsimulated. A method will be developed for simulating large numbers of\r\nindividual freight shipments by vehicle and for assigning them to specific\r\nlinks in the US truckrailwaterair freight transportation network.  Within a\r\nsupplychain management framework, information and cash flow will be\r\nincorporated into the network analysis.  Created in the 1960's, the\r\nInternet has become an open access, inexpensive, and globally available\r\nmeans for rapid correspondence with the rest of the world.  On-line\r\nInternet trading is now a major form of  business activity. What this rapid\r\ntransition to e-commerce ultimately implies for the U.S. transportation\r\nsector remains to be seen. It is likely to initiate some profound changes\r\nin both domestic and international product supply chains, leading to some\r\nimportant new patterns of freight movement which can only be modeled by\r\ninter-relating the physical and information networks.  The focus of this\r\nresearch will be on the development of a sound theoretical base using\r\ninformation in the literature as a guide to proof of concept instead of an\r\nempirical analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award is made under the Exploratory Research on Engineering the\r\nTransport Industries (ETI) program solicitation.\r\n",
