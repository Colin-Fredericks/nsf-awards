 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Grants for Exploratory Research project to support travel and some transcription in support of oral interviews of approximately 50 people who were active in the early years of modern investigation of polar regions. The United States will soon lose a generation of pioneering scientists and explorers who led the way for scientific advances in polar regions. The people who participated in the expeditions of the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's and those who were the first scientists of the IGY established the modus operandi for field operations in use today. They possess a wealth of information and perspectives about the development and history of polar investigation that was not recorded; they are also in the final years of their lives. The interviewees, most of whom have been contacted and have agreed to participate, live in many places across the United States. A working list of more than one hundred people has been developed by using the membership list of the American Polar Society and expeditionary rosters from this era.  An advisory board will help to set priorities and provide guidance. Priorities will be based on such factors as age, state of health, and prominence of the interviewees. Funding from this project will send trained and experienced interviewers to meet with the scientists and to create the historic documents, i.e. the tapes, that will be a continuing resource for scientists and historians. Ohio State University will preserve the tapes and make them  available. From the experience of this project, the principal investigators expect to develop a continuing oral history program for polar science. This proposal is based on imminent need (the age and state of health of this generation of explorers and scientists) and on collaboration.  Captain Brian Shoemaker, as Secretary of the American Polar Society, and Dr. Raimund Goerler, as Chief Archivist of Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center Archival Program, will work with an Advisory Board of persons prominent in science and in oral history, with staff of the Byrd Polar Research Center Archival Program, and with volunteers of the American Polar Society, an organization that began in 1935 to provide polar information for explorers and scientists. \r\n",
