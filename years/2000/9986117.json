The principal objective of the series will be to explore issues with significant implications for the vitality of science and engineering in the borderless, knowledge-based economy of the 21~ century. A Coordinating Committee will be responsible for the organization and implementation of the series of events. Consideration will be given to the establishment of an Advisory Board representing leading government and nongovemment scientific institutions in the two countries to provide strategic guidance. This proposal covers planning and oversight for the first three years and travel costs for participants in the first two events planned in the series.\r\n\r\nThe theme of the first event in the series, to be held in Beijing in October 1999, is Linking the Production, Dissemination, and Application of Research. This theme could also serve as a guiding principle for the entire decade- long series of events-including a proposed U.S.-China Science Forum, in Washington, DC, in March or April 2000 featuring presentations by distinguished Chinese scientists and engineers and discussions with similarly distinguished American scientists. Specific topics to be considered at the October 1999 Beijing seminar will include: 1) Knowledge-Based Science Policy; 2) Human Resources for Science and Engineering; 3) Data for Science and Technology; and 4) Changing Character of R&D. Participants in this seminar will include representatives from key government R&D agencies in the two countries, as well as experts from the industrial and academic sectors. Outcomes would include: (1) a written and electronic record of the seminar, including recommendations that could be addressed individually and jointly by two countries, and (2) suggestions for subsequent events in the series.\r\n\r\nBased on these outcomes, the Coordinating Committee will develop a definitive schedule of events as a basis for bilateral science policy cooperation, and a foundation for strengthened partnership in specific areas of science and engineering.  The cochairs for these events are Dr. J. Thomas Ratchford, Distinguished Visiting Progfessor, National Center for Technology and the Law, George Mason University, and Dr. Xu Weixuan, Director of the Institute of Policy and Management, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
