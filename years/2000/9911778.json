Also providing expertise to the project will be the Education Development Center and TERC.  The project will build upon four years of standards-based mathematics and science curriculum implementation and teacher enhancement in each district.  Both districts have adopted and are committed to using only reform-based, NSF-funded curricula at both the elementary and middle school levels.  \r\n\r\nThe participating teachers will take part in 160 hours of professional development over the life of the project.  The majority (130) of these hours will occur at the teachers' schools, in their classrooms and during their contract day.  The Pedagogical Content Knowledge Workshops will be held in six half-day, school-time sessions per year for the five years.  The Workshops will broaden and deepen the teachers' content knowledge, while using an inquiry, reform-based instructional approach.  In-class support will be provided by the districts' mathematics and science specialists as well as a cadre of 54 specially prepared Teacher Leaders.  Lastly, the Summer Synergy Institute will give participants the opportunity to intensely examine and develop conceptual and instructional synergy between mathematics and science.  \r\n\r\nThe project will impact two districts, 13 schools, 314 teachers and 6,450 K-8 students.\r\n",
