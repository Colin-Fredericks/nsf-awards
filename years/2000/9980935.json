 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to increase the three-dimensional molecular literacy of undergraduate students by having them create and present detailed three-dimensional molecular illustrations of biochemical structures and processes. These illustrations are used as the bases of inquiry-based projects designed to help prepare the students to understand and interact with molecular structures in graduate school as well as in careers as diverse as biotechnology, molecular medicine, forensics and high school teaching. To accomplish this goal, kinemage authorship is introduced into two biochemistry courses, one for majors in biochemistry and related fields, and one for science majors in other fields. Students prepare and present kinemages on topics covered in the classes, with both peer and instructor evaluation. As part of the assessment of effectiveness, a kinemage component is included in each examination in the courses. Concurrent with the curriculum efforts, the PREKIN (kinemage authoring) and MAGE (kinemage viewing) programs and documentation are being developed under the supervision of the software author to further facilitate ease of use by both teachers and students at this level. After refinement based on this experience of combined software and pedagogy development, the materials are disseminated electronically and via workshops. The development of a framework for undergraduate kinemage authorship serves as a national model for inquiry-based learning of molecular structure in biochemistry classes of all sizes and student compositions.\r\n",
