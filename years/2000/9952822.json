 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nThe Department of Geography and Geology at Mount Holyoke College is redesigning and reorganizing several separate curricula into an integrated Earth and Environmental Sciences program.  This curricular revision responds to three major concerns: the need to improve the scientific and environmental literacies of student-citizens, the continued underrepresentation of women and people of color in science, and limited integration of the links between science and society; as well as, between natural and social systems in science curricula at all educational levels. The goal of this project is to provide students with a fundamental understanding of the dynamics and interdependency of Earth's system by placing their study in cultural and historical contexts and with investigative experiences doing science so that students can understand science as a process of inquiry. \r\n\r\nThe project goal is being achieved by 1) designing an integrative, place-based curriculum that emphasizes processes of science from the introductory to advanced levels, 2) focusing on investigative projects, group and individual learning, and peer teaching, 3) using interdisciplinary approaches to examining Earth systems to emphasize links between natural and social systems, 4) emphasizing important skills in communication, critical thinking, problem solving, 5) making interdisciplinary connections of ideas and knowledge, and 6) embedding diverse internal assessment strategies in the curriculum. This program will help to increase the diversity of scientifically and environmentally literate student-citizens who can critically evaluate issues on Earth's systems ranging from basic scientific knowledge and methods to cultural/societal contexts of environmental problems.\r\n\r\nThis project, addresses these concerns by adapting and implementing ideas and strategies from successful models to develop a program that better serves young women citizens and scientists.  The pedagogical models being adapted by this project come from a variety of other successful projects and include hands-on, inquiry based and experiential teaching approaches, student-student and student-faculty learning partnerships, and constructivist \"learning cycle\" sequences in the new curriculum.  \r\n\r\nThe project is being evaluated by a consultant who is developing a mixed method approach for both the formative and summative evaluations.  Dissemination of the new curriculum and the evaluation results is planned through conference presentations, workshops, including one for local K-12 teachers, and a website.  \r\n",
