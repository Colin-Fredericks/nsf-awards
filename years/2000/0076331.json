 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award is to a professor at Boston College for an experimental research project that focuses on the electromagnetic and thermodynamic properties of two classes of low dimensional systems in which superconductivity and magnetism compete, or even coexist.  These properties will be investigated at low temperatures and high magnetic fields.  In one case, critical information on the pairing symmetry in the superconducting state of linear chain molecular conductors (TMTSF)_X will be sought. Previous research has provided strong evidence that these materials, whose superconducting phase is in close competition with an antiferromagnetic spin density wave, are p-wave triplet superconductors. If so, then there would be no Zeeman pair-breaking mechanism to destroy superconductivity in a magnetic field.  In addition, there exists the possibility that the orbital pair-breaking effect can be reduced or eliminated, which means that the superconducting state would persist to extremely high fields.  In this project, one post-doc and two graduate students will be involved in extending previous work to 50% higher field and 1/5th the temperature of previous efforts, in search of definitive evidence for triplet pairing and reentrant superconductivity.  In the second case, the hybrid ruthenate-cuprate magnetic superconducting system, a possibility also exists for high field superconductivity, but perhaps by a different mechanism.  These materials have alternating superconducting and antiferromagnetic (with weak ferromagnetic order) layers, providing a unique setting to test the antagonistic relationship between the two broken symmetry states of magnetism and superconductivity.  The experiments will be performed in a new laboratory facility at Boston College housing several new high field magnets and dilution refrigerators.  The students involved in this project will learn techniques that will prepare them for positions in academic, governmental, or industrial research.\r\n%%%\r\nIt has long been established that magnetism destroys all superconductivity.  For example, the superconducting magnets that power modern MRI machines are limited in strength (and thus sensitivity and resolution) due to the fact that the very field created in the magnet's windings diminishes the wire's ability to carry current.  There may be ways around this suicidal tendency of superconductors, however.  In certain low dimensional geometries, namely in situations where the superconducting electrons are confined to planes (like the pages of a book) or even individual chains (like the lines on a page), the possibility exists for the superconducting state to regain its strength, and to persist in fields well beyond conventional expectations.  This individual investigator award to a professor at Boston College is for a project that will investigate this possibility in certain low dimensional materials, where previous work (on so-called \"molecular superconductors\") has shown an exciting tendency for enhanced superconductivity in very strong magnetic fields.  It turns out that these materials are ones in which superconductivity and magnetism \"compete\" against each other on a nanoscopic scale, a fact that may prove important in the realization of high field superconductivity and, eventually, the fabrication of ultra-high field magnets.  The graduate student and postdoc involved in this project will learn techniques that will prepare them for positions in academic, governmental, or industrial research.\r\n***\r\n",
