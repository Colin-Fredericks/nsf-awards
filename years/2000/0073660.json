When brought together at the integrated antenna-array\r\nCDMA-receiver system level, these challenges are magnified and \r\nnew problems of both theoretical and practical interest arise.\r\nThis proposed research on antenna array DS/CDMA communications\r\nis characterized by the following three attributes: (i) The principle \r\nof joint space-time processing is maintained. (ii) Low optimization \r\ncomplexity is sought, therefore matrix inversions and/or \r\neigen-decompositions are viewed as undesirable operations.\r\n(iii) Superior adaptive system performance on short data records,\r\nas opposed to ideal asymptotics, is the objective.\r\n\r\n  In terms of projected contributions to science and engineering\r\nprinciples, this proposed research is intended to build on past work\r\nof the PIs during the last four years -supported by seed funding by \r\nthe National Science Foundation- that led to initial understanding and\r\npreliminary development of new linear filter optimization criteria and\r\nprocedures. The focus is on low bias and low short-data-record variance \r\nadaptive optimization procedures that the investigators of this proposal \r\nhave developed and termed ``auxiliary-vector (AV)'' filtering. AV filtering \r\nmay touch many aspects of multidisciplinary engineering that are presently\r\nhampered by the ``curse of dimensionality'' and could benefit from adaptive\r\nfiltering and/or adaptive system optimization through limited input data.\r\nVariations of AV filtering schemes are currently considered in diversified \r\nareas that include temporal-only processing of CDMA signals, synchronization, \r\nadaptive robust spread-spectrum receiver designs, adaptive array radars,\r\nDirection-Of-Arrival estimation problems, and jam-resistant GPS. This present\r\nresearch plan covers aspects varying from basic algorithmic developments and \r\ntheoretical analysis to DSP and FPGA hardware prototyping and testing through\r\nthe use of the SPW (R) block-level communications systems simulator, \r\na programmable antenna array testbed with 12 complete receive chains, \r\nan anechoic chamber with range in excess of 7 meters, and a DSP/FPGA \r\nboard-level implementation testbed.\r\n***\r\n",
