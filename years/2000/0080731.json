 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of a wide variety of policy changes and economic shocks depend crucially on the ease with which labor can be reallocated from one industry or geographic location to another. This is particularly true of the distributional effects of changes in the economic environment. For example:\r\n(i) The distributional consequences of eliminating the Multifibre Arrangement, which has protected the U.S. textiles and apparel industry from international trade, depend crucially on how easily the workers in that sector can find employment in other sectors.\r\n(ii) The effects of a cut in income taxes in one state depend on how easy it is for workers in other states to move in response. \r\n(iii) The effects of immigration into a particular region of the country depend on how fluid labor is between that region and others, a question of particular importance to states such as California, Florida and Texas. \r\n(iv) The effects of privatization and rationalization of the public-sector workforce in post-communist and less developed countries depends on the ease with which the workers thus released can integrate themselves into other sectors of the economy. \r\n(v) The costs of labor mobility determine the extent to which the effects of regional labor demand shocks is mitigated by inter-regional labor flows.\r\nSurprisingly, given the wide range of issues in which the costs of labor mobility play a critical role, there is very little direct evidence on the magnitude of these costs, and how, they vary across categories of workers, sectors, and regions. This project aims to fill that gap. An integrated framework, which combines a fully-specified theoretical model within which to think about the economic implications of mobility costs with an estimation strategy that derives directly from the model, is used to generate estimates of intersectoral and geographic moving costs for various worker categories. These estimates are used to answer questions such as: Are skilled workers more mobile geographically, but less mobile across industries, than unskilled? What are the costs in terms of reduced mobility of being a homeowner? Has technical change made it easier for skilled workers to switch industries?  The estimates are then used to conduct a number of specific policy simulations, among them a study of the desirability of gradualism in implementing trade liberalization in the U.S. and an analysis of the impact of immigration on local labor markets.  Time-series data on wages and gross labor flows across region-cum-industry cells, constructed from 28 years of the March Current Population Survey files, provide the main basis for estimation. These data are supplemented with data from other sources in carrying out the program of policy analysis.\r\n",
