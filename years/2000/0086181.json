 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Sisseton Wahpeton Rural Systemic Initiative, based at the Sisseton Wahpeton\r\nCommunity College, is in many aspects a continuation of the Tribal Colleges Rural\r\nSystemic Initiative. However, since it is a locally based project, instead of a six-state\r\neffort, we will be able to concentrate on the educational needs of the Lake Traverse\r\nReservation population to a far greater extent. The ultimate goal of the SWRSI project is\r\nimprove the education, particularly in the areas of math and science, of our children\r\nthrough systemic reform. This is a process that requires the support and dedication of all\r\nthe stakeholders in the community. This reform began three years ago with the\r\nintroduction of the TCRSI program, with the development and adoption of standards and\r\nincreased professional development in research-based curricula. The formation of a\r\ncoalition of the local school districts and the establishment of \"focal schools\" also\r\noccurred. Activities during the TCRSI project are referred to as Phase I.\r\nPhase II will be a more intensive program of systemic reform, with our major\r\nobjectives being the increased implementation of research-based curricula and the\r\ndevelopment of culturally relevant alternative assessments. These assessments will be\r\ntied to benchmarks established by local and state standards, and correlated to traditional\r\nstandardized tests. By this method our schools will be able to develop better teaching\r\nmethods based on our students learning styles.\r\nThe implementation of research-based curricula is a potential hazard if not\r\nsupported by up-to-date and intensive professional development for teachers. When\r\nthese programs are introduced without understanding their underlying philosophies, the\r\ncurriculum becomes part of the problem. Our second objective is to create a system of\r\nprofessional development that is curriculum specific, intensive, ongoing, and relevant to\r\nteacher needs. At the same it must be able to overcome the problems of a rural setting,\r\nlimited budgets, and high teacher turnover rates. Our strategy to overcome these issues is\r\nto use distant learning technologies, web-based support, and the development of local\r\nexperts at SWCC and lead-teachers in the focal schools. Information given at\r\n\"traditional\" workshops and via video conferencing sessions will be placed on curricula\r\nsupport web pages available 24 hours a day to our participants. Questions related to the\r\nuse of the curricula could be posted with answers being provided by expert consultants or\r\nother classroom teachers. To combat the high teacher turnover rate Internet courses for\r\ntraining purposes will be developed and maintain by SWRSI and collaborating\r\ninstitutions. These efforts will directly address the issue of sustainability.\r\nThe third objective of the SWRSI project is to increase the level of cooperation\r\nbetween the individual focal schools and the tribal college. An Administrators\r\nCommittee and a Steering Committee (composed of focal schoolteachers, SWCC staff,\r\nand community members) has been formed as one component of this effort. The\r\nprofessional development activities of SWRSI will attribute to this effort, as each school\r\nwill help plan and participate in these joint-training sessions. \r\n\r\n",
