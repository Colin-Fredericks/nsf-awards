 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nBruce Locke and Ronald Clarke\r\nFlorida State University\r\n0071351\r\n\r\nGas phase pulsed corona reactors have been used for the degradation and removal of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds from combustion gases and other gaseous waste streams.  A pulsed streamer corona discharge creates streamer channels that propagate from one electrode to the other and that typically have relatively small diameter.  These streamers lead to the formation of chemically reactive degradation of conversion to less harmful byproducts of many pollutants.\r\n\r\nThe PI's are working on reticulated vitreous carbon as high voltage and ground electrodes in pulsed corona reactors.  The major advantage of using reticulated vitreous carbon electrodes for this application is that it allows for the gas to flow through the electrode region where the plasma has the highest intensity, thereby facilitating good contact between the waste components in the gas and the plasma region.  In addition, preliminary work has indicated possible interactions between nitrogen dioxide and the surface of the electrodes.  This project is to explore the possibility of improving the reactor operation for nitrogen oxide removal through the coating of the reticulated carbon electrodes with platinum and other materials in order to promote reductive reactions.\r\n\r\n",
