 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an REU Site in Sociology at Texas A&M University.  The program consists of a year-long research experience and training program for ten undergraduate students who are considering graduate school in sociology.  The eight-week summer program will include research projects under the supervision of a faculty member, classroom and laboratory training, participation in field trips and professional development seminars, and formal presentations of research papers at professional conferences.  Students will continue their research and mentoring experiences during the following academic year at their home institutions.  Students will be recruited from universities in Texas that do not have doctoral programs in sociology and that have large enrollments of students from population groups that are underrepresented in graduate programs in sociology.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n",
