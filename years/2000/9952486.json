 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThis project continues the ongoing replacement of course-specific, upper level teaching laboratories with cross-disciplinary, project-based ones.  By building on the experience of others in teaching discovery-based, guided-inquiry, or problem-based laboratories, a curriculum is being fashioned that will provide an intense learning environment for chemistry and biochemistry students.  The resulting curriculum provides students with experiences and tools needed to become successful scientists and serves as the link between undergraduate courses and undergraduate research.\r\n\r\nA critical component in guiding students to an understanding of chemistry is getting them to see that the fundamental principles of (bio)chemistry are intrinsically cross-disciplinary.  The problems they investigate must therefore be cross-disciplinary in nature.  The thesis is that instrumental techniques that span disciplines are likewise critical to the development of \"chemical Weltanschauung.\"  Mass spectrometry is an essential component in this development.  Experiments from journal articles will be adapted for use in various courses.  Other critical components -- high-field NMR and visible spectroscopy -- are already available to this institution's undergraduate students.  Laboratory projects incorporating cross-disciplinary use of NMR, visible spectroscopy, and LC/MS continue to be developed.",
