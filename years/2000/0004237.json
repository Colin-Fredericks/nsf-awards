 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to perform machining operations in a comprehensive simulation environment and to obtain realistic predictions of its outcome in terms of workpiece attributes (dimensional tolerance, form, and surface finish) and process capabflities is the vision motivating this proposal.  An initial framework for the realization of this capability, epitomized by the designation Virtual Machine Tool (VMT), will be defined.  The envisioned VMT environment will ultimately allow machine tool builders to evaluate alternative machine designs and configurations, and will assist machine tool users to predict the achievable workpiece attributes during planning, selection, and use of' metal cutting machine tools. The underlying assumptions, interrelation between the necessary functions, and the envisioned methods and approaches to the computational simulation of the functional elements of the VMT will be addressed. The principal emphasis will be on fundamental issues related to the integration of machine and process related funttions, and on the development of predictive models for workpiece attributes and process capability measures that are essential missing ingredients of the VMT concept. The outcome, consisting of prototype code for the characterization, visualization, and mapping of workpiece attribute deviations from the nominal, will be experimentally verified on the example of end milling, drilling, and tapping operations.",
