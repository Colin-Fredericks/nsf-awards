Williams\r\n\r\n\r\nKnot theory applications from a newly emerging area \r\nof dynamics, the study of dynamical systems of algebraic \r\norigin, will be developed. The set of representations into \r\na compact group of the derived group of a link group will \r\nbe studied as a dynamical system.  New results about knot \r\nsymmetries and branched covers of links are expected. \r\nA recently discovered relationship between symbolic \r\ndynamical systems and topological quantum field theory \r\nwill be  explored. The research will address open questions \r\nin knot theory and dynamics and expand on previous results \r\nin these fields. It will continue a new program of research \r\nin knot theory that incorporates ideas from symbolic \r\ndynamical systems. \r\n\r\nThe investigation of knots and links has attracted great \r\nattention not only in the mathematical world but also \r\nin the larger scientific community. Knotting and linking \r\nphenomena are found in molecular biology and plasma physics, \r\nfor example, while striking similarites in computational \r\nmethods arise frequently in theoretical physics. The proposed \r\nresearch will provide new understanding of knots and links \r\nby using techniques from symbolic dynamical systems, \r\na mathematical branch of information theory. The research \r\nwill also strengthen interaction between researchers in \r\nthe fields of topology and dynamics.\r\n",
