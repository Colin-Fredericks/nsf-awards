In particular the multi-week modules are organized around the general theme of \"perception\". Pilot testing is underway at the PI's institution and several partner institutions. An external evaluation plan is in place and several leading cognitive scientists are engaged as consultants to the project. In addition, a partnership with an important publisher of cognitive science literature is being pursued as part of a strategy to move to a full educational materials development project supporting \"cognitive sciences across the curriculum\".",
