The majority of flowering plants are hermaphroditic, with each flower bearing both male and female parts.  A significant number of flowering plants, however, have evolved highly complex sexual systems that involve the production of different flower types by the same individual.  Andromonoecy\r\nis a sexual system in which plants produce both hermaphrodite and functionally male flowers.  Despite over a century of intensive study of the function of andromonoecy, the origin of this sexual system remains a mystery.  This study addresses the evolutionary origin and diversification of andromonoecy within the genus Solanum.  This research will identify the specific features of plants and flowers that have been modified during the evolutionary transition from the production of only hermaphroditic flowers to andromonoecy and the ability to produce both hermaphroditic and male flowers.\r\n\r\nThis research on the evolution and function of plant sexual systems has broad implications for basic and applied research in plant biology.  Sexual systems determine patterns of mating, and thus the genetic structure of populations.  They are important determinants of reproductive output (e.g., fruit production), and may provide critical mechanisms for plant response to environmental variation.  The results of this research will be particularly important for understanding past evolutionary responses to a variable environment and predicting mechanisms of response to future environmental change.  In addition, functional andromonoecy limits productivity in many species , including perennial fruit crops.  This research has the potential to identify developmental processes that can be targeted by breeders and geneticists to improve productivity.\r\n\r\n",
