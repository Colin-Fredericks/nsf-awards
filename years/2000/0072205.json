 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award is to a young PI at Boston College.  The experimental project is to study many-body interactions in novel two-dimensional electronic materials by using high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). More specifically, systematic ARPES studies of many-body interactions will be conducted in four different but related two-dimensional superconductors - Tl(2)Ba(2)CuO(6+x) thin films with different doping levels (Tc about 85K for optimally doped samples), ruthenate (i.e., Sr(2)RuO(4), Tc about 1K), ferromagnetic superconductor RuSr(2)GdCu(2)O(8), and layered hafnium nitride (i.e., Li(x)(THF)(y)HfNCl, Tc=25.5K).  Such studies will not only answer many questions directly related to these materials, but will also advance the understanding of the high temperature superconductivity.  The results will provide important information on the understanding of the influence of dimensionality on many-body interactions and superconductivity.  This research project will also provide good training for both undergraduate and graduate students by introducing them some exciting new materials, cutting-edge techniques and fundamental condensed matter physics. This training will prepare them for a range of careers in academe, industry or government.\r\n%%%\r\nThis individual investigator award is to a young PI at Boston College.  The experimental project is to study many-body interactions in some newly discovered two-dimensional electronic materials by using high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES).  Those materials display some novel properties, such as high temperature superconductivity - conducting electric current with any loss.  Fundamental understanding of these materials is important given their great application potential.  ARPES is a powerful technique to probe many-body interactions, which are often responsible for novel properties of these materials.  Results from this proposal will provide important information on the understanding of high temperature superconductivity and other interesting phenomena.  This research project will also provide good training for both undergraduate and graduate students by introducing them some exciting new materials, cutting-edge techniques and fundamental condensed matter physics. This training will prepare them for a range of careers in academe, industry or government.\r\n***\r\n",
