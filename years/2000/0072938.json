The Endeavor is a 184 ft. vessel, constructed in 1976  with a midlife in 1993, and is owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the University of Rhode Island.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 211 operational days during 2000, of which 100 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support Navy, NOAA, and USGS projects.  The projects scheduled on the Endeavor represent several oceanographic disciplines, and includes instrument testing, mooring deployments and recoveries, plankton studies, and chemical oceanography, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel. Operations in 2000 will mainly take place in the North Atlantic, from the Gulf of Maine to as far south as the coast off of Atlantic City.\r\n\r\nThe Endeavor is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
