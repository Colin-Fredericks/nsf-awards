 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipid peroxides or their products have recently been cited as biological second\r\nmessengers in signal transduction pathways that induce cytoprotective enzymes, stimulate\r\nprotein kinases, mediate programmed cell death, and stimulate neutrophil adhesion and\r\nsmooth muscle cell proliferation in a manner similar to platelet activating factor.\r\nIdentification and quantification of lipid peroxidation products will enhance\r\nunderstanding of the enzymology, biochemistry, and biodisposition of these biological\r\nmediators. The current detection methods for these products in cells or subcellular\r\nfractions include spectrophotometric assays and liquid chromatography, though none are\r\ncapable of generating data in real-time.\r\n\r\nInstrumentation and methods to monitor biological processes in tissue cultures in real-time\r\nwill be developed in this project. Two full-time graduate students will assist in the research and implementation process.  The instrument will incorporate a cell incubation device with a \r\ncryofocusing inlet suitable for use with high-speed gas chromatography (HSGC), and will\r\nbe compatible with various platforms. Cells will be cultured in a 37 degrees C oven in\r\n standard tissue culture flasks fitted with specialized caps. The caps serve to isolate the\r\nproducts within a flask while providing air and CO2. Direct monitoring will be accomplished \r\nby concentrating gaseous products on a cryofocusing trap for injection into a HSGC system. \r\nThe long-term goal of this project is to develop an integrated, modular incubator/inlet that\r\n will provide new capabilities for monitoring biological systems in real-time. The instrument\r\n could be used to study many systems, although this work will focus on the characterization of lipid peroxidation products.\r\n\r\nFor inlet design testing and proof of concept work, lipid peroxidation will be stimulated\r\nin the isolated microsomal fraction from rat liver, which generates relatively large\r\namounts of products. Detection will be accomplished with time of flight (TOF) mass\r\nspectrometry. The high scanning rates of TOF instruments are compatible with high speed\r\nGC, and the second dimension of data facilitates positive identification of peroxidation\r\nproducts. This is a decided advantage for complex and dynamic biological systems. A\r\nspecialized incubator will be constructed in the second phase of the project for use with\r\ncell cultures. Final valving configurations will be tested and optimized. The ruggedness\r\nof the instrument will be examined in detail, in order to develop an instrument suitable\r\nfor patent application and marketing.",
