 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sintering is an important technological process of powder and porous material consolidation used in various fields of manufacturing ranging from electronic circuit production to large-scale tooling.  The continuum approach enables prediction of shape distortions and density distributions under sintering which are critical in modeling net-shape processing of powder materials including both conventional powder thermoprocessing and novel areas such as laser, microwave, and plasma sintering.  Thereby one of the most important problems of powder treatment - dimension control - can be successfully resolved.  A considerable amount of research activity is presently taking place in this area but there is a lack of effort in the following directions which will be the focus of the present research:  (1) modeling at different hierarchical physical scales taking into consideration material micro-structure characteristics in continuum models of sintering; (2) taking into account additional factors such as phase transformations; (3) prediction of sintering stability and  development of sintering damage criteria.\r\n\r\nThe educational part of the career program incorporates the development of undergraduate and graduate courses including the preparation of a textbook on physics and mechanics of sintering which will combine theoretical concepts developed in three major schools (U.S., Eastern and Western European) of science of sintering.\r\n",
