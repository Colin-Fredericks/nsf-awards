 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Partha Dasgupta\r\n\r\nThe process migration problem has received a lot of attention but has\r\nproduced only mixed results.  Traditionally, migration mechanisms have\r\nbeen used to balance the load among processors in a distributed\r\nsystem. However, most mechanisms proposed to date for general-purpose\r\napplications have required extensive operating system kernel\r\nmodifications. Hence, conventional wisdom has held that the costs of\r\nprocess migration are not justified by resulting benefits.  This\r\nresearch takes a new look at process migration, recognizing both its\r\nutility for an increasing number of emerging applications that can\r\ntolerate higher overheads, as well as the possibility of implementing\r\nnecessary mechanisms using novel user-level techniques. Process\r\nmigration enables a host of capabilities such as mobility,\r\ncollaborative work, distributed systems management, automatic\r\nreconfigurability, and fault-tolerance.  Moreover, API interception\r\ntechnologies, which permit insertion of arbitrary functionality in the\r\nexecution path of an application's interactions with the underlying\r\noperating system, enable process migration to be implemented without\r\nkernel modification. This research investigates a virtualization\r\nscheme that decouples an application from dependencies in the\r\noperating system and the physical environment. Virtualization also\r\nmonitors and controls the interactions and the resulting side effects\r\nbetween processes and operating systems, making process migration\r\npossible.\r\n",
