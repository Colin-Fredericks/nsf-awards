 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economics (82)\r\nPatterns in Problem Solving is multimedia software designed to teach problem solving strategies in economics. Classroom integration of instruction on problem solving and standard course material requires a costly tradeoff between quality of learning and the amount of material that can be covered. This project develops software that allows problem solving strategies and new economic knowledge to be taught on parallel but separate tracks. Separation through computer-assisted instruction is expected to increase learning by allowing students to distinguish those study methods pertinent to problem solving from those that are appropriate for new economic knowledge. The objective of Patterns in Problem Solving is to develop problem-solving strategies within the domain of economics and (later on) to transfer these strategies to a variety of domains. The software use multi-level questions to guide students through fifty application problems. The problems are based on a subset of core economic knowledge but the software does not teach economics per se. The software develops proficiency in ten problem-solving strategies adapted from research on the differences between expert and novice problem solvers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
