 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Codes on Graphs, Factor Graphs, and Iterative Algorithms\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of this research is the investigation of creative new\r\nmethods for reliable transmission of information in the context of modern\r\nerror-control techniques. Error-correcting codes are an essential part of\r\nmodern communication and storage systems and much of today's technology\r\nwould not be possible without them. This study is focused on graph-based,\r\niterative decoding algorithms, which, without doubt, are one of the most\r\nsignificant coding-theoretic developments of the last decade. The goal of\r\nthe investigator's research  is to develop a broad, analytical, and\r\nconstructive approach to research and education, unifying  graphical\r\nmodels, coding theory, and iterative algorithms. The interplay  between\r\ncodes on graphs and other areas, like iterative graph-based algorithms,\r\nsystem theory, and network information theory, is in  the focus of this\r\ninvestigation with the goal of discovering  and utilizing fundamental\r\nconnections between these fields.\r\n\r\nThe central notion of this research is the framework of \"codes on graphs\"\r\nand \"factor graphs\". Three main thrusts of research are present. The first\r\nmain thrust is directed towards the  analysis and theoretical study of\r\niterative decoding algorithms in graphs with and without cycles. The main\r\ntools for this research originate in recent successes in the analysis of\r\ncodes on graphs as the codelength approaches infinity, and in the notion of\r\npseudo-codewords for short codes on relatively simple graphs. Both\r\napproaches are made viable by drawing  heavily on the properties of the\r\nunderlying graph in the code construction.\r\nThe second main thrust involves problems arising from generalizations of\r\nminimal realizations of codes on graphs. This work has important\r\nramifications to  behavioral system theory, network information theory and\r\niterative decoding. The goal is  to derive algorithms that achieve a\r\n\"minimal\" realization of a code on a graph. A solution to this question is\r\nclosely related to important problems in network information theory and the\r\nachievability of desired information flows in a given network topology.\r\nThe third objective of the investigator's study is aimed at jointly\r\noptimized receiver functions in a graph-based iterative setup. Factor\r\ngraphs provide a natural and generic framework for the study of iterative,\r\nbelief propagation  algorithms on graphical models. One of the most\r\nexciting opportunities offered by the factor graph framework is the\r\npossibility of incorporating a variety of different  estimation tasks into\r\na joint optimization. The research focuses on opportunities to realize, in\r\njointly optimized subsystems, the gains that are essential for future\r\ncommunication systems.\r\n",
