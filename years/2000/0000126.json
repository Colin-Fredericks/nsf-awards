 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n This proposal attempts to design an efficient power conditioning system for PV interconnection to a residence. The design is based on DC-DC converter and Inverter topology, and this topology itself is not a new scheme; it has been used in many cases of PV systems.  Also, the proposed scheme is designed to use the maximum power point (Voltage or current) derived from a MPPT algorithm (which assumed to be installed in a microcomputer based system).  Actually, the main reason that the MMPT is not well accepted in a small PV project is that the high-cost of the computer based maximum power tracker.  The PV market and application have yet to justify the adoption of MPT in terms of the benefit of just a little more power drawn from the PV cells against the initial costs of the MPT.   In a small size PV application, more economical power tracker is highly sought.  In addition, if the DC-DC converter is included in the proposed scheme, could the DC-DC control scheme, such as current control, accommodate the MPPT control?  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
