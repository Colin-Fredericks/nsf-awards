 "awd_abstract_narration": "The simple process of transforming the present tense of an English verb into its past-tense form has dominated the debate between two fundamentally different views of language knowledge and processing. According to traditional, symbolic theories, language knowledge takes the form of explicit rules operating over discrete, symbolic representations. By contrast, according to connectionist or neural-network theories, language processing involves the massively parallel interaction of large numbers of neuron-like processing units.\r\n\r\n\tThe principal objective of the proposed work is to implement a\r\nconnectionist-style computational model that demonstrates the differential\r\ninfluence of semantic and phonological factors on past-tense production and in\r\nturn, derives novel predictions that could be assessed by future\r\nneuropsychological testing.\r\n\r\n\tThe computational simulations will extend preliminary work by\r\nJoanisse and Seidenberg in which verb processing involved the parallel\r\ninteraction of representations of phonology (both in comprehension and\r\nproduction) and their meanings. The proposed simulations will incorporate more\r\nrealistic representations and temporal dynamics. An initial stage of modeling\r\nwill employ fixed-length phonological representations of monosyllabic verb\r\nstems, but a second stage will employ continuous-time trajectories for\r\nphonological input and output capable of handling multisyllabic items. Semantic\r\nrepresentations will be derived from a number of analyses of large text\r\ncorpora, including Lund and Burgess' Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL),\r\nwhich will be replicated if necessary in order to make the resulting semantic\r\nrepresentations publicly available for unrestricted use by other researchers.\r\n  \r\n\tThe development of a strongly theoretically motivated connectionist computational model of selective impairments in English past-tense formation will not only provide important insights into the role of semantic and phonological representations in lexical processing, but also more generally about the fundamental character of the principal components, and their interactions, in the language system.\r\n\r\n",
