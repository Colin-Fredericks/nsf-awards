 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to develop nanoscale methods to manipulate nanoparticle chain aggregates (NCA) and measure their properties. These aggregates exhibit elastic properties, which have been observed for several metal oxides composed of particles in the 5 to 10 nm size range.  Measurement of the bond energies between particles and characterization of the elasticity are of interest, and complementary theoretical work will interpret the measurements in terms of fundamental properties of particle bonds. \r\n A systematic investigation of aggregates would advance fundamental understanding and have broad technological implications.  The proposed research covers four areas.  An improved laser ablation generator for NCA synthesis will be designed to permit the production of more monodisperse particles.  Bond energies and elastic properties of the NCAs will be measured by atomic force microscopy.  High-speed video analysis of NCA stretching will be used to characterize elastic properties.  Theoretical studies will relate measured NCA properties to primary particle size and material properties.  Methods of relating experiment and theory include a statistical model of restructuring, grain boundary sliding, and van der Waals forces. The model has the potential for quantitative predictions.  This work has the potential for application to improving the performance of materials produced from nanoparticles including filled rubber and ceramics. \r\n",
