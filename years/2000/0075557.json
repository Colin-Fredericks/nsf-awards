 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate a theoretical foundation for a major responsibility of  enterprise systems to ensure that the right information about the enterprise is available to decision makers at the right time.  The Internet and e-commerce are rapidly creating an environment in which businesses can be usefully likened to organisms which must tap into the relevant features of their environments to make rapid life/death decisions-where even what is relevant is continually in flux.  The primary focus of this project is to formulate an approach  to incorporating flexibility in connecting decision-makers (brain)  to dynamically  relevant data sources (internal and external environment) to support time-critical decisions.  Within  this framework, the research will study the application of  model-driven data acquisition,  filtering and attention mechanisms to achieve flexible sensor-to-decision maker connectivity.\r\n\r\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) systems  are a response to the realization that manufacturing control systems cannot function in isolation from other major enterprise functions.  The  objectives of  ERP systems should also include standardization of principal functional modules to minimize customization and enhance reusability.  The ultimate result of this research would be a framework for scalable enterprise system development that does not constrain the continued development of the framework as would a pure software code-based approach.  Based on a mathematical formalism, the modules developed would not be bound to any one technology but would be amenable to  transition to scalable network infrastructures as they evolve. The development of a model-based framework for goal-driven data delivery could ultimately guide the  design of scalable data management as well as other standardized modules in flexible corporate enterprise systems.\r\n\r\n",
