The US organizer is Dork Sahagian of the University of New Hampshire, and his Brazilian co-organizer is Carlos Nobre from INPE in Brazil.  The workshop will help to develop modeling capabilities of the research community working in Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiments in Amazonia (LBA), train participants in ecological modeling using \"hands-on\" experience, and foster collaboration between Amazonian scientists and US and other researchers for joint international projects.  Participants will be selected from early to mid-career researchers who are in the strongest position to contribute regional data and understanding to the workshop and disseminate the capabilities obtained to their colleagues and students.\r\n\r\nThe workshop takes an Amazonian focus within a global context and is oriented toward education and outreach rather than actual model development.  The issues addressed in this workshop are central to the activities of the Task Force on Global Analysis, Interpretation, and Modeling (GAIM), an element of the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP).\r\n",
