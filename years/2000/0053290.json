 "awd_abstract_narration": "This southwestern project addresses the growing employment demand for trained Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technicians and analysts. This project also focuses on state-of-the-art GIS curriculum development incorporating work-based SCANS competencies and career-pathways into GIS degree programs. Research-based findings in technology education and minority student success, career pathways and project-based laboratory experiences form the basis for the further development of national skill standards. The objectives for the project include the: 1) Development of a series of work-based laboratory exercises that are employer-driven exposing students to the problems associated with the design and collection of reliable and accurate data sets using GPS and GIS programs; 2) Training of area secondary school faculty in the application of GIS and GPS as they apply to a variety of occupations that incorporate GIS components into current Technical Preparation agreements; 3) Increasing the number of rurally-isolated, minority secondary students who choose to participate in post-secondary GIS/GPS training for employment in currently unfilled GIS positions; 4) Working with the leading GIS and GPS software\r\ncompanies in the development of industry-based skill standards; and 5) Sharing the curriculum developed with other colleges and NSF.\r\n\r\n",
