 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Koch   is investigating  critical  behavior  in  Hamiltonian\r\nsystems and models from statistical  mechanics.  Such behavior appears\r\nto be  attributed not  to  individual  systems,  but to  manifolds  of\r\nsystems.  In  the renormalization group   approach to these phenomena,\r\none attempts to identify these manifolds as the invariant manifolds of\r\na transformation acting  on the space of  systems  considered.  Such a\r\n\"renormalization group   transformation\", acting on  Hamiltonians, was\r\nintroduced in a previous project.  It is expected to have a nontrivial\r\nfixed point,  whose stable manifold describes  the critical breakup of\r\ncertain invariant   tori.  One  of  the  main goals  is  to  prove the\r\nexistence of such a fixed point.  The proposed method involves the use\r\nof a computer, to carry out the large number of estimates that will be\r\nneeded.  Another goal is to use the known or anticipated properties of\r\nthe  fixed  point in order to   describe  critical invariant  tori and\r\nnearby periodic orbits.  Extensions  of renormalization group  methods\r\nto  other  (problems in) Hamiltonian systems   will be investigated as\r\nwell.   Some interesting formal connections  with quantum field theory\r\nand statistical mechanics  also suggest new   ways of approaching  old\r\nproblems in these areas.  One  of the long term  goals in this area is\r\nto gain a better understanding of the critical  behavior of Ising type\r\nmodels.  The approach here is to  find and study suitable improvements\r\nof the corresponding hierarchical  model.  Other interesting questions\r\nconcern  the hierarchical model  itself, and two  fixed point problems\r\nrelevant to disordered media. \r\n\r\nMuch  of this   project  is related  to  the question  of stability in\r\nclassical   Hamiltonian systems.    Examples are  coupled oscillators,\r\ncertain  plasma beams, and models   from celestial mechanics.  In  the\r\ncase  of two degrees  of freedom, quasiperiodic  orbits that trace out\r\nsmooth invariant tori divide phase space into regions from which other\r\ntrajectories cannot   escape, thus  adding  to   the stability  of the\r\nsystem.  The breakup of such tori, as system parameter are varied, can\r\ncause the  dynamics to become locally  unstable or chaotic.  Numerical\r\nstudies  reveal that this   happens  in a highly  universal  way, with\r\ncertain measurable quantities taking exactly the same values, within a\r\nlarge class of systems.  The standard explanation of these findings is\r\nbased  on  the assumption that  there  exists a nontrivial Hamiltonian\r\nsystem  that is  invariant  under a  suitable  \"renormalization  group\r\ntransformation\".  The goal  here is to  prove that this assumption  is\r\ncorrect.  Part of the proof will  be carried out by  a computer.  This\r\nwork  should  yield valuable  insight into   the  mechanism behind the\r\nobserved phenomena, and at the same time, advance the state of the art\r\nin computer-assisted proofs -- a  technique that will undoubtedly play\r\nan  important role in  the  future of mathematical research.   Similar\r\nuniversality  phenomena  are  associated   with  phase transitions  in\r\ncondensed matter  physics,  and  models from  several  other  areas in\r\nmathematics and physics.  A more  general form  of universality -- the\r\nfact  that macroscopic   descriptions are possible   without the exact\r\nknowledge  of  microscopic details   -- is in   fact  at the  heart of\r\nphysics and other sciences.  The projects under investigation are part\r\nof a long  term effort to understand such  phenomena, and  to describe\r\nthem mathematically.  A correct  mathematical  description can also be\r\nexpected  to lead to significant improvements in numerical algorithms.\r\n\r\n",
