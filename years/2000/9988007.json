Eastwood\r\nThe Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site project will bring eight undergraduate students, recruited nationally, to Flagstaff, Arizona for individual research experiences in astronomy. The program is open to undergraduates at all levels. The students will be paired with mentors from Northern Arizona University, the Lowell Observatory, the Flagstaff station of the U. S. Naval Observatory, the astrogeology branch of the U. S. Geological Survey, or visiting members of the National Undergraduate Research Observatory. Although not every field in astronomy research is available every summer, possible projects include work in planetary sciences, stellar astrophysics, extragalactic astrophysics, astrogeology, and instrumentation. In some of the projects, the students will have the opportunity to conduct observations on local telescopes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their research work, students will attend a seminar series consisting of research talks by local and visiting scientists. At the conclusion of the summer, each student will turn in a written report of their work and will give an oral presentation of the results of the research.  As part of the experience, each student will receive three hours of university credit and will be housed together in a campus dormitory. Four students each year will be selected, and travel support offered, to present their work at a national professional scientific meeting.\r\n***\r\n",
