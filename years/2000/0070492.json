 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with two main projects. The former focuses on\r\nvarious questions in sub-Riemannian geometry and in the closely connected\r\nanalysis of sub-elliptic pde's and systems. The PI proposes to investigate\r\nthe classification of non-negative entire solutions to non-linear\r\nequations in groups of Heisenberg type, and compute the best constants in\r\nthe Folland-Stein Sobolev embedding. This program is instrumental to a\r\npossible attack of the compact CR Yamabe problem in the open case of CR\r\nmanifolds of co-dimension higher than one. The geometric case of such\r\nembedding will also be investigated along with the relative isoperimetric\r\ninequalities. The PI also proposes to study the regularity of minimal\r\nsurfaces, the question of traces on lower dimensinal sub-manifolds of\r\nfunctions having integrable horizontal derivatives. The basic boundary\r\nvalue problems, such as the Dirichlet and the Neumann problem will also be\r\ninvestigated, and a theory of variational inequalities and regularity of\r\n\"free boundaries\" will be developed. The second project is concerned with\r\nvarious problems in which symmetry plays an important role. One of them is\r\nconcerned with the determination of the extremal functions in the\r\nTomas-Stein restriction theorem for the Fourier transform. Other problems\r\nare connected with symmetry in the exterior obstacle problem, a conjecture\r\nof De Giorgi connected to minimal surfaces, and symmetry in the evolution\r\nof surfaces driven by mean curvature.\r\n\r\n\r\nPartial differential equations and systems formed by the latter are the\r\nbasic laws which describe most natural phenomena. An understanding of the\r\nphysical world also requires grasping the underlying geometric structure\r\nof the latter in its various forms. The present proposal belongs to that\r\nmainstream of research which sits at the confluence of the theory of\r\npartial differential equations and systems, both linear and non-linear,\r\nand their connections with an emerging type of geometry, called\r\nsub-Riemannian geometry. Both theories have witnessed an explosion of\r\ninterest in the last decade and they continue to attract the interest of\r\nvarious schools of mathematicians both nationwide and abroad. Another main\r\npart of this proposal is devoted to the study of physical and mathematical\r\nproblems in which symmetry plays an important role. Symmetry is present\r\neverywhere in nature, a remarkable instance being the fundamental laws\r\nof gravitation and electrostatic attraction. The study of conditions under\r\nwhich a given natural phenomenon develops symmetries is both important for\r\nits practical consequences (the presence of symmetries\r\ndrastically reduces the human effort) and for its implications\r\nin the furthering of our knowledge.\r\n\r\n",
