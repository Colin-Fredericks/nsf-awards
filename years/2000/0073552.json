 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to extend the present performance limits of pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) through the development of a digital signal processing technique that corrects for analog circuit mismatches.  With recent trends toward software reconfigurability and digital signal processing, pipelined ADCs have become widely used in applications such as cellular telephone base-stations and wideband wireline modems.  However, analog component mismatches have limited the accuracy achieved by present fabricated pipelined ADCs to levels below those desirable in many communications applications.  For example, the accuracy ceiling imposed by analog component mismatches in present pipelined ADCs with conversion rates at or above 10MHz is approximately 75dB peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion (SINAD).  Several distinct mismatch calibration techniques have been proposed in recent years to address the mismatch problem, but so far they have not made it possible to break through the above-mentioned 75dB SINAD ceiling.  The problem is that the calibration techniques proposed to date are ultimately limited by the precision of their analog components, which tends to decrease as the conversion rate is increased.  This research involves the development of a new pipelined ADC mismatch calibration technique that avoids this problem. The new technique differs from other mismatch calibration schemes in that it continuously measures and cancels noise in the ADC output arising from component mismatches during normal operation of the ADC; no special calibration signals or auto-calibration phase are required prior to A/D conversion.  Both the measurement and cancellation of mismatch noise are performed entirely using digital logic, but unlike previously proposed digital calibration techniques the technique does not require additional pipeline stages or bits per stage. The objectives of the research are to 1) refine the technique, 2) quantify its performance limits through simulation and theoretical analyses, and 3) develop a CMOS pipelined ADC prototype that achieves record-setting performance enabled by the technique as a proof-of-principle.\r\n",
