 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the complexity of the Internet, the nature of its applications, and its socioeconomic framework evolve, new algorithmic and architectural ideas will be proposed, tested, and adopted.  While the original Internet design principles will likely remain valid, the researchers believe that it is important to have in place a mathematical framework within which these design principles can be expressed and applied to the next generation of Internet algorithms and architectures.  Building such a framework is the ultimate goal.  The mathematical tools will come from optimization, game theory and competitive analysis. The researchers shall work on the following topics.\r\n\r\nMulticast.  The researchers shall seek to determine the relative efficiency, in terms of link usage, of multicast versus unicast, devise and analyze efficient methods of multicast error recovery, and determine how efficiently multicast can be simulated in the application layer by a coordinated set of unicasts.\r\n\r\nCongestion Probing.  The TCP congestion control protocol controls its window size with an additive-increase and multiplicative-decrease  (AIMD) algorithm.  One can think of this as a probing algorithm in  which the flow attempts to discover the maximum rate of traffic that\r\ncan be send under current conditions; if a packet drop is recorded it is assumed the bandwidth rate was too high and so the window size is reduced. The researchers shall develop efficient probing algorithms and  theoretical limits on the efficiency of probing under different models of Internet congestion.\r\n\r\nCost Sharing. How are the recipients of a multicast transmission to share the network costs?  The researchers assume that the information to be multicast is of a certain value to each possible recipient, but this value is private to that individual. The researchers shall investigate strategyproof cost sharing methods where each user is assured that their outcome is maximized if they truthfully reveal their value to the network.  The researchers' goal is to characterize the set of protocols that are acceptable on both game-theoretic and complexity grounds.\r\n\r\nInformation Dissemination.  While traditional databases require transactional consistency, many repositories of information require only the much weaker notion of eventual consistency.  That is, in such cases we care only whether, and how quickly, the information is disseminated, but do not require global consistency during the dissemination. The researchers shall identify message-efficient strategies for selectively propagating information so that the network will eventually converge to a fully updated state.\r\n\r\n",
