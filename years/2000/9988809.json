 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract :\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator is Michael Shub. Shub and co-workers\r\nPugh, Wilkinson and others have established the stable ergodicity of a\r\nwide range of partially hyperbolic dynamical systems which preserve a\r\nsmooth volume element, thus establishing the statistical robustness of\r\nthese chaotic systems. The thrust of the work proposed is to extend\r\nthese results to include almost all partially hyperbolic systems and to\r\neliminate the hypothesis of volume preservation. This is an ambitious goal,\r\nbut the results obtained included the development of new tools,  namely\r\njulienne quasi-conformality and julienne density point preservation of the\r\nstable holonomy maps, whose power has not been fully explored. \r\nA second theme is a study of the complexity of continuous problems centered around the\r\nanalysis and application of variants of Newton's method.\r\n\r\nChaotic dynamical systems are pervasive in scientific, engineering and\r\nnumerical simulation applications. The proposed work would lay foundations\r\nfor the statistical analysis of these systems, whose deterministic behavior is\r\nunpredictable due to the presence of sensitive dependence on initial\r\nconditions. Newton's method for solving systems of equations is one of\r\nthe main algorithms of numerical analysis. A better understanding of its\r\nproperties and those of variants can make the solution of problems of\r\nscientific and engineering origin more efficient.\r\n\r\n",
