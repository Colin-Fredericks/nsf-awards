 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems associated with building complex heterogeneous systems \r\ncomposed of computer, human, and electromechanical components are starting\r\nto overwhelm system and software engineers, resulting in failed projects\r\nand accidents related to software behavior.  As the complexity of the \r\nsystems grows, so does the difficulty of ensuring safety.  \r\n\r\nModel-based system and software engineering is an approach to building \r\ncomplex systems that is based on common models and specification languages \r\nthat are understandable and reviewable by all the engineers on the project \r\nand by those who must interact with and use the automation as well.  The \r\nresearch topics to be investigated are: (1) enhancing requirements \r\nspecification reviewability, (2) assisting engineers in creating large, \r\ncomplex specifications, (3) minimizing the disruptions caused by changes \r\nin requirements, and (5) specifying and analyzing safety-related \r\nproperties using the models.\r\n\r\nTo ground the research, the new approaches will be applied experimentally\r\nto the advanced air traffic control systems being developed and\r\nvalidated by Eurocontrol (the European Organization for the Safety of\r\nAir Navigation).  ATC provides a challenging testbed but the results\r\nof the research should be equally applicable to medical, defense,\r\ntransportation, manufacturing, and other complex, real-time systems.\r\n",
