 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific objectives of this research are fourfold.  First, a thorough investigation of the Co(0) catalyzed Pauson-Khand reaction will be carried out with emphasis given to ligand control of the relative and absolute stereochemical outcome of ring formation.  Second, ligand control of asymmetric Rh(I) catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition processes will be studied.  Third, the rational design and synthesis of structurally differentiated, enantiopure P-chiral phosphine ligands will be carried out.  Fourth, the ligands will be evaluated in asymmetric bond forming reactions including Ir(I) catalyzed hydrogenations, Cu(I) catalyzed nucleophilic epoxide openings and 1,4-additions to unsaturated substrates.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Tom Livinghouse of the Department of Chemistry at Montana State University.  Professor Livinghouse will focus his work on developing  new methods for metal mediated ring formation and asymmetric ligand design.  Motivation for the research is provided by the growing need for many substances in a stereoisomerically pure state.  The research will have broader impacts for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and for the training of graduate students.",
