 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at developing and demonstrating an innovative information-rich and real-time system for particle characterization.  Encouraged by results from Phase I which established the feasibility of using polarized light scattering for characterization of micron, sub-micron and nano-sized ceramic particles, Synergetic Technologies proposes to develop an accurate and reliable on-line instrument.  Phase I illustrated the high accuracy achievable, the ability to detect and quantify nano-size particles, and the capability of determining the size distribution of high aspect ratio whiskers and irregularly shaped particles.  Project tasks include: system design, construction, calibration and testing; software development for more accurate shape determination and automized system use; study of different lasers; and testing and demonstration at three potential customer sites (a major ceramic research university, a large industrial research laboratory, and a small company at the leading edge of nanomaterials production). The University of Kentucky staff and students will assist in this project.\r\n \r\nThe ability to measure fine particle sizes and shapes on-line is necessary for controlling the quality of many high technology products, such as advanced ceramics and pharmaceuticals.  In addition, monitoring and controlling particle size is fundamental to the manufacture of many consumer products, medical products, food processing and environmental monitoring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
