PRI will establish a Technology Desk and assign a reporter full-time to covering technology.  In addition, \"The World\" will benefit from the full resources of the BBC Science Unit.  Technology reports will be produced in several radio formats including:\r\n\r\n At least 26 direct news reports annually (approximately four minutes each)\r\n Technology updates in daily newscasts (approximately 52 minutes per year)\r\n A weekly Lab Report highlighting emerging technologies (approximately three minutes each)\r\n Three monthly in-depth features (Approximately five minutes each) \r\n Two major annual in-depth series of five installments each (approximately six minutes each)\r\n\r\nThis emphasis on the latest technology developments will provide listeners with up-to-date information about important developments in such areas as nanotechnology and micro-electrical machines, quantum cryptography and genetic manipulation of agricultural products.  In depth reports would cover topics such as the Human Genome Project and the influence of technology on archaeology.\r\n  \r\nPRI will work with the Exploratorium in San Francisco to design and produce outreach components for the project.  A web resource will be developed to extend and deepen technology covered in broadcasts over the radio.  It will include further information about topics, directions for conducting experiments, transcripts of technology reports and bibliographies of additional resources.  \r\n\r\nPRI and the Exploratorium also will implement a three-year pilot project to involve children from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods in the creation of online broadcasts (webcasts) on technology-related themes.  This element of the project will determine whether programming derived from a news program and produced by children for children is an effective production model and whether the model is appropriate for replication.\r\n",
