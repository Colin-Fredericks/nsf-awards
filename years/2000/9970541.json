It is the goal of YAMS to introduce the next generation of analysts in the southeastern region of the U.S. -- graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty -- to the existing community of operator theorists and functional analysts in that part of the country, thereby establishing contacts that will be of help to members of the younger generation in their mathematical development. The duration of a typical YAMS conference is five or six days. The program is normally built around a principal speaker, who delivers a series of five or six hour-long lectures. Talks by ten senior and ten junior invited speakers of lengths 40 and 30 minutes, respectively, fill out the program. The YAMS organizers make special efforts to attract recent Ph.D.s and graduate students as participants in the conferences. Their hope is that YAMS will provide a unique opportunity for graduate students and more experienced researchers alike to gain valuable exposure to some of the exciting advances in the operator theory/operator algebras field. \r\n\r\nThe Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) has been held annually at numerous venues in the region for the past fifteen years, in most cases with the help of partial support from the NSF. The purpose of the meeting is to encourage the interchange of the latest developments and ideas in various areas of analysis, with special attention directed to the mathematical development of junior faculty and graduate students.\r\n",
