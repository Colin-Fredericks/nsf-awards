 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nThis project develops a laboratory and revised environmental studies curricula in which spatial perspective and geographic analyses are integrated at all levels. It adapts materials from exemplary projects at West Chester University and Stockton State College. It provides resources at the Alfred University Hydrologic Field Site for students to collect, input, and interpret relevant spatial data and develop meaningful visual representations of the analyses they perform.\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Studies Program (ENS) offers a multidisciplinary approach to undergraduate education, emphasizing experiential learning, problem solving, and technology integration in its curriculum.  Incorporating a spatial perspective into the Environmental Studies (ENS) major substantially enriches the curriculum because spatial visualization skills are positively related to improved learning in environmental studies. Adaptations of GIS and GPS materials from other institutions are being incorporated into ENS courses, adding a spatial dimension to analytical and field exercises. Students at all levels use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology as a tool to improve their understanding of the local area. As the ENS faculty revise courses to incorporate spatial exercises or modules, they are taking advantage of new pieces of equipment that facilitate the collection of spatial data, including a large-format digitizer and a Global Positioning System (GPS). For class-based projects or independent research, coordinating this equipment with the existing GIS capabilities substantially enhances a student's ability to gather, analyze, interpret and display spatial data, leading to improved spatial and visualization skills.\r\n\r\n",
