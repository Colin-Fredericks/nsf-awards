The students selected for the program will work closely with a faculty mentor on cutting-edge projects in such fields as solar physics, planetary astronomy, stellar astrophysics, the interstellar medium and star formation, normal and active galaxies, cosmology, and instrumentation development.  Each student will participate in at least one observing run related to his or her project. The program will be student-centered and will have many supplemental activities such as seminars, journal clubs, and discussion groups. These activities will be designed to allow students to learn about front-line research from the scientists that are doing it, and to develop their skills in discussing their research projects with their peers. At the end of the summer program, participants will create poster and verbal presentations describing their research projects. Each year the two students whose projects are judged to be best by a panel of faculty will receive support to attend a national scientific meeting to present their results.  The students will meet biweekly with the principal and co-principal investigators to review the progress on the projects.  An external evaluator will work with the project team in assessing the impact of the program. The evaluator will meet with the students over a period of 3 days, both at the beginning and end of the summer. Post-program tracking of the participants will be undertaken to assess the long-term impact of the summer research experience on the participants' scientific careers.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Division of Astronomical Science.\r\n***\r\n",
