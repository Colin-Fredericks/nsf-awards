 "awd_abstract_narration": "To reduce the risks associated with software faults, the research \r\nfocuses on a fault tolerance method based on controlled execution \r\nwith lookahead.  In this approach, a program is run in a lookahead \r\nmode without affecting the external environment. During lookahead, \r\nsufficient information is traced so that it can be analyzed for faults.  \r\nIf the analysis of the execution shows that there are no faults, then \r\nthe lookahead execution is committed and its effects are visible to \r\nthe environment.  Otherwise, the results from the lookahead execution \r\nare discarded, and the system is run in a controlled mode. In this mode, \r\nthe system exercises control by introducing additional synchronization \r\nor by changing the order of messages to avoid the fault that occurred \r\nduring lookahead.\r\n\r\nThere are three main components of the project - algorithms for\r\ndetection of software faults, algorithms for automatic\r\ncontrol such as insertion of control messages and reordering of\r\nmessages based on lookahead, and a system which supports controlled\r\nexecution with lookahead.  For detection of software faults, \r\nprevious algorithms will be extended to work for more general model of\r\ncomputation in the presence of failures. For automatic control, the project \r\nwill focus on synchronization faults in concurrent programs.\r\nFinally, a system in Java that supports controlled\r\nexecution with lookahead will be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
