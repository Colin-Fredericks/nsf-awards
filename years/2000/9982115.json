 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for the Cold Spring Harbor summer course on Arabidopsis Molecular Genetics.  This course is a continuation of the course that has been funded by the National Science Foundation since its inception 15 years ago.  The current emphasis on Arabidopis as a model plant for the laboratory portion of the course reflects the current research interests of many US and international labortories, allows students to take advantage of a wealth of genomic resources, and allows the course participants to focus on one system as they learn the more general biological or technical principals being taught.  The course is designed to fulfill a growing need within the plant science community for training in this area.  The intention is (1) to teach state of the art molecular techniques to scientists already involved in plant research so that they can apply these technologies to their own future resarch and (2) to teach scientists familiar with microbial, animal or plant systems about current research in plant biology using Arabidopsis as the model plant sytem.  The course consists of a rigorous lecture series a hands-on laboratory and informal discussions.  Speakers will provide both an in-depth discussion of their work and an overview of their specialty.  Many of these speakers will be experts in plant systems other than Arabidopsis thaliana; others will be non-plant scientists expert in disciplines that apply to all biological systems.  The laboratory sessions provide an intensive training in modern techniques in plant biology and reinfored the lessons learned in lecture.",
