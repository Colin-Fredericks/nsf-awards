 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)  Phase I project.   Innovative approaches are now needed to utilize the information generated from genome research in an integrated fashion to analyze, interpret, and predict the function of biological systems to assist in the development of novel therapeutics and the advancement of biotechnology on the whole. This proposal addresses these needs with novel engineering approaches for studying the systemic capabilities of metabolism in completely sequenced bacterial genomes to address the emerging healthcare threat of antibacterial resistance. The overall objective of the proposed research is the in silico identification of the minimal gene deletion sets that are capable of rendering cellular\r\nmetabolic networks inoperable. This involves the construction of genome specific stoichiometric models of cellular metabolism from genomic information and the subsequent application of convex analysis to determine the set of extreme pathways that can be used to assess the complete production capabilities and functions of the metabolic network.  From the set of extreme pathways algorithms can be constructed to identify sets of\r\nreactions and their associated genes whose loss to the network is critical or lethal under various combinations of environmental and genetic conditions. The identification of these sensitive or critical steps in metabolism based on their concerted effects represents a new paradigm in the search for antimicrobial chemotherapeutics and the rational metabolic engineering of industrial bacteria. These research efforts will lead to the validation of in silico simulations used to identify minimal deletion sets to be used as molecular targets in the development of antibacterial chemotherapy. Therefore the direct commercial application is in the identification of targets for drug development. Additional applications for the identification of these condition specific sensitive steps in metabolism include the metabolic engineering of bacteria for bioprocesses, and\r\nbioremediation.\r\n",
