Similarly quantum K-theory is a deformation of ordinary \r\nK-ring of X.   In their study of Gromov--Witten K-theory, \r\nProfessor Lee and his collaborators have found some interesting relations to other fields in mathematics and physics including algebraic geometry, integrable systems, representation theory \r\nand quantum geometry.  These investigations also naturally lead \r\nto further investigations of Gromov--Witten theory itself.  The \r\nmain focus of this project will be on quantum cohomology, quantum K-theory and their relations to discrete KdV hierarchies, Toda lattices, and enumerative geometry. \r\n\r\nGromov-Witten theory is a new subject that lies within the\r\nintersection of many traditional branches of mathematics and \r\ntheoretical physics.  This theory was originally discovered \r\nwithin string theory.  Shortly thereafter people found many new applications to mathematics.  Some of these applications solved\r\nproblems that, based on traditional methods, were considered to\r\nbe very difficult.  The tools used to study Gromov--Witten theory \r\nalso involves many fields, including algebraic geometry, topology \r\nand analysis.  Thus, this is a growing new field which exhibits \r\nmany rich structures and deserves further investigation\r\n",
