Several extant and future technologies call for the \r\ncontrol of quantum systems - semiconductor heterostructures, \r\nspectroscopy, atomic lasers, quantum information processing, control of \r\nmolecular dynamics, to name a few. Many of these problems can, after \r\njudicious modeling and optimization, be recast as the problem of \r\npreparing desired unitary generators, via an external control acting on a \r\nquantum system. This leads quickly to the problem of path planning for \r\nsystems with drift on Lie groups, via controls that are constrained. Path \r\nplanning for systems with drift, with few and constrained inputs, has not \r\nhitherto been studied. The only other alternatives for the control of \r\nquantum systems are computationally expensive optimization, and \r\ntracking which relies heavily on intuition. In this project the role of \r\nintuition and optimization will be limited to reformulating a given physical \r\nobjective as state preparation for a quantum system. The latter problem \r\nwill be attacked by developing structured factorization of unitary matrices, \r\nthe structure being determined by the constraints. The resulting control \r\ndesign will be compared with other techniques such as inversion and \r\noptimal control.  Applications to lasing without inversion, molecular \r\ncontrol, quantum computing and information will be then carried out. \r\nRelated issues, such as tractable descriptions of reachable sets of quantum \r\nsystems, will also be studied. The second part of the project stems from \r\nthe fact that the extant non-linear control schemes are rarely directly \r\napplicable in singular situations such as a varying rank decoupling matrix \r\nand a change in relative degree. Tools from singularity theory, the theory \r\nof foliations, nonsmooth analysis and Lie groups will be developed to \r\naddress this problem. A key feature will be the use of differential forms \r\ninstead of vector fields for studying such issues. This should also have \r\npayoffs for singular exterior differential systems. Applications to \r\ntechniques such as the method of intermediate integrals for partial \r\ndifferential equations and equations that change type will be studied from \r\nthis vantage point. It is worth remarking that both components of the \r\nproject call for similar mathematics.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this project should yield benefits for several \r\ncurrent and future technologies. For instance, the fabrication of a quantum \r\ncomputer calls for solutions to precisely the type of problems being \r\nstudied in the project. Similarly, obtaining a snapshot of chemical \r\nreactions at the molecular level also requires the control of quantum \r\nprocesses. Active control of quantum phenomena would also lead to the \r\ncontrol of chemical reactions via tuned lasers. This should enhance \r\nproduct specificity in chemical reactions, thereby minimizing the presence \r\nof products that are not desired. The control of quantum phenomena is still \r\nin its infancy. The project aims to move it along further by linking it \r\nconcretely to traditional control theory. Conversely, the results of the \r\nproject should shed light on the control of macroworld systems. This will \r\nalso have benefits for traditional technologies such as robotics, consumer \r\nelectronics and electrical networks, since the underlying mathematics is \r\nquite similar. From a didactic point of view, the project's contribution will \r\nbe to show to undergraduates and graduate students alike that advanced \r\nmathematics is not an arid field, but is in fact a lively process with \r\npalpable connections to real life situations. This should enhance the \r\nlikelihood of students, especially from under represented groups, to pursue \r\nhigher education in mathematics, science and technology.\r\n",
