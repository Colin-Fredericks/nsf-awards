Malek, Materials Research Laboratory and Dr. Della Roy, Professor (Emeritus) of Materials Science at Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Essam El-Rafey, Head, Materials Science Department, Institute of Graduate Study and Research, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt. These scientists propose to study the mechanisms of deterioration of ancient buildings and monuments, and to find scientific basis for restoration.  The US and Egyptian investigators plan to collect, with appropriate supervision, samples of damaged monuments in Egypt.  They plan to diagnose the deterioration mechanism of these samples and compare them to other non-damaged samples under the same conditions.  The diagnosis methods will include X-ray diffraction, solid state Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MAS NMR), Raman and Infrared Spectroscopy, as well as more conventional methods such as color, porosity, water sorption, bulk specific gravity, hardness, compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and thermal expansion and conductivity.  They will attempt to determine appropriate repair mechanisms for these samples with several binders including cement grout, geopolymers, cementic polymer blends, and phosphate binders.  The compatibility of these binders with the masonry, longevity, adhesion, and color will be tested.\r\n\r\nScope: The proposal addresses an important area, that of study of the mechanisms of deterioration of ancient buildings and monuments and means of their restoration.  The project brings basic scientific knowledge to practice with actual field data for verifications. The two US PIs are experts in materials research, characterization, and analysis of material properties.  They have excellent research facilities at their institute. The Egyptian collaborating scientist is at one of that country's most respected research units in Egyptian universities. The international collaboration is well conceived and the expectation is that they will proceed to mutual benefit and will produce useful results. This project meets INT criteria for support of mutually beneficial cooperative research projects.  Funding for this project is provided by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems.\r\n",
