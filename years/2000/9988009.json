Students will conduct research in neural and behavioral sciences under the guidance of scientists from the Department of Biological Sciences and the Department of Psychology.\r\nThis 10-week summer research internship integrates five major components: (1) Faculty mentors will provide hands-on research experience to students in faculty laboratories, fostering the excitement of scientific discovery and allowing students to learn science by doing science. (2) Research faculty will present seminars in which they demonstrate research techniques and present their research results. (3) Professional development seminars will provide instruction on how to apply to graduate school and present scientific results at professional meetings.  At seminars, students will discuss ethical concerns in research, and will hear presentations about the Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Conunittee.  Cultural issues will also be addressed, including Native American attitudes toward the use of plants and animals in research. (4) Students will participate in weekly noon meetings where students can socialize and discuss the progress of their work. (5) At the end of the summer, students will present the results of their projects in a joint poster session ensuring that each student produces a tangible, research product at the end of IO weeks, that can be refined for presentation at a scientific meeting or submitted for publication.\r\nThis program will continue to refined based on evaluation results, the input of faculty mentors and current and former students, and the findings of social and educational research..  The goal since 1992 has been to prepare minority and first generation university students for graduate education in the Neural and Behavioral Sciences.  The program's contributions to date are significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
