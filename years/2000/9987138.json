 "awd_abstract_narration": "The baccalaureate is the terminal technical degree for many talented students at the University of Houston and across the country. Because of this, most of our graduates find employment in software development, manufacturing, plant operations, or sales, far from the process of creating either fundamental knowledge or new technology. However, Research and Development (R&D), particularly in the CSEMS fields, is the engine that drives productivity growth and increases our standard of living. It is important, therefore, that we motivate and prepare more of our students for careers in R&D. \r\n\r\nThe faculties of computer science, engineering and mathematics at the University of Houston have joined to propose the R&D Scholars Program, whose goal is to increase the number of students pursuing R&D careers. We will provide the following student-support infrastructure: a) An undergraduate research experience on a funded research project, b) A $2,500 summer research stipend in addition to the CSEMS scholarship, c) A special summer school course to develop basic research skills (planning, technical writing, presentations, and mathematical software tools), d) A seminar series on the nature of academic and industrial R&D, the historical importance of R&D to society, career planning and educational preparedness amid the uncertainties of the modern workplace, and R&D career opportunities, e) An undergraduate research advisor and graduate student mentor, f) Support for developing personal educational and career plans, g) Support for applying to graduate school, h) Job placement for graduates who elect to enter the workplace after graduation. \r\n\r\nPromising students will be selected on the basis of clearly defined criteria and provided with scholarship support from both NSF and UH sources. These students will participate in an intensive, advanced-level enrichment program, characterized by the development of research and communications skills and special mentoring opportunities, all within the context of high quality undergraduate and graduate programs in Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics. The proposed program complements several effective academic enrichment programs at UH that serve mainly freshman and sophomore students. The proposed program has enthusiastic faculty support, and the support of the Deans of the two Colleges involved. The program administrative organization is well-defined, and the evaluation protocol includes dynamic elements that will serve not only to document effectiveness, but to provide feedback for continual improvement and success of the program. \r\n",
