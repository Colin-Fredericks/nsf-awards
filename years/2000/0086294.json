 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blackfeet Community College (BCC) proposes to examine past activities of Phase I, look at\r\nwhat was learned, and continue into Phase II as a development grant. Phase I efforts in\r\ndeveloping and maintaining a comprehensive and sustainable systemic reform effort in\r\nmathematics, science, and technology fell short of expected activities and BCC has learned\r\nfrom its past activities.\r\nBCC will utilize the lessons learned from Phase I activities and will continue to promote\r\nthe NSF drivers while at the same time seek current strategies to assist in their effort\r\nto have a comprehensive program that will catapult Blackfeet Indian reservation and its\r\nstudents to meet the National standards. Special emphasis will be placed on a holistic\r\napproach to community reform using RSI activities as a springboard for a comprehensive\r\nreform effort.\r\n\r\nThere are fourteen K-8 schools (1,814 students) and two high schools (563 students) in the\r\nservice area of BCC. BCC will work with eight of these schools in a comprehensive effort\r\nfor systemic reform, impacting 1,777 (98%) in the K-8 area and 563 (100%) of the High\r\nSchool students. BCC will work with mathematics and science teachers and administrators\r\nthrough existing channels established during Phase I in setting goals and objectives for\r\nPhase I implementation activities. A task force made up of reservation school\r\nadministrators will be chaired by the BCC college administrator and will include all\r\nschool administrators of schools served. A mathematics task force will be developed and\r\nwill include area mathematics instructors (recommended by school site administrators) and\r\nBCC mathematics instructors. It is this group that will examine, recommend, and assess\r\nefforts in mathematics. Another task force in the sciences will be formed composed of all\r\nservice area science teachers and BCC science instructors. They will work closely with\r\nthe science curriculum of area schools and look at how they are involved in the overall\r\nreform effort.\r\n\r\nThe Phase II developmental efforts will continue to promote systemic reform in math\r\nand science education at two school districts consisting of six different school buildings\r\nlocated in rural Montana. The utmost goal of the program is to develop and maintain a\r\npopulation that is prepared to meet the needs of a technologically competent work force.\r\n\r\n",
