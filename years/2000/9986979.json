The university has academically strong, accredited degree programs in these areas and thus can provide high quality training to students who can gain access to it.  This campus has an enormous demand for mathematics and engineering scholarship money which it cannot come close to meeting. At the same time, they have several programs in place aimed at assisting students who fall into categories underrepresented in these fields but they are severely limited financially. The NSF scholarship program substantially improves the financial situation of many of these students.",
