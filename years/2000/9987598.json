This project will integrate ongoing interdisciplinary research efforts in our new Institute for Scientific Computing into a cooperative traineeship program.  The program will build upon existing high-performance computing related projects, many with industrial collaboration, to develop a concerted thrust in the area of scientific computing, a growing research strength at Wayne State University.  Active programs in computer intensive, data intensive, and real-time computing will form the core research that will be the hallmark of a new interdisciplinary Masters/Ph.D. curriculum.  The curriculum will consist of an integrated series of hands-on (lecture and laboratory) courses and seminars on scientific computing developed by university and industrial participants.  Graduate thesis training will be based on teaming where students work individually on different components of a major interdisciplinary project.  Programs using high performance computing in the following strategically important areas are envisioned:  (i) Medicine, Genetics, and Biochemistry, (ii) Chemistry, Physics, and Materials Science, and (iii) Automotive and Aerospace Systems.  This research-educational initiative has the active support of industry, particularly Ford, IBM, SGI, SUN, and CFD Research, who will provide substantial resources as a match to initiate this program and who will participate in lectures, research training, and oversight/assessment of the project.  Wayne State University will commit more than $2,320,000 in resources to support this program.  To ensure the success of this training program and to be competitive with the many opportunities in scientific computing, Wayne State University is supplementing the graduate stipends to give a total stipend of $23,266/year.  With this stipend and the strength of the training program, we will be able to recruit outstanding students.\r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.  The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing new, innovative models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the third year of the program, awards are being made to nineteen institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this specific award reside in the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Engineering, Biological Sciences, and Education and Human Resources.\r\n\r\n",
