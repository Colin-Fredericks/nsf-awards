 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nErich Kaltofen proposes to study mathematical optimization techniques on problem formulations that are  imprecise due to numerical data; randomization techniques that are the power tools in the design of fast algorithms with exact arithmetic on black box matrices; and generalization of the computer programs that implement these algorithms to multiple domains with methodologies such as generic, reusable programming and interface protocols.\r\n\r\n  A difficulty in the symbolic/numeric area is that inputs with imprecise coefficients as a result of a physical measurement or a numerical computation can lack a known property that is of interest. For example, instead of a double real root, a polynomial has two conjugate complex roots that are very close together.  The optimization problem is to compute efficiently the nearest input that has the desired singularity.\r\nOur focus will be on the nearest pair of polynomials with a common root under coefficient-wise change (infinity norm), the nearest singular Toeplitz matrix, and the nearest bi-variate complex polynomial that factors over the complex numbers, the latter two under any reasonable norm.\r\n\r\n   A black box matrix is stored as a function that performs the matrix-times vector product.  Efficient algorithms for performing linear algebra computations with exact field arithmetic, such as solving a linear\r\nsystem with a black box coefficient matrix, are based on the Lanczos/Wiedemann approach.\r\nRandomization techniques, for instance, matrix pre-conditioning and Krylov sub-spacing with random projections, avoid self-orthogonality when the coefficients are from a finite field and general algorithmic\r\nbreak-down due to certain invariant factors of the matrix. We propose to investigate how the different linear algebra problems are interelated, for example if the computation of a solution of an inhomogeneous black box linear system can be efficiently reduced to the  computation of a column dependency of a black box matrix.\r\n\r\n   Generic programming is a software design technique that generalizes a program so that it can be used with more than one underlying domain.  The proposed implementation of our black box algorithms not\r\nonly permits the plug-in of a black box matrix over a native coefficient field, but the code also imports internally needed operations like polynomial and vector operations from expertly fine-tuned existing packages across generic interfaces. Our library's application program interface provides a serialization mechanism for black box objects that is compliant with the MathML/OpenMath philosophy and that allows\r\nInternet communication.\r\n\r\n  Finally, we propose research on two classical problems. First, the polynomial-time computation of dense, low-degree factors of high-degree sparse multi-variate polynomials with rational coefficients, which would generalize a recent related result by Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr. Second, a time- and space-efficient realization of the transposition principle for transforming a matrix-times-vector function to the transpose vector-times-matrix operation.\r\n",
