The quintessential example of strongly correlated physics is the fractional quantum Hall effect.  In very strong magnetic fields the kinetic energy is completely degenerate, and the dynamics is determined by interactions alone.  The focus of the research is to investigate quantum phase transitions between possible phases of electrons in strong magnetic fields as various external tunable parameters (such as Landau-level mixing, sample thickness, disorder, and the Zeeman energy) are varied.  A new approach developed by the PI with Shankar will be used, supplemented by standard techniques.  The states to be studied include: fractional quantum Hall liquid; Wigner crystal; Hall crystal; p-wave superconducting composite fermion states and their inhomogeneous generalizations.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is grant to support theoretical research on the physics of correlated electrons.  The quintessential example of strongly correlated physics is the fractional quantum Hall effect.  In very strong magnetic fields the kinetic energy is completely degenerate, and the dynamics is determined by interactions alone.  The research will study a variety of configurations of these systems.  The results will be of fundamental importance and will possibly provide insight into device applications.\r\n***\r\n",
