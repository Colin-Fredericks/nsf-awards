Eggers\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nOver the next decade, highly scalable computer systems consisting of\r\nhundreds or thousands of nodes will become necessary to meet the\r\ndemands of emerging global applications, such as Web and database\r\nservers used for Internet commerce.  These applications must be\r\nmultithreaded to handle the thousands of simultaneous requests.  One\r\npromising technology for this scalable server domain is the use of\r\nmultithreaded processors; for example, Compaq has announced\r\nSimultaneous Multithreading (SMT) support for its Alpha processor \r\nin the 2002/2003 time frame.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no research has been conducted on multithreading\r\nsupport for operating systems or on how to structure operating systems\r\nfor multithreaded CPUs.  Yet the OS may be crucial in this environment;\r\ne.g., measurements show that a loaded web server can spend 75% of its\r\ntime in the OS.  The proposed research will develop the software\r\nenvironment to complement the multithreaded hardware environment\r\nprovided by SMT and other fine-grained parallel processors.  The\r\nresearch sits squarely between architecture and operating systems,\r\nexamining (1) the design and performance of multithreaded processors\r\nto support OS needs, and (2) the structure of operating systems in\r\nlight of the capabilities of multithreaded processors.  The research\r\nwill focus on these questions in the domain of highly parallel,\r\nrequest-driven workloads, such as Web servers and database servers.\r\n\r\n",
