 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jackson State Community College is conducting a project for recruitment, selection, registration, support services, and retention activities for students in Engineering Technology, Computer Technology, and Mathematics programs.  Jackson State, a state-supported, public two-year college, serves the substantially rural fourteen-county area of West Tennessee.  Two of these counties are majority African-American with a growing Hispanic population.  Due to its location in a predominantly low-income, rural area, many potential students require substantial amounts of financial aid in order to attend college on a full-time basis.  At this time, Jackson State has no endowment to support student scholarships.  Furthermore, some students are reticent to apply for financial aid.  Thus, this scholarship program funded by the National Science Foundation is improving the perceived image of financial aid and encouraging more students to apply.  College leaders are using an enhanced, systematic and professional program of public information and recruitment to result in forty eligible, full-time students for the three programs involved.\r\n\r\nThe program is supporting students to successful completion of the two-year degree programs. These support services include: informational recruiting sessions that outline the programs and provide realistic expectations for prospects; cohort selection and organization that enhance the social and intellectual experiences of students; careful selection of classes to ensure progress toward the degree; ongoing support services such as tutoring, special feedback groups, field trips, case-based learning in professional classes, and assignment of a faculty mentor.\r\n\r\nJackson State's technology programs have been structured to offer students a professional experience in both engineering and in computer technology along with incorporated workplace values and communication skills that are presented concurrently throughout the program.  University parallel courses are preparing students for success at the receiving institution, where students perform as well as native students.  The college provides job placement and career guidance to its students, and it maintains close articulation agreements with local and state four-year universities.  Scholarship students who participate in this program are being given careful attention and support throughout their career at Jackson State and beyond to the transfer institution or the workplace.\r\n\r\n",
