 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lay abstract\r\n\r\nThis proposal will support the construction of large-scale computer models of the mammalian cerebellar cortex.  The models constructed will be realistic in the sense that they will include what is currently known of the anatomy and physiology of the neurons and networks of this structure.  Because the models are realistic, modeling results can be used to guide experimental investigations and help in the interpretation of new experimental results.  Although no funds are requested to support animal research in this grant, the results will be invaluable for making animal research more efficient and effective.   This modeling effort will also take place in the context of a fundamentally new theory of cerebellar cortical function recently proposed y the P.I., which has grown out of previous basic research efforts, funded in part by NSF.  Although the work to be performed in this study is basic science, the theory that has been proposed has already generating new ways to look at cerebellar dysfunction in human patients, and will shortly result in clinical trials for new means of detecting cerebellar deficits.  The modeling efforts to be supported here will almost certainly continue to produce new ways of thinking about the function of this important structure.\r\n",
