This grant provides equipment, which will function in support of research as well as the university's teaching and undergraduate collaborative research mission. This grant provides for a JEOL 2010F field emission transmission electron microscope or equivalent.  The microscope along with several requested accessories would provide TEM resolution of 0.19 nm, STEM resolution of 0.17 nm, electron holography, magnetic domain imaging, high angle annular darkfield imaging, convergent beam electron diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy, and energy filtered imaging.  None of these techniques are presently available to University researchers.  Numerous new scientific investigations would be enabled with the new equipment. The instrument will support research in a variety of material systems including semiconductors, ceramics, metals, polymers, new materials, biomaterials and mesoporous materials.  The instrument will be housed at the Center for Advanced Microscopy, one of the University Core Facilities, that serves electron microscopy users from 49 different University departments.  One staff academic position will be entirely devoted to the TEM to ensure adequate instrument supervision, user supervision, instruction, and technique development. Instruction on the TEM will be integrated into several existing electron microscopy courses that serve a broad range of users. \r\n%%% \r\nMichigan State University is host to many scientific grants funded by NSF.  Many of these programs are in need of a modern transmission electron microscope.  These instruments are used to look at structure and interactions within matter.  They are useful in many diverse fields such as chemistry, geology, materials science, physics, biology, and medicine.  However, the present instruments at the University are in excess of 15 years old and do not have up-to-date capabilities.  Many new imaging methods have been discovered in recent years that enable scientists to see structures never seen before and to determine information about matter never available before.   Many of the scientists and students at the University could use this new equipment to make new discoveries.   These discoveries have practical applications in electronics, sensor materials, catalysis, absorbent materials, materials for environmental clean-up, petroleum refining and understanding of global ecological changes.  It will also significantly impact the discovery of new materials. Michigan State University has been given the funds to purchase a modern transmission electron microscope and to house it in the Center for Advanced Microscopy.  This University Center will have one scientist in charge of this new microscope.  That person will teach other scientists and students how to use it effectively in their research programs. Acquisition of this equipment will allow safe, effective training and research in electron microscopy of materials. The impact to the future education of students at MSU is expected to last for the next 15-20 years. Students from MSU will receive experience in using state-of-the-art instrumentation, whether they are bound for academics or a career in the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
