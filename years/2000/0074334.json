 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temam\r\n0074334\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues study nonlinear problems\r\nfrom meteorology, oceanography, and fluid mechanics, using the\r\nmathematical tools offered by analysis, the theory of nonlinear\r\npartial differential equations, dynamical systems theory, and\r\ncomputation.  The part of this project related to meteorology and\r\noceanography focuses on the following areas: (1)  Open boundary\r\nconditions for limited domain simulations and well posedness\r\nissues for meteorology and oceanography problems. (2)  Balanced\r\nand unbalanced models in atmosphere sciences. (3)  Well-posedness\r\nand stability problems in oceanography.  The fluid mechanics\r\ntopics focus on several aspects of turbulence theory, including\r\nthe connection between the conventional theory of turbulence, the\r\ndynamical systems approach, and the Navier-Stokes equations.  The\r\ninvestigators intend also to complete a research monograph on\r\nsome of these aspects of turbulence.\r\n     Central problems in meteorology and oceanography are\r\nconcerned with understanding and predicting the behavior of the\r\natmosphere and the ocean --- in what patterns do these fluids,\r\nair and water, move?  The mathematical equations that describe\r\nthe motions are difficult to analyze, and computations are also\r\ndifficult because the physical phenomena are complex and\r\nnonlinear.  In fluid mechanics, understanding fluid flows\r\ngenerally and turbulence in particular, and developing efficient\r\nnumerical methods to compute these flows, are major themes.  The\r\ninvestigators study several problems related to the behavior of\r\natmosphere and ocean fluid flows and to their effective\r\ncomputation.  They also study and develop computational methods\r\nfor turbulent fluid flows of importance for industrial processes.\r\n",
