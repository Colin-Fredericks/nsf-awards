 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though inherently a statistical issue, model evaluation lacks a unifying \r\nstatistical framework; this project supplies such. The foundation of the \r\nframework is the use of Bayesian techniques to quantify the degree to \r\nwhich a model captures an underlying reality; develop theory and methods \r\nthat allow dual use of data in both estimation of model inputs and \r\nevaluation of outputs; select evaluation functions, by which a model and \r\nreality are compared and through which flaws (causes of \"invalidity\") \r\nare found; and to design the collection of field and computer simulation \r\ndata. The building of the framework relies on specific formulations of \r\nproblems, motivated by testbed examples such as subsurface fluid flow \r\nmodels - where the computer model is deterministic but uncertainties are \r\npresent in the model inputs and specifications - and traffic simulators \r\n- where the model is intrinsically stochastic, in addition to having \r\nuncertain inputs.  \r\n  \r\nComputer models are everywhere and evaluating their fidelity to reality \r\nis central to assessing their effectiveness in understanding real \r\nphenomena (such as flow of pollutants through soil and into groundwater) \r\nand predicting results of innovative technologies (such as new signal \r\ntiming strategies to relieve traffic congestion in urban networks). This \r\nproject develops a statistical structure and basis for such evaluations \r\napplicable across the scientific and technological landscape.  In the \r\nprocess, the project creates the ingredients for a virtual laboratory \r\nto disseminate results, broaden involvement of other researchers (and \r\nusers), and establish a unique educational and training environment.",
