 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry  (GOALI) project will involve the principal investigator and researchers at the ALCOA Technical Center (ATC).  This award is to institute an integrated experimental-computational research program targeted at improving productivity and product quality.  This will be accomplished by developing advanced multiple scale computational models and software for simulating failure in materials processing and subsequent process design.  It will augment two newly initiated thrust areas at ATC on:  (1) understanding the effect alloy microstructure and process parameters on edge cracking in cold rolling processes; and  (2) improving cut-edge quality and minimize burr and debris in material shearing processes such as slitting.  Furthermore, collaborations with Scientific Forming Technologies Corporation (SFTC) and Ohio Supercomputer center will elevate the simulation software to the advanced level of high performance computing needed for solving complex industrial problems.\r\n\r\nExperimentally motivated-validated, multi-scale computer models will introduce adaptive multi-level hierarchy and represent details of material microstructure from quantitative metallography, to simulate ductile fracture.  The adaptive multi-level system of computational modules will concurrently predict variables at the scales of the work-piece and model localization and ductile fracture as a phenomenon of incidence, interaction and propagation of damage across the scales.  Adaptive hierarchy of computational sub-domains with varying resolutions will differentiate between non-critical and evolving critical regions and will zoom in at 'damaging hotspots' for pure microscopic simulations.  Microscopic stress and damage analysis of real microstructures will be done by the specially developed Voronoi cell finite element models.  The forming simulations will be coupled with design methodologies and software to predict 'optimal' microstructural constitution and process parameters.  Experiments on localization and failure in deformation processing will be performed, and will include mechanical testing of notched specimens for load-displacement and fracture toughness data, and real process like cold rolling and sheet metal shearing for \r\n",
