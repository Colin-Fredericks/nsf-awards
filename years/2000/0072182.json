More precisely there are three\r\noutstanding and closely related problems that I would like to\r\nwork on and hope to solve. The first is to prove the most general\r\nmirror principle for counting rational curves in any projective\r\nmanifold and its Calabi-Yau submanifolds; the second is to\r\nunderstand the geometry and algebra of the local mirror symmetry,\r\nin particular, of the surprising role played by the elliptic\r\ncurves appeared in our computation by applying mirror principle;\r\nthe third is to develop a mirror principle for counting curves of\r\nhigher genus in projective manifolds. I hope to solve these\r\nproblems by further extending the techniques we developed to\r\nprove the mirror principle for balloon manifolds. These three\r\nproblems are the different aspects of a single problem: to prove\r\nand understand the mirror principle in its most general form.\r\n\r\nSuperstring theory, one of the most ambitious theory in sciences,\r\nis proposed for the grand unification of the laws of the nature.\r\nBased on this theory, string theorists have made many remarkable\r\nmathematical conjectures. Mirror symmetry is among one of them.\r\nThe proofs of these conjectures will not only give beautiful\r\nmathematical results, but also help gain confidence in the\r\nphysical theory. The mirror principle we developed has partially\r\nverified some of these conjectures. It has many interesting\r\nmathematical consequences and is remarkably compatible with the\r\nphysical theory.\r\n",
