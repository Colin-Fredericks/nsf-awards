 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a one-year small grant for exploratory research (SGER) granted by the ECS Division\r\nof NSF, we have explored new concepts for coherent quantum effects in nanotechnology\r\ndevices. We have conceived of several new solid-state devices based on coupled coherent\r\nquantum phenomena that are potentially useful for computing and communications, and\r\ninvestigated their practicality through theoretical studies. With this initial success, we\r\nnow propose to continue these studies with a more extensive and precise analysis of the\r\nphenomena and to initiate a coupled experimental program to show feasibility.\r\n\r\nThe nanotechnology structure that shows most promise for a quantum computer is based\r\non the spin of exchange coupled electrons trapped in an array of gated quantum dots\r\nfabricated in either III-V or silicon. The proposed quantum computer is capable of 10 5\r\noperations within the coherence time at a two-qubit operation rate at 10 8 Hz. It is readily\r\nscalable to a large number of elements, on the order of ~10 6 qubits, and electrically\r\nreconfigurable utilizing a planar architecture. This device is unquestionably\r\nmanufacturable using technology enabled by the 70-nm technology node as specified in\r\nthe \"International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, 1999 Edition\". We have\r\nestablished collaborations with industry that wish to take advantage of this\r\nnanotechnology once we have shown feasibility.\r\n\r\nTo fully examine the potential of our concepts, we propose to conduct a comprehensive\r\nstudy by analyzing the physical parameters of the devices to generate the desired energy\r\nstructure and coupling strength among neighboring device elements, by investigating the\r\nlimitations to coherence, and by simulating the operation of the device to operate it as a\r\nquantum computer. We further propose to undertake an experimental program to\r\nfabricate and test elementary prototypes of these devices to demonstrate feasibility.\r\nCollaboration between the theoretical and experimental studies should result in a nano-device\r\nstructure that is technically interesting and potentially important for commercial\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThis research will be coupled to an educational program that provides interdisciplinary\r\nresearch for graduate students and for the development of courses that introduce quantum\r\ninformation processes at the graduate level within the Electrical and Computer\r\nEngineering Department at North Carolina State University.",
