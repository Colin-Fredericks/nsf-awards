Acoustic streaming is a steady fluid motion created when high amplitude acoustic waves propagate through a dissipative fluid. The dissipation of energy through viscous effects, combined with nonlinear hydrodynamic coupling, results in a steady momentum being imparted to the fluid.  The primary function of this device (and the primary focus of the research) is pumping, although the device will be capable of performing a variety of other tasks critical to micro-fluidic control including metering, valving, mixing, fluid property monitoring and suspended particle manipulation.  The research program consists of simultaneous computational and experimental investigations.   The computational investigation is focused on the development of nonlinear fluid dynamic models used to reveal effects of fundamental system parameters on acoustic streaming.  The experimental investigation is focused on prototype development and experimental verification of the computational results.  This work promises to have a significant technological impact at many levels.  First, the understanding of the fundamental physics  surrounding acoustic streaming will be enhanced.  Secondly, this approach to micro-fluidic control has many advantages over anything yet postulated.  These advantages include the development of a solid state micro-fluidic pump possessing superior manufacturability and reliability as well as a micro-fluidic control device capable of performing multiple fluid handling functions.  Finally, the creation of an effective, reliable micro-fluidic control device promises to open many other possible applications for MEMS technology such as microprocessor design, pharmaceutical products and security/defense capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
