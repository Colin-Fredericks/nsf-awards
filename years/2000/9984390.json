 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this CAREER proposal is to augment existing solid modeling representations to facilitate the distributed and collaborative design of mechanical components/assemblies with the inherent ability to parallel process various solid modeling tasks. Specific research objectives are (a)to synthesize segmentable representations that would support encoding, communication, and manipulation of solid models in a distributed and collaborative environment, (b) to enable the encoding, decoding, and streaming of solid models for purposes of communicating segments of solid models in a distributed and collaborative environment, and (c) to synthesize, in an evolutionary manner, complex solid models based on changing segments of solid models and propogating the change to the entire model. Recognizing that design involves both collaborative and individual learning, a collaborative and distributed design studio (CDDS) will be developed to provide a familiar environment for for students throughout their education. Three educational initiatives that will be undertaken as part of the CDDS include (1) three dimensional jigsaw macro-models of multi-material micro-devices, (2) collaborative and distributed design projects, and (3) webfolios (portfolios on the web). The first is designed to attract high-school students and underclassmen to the CDDS and encourage learning in an unfamiliar environment with fun-to-do projects. The next, targetted at upperclassmen, is designed to familiarize students with concepts of collaborative and distributed design. Finally, webfolios are aimed at all students and faculty who are interested in assessing progress (this will specifically be used to evaluate the research and educational impact of this CAREER proposal). \r\n\r\n                     If successful, the integrated research and educational objectives will benefit the numerous industries that use solid modeling by enabling a new generation of applications that can be modeled in a distributed environment enabled by parallel processing. The educational plan will provide industries with uniquely trained engineers in mechanical engineering design who will be capable of further advancing the state-of-art. \r\n",
