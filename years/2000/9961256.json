 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims to apply novel micro-discharge structures and techniques for exciting micro-lasers. The proposer will target wavelength regions not accessed by other compact lasers, emphasizing output wavelengths in spectral regions where diode pumped solid state laser approaches are considerably more complex than the proposed technology. The Phase I objectives include the development of the alignment and construction methods needed to make a stack of micro-discharges appropriate for laser action. The proposer will show laser action in the touchstone systems of the Mid-IR Xenon atom laser and the KrF laser in the ultraviolet. An analytical effort using state of the art, multi-dimensional discharge models will support experiments and guide the Phase II prototype design.  The proposer will also define the needed risk reduction tests to produce a useful sensor system in Phase II.\r\n          These very compact sources will be used in sensors for trace species detection, process control, and medical and food industry applications. The small size and low voltage operation will lead to inexpensive hand held uses and very compact automated industrial systems. The semi-conductor based fabrication techniques are inexpensive and systems based on this technology can significantly enhance the market potential. Specific commercial applications include: trace gas sensors for short ranges, screening solid surfaces and foods for pathogens, process controls, and fiber coupled probes for medicine.\r\n",
