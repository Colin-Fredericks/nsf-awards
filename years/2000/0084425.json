In a series of experiments, single crystal aluminum substrates with 111, 110, and 100 orientations will be used.  Complementary numerical simulations will demonstrate how the crystal orientation affects the pattern development during electropolishing.  The procedure for producing nanoscale patterns is to apply a constant bias voltage on the aluminum substrate in an acidic alcohol-water solution.  The applied voltage causes the aluminum to dissolve as aluminum ions into the solution.  Although striped patterns have been observed, these are not of current industrial interest.   Conditions that favor the formation of ordered hexagonal patterns will be explored.  Collaboration with the University of Alabama laboratory on Materials for Information Technology (MINT) is anticipated.  This facility is an NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC).  Students will have use of the facility for work on this project.  Ordered arrays of nanometer-sized holes form the basis for a number of emerging technologies including magnetic media, photonic bandgap filters, and molecular sieves.  A new fabrication method that produces such arrays would be potentially useful in the development of these devices.\r\n",
