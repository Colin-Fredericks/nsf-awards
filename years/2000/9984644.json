 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of \"Tin-Lite\"alternatives to reactions involving organotin chemistry.  A practical, tin catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction will be developed and the methodology will also be applied to traditional organotin mediated reactions, copper based cross-couplings fluorous phase reactions and combinatorial chemistry.  The results could have a broad impact on the commercial synthesis of biologically important compounds.  The educational component of the project involves the introduction of high school students to a meaningful laboratory experience and the introduction of a pharmaceutical chemistry course at the undergraduate level.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Robert E.. Maleczka of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University.  Professor Maleczka will focus his research on the discovery, development and application of stannane mediated reactions in organic synthesis with the specific goal of minimizing the tin requirement in these reactions.  The approach will rely on the design of new reactions catalytic in tin and in seeking non-tin alternatives. The methodology has broad implications for synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry.   The educational activities of the project include curriculum development and high school outreach.",
