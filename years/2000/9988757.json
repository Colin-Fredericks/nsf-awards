 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to enable a new generation of remote sensors for injection molding process monitoring and control. This research is motivated by current limitations in observing part quality during manufacture that allow the occurrence of defective products and cost inefficiencies.  The new sensors will be self-energized by extracting energy from the intensification and decay of polymer melt pressure to generate and transmit signal pulses that correspond to changes in the molding process.  This approach promises to reduce the energy consumption by several orders of magnitude.  Issues to be investigated include sensor design, simulation, heat conduction, structural integrity, signal encoding, and optimal transmission.  The research represents a radical step forward in sensing technology, and has the potential to change industrial molding practice by enabling better algorithms for molding control.  The potential increase on productivity is estimated to be $200 million/year.\r\n\r\nThis research project, being a close collaboration between the faculty researchers and their industrial partner at Dynisco Instruments, may provide validated process sensing technology for many other applications beyond injection molding.  The self-energizing and wireless signal transmission concept promises to greatly reduce the information bottleneck out of manufacturing processes.  Finally, the research has a great potential to fundamentally impact the manufacturing and design curriculum and ultimately, the educational infrastructure the researchers' home institution. \r\n",
