Zhang, University of California, Davis \r\nProposal Number: 9984239 \r\nProposal Title:Improved Continuum Models of Vehicular Traffic Flow \r\n\r\nProject Abstract: \r\nThis research seeks to expand the understanding of various critical phenomena in vehicular traffic flow and develops improved theories to model them. Comprising of heterogeneous intelligent \"particles\" -vehicles driven by diverse people, traffic flow exhibits complex dynamic patterns. Although some aspect of traffic flow, such as shock waves, is well understood and supports the well known traffic flow theory of kinematic waves, many other phenomena that are critical to traffic flow applications are not well understood. These include the laminar flow to stop-and-go flow transitions, stop-start waves, and phantom traffic jams. This research proposes to 1) better understand the nature of the aforementioned critical phenomena, 2) develop improved traffic theories to model these phenomena, and 3) apply the developed theories to better manage traffic congestion and reduce vehicle emissions. In the research, experimental evidence is carefully examined and past developments of traffic flow theory are scrutinized to gain insights on driver behavior and possible directions of new theory development. Improved theories are then developed based on a sound understanding of both driver behavior and existing theories, rigorously analyzed and carefully validated with experimental data. The success of this research can lead to a better understanding of traffic flow and greatly increase the ability to monitor, model and control traffic flow. These advances in turn lead to more efficient use of existing road infrastructure and better air quality planning. \r\n\r\n",
