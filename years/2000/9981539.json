 "awd_abstract_narration": "Branka Ladanyi of Colorado State University is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to investigate solvation and reaction dynamics in the polar solvent pool of reverse micelles and in polar solvent clusters.  In both cases research will focus on how the number of polar molecules within a cluster or a reverse micelle affects solvation and reactivity.   The primary goal is to explain observations of large differences from bulk solvation.  In the case of reverse micelles, Ladanyi will investigate how the size of the water pool and other factors, such as counterion identity and solute location within the reverse micelle, affect solvation dynamics and thermodynamics. This will be done using molecular dynamics simulations and analyzing the trajectory data to identify the important solvation mechanisms and their dependence on the heterogeneity of the solvent environment.   A hierarchy of models, starting from an atomistic representation of only the interior region and progressing to a fully atomistic representation of the surfactant tails and the nonpolar solvent, will be used in these studies.  In the case of solvation and reactivity in polar clusters, Ladanyi will extend her previous work on solvation and photodissociation dynamics of solvated sodium iodide to other alkali halides, primarily to sodium chloride, and to other polar solvents, in particular acetonitrile and ammonia.  The goal of this work is to determine, at the molecular level, how interactions with varying numbers of polar solvent molecules affect the electronic states of the solute and the consequences of this for equilibrium solvation and photochemistry.  Monte Carlo and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulation methods will be used in this work.  Much of the work will be used to interpret the experimental results obtained by Nancy Levinger on reverse micelles. \r\n\r\nSince most chemical reactions happen in the presence of solvents, understanding and predicting the effects of solvents on reactions has been a longstanding goal of chemical research.  In recent years there has been a great deal of progress towards the molecular level understanding of solvent effects on chemical reactivity.  Theoretical and computational methods are now making it possible to study increasingly complex systems and phenomena.  Theoretical models are extending to heterogeneous chemical environments that occur in biological and technologically important processes.  Ladanyi will perform simulations on polar solvation in reverse micelles that have significant technological importance, and that serve as model systems for understanding solvation in biological systems.",
