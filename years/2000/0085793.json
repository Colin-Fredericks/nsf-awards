 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the development of a new online Journal of Earth System Science Education (JESSE), plans for which were laid with the support of a previous planning grant (Award No. 9907764).\r\n\r\nThe new e-journal is emphasizing research and experimentation with the peer review process as it establishes, through electronic publication, an orderly collection of reviewed resource materials for the broadly defined geoscience and related disciplines involved in Earth system and global change education.\r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary richness of Earth system and global change science provides unusual opportunities for research and experimentation with the peer review process in advancing science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education (SMETE). JESSE is focusing on learning resources and metadata where scientific content combined with visualization enriches learning across a broad range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary educational efforts. The initial emphasis is on creating, implementing, testing, and evaluating a peer review process embracing anonymous and open review components for the submission of educational resources at the undergraduate level. This research and experimentation aims to optimize the efficiency of the review process and the quality of the offerings as the digital library's collections are built.\r\n\r\nIn providing for both anonymous and open reviews, JESSE is experimenting with the process. Guided by Principal Editors, the anonymous component is to ensure credibility of the process and judgments reached through the open review. Within the open review process, both editors and reviewers work directly with the authors of resources to suggest changes and develop informative commentary for classroom and other educational endeavors, while reaching common agreement on the acceptability of a resource for publication. JESSE's review criteria include those recommended by the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE). Review criteria also constitute a topic of research as they are applied and adapted for resources from different disciplines and of different types. Different types of resources include courses, syllabi and lectures, laboratory exercises, interactive models, topical modules, virtual field trips, annotated image databases, and electronic texts and monographs. Other types include notes, correspondence, and user experiences for review and publication within a peer commentary section of the journal. JESSE also intends to publish articles and review papers concerning the learning process involved in Earth system education. Copyright of all materials reviewed and published by JESSE remains with the author, while the peer review process itself and publication ensure national recognition for the author.\r\n\r\nAs part of its research and experimentation with the review process, the journal aims to stimulate the creativity of educators in the development of quality electronic resources that describe both the state and underlying processes governing the Earth system. Ultimately, the peer-reviewed collection will provide a holistic perspective of Earth system and global change science.\r\n",
