 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from New Span Opto-Technology Incorporated studies holographic data storage in a new ion-exchanged photochromic glass disk.  It is well known that holographic data storage can significantly increase data storage capacity and reduce access time.  However, the technology maturity of holographic data storage is believed to be impeded by the lack of good holographic material that can be erased and recorded optically with almost unlimited rewriting cycles, with large index modulation for large capacity multiplexed data recording, and with long lifetime and immunity to destructive readout for archival applications.  The new ion-exchanged photochromic glass in this proposed study can potentially satisfy all of the above requirements.  UV and blue laser illumination on the glass can make the exchanged layer blue while red laser illumination can convert the blue layer to violet-red due to de-ionization and ionization in the ion-exchanged layer.  The associated refractive index change is the basis for the holographic data storage.  The recording media is room environment stable, erasable, re-writable, and does not require any follow-up processing. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of holographic recording on the new ion-exchanged glass.  Phase II will optimize holographic recording process and demonstrate a high-capacity holographic storage prototype using the glass.\r\n\r\nThis research will demonstrate the feasibility of erasable, rewritable, high-capacity holographic data storage on a new ion-exchanged photochromic glass disk.  The holographic recording does not require hologram fixing process and is suitable for on-line application. New Span Opto-Technology proffers technology that is expected to significantly improve the holographic data storage technology for commercial and military applications such as computer data storage, on-line storage, library archival applications, image storage for medical applications and for military fast access to its large intelligent database.\r\n",
