In the area of nonlinear equations the PI will continue his \r\nresearch program on pseudo-transient continuation methods for nonlinear \r\nequations to the partial differential algebraic equation (PDAE) setting\r\nand design and analyze multilevel methods for fully iterative algorithms \r\nfor parameter-dependent families of compact fixed point problems.\r\nIn the area of optimization, the principal investigator will \r\nextend his work on sampling methods to problems with ``hidden constraints'', \r\ni.e. constraints whose violation can only be detected by failure of the \r\nobjective function to return a value, continue his development of the implicit\r\nfiltering with the design of a Levenberg-Marquardt form of the algorithm, \r\nand investigate the performance of the DIRECT method both from the \r\ntheoretical viewpoint and as a way to identify hidden constraints. \r\nThis aspect of the PI's research involves undergraduates in a significant way.\r\n\r\nMany processes and models in engineering and science are expressed as nonlinear\r\nequations. Numerical simulation of these processes requires the rapid and \r\naccurate solution of these equations and a clear understanding of the methods\r\nand their limitations. With a high-quality simulator in hand, optimization\r\ncan be used in design.  The optimization problems that arise in \r\nindustrial design are often noisy because of measurement or simulation error. \r\nThe principal investigator will continue his work on the computational \r\nsolution of nonlinear equations and optimization problems. The work \r\nwill consist of study of algorithms, needed to ensure robustness and \r\nreliability of simulations, implementation on distributed memory computers,\r\nwhich is important for for rapid turnaround, and applying the methods\r\nin collaborations with scientists and engineers in industry, national \r\nlaboratories, and academia. The work will be used in (a) environmental \r\nmodeling, measurement, and remediation, (b) simulation, optimal design, \r\nand control in the aerospace industry, and in (c) optimization of \r\ngas pipeline networks.\r\n\r\n",
