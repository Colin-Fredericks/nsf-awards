The project is designed to address a need for programs that provide prospective teachers the opportunity to make connections between prior knowledge and future tasks, and to enable them to construct new mathematical and pedagogical knowledge by engaging in the teaching and learning of mathematics. The project will design integrated units in geometry and abstract algebra that focus on the basic results that provide the underpinnings for secondary school mathematics. The units will incorporate school-based field experiences.\r\n\r\nUniversity mathematics faculty, secondary school teachers, graduate students, and undergraduates will participate together in professional development activities that tie mathematics content and pedagogy together at the pre-college and university levels. Evaluation will provide feedback on the success of the project as well as insights on how undergraduates (in particular, prospective teachers) develop an understanding of abstract mathematics. Results from the \"proof of concept\" project will inform the development of a full curriculum based on the concept. Additional sources will be explored for funding of the full development.\r\n",
