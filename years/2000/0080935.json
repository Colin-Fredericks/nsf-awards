 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is the establishment of an independent, self-sustaining research Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies, (IBESt) at the University of Idaho.  Researchers with common interests in evolutionary mechanisms in the intersection of biology, computer science, and mathematics will focus on tool and infrastructure development to sustain interdisciplinary research and to further growth and understanding of Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies research issues.  Research projects will be carried out in the following areas:  (1) Parallel and Distributed Bioinformatics, (2) Transposable Element Simulation and Analysis, (3) Statistical Analyses of Comparative Phylogeographic Data, and (4) Self-Repairing, Fault Tolerant Programs via Evolution.  The goals of the project which will advance the formation of IBESt are as follows.\r\n\r\nRecruit a new distinguished professor of Bioinformatics, retain and support current faculty, and retain and recruit excellent graduate students.\r\n\r\nExpand the current record of accomplishment in interdisciplinary research in order to build a successful, externally funded research program in bioinformatics and evolutionary studies.\r\n\r\nConstruct a powerful, expandable Beowulf computing system for teaching and research.\r\n\r\nDisseminate knowledge to the broader university community and to the public through the conduct of seminars and workshops.\r\n",
