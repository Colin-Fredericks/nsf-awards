 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) \r\n\r\nThis proof-of-concept project is developing materials and laboratory exercises for teaching concurrent program design and implementation using the theory of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) and Java with CSP libraries. CSP provides a sound theoretical foundation for designing concurrent programs and for proving their correctness.  Concurrent programs are important in many areas of computer science including operating systems, parallel computing, and applications of real-time embedded computing. In addition, concurrent modules are especially appropriate for the design and implementation of many network applications. The concurrent threads in Java provide a ubiquitous environment for such programming.   \r\n\r\nA quad-processor server is being installed in the lab at Colgate for use in development and teaching with true parallel execution of concurrent threads. This project builds upon work done in the UK and the Netherlands to implement the CSP constructs in Java.  It will develop content units and laboratory exercises for teaching the principles of concurrent program design and implementation, as well as applications of concurrency to such areas as parallel computing, simulation, and network computing. The teaching units and laboratories developed for this project are being made available electronically.  Evaluation of the new materials is being done by outside experts who will evaluate the appropriateness of the new units, laboratory exercises, and syllabus in the context of the computer science curriculum.  Student evaluations are being conducted to assess the effectiveness of the materials in promoting learning.  During the second year of the project, other schools are going to use and assess the materials with their students.  Sites are being selected to encourage use of the materials by diverse student populations.\r\n\r\nThe project includes a faculty workshop to disseminate the materials developed and to engage interested faculty from other institutions in ongoing development of materials using this approach. The methodology developed is being presented at tutorials and workshops at national conferences such as the SIGCSE Symposium.  It is also being developed into a textbook format for publication.",
