 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project develops interactive environments through a component design and production service and an assembly environment to support identification and reuse of curricular materials. The component design and production service supports collaborative creation of learning objects. It is aimed at programmers and focused on direct coding of components, from graphical user interface elements to complex simulations. It tests strategies by developing reusable components for selected topics in several disciplines. The assembly environment service is aimed at instructors. It provides an environment that allows for easy yet flexible creation of curriculum materials that utilize interactive learning objects. \r\n\r\nThis project develops a base around with future work can crystallize and build new content and structure. It has enormous potential for facilitating the potential of creating ever-growing, collaboratively-driven online repositories of educational software components. This could result in a wealth of online resources for students and teachers and enable teachers to create learning environments for their own use and for use in the next generation of digital libraries and learning environments.\r\n",
