Flanagan, Department of Chemistry, University of Vermont and R. Balasubramaniam, Department of Materials and Metallurgical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.  The goal of the research is to understand the relationship between the microstructure of materials and their properties such as H2 solubilities.  This project will explore the relationship by combining the expertise of the US PI in physical chemistry with that of the Indian PI in physical metallurgy in order to understand the characteristics of composite materials using H solubility as a probe and relating these to the microstructure. \r\n\r\nScope:  Based on past successful collaboration that has produced three joint publications, there is every expectation that these researchers will continue to work fruitfully.  Flanagan with his students will carry out thermodynamic studies in the US and Balasubramaniam with his students will perform the microstructural characterization studies at the Advanced Centre for Materials Science at Kanpur.  This collaboration will benefit both educational institutions and provide an opportunity for the PIs students to gain a unique research perspective.  This joint effort is well balanced technically and should result in mutual benefits.         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
