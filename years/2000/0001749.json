 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past twenty years, theories of social choice have emphasized the \r\nimportant effects of institutions. However, the cognitive structures with which \r\nindividuals represent a decision context are also important. These mental \r\nmodels, or knowledge structures, create categories and relationships among \r\nalternatives, thereby influencing the existence and characteristics of an \r\nequilibrium. In previous papers it was shown that in both cooperative games such\r\nas social choice and non-cooperative games such as coordination problems, the \r\nprospects for stability are greatly improved when players have shared mental \r\nrepresentations (despite having conflicting preferences). These results are \r\nbroadly referred to as a \"knowledge-induced equilibrium.\"\r\n\tAlthough a knowledge-induced equilibrium is immune to manipulation by insincere\r\nvoting, the more interesting question is the extent to which players can \r\nmanipulate others' mental representations--such as through framing, discourse, \r\nor persuasion--in order to influence the collective outcome. This \"second-order\"\r\nstrategic behavior is much closer to William Riker's concept of heresthetics. The task \r\nof this project is to explore the possibilities and characteristics of \r\nmanipulation in the knowledge-induced equilibrium framework. More specifically, \r\nthe investigator constructs a game model where players can send signals to a subset of other players to which they are persuasive in an attempt to alter the mental \r\nrepresentations of the decision context and thereby altering the collective \r\noutcome. Players' strategies include heresthetical tactics such as arguing \r\nrelationships among alternatives, adding or removing alternatives from the \r\nchoice set, and influencing the distribution and depth of other players' \r\nknowledge representations. Results from the project contribute to several \r\ntopics, including (1) explanations of the endogenous emergence of shared \r\nknowledge structures through strategic dialogue, (2) the identification of \r\nstructural positions or contexts that are \"lever points\" in that a player has \r\ndisproportionate ability to direct the outcome through strategic persuasion, (3)\r\na formalization of a set of heresthetical maneuvers along the lines called for \r\nby Riker, (4) applications to bargaining and negotiation theory, and (5) the \r\ndevelopment of an alternative index of power based on equilibrium opportunities \r\nfor strategic persuasion rather than on the combinatorics of coalitions.\r\n\r\n",
