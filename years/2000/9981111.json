This \"sage on stage\" mode of education is known to be less effective than active-learner methods. As a result, many college-educated people lack the scientific literacy needed to keep up in the workplace and to participate in public debate. This problem is especially damaging as it affects pre-service teachers. Poor teacher preparation creates a \"cycle of illiteracy\" as underprepared teachers promote new generations of underprepared students.\r\n\r\nObjectives: We are using a classroom tested strategy that fosters active learning and communication among faculty and students in five introductory and upper division courses using the World Wide Web (WWW).  During the 3-year implementation period, we will benefit over 8,000 students including SMET majors, pre-service teachers, and students satisfying general science requirements.  The project is focusing on increased learning by both weak and strong students, increased retention, and improved problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork and communication skills.  It is also focused on pre-service teachers, exposing them to new pedagogies, and encouraging them to begin teaching as student mentors.\r\n\r\nMethods: This project is a large scale adaptation of Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT), a system that integrates technology with active learning. JiTT was developed for physics courses at IUPUI and the US Air Force Academy with support from the NSF Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE 975 2365) and has been adopted at 12 other institutions as of Spring, 1999.  In this project, JiTT is being adapted and implemented in chemistry, biology and mathematics courses. In the JiTT approach, students use the WWW to receive and answer preparatory questions a few hours before each class.  Participating members of the faculty use these student responses to structure lessons for the next class meeting. Thus, students participate in a class that is based on their own prior knowledge.  JiTT also uses the web to deliver enrichment materials and to increase interaction among students and faculty.  The project is working with other members of the faculty to help them to learn the JiTT system, and the project will institute further faculty development efforts as the project matures. \r\n",
