 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops a novel framework for the design and better\r\nunderstanding of data compression algorithms. This framework facilitates \r\nthe use of ideas and techniques from statistics in order to:\r\n  (a) Design efficient practical algorithms for specific applications; \r\n  (b) Precisely characterize the performance of such algorithms. \r\nThese algorithms provide easily implementable, high-compression methods. \r\nTheir construction is done in three stages: A precise correspondence is \r\nfirst established between data compression algorithms and statistical \r\nmodels. In the second stage, statistical techniques are applied to \r\nidentify a suitable \"model\" for the data, and in the third stage the \r\nselected model is turned into a practical algorithm. Virtually all of the \r\nalgorithms that are currently used in compression applications can be \r\nincorporated into this framework. In view of the tremendous practical \r\nimportance of the basic problem (lossy data compression), especially in\r\nthe area of multimedia, even modest advances can have a strong impact. \r\n\r\nUsing ideas and techniques from the area of adaptive statistical model-\r\nselection, this study develops practical algorithms and attempts to\r\nadvance theoretical understanding of the fundamental issues involved \r\nin lossy data compression, by investigating the following basic questions:\r\n1. What are the fundamental limits of performance (in terms of redundancy \r\n   and complexity), for compression with finite amounts of data? What is\r\n   the best achievable rate at which optimality can be reached using \r\n   reasonable computational resources?\r\n2. How can the trade-off between implementation complexity and compression \r\n   performance be balanced in practice?\r\n3. What is the natural _lossy_ analog of the well-known correspondence \r\n   between algorithms and codebooks in lossless compression, and how can \r\n   model-selection be employed to construct practical algorithms?\r\nOn the side of applications, the primary emphasis is on adaptive methods \r\nthat can be implemented in real-time systems, and which are based on \r\nconcrete theoretical guidelines. These will provide low-complexity, \r\nuniversal algorithms. In terms of the theory, the focus is on determining\r\nthe natural mathematical framework, within which the above issues can\r\nbe analyzed. This development builds on recent work in information\r\ntheory, centered around a natural \"lossy\" generalization of the \r\nAsymptotic Equipartition Property and its refinements.\r\n",
