 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miller proposes to continue his research on the model theory of\r\nexpansions of the field of real numbers, concentrating on further\r\ndeveloping the model theory and analytic geometry associated with\r\no-minimal, and certain other well-behaved, expansions of the field of\r\nreal numbers. He intends to do this by applying techniques from\r\ndescriptive set theory and  geometric measure theory in addition to the\r\nmodel-theoretic and analytic-geometric techniques usually associated\r\nwith o-minimality. In turn, Miller hopes to apply model-theoretic\r\ntechniques to questions in descriptive set theory and geometric measure\r\ntheory. Miller has also begun to collaborate with applied mathematicians\r\nand control engineers on applications of model theory to hybrid control\r\nsystems, and intends to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany results of so-called classical mathematics are very general; they\r\napply to a wide variety of input, so to speak, so we must expect to have\r\nto deal with a correspondingly wide variety of output.  However, we\r\ncould hope that if the input is, in some respect, particularly well\r\nbehaved, then the output would be similarly well behaved. This turns out\r\nto be true in many important cases, but to see this  usually requires\r\nnew, more constructive proofs of classical results, as well as a deeper\r\nunderstanding of the good properties of the input. Before we can even\r\nbegin such projects, though, we need some way of deciding which\r\nmathematical objects (inputs) should be considered as well behaved, and\r\nwhich should be considered as troublesome. This can be a difficult\r\nmatter. The theory of o-minimal structures on the real field, a\r\nsub-discipline of mathematical logic, has been developed in large part\r\nto deal with this issue. This has been a rapidly-developing area for the\r\nlast decade, with many contributions from---and cooperation\r\nbetween---several branches of mathematics and logic. Applications, and\r\npotential applications, of these developments have been found in areas\r\nas diverse as theoretical economics, neural-net learning theory, and\r\nhybrid control systems.\r\n",
