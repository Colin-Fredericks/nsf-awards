 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Summary\r\nIn this research, we propose to use group representation theory to generate automatically fast\r\nalgorithms for digital signal processing (DSP) transforms. Group representation theory provides a\r\ndeeper understanding of the structure of signal transforms and a context to address fundamental\r\nquestions in modeling and processing of signals. We propose to use representation theory to design\r\nnew transforms with desirable characteristics.\r\nOur work is at the meta-level of DSP algorithm libraries (DSP-AL), like SPIRAL, [23]. SPI-\r\nRAL is a library of DSP algorithms that concatenates a formula generator block with a code\r\ngenerator block to produce optimized software implementations for a given computer. SPIRAL\r\napplies iteratively fast algorithms, the algorithmic rules, to generate a rich collection of alternative\r\nequivalent formulas (the formula space) for the same DSP algorithm. For each formula, SPIRAL\r\nthen produces automatically optimized code that runs efficiently on the given computer. By\r\nsearching over the formula space, SPIRAL generates automatically the formula and correspond-\r\ning code implementation that matches in an optimized sense the algorithm to the hardware.\r\nWhat SPIRAL, or any other existing DSP-AL for that matter, does NOT do is the automatic\r\ngeneration of the fast algorithm, or algorithmic rules. This meta-level is the focus of our proposed\r\nresearch. We exploit group representation theory to develop the theoretical framework and the\r\ntools that produce automatically these fast algorithms for a number of DSP transforms. We will\r\nimplement and interface these tools to a DSP-AL (SPIRAL) which will enable us to translate\r\ndirectly a fast DSP algorithm as generated by our tools to an efficient low-level language program.\r\nGenerating a fast discrete signal transform, given as a matrix, consists of two steps: determin-\r\ning the \"symmetry\" of the transform, which is a pair of representations under which the transform\r\nis invariant; decomposing stepwise the representations, giving rise to factorized decomposition ma-\r\ntrices, which determine the factorization of the transform. The symmetry catches redundancy in\r\nthe transform, and the decomposition of the representations turns the redundancy into a factoriza-\r\ntion of the transform - the fast algorithm. To realize this program, new results on decomposition\r\nmatrices will be derived in the context of a constructive extension of standard representation\r\ntheory, where representations are manipulated up to equality, not only up to equivalence.\r\nWe will implement the algorithm for generating fast discrete signal transforms within a package\r\nfor symbolic computation with group representations and structured matrices and interface it with\r\na DSP-AL, namely SPIRAL.\r\nWe consider different types of \"symmetry,\" going beyond regular representations to include\r\narbitrary permutation and monomial representations, in order to capture in the representation\r\nframework a wide class of signal transforms. Besides the DFT, and trigonometric transforms, we\r\nwill consider other transforms including wavelet transforms.\r\nWe use the group representation framework to explore the connection between the \"symmetry\"\r\nof a signal transform and its properties with respect to signal processing. The use of a transform\r\ncan be justified on the basis of the model underlying the data. We have shown this relation to be\r\nconnected to the boundary conditions (b.c.) assumed in describing a certain class of models widely\r\nused in applications. These b.c.'s also reflect the type of \"data extension\" that is hypothesized,\r\nfor example, cyclic b.c.'s versus signal periodic extension versus the discrete Fourier transform.\r\nThis proposal will exploit the relations between the \"symmetry\" of the representation, the signal\r\ntransform, and the signal models, enabling us to address some fundamental questions, namely\r\nhow to design a signal transform which is adapted to a given signal model (i.e., reflects a desired\r\nsymmetry) and is computationally the most efficient.\r\n",
