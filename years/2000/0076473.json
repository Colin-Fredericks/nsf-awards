The system will significantly enhance present research capabilities and broaden the impact of  a recently acquired GOALI research grant. The Lehigh facility will be expanded and developed to op a full-scale, state-of-the-art Fiber Optics Laboratory. This laboratory will serve: (1) to uncover the relationship between the glass microscopics and optical nonlinearities and provide a the necessary link between fundamental glass research and fiber optics; (2) to train PhD level graduate students in photonics (these are in very short supply at the present) who understand optics as well as materials; (3) as a link between the university and industry; (4) as a pole for experimental studies in materials for integrated optics and optical communications at Lehigh. \r\n\r\nThis award from the instrumentation for materials research program in DMR will allow Lehigh University to acquire a multipurpose high-power fiber optic system, which can be operated in the CW or pulsed mode and capable of producing picosecond or femtosecond pulses.
