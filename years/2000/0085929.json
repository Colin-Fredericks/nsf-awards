 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research studies the design of agile wireless networks that accommodate time\r\nvariations in the communication channels, the information sources, and the network topology. The research will lead to design principles that, in addition to enabling more efficient use of the current cellular and PCS bands, will allow exploitation of frequency bands in the 10-100 GHz range to provide high-speed multimedia services for both indoor and outdoor applications. While the basic cellular paradigm of wireless access to a high-speed communication and computing backbone will be adhered to, nearly every other assumption in existing second-generation and projected third-generation cellular and PCS networks will be reexamined. Some of the significant differences from current designs are as follows. A dense network of base stations will provide connectivity despite the high path losses and sharp shadowing at higher frequency bands. Cells with well-defined boundaries may no longer exist, and mobile terminals will see a rapidly varying network topology. A variety of traffic classes, such as voice, data, and video, with diverse requirements regarding delay, loss, quality of reproduction, and number of potential receivers will be considered. Packetized transmission will be considered as a flexible means of supporting such multimedia applications so that current circuit-based cellular trunking is not applicable.\r\nA key element of the approach is to envision new applications and new overall system architec-\r\ntures. Modeling based on propagation studies and analysis of requirements for carried datastreams will be used both to continually revise the concept systems and to provide models for the design of algorithms for such things as joint implementation of source coding, channel estimation, interference suppression, routing and congestion control. The performance of the algorithms will be evaluated broadly, including aspects of implementation in VLSI as appropriate, and the results will lead to further revision and refinement of the overall system architecture. Many tradeoffs will be explored, such as the tradeoff_ between the performance of distributed soft detection and the network capacity needed to assemble the required information. The integrated research effort will be conducted by five overlapping research teams of University of Illinois faculty investigators and their students, organized around the following interdisciplinary\r\nprojects:\r\n\r\nConcept Systems, Modeling, and Performance Limits\r\n\r\nDesign Principles for Wireless Packet Networks\r\n\r\nDesign for Time-Varying Channels\r\n\r\nJointly Optimized Source Coding, Channel Coding, and Estimation\r\n\r\nVLSI Algorithms, Architectures, and Bounds\r\nThe bulk of the requested funding will be used to support the students. Most of the faculty and\r\nstudents have adjacent offices within the Coordinated Science Laboratory, an environment carefully cultivated to promote intense interaction and collaboration. Regularly scheduled weekly meetings of the investigators are used to coordinate the research and identify opportunities for better integration of the design approach. An External Advisory Committee of key technical people from industry will help ensure that the research is focused on problems and issues likely to be important in the future.  This proposal is to supplement NSF grant NSF CCR 79381 \\An Integrated Exploration of Wireless Network Communication.\" That grant is funded at a level of $700K for three years beginning October 1, 1999, whereas the original funding request was for $2.5M over five years. Although the proposal was rated as highly competitive, the funding received covers only six students and no faculty time. Additional funding will greatly enhance our ability to achieve our research and educational goals.  \r\n\r\nKeywords: Wireless networks, fading channels, multimedia communications\r\n",
