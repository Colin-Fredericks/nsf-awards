 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to identify, isolate or develop new biocatalysts for producing stereo-specific monomers that can be used to synthesize chiral plastics with unique optical and mechanical properties. Current technologies for resolving racemic mixtures of organic monomers rely on the use of a biocatalyst to selectively react with either a desired or undesired enantiomer. The desired enantiomer can then be purified and used in the targeted process. During this project, new biocatalysts will be identified and used to resolve enantiomers that can be used to synthesize plastics. The resulting plastics will initially be tested and used to construct devices for controlling optical signals on fiber optic cables, and other uses for the plastics will become apparent after the thermal, mechanical, and optical properties of the materials are evaluated and understood. Without such development work, the properties and utility of the plastics can not be predicted, and relatively large quantities of improved biocatalysts are needed to produce sufficient quantities of polymers for testing and evaluation. The new catalysts will overcome existing limitations such as poor reaction kinetics, enzyme instability, insufficient selectivity, and high costs which have hindered widespread acceptance of biocatalysts in organic synthesis.  Enantiomerically pure chemicals are becoming increasingly important as products, and as intermediates for synthesizing pharmaceutical and other end products. This work will lead to the production of enzymes that can be utilized to synthesize chiral monomers that can subsequently be used for creating optical devises for the fiber optic industry. Likewise, the enzymes will likely find utility in synthesizing enantiopure intermediates for a wide range of chemical syntheses.",
