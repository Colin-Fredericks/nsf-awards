 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both researchers in high performance parallel computing and vendors of scalable server systems are actively studying the performance of hierarchical computer systems. There is now a consensus that the structure of the various software and hardware layers of a system (e.g. machine architecture, operating system, compilers, and user programs) has a great impact on the overall performance. Traditionally, systems have supported resource management at low levels of the hierarchy to allow better use of machinespecific features. More recently, higher-level libraries and application-specific operating systems have taken more of this responsibility so that they can use program behavior to determine resource use. Both approaches have disadvantages - the former is too application-independent, while the latter requires too many application-specific modules. This project avoids these problems by using compile-time information, program transformations, and smart runtime systems to efficiently use system resources. To do this, the compiler will rely on developments in Java mobile code, which will avoid pitfalls that have trapped previous research projects in this area.\r\n\r\nThe compiler that this project produces will analyze program-level behavior, generate program-specific system management code, and choose appropriate management policies automatically. It will make three important contributions: new compiler algorithms to analyze and optimize a program's utilization of system resources, precise models of network and storage devices to aid in resource management, and \"wide\" interfaces to system layers to enable management policies to be chosen by the compiler or runtime system. The project will integrate this research understanding with education by incorporating a wide variety of state-of-the-art tools into coursework. These tools will enable the students to better understand the tradeoffs between static and dynamic approaches to computing.\r\n",
