 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physiological demands imposed by the environment are, of course,\r\nfundamentally different for marine fish and birds.  The cellular and\r\nmolecular processes that control inorganic phosphate and sulfate, however,\r\nappear similar, though they may be used differently.  It is by comparing\r\nand contrasting these systems that we gain insight into the general\r\nprinciples of ion regulation.  The long-term goals of this project are to\r\nbetter understand the comparative physiology of the mechanisms and\r\nregulation of renal transport of inorganic phosphate and sulfate. These\r\nanions can alter calcium balance, acid-base balance, urinary buffer\r\ncapacity, extracellular matrix of bone and cartilage, etc., and their\r\nlevels are tightly controlled in all vertebrates.  Dietary in-take,\r\nintestinal absorption and renal excretion are the sole determinants, aside\r\nfrom growth, of body phosphate and sulfate balance.  Excretion of these\r\nanions is a result of renal filtration, reabsorption and secretion.  The\r\nkidney is the most important site of regulation of excretion of these\r\nanions in the body.  We here propose likely mecha-nisms  regulating\r\nphosphate and sulfate transport in members of two verte-brate classes\r\n(winter flounder and chicken).  Methods are used which permit\r\ncharacterization of anion transport at several levels of organization\r\n(proximal tubule primary cultures, isolated proximal tubule brush-border\r\nand basolateral membrane vesicles, and renal clearance).  We also have a\r\nreasonable understanding of the basic intracellular signaling systems that\r\nactivate and inactivate membrane mechanisms for reabsorption or secretion\r\nof these anions in both species.   Regulation of transport by proximal\r\ntubule involves the interaction of several hormones, acid-base status, and\r\nphosphate and sulfate availability.  We will examine a variety of hormones\r\nthat may control kidney handling of phosphate.  In addition, our recent\r\nstudies indicate an important role for carbonic anhydrase in renal sulfate\r\nsecretion by marine fishes.  The enzyme's role probably stems from the\r\nmembrane anion exchangers responsible for sulfate secretion.  Because this\r\ntransepithelial transport process is profoundly influenced by steroid\r\nhormones in both flounder and chicken, we have here proposed to examine a\r\npossible regulatory effect of steroids (including vitamin D3) on carbonic\r\nanhydrase activity and renal sulfate transport in both fish and chicks.\r\n",
