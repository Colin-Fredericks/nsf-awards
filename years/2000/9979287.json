 "awd_abstract_narration": "interCONNECTIONS is a new kind of book series designed especially for young girls ages 8-11.  The collection focuses on the ability to take abstract concepts such as atomic structure, the Pythagorean Theorem, music, color, or magnetic fields and explain them through metaphor and imagery that might be more familiar at a young age.  The series is meant not only to help explain these concepts but also to illustrate how they are connected to one another, how everything is connected.  These books are similar in format to modular toys and board games, with mechanical/scientific mechanisms embedded in them.  \r\n     The goal of the project is to test and evaluate the education efficacy, the appeal of the narrative approach to the content, and the overall usability of these books.  Ultimately, this project will serve as a proof of concept and yield the first three books of the series ready for manufacture/publication and dissemination.  ODYSSEY Books will serve to position the books simultaneously in the educational and consumer markets.\r\n     Girls ages 8-11 are the primary target audience of interCONNECTIONS.  However, this product will also serve elementary and middle school teachers, librarians, and parents.  All of these target groups will be involved in the prototype-testing phase of the project.  Subjects for testing will be invited from at least three different schools across the United States.  The research model for testing will be established and conducted with the consultation of Design Research Associates, Inc., and ODYSSEY Books.\r\n     interCONNECTIONS will help girls connect to abstract phenomena at an early age, thus allowing them more accessibility and comfort in scientific and engineering fields as high school and college students.   In the earliest prototype, The Universe Is in My Face, concepts were introduced with something that young girls are more familiar with or interested in, such as their faces (eyes are part of faces, molecules make up eyes, atoms make up molecules and electrons give eyes color).  Suddenly, a scientific and intangible concept such as atomic structure is made perceptible and concrete.\r\n     Specifically, the series will enable girls to (1) make connections between mechanical activity and abstract ideas; (2) make physical connections between boards, using a new technology that also demonstrates the content of the books; (3) connect one book (representing, for example, magnetic fields) with the next books (atomic structure), and the next (color theory) and so on; (4) develop a confidence in their own inquiry through identification with the narrator, Phoebe.\r\n     Previous research underscores the important roles of concrete/mechanical activity in education and play - hence the mechanical emphasis in the format of the project.  LORD Corporation will be collaborating with the principal investigator to develop a magneto-rheological (MR) connecting component for the books as a way of augmenting the overall content of interCONNECTIONS.  The MR technology will have particular resonance in book one, Phoebe's Field, which is about magnetic and electrical fields.\r\n\r\n",
