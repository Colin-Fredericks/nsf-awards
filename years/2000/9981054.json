 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nA group of faculty in Mathematics and Education propose to design and pilot an online support system for first year mathematics courses at UNC-CH and for math teachers in the public schools. Appropriate software, readily used by math students and teachers, will be identified and negotiations for further development begun. The primary themes addressed are teacher preparation and integration of technology, with other themes intrinsically included. The Online Math Help Center for freshman courses extends a new and successful walk-in help center to provide broader access to a more diverse group of the 4500 students enrolled annually in these courses. In the first year of this grant, the basic website will be designed and tested in pilot sections of two first-year math courses. Through the pilot program, the effect on student learning, performance and satisfaction can be measured. With the implementation of the University's requirement for laptops, every student will have a direct link to support services offered by the Department. The second component of this project is the Math Connections site, through which public school teachers will browse applications developed to suit their curricular needs; discuss mathematics, direct questions and exchange ideas or materials with faculty, graduate students and other teachers. It provides a crucial direct link between the public school teachers and professional mathematicians. During the grant period, the site will be developed and work with pre-service teachers begun; contacts with in-service teachers established. An assessment of the effect on student teaching will be completed. The partnership with LEARN NC provides an essential connection with schools across the state.\r\n",
