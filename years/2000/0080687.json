Learning requires association of environmental stimuli such that they have predictive value and retention of these associations between stimuli over time underlies memory.  Identification and characterization of the molecular mechanisms necessary for learning and memory is cardinal to our understanding of brain function and to eventually ameliorate, or cure brain malfunction.  The specific problem addressed in this proposal focuses on the function of a very abundant group of brain proteins, the 14-3-3 proteins.  The goals of the project are to utilize the simple, but genetically powerful Drosophila melanogaster system to investigate the properties of these proteins within the brain as they relate to learning and memory.  Drosophila has been used extensively as a model system to discover genes and functions pertinent to human development.  Since this model system is endowed with powerful molecular and genetic tools including the first animal genome to be fully sequenced, it offers a unique opportunity to study the function of these proteins within the context of the entire live organism.  This system allows molecular, genetic histological and behavioral methods to be used to understand the role and regulation of 14-3-3 protein function in the brain.  \r\nDespite their abundance and presence in every animal species, the precise role of 14-3-3 proteins, especially in the context of an entire organism is not well understood.  With respect to learning and memory, or brain function in general little is known about the role of these proteins.  Therefore, the proposed research will lead not only to better understanding of the functional properties of 14-3-3 proteins, but will elucidate basic molecular mechanisms of brain function essential for learning and memory.  \r\n",
