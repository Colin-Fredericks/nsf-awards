 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concentrates primarily on the investigation of\r\nmathematical problems that arise in the study of molecular quantum\r\nmechanics. The nuclei in a molecule have large masses. Consequently, their\r\nmotion is approximately described by classical mechanics. By comparison,\r\nelectron masses are very small, and electrons adjust their quantum\r\nmechanical states rapidly in response to the much slower motion of the\r\nnuclei. This intuition is the basis for Born-Oppenheimer approximations.\r\nProfessor Hagedorn, his graduate students, and his collaborators will\r\nstudy situations where Born-Oppenheimer approximations are not\r\nsufficiently accurate to describe all the phenomena of interest. For\r\nexample, they plan to develop accurate \"surface hopping models\" to include\r\nthe possibility of electrons making quantum mechanical transitions. Models\r\nof this type have been proposed in the chemistry and physics literature,\r\nbut they have not been derived from first principles. The main goal of\r\nthis project is rigorously to derive and implement such a model.\r\n\r\nMotion of electrons and nuclei in molecules are well described by\r\nsolutions to the Schrodinger equation. No one has ever solved the\r\nSchrodinger equation for a molecule, and our theoretical knowledge of\r\nchemistry and molecular physics has come from approximations to solutions.\r\nThe principal goals of this project are to study the several commonly used\r\napproximations and to develop improved approximations that will be useful\r\nto chemists and physicists. In addition to theoretical understanding,\r\npotential uses of this basic research are the synthesis of new chemical\r\ncompounds, the design of new catalysts, or the design of new drugs.\r\n",
