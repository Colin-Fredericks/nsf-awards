 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes the formation of the Illinois Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Illinois LS-AMP) and presents a comprehensive plan for improving the quality of undergraduate education for underrepresented minority students in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET).\r\n\r\nThe Alliance will focus on increasing the number of minority students from Illinois LS-AMP who choose to major in a SMET discipline, persist in the science pipeline and are prepared to attend graduate school or to teach in SMET disciplines.  Illinois LS-AMP activities will enhance the growth of the SMET community at and among Alliance institutions and promote linkages and partnerships in undergraduate SMET education throughout Illinois.  In order to accomplish these objectives, the Alliance will utilize strategies that include:  1) pre-college and community college bridge programs to ease the transition and better prepared freshman and transfer students; 2) faculty and peer mentoring to help retain students in SMET disciplines; 3) supplemental instruction (study groups, tutorials, workshops, study skills training) to strengthen students ability and resolve to succeed in gatekeeper and higher level courses; 4) academic year and summer undergraduate research to prepare and develop students for transitioning to graduate school; 5) curriculum revision; and 6) industry internships.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois LS-AMP universities from a diverse group of public and private institutions in urban and rural settings:  Chicago State University (CSU), lead institution, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), DePaul University (DPU), Illinois State University (ISU), Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville (SIUE), Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), and Governors State University (GSU).  The participation of the City Colleges of Chicago completes the Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe presidents of Illinois LS-AMP baccalaureate institutions and the Chancellor of the Chicago Community College (CCC) System will comprise a Governing Board committed to the institutionalization of successful AMP activities, establishing policy and obtaining additional financial and resources support from the Illinois legislature, Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE), foundations, and industrial and business communities.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois LS-AMP has a strong assessment component, with external evaluation and internal feedback.  External suggestions and assistance will be furnished by a Program Advisory Committee (PAC), the composition of which provides a connection with the Illinois business community, the public high schools, graduate schools, state and national policy makers and national research institutions.\r\n\r\n",
