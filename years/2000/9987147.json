 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop, implement and assess a scholarship program, July 1, 2000 - June 30, 2002. The mission of the Program is to provide opportunities to 40 low-income, academically talented students that promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement in the targeted disciplines. Applying an existing infrastructure to the Program is envisioned to generate higher retention rates of students most at-risk not completing their degree program. \r\n\r\nA unique collaboration is proposed between the School of Engineering, the Departments of Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science, and the Office of Minority Student Affairs to identify and select 40 participants, provide sufficient support services to graduate 95% of the participants, provide faculty mentors for the participants, and implement a series of workshops to engage participants in research and community service activities relevant to their degree program. A tracking system will be designed to address issues that emerge during the life of the project, follow-up to determine postgraduate plans and activities, and on-going academic performance to meet scholarship requirements. \r\n\r\nThe proposed Program will be an opportunity to research and address issues that affect retention and graduation of continuing students. Generally, continuing students are assumed to have acquired the resources and skills necessary to succeed on their own, however it is our experience that this may not be the case. Instead, students facing persistent financial challenges are less likely to complete their degree in a timely manner, require some intervention to maintain their focus, and guidance into the next phase of their academic and professional journey. The Program is designed to enable at-risk students to remain in a position to succeed academically, graduate and enter a professional field.\r\n",
