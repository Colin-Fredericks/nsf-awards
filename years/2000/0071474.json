 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a coherent research program of modeling, analysis and\r\nnumerical simulation of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The mathematical\r\ninvestigation of such devices forces the researcher to understand the behavior\r\nand coupling of fluid, electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical forces on the\r\nmicron length scale. The focus of this project is the coupling of electrostatic\r\nand mechanical forces in MEMS devices. Due to their favorable scaling with device\r\nsize, electrostatic forces are often used to actuate mechanical members of such\r\ndevices. The mathematical modeling of this effect requires an understanding of \r\ncoupled nonlinear elliptic systems of partial differential equations. \r\nThe system consists of the equations of electrostatics coupled to the \r\nNavier equations of elasticity. Generally, the equations are coupled in two ways. \r\nFirst, the electrostatic potential appears as a source of mechanical force in the \r\nNavier equations. Second, the boundaries of the domain for the electrostatic \r\nproblem depend upon mechanical deflections and hence the solution to the \r\nNavier equations. This two way nonlinear coupling is often additionally \r\ncomplicated by the appearance of nonlocal terms when the device is embedded \r\nin a circuit. In this work, a sequence of mathematical models of such devices \r\nwill be designed to explain phenomena associated with MEMS devices, improve \r\nexisting or suggest new numerical simulation methods and ultimately\r\naid in the design of existing and future MEMS devices. \r\n\r\nThe field of microelectromechanical systems has undergone a startling revolution\r\nin recent years. It is now possible to produce functioning motors\r\nthat can only be seen with the aid of a microscope, gears smaller than a\r\ngrain of pollen, and needles so tiny they can deliver an injection without\r\nstimulating nerve cells. The use of existing integrated circuit technology\r\nin the design and production of MEMS devices allows these devices to be\r\nbatch processed, hence made in quantity, inexpensively. This in turn is\r\nigniting a revolution in areas such as biotechnology, where devices that\r\nonce could only be dreamed about have suddenly been made possible. \r\nIn order to realize the full potential of MEMS, a theoretical understanding\r\nof their function is necessary. This requires the construction and analysis\r\nof mathematical models of such devices. Of particular interest are devices which\r\nutilize electrostatic forces to provide locomotion. This class of devices will\r\nbe modeled and analyzed in this project. This analysis will yield insight into\r\nthe operation and future design of MEMS devices. Further, by developing an understanding\r\nof electrostatically actuated MEMS on a fundamental level, the research will suggest\r\ntechniques for efficient numerical simulation of more complicated structures.\r\n\r\n",
