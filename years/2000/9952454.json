 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) This project develops a laboratory for studying administrative aspects of computer networking and operating systems. The laboratory includes mini-networks of PC workstations and servers, plus Ethernet hubs, routers, and an Ethernet/ATM switch for connectivity. The project adapts materials developed through NSF Award 9750885 to the University of Michigan.  This project adapts the materials to use the Linux rather than NT operating system and increases the emphasis on measurement and experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory allows students to install and manage a network of PCs, program routers both for normal use and as packet-filtering firewalls, and to measure network performance of different technologies. Prior to this project, students at Rockhurst did not get any experience in these areas  since all of the College's networking resources were used for essential infrastructure and were unavailable for experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory will be integrated into two regularly offered courses in networking and operating systems. Many of the adapted and newly developed exercises will also be used as supplemental materials in three other courses. The project director will host two one week summer workshops for faculty development.  All developed materials will be available through courseware repositories on the Web and results will be presented at computer science education conferences. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
