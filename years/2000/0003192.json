 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mass balance of tropical cyclones is not well understood, but better understanding is crucial to understanding hurricane dynamics and to understand hurricane precipitation processes.  The principal objective of this research is to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimates in landfalling tropical cyclones through improvement in the understanding of the relative importance of different precipitation processes at various locations in hurricanes and their effects upon storm structure.  Data to be analyzed is from a new, advanced cloud physics instrument that was deployed during the summer of 1998.  Specifically, data will be analyzed to determine cloud particle density under a variety of environmental conditions.  This research will be conducted in collaboration with NOAA scientists and success will lead to improved understanding of precipitation processes within hurricanes.",
