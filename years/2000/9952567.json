 "awd_abstract_narration": "This builds on a previous project where a lack of geometric visualization in the student comprehension of three-dimensional concepts was discovered. With the help of mechanical engineering students from the school of engineering, a system and set of tools is being created. This set of tools is helping students of science and engineering visualize concepts relating to points, surfaces, curves, contours, and vectors in three dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe goals for the project are the following: \r\n(a) to manufacture sets of these tools, which can be used both by instructors and by students in small groups. \r\n(b) to publish an accompanying manual for the use of these tools. \r\n(c) to locate partner institutions to pilot test these tools.\r\n\r\nTo realize these goals, mechanical engineering students are refining tools currently being used to a level where they can be mass-produced. The senior personnel are writing the accompanying manual for their effective use. Local tests are being run to test their effectiveness. Partner institutions are being identified to help pilot test these tools.\r\n\r\nThis project is having a strong impact on underrepresented minorities in SEM fields. It involves faculty development and the integration of new tools in the mathematics curriculum.\r\n",
