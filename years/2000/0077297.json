Within the broader field of nanostructured materials, microstructural engineering and surface reactivity of nanostructured materials are of great scientific interest and enormous technological potential, especially as they relate to the development of highly efficient and mote reliable gas reactive systems.  In fact, advances made in the last decade in the development of novel synthesis and processing methods make it possible to control the microstructure and the chemistry of these materials at the nanoscale level.  Improved characterization techniques and modeling permit improved understanding of microstructural effects on the complex gas-surface reaction processes. Motivated by the enormous scientific interest generated in nanostructured materials and considering their critical importance in the development of efficient and cost-effective gas reactive systems, it is timely to have this conference.  The conference brings together international researchers from academia, research establishments, and industry to discuss recent advances in the development of nanostructured materials and outline future research directions for this field.\r\n%%%\r\nThe proper utilization of nanostructured materials, using new and versatile synthesis and processing methods, improved characterization techniques, and theoretical modeling, aided by system design and integration, will lead to the development of more efficient and cost-effective gas sensors, getters, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage devices.\r\n***\r\n",
