 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (21), (59) This project administers financial, academic, and non-academic support to a cohort of low income students whose academic merit is high. The project includes a new one credit Mathematics/Engineering Laboratory course being offered for at least the duration of the award. It is designed to provide support, including research experience, professional development, career planning, and counseling, to junior and senior undergraduate students majoring in mathematics and engineering disciplines. A small group of advanced graduate students have mentoring functions, enhancing their preparation for careers as researchers and educators. The lab is open to all students in selected courses, but registration in every semester is required of scholarship recipients. The application mechanism for scholarships solicits information on students' academic merit, professionalism, and financial need, and ascertains the nature of the academic and non-academic support that enhances students' prospects for graduation within two years. \r\n\r\nScholarships to approximately thirty six undergraduates each academic year remedies, to some degree, the financial need that forces many to take part time employment during the academic year. Since such employment inhibits their participation in ongoing support activities in the College of Engineering, these students have not previously formed networks with other students and faculty. One of the primary functions of the laboratory is to provide all math and engineering undergraduates the opportunity to form peer working groups. \r\nLaboratory activities evolve each semester, although some course support for all registered students is provided by graduate student mentors in every semester. The first semester of activity is devoted to program orientation. Students whose application indicates the desire for non-academic support services are identified and directed to campus programs such as the Counseling Center, Student Support Services, the Center for Learning Experience, and other appropriate services. Math/Engineering faculty make presentations in the lab to recruit students to work on current research projects. During the second semester, scholarship students are required to prepare a research proposal to join an active research group. During the third and fourth semesters, scholarship students engage in research. Lab activities prepare students for their postgraduate careers through career planning, development of interview skills, and graduate school advisement. The laboratory serves as a forum for students to meet with representatives of industries that employ Math/Engineering graduates. \r\n",
