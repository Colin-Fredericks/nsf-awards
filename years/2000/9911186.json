 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sesquiterpenoid compounds have been identified in plant emissions in numerous studies and are suspected to participate in aerosol-forming processes and heterogeneous reactions in the atmosphere.  Understanding the role of these compounds in atmospheric processes is challenged by the lack of analytical capabilities and ambient measurements.  In this project, a capillary diffusion-based calibration system will be built to generate well-defined gas-phase concentrations of sesquiterpenoid compounds.  A gas chromatography/flame ionization detection instrument will provide automated and continuous on-line monitoring of the system output.  The calibration system will be designed to allow addition of potential analytical interferences to the analytes, such as water and ozone, in order to study the effects of these atmospheric components on the SQT recovery rate and the analytical precision and accuracy.  Sampling, storage and analysis methods using either whole air sampling techniques into bags and canisters and collection onto solid adsorption cartridges will be investigated for their analytical suitability.  These studies will develop methodology for the reliable measurement of sesquiterpenoid compounds in air for ambient measurements and flux studies.\r\n\r\n",
