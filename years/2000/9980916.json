 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuroscience students are exploring neural development and the phenomena of excitable cells that give rise to resting membrane potentials, action potentials, synaptic potentials, and synaptic plasticity. They are doing this in the spirit of scientific exploration, with open-ended experiments that they are helping to design. Students set the goals, propose experimental methods for answering research questions, and analyze and report their findings. This is being done in a cooperative environment with the professor acting to facilitate exploration rather than presenting a protocol and expected results.  Research experiences are making use of live invertebrate animals (crayfish, snail, and earthworm), frogs, cultured cells, and computer models.  Significant portions of this course are being adapted from a successful neuroscience course developed and taught at Rhodes College.  Experience with the pedagogy and equipment used in this neuroscience course is being carred over to the revision of the team-taught anatomy & physiology courses and other new course development.\r\n",
