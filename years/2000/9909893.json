 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported by this award includes a variety of studies. The ring opening of disilylcyclopropanes to form 1,3-diradicals; the generation of quadricyclene, norbornyne,  norbornenyne, 3,3,44-tetrfluorocyclobutyne and 1,2-cyclobutadiene radical anions are among the experimental goals of the work.  A number of computational projects are also proposed.   Representative examples include:  the partitioning between direct and statistical trajectories in the Cope rearrangement  of 1,2,6-heptadiene, the effects of substituents and solvent on the three lowest electronic states of phenylnitrene, the Cope rearrangements of mono-, di- and triphenyl-1,5-hexadienes, cycloadditions of cyclopentyne to alkenes, reductive elimination from Pt(0) and Pt(II) complexes and the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of stereoisomeric (R3P)2Re(CO)3(H2)+ species.\r\n\r\nWith this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Weston T. Borden of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington.   Professor Borden will focus his work on a combination of experimental and theoretical problems.  The proposed studies are aimed at developing and testing theoretical models, that explain and predict the chemistry and spectroscopy of organic and organometallic molecules.  The proposed research will benefit the scientific infrastructure by educating undergraduate and graduate students, through the involvement of three faculty members from schools with only undergraduate research programs, and by continued exchanges of information and expertise with the many groups with which Dr. Borden's group collaborates.\r\n\r\n",
