 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAn international partnership is proposed to create a zooplankton genomic (ZooGen) database of DNA type sequences for calanoid copepods and euphausiids. The ZooGen database will be designed to include all species of these groups and to allow expansion to additional zooplankton groups. The ZooGen partnership includes four P.I.s and thirteen expert taxonomic consultants from seven countries. Zooplankton samples will be sorted from existing archival collections, obtained in coordination with planned oceanographic research efforts, and collected during National Marine Fisheries Service field surveys. The taxonomic experts will confirm species' identifications; DNA sequencing will be done at the University of New Hampshire and, in some cases, in other partners' laboratories. For each species, a DNA type sequence will be determined for a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) gene; multiple mtCOI sequences will be included as necessary to reflect intraspecific variation. The ZooGen database will be designed, created, managed, maintained, and distributed as part of the proposed work; the data will be integrated into the Ocean Biogeographical Information System (OBIS). Education and outreach efforts will include: training of graduate students at UNH and UW; a hands?on Molecular Systematics Workshop at UNH during Summer, 2001; exchanges between the P.Ls, international partners, and their colleagues and students; inclusion of ZooGen molecular and environmental data in the OBIS database, among others; creation and maintenance of a project web site; production of a CD with the ZooGen database and simple search tools; and informal education with the assistance of UNH Sea Grant Educators and Marine Docents.\r\n",
