 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:  DMS-0072356\r\nPI: Jerzy Dydak\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator plans to work on\r\n a general theory of dimension called\r\nthe extension dimension. In this theory, dim(X) is not a natural number.\r\nInstead, dim(X) is a CW complex and dim(X) being at most K\r\nmeans that K is an absolute extensor of X. In particular,\r\ndim(X) being at most the n-sphere is equivalent to the covering dimension\r\nof X being at most n. dim(X)=K means that K\r\nis minimal with respect to all L such that dim(X) is at most L.\r\nIt turns out that infinite symmetric products play a crucial role\r\nin the whole theory. Their properties lead to a natural algebra\r\nwith self-duality. That self-duality is an algebraic manifestation\r\nof the geometric duality between compact spaces and CW complexes.\r\nAll infinite symmetric products equivalent to compact\r\nor finite-dimensional CW complexes are classified.\r\n\r\nIn classical dimension theory one tries to attach\r\na natural number n (or infinity) to every space.\r\nIt turns out that the natural number n is simply a substitute\r\nfor the n-sphere and saying that dim(X) is at most n reflects\r\na certain relationship between the space X and the n-sphere.\r\nOne can generalize the notion of dimension by considering\r\nthe same relationship between the space X and a polyhedron K\r\nand that is stated as \"dimension of X is at most K\". For example, one can\r\ninvestigate if the dimension of X is at most the projective plane.\r\nIt turns out that the dimension theory constructed that way\r\nis much closely connected to the mainstream of topology.\r\nIn particular, one gets links to homological algebra\r\nand algebraic topology. One of the most interesting aspects of\r\nthat theory is duality, a fundamental idea in the whole of\r\nmathematics. At the simplest level it means that not only\r\nare we trying to attach dimension (a polyhedron) to a space,\r\nbut also we attach a space to a dimension.\r\n\r\n",
