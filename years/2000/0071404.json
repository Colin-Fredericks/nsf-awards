Kudla (University of Maryland)\r\nFreydoon Shahidi (Purdue University)\r\n\r\nThis project will provide support allowing young researchers from  the US mathematical community to benefit from participation in   the special program at the Institute Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris  in the spring semester 2000. This program focuses on two topics:  (i) Shimura varieties and the trace formula and  (ii) congruences and Galois representations.  These topics, and particularly their interaction, will certainly  be at the center of much of the research activity in automorphic  forms and number theory in the opening decades of the 21st century.  The activity at IHP will bring together the world leaders in these  areas. The program will center around a series of lecture `courses' covering the latest developments concering the trace formula, endoscopy,  the fundamental lemma, L functions for Shimura varieties, global and  local Langlands functoriality,  Galois representations,  p-adic Hecke algebras, p-adic modular forms, rigid analysis, the local Langlands  correspondence and the geometric Langlands correspondence.  The scope of the program encourages new directions for research  at the interface of the two major fields and participation will  provide young researchers a  unique opportunity to develop expertise  in this important area at an early stage in their careers.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTwo major developments in mathematics in the later part of  the 20th century are the Langlands program in automorphic  forms/representation theory and the Wiles and Taylor-Wiles  proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura  conjecture. These advances, relating number theory and geometry,  are in fact very closely linked, and a vigorous development of  the union of the techniques from the two areas is currently taking  place. The resulting field will be one of the main arenas of  research activity in mathematics  in the first decades of the  21st century. The research program taking place at the  Institute Henri Poincare in Paris in the spring  semester 2000 and centered around lecture courses by the world leaders   provides an unparalleled level of vision and insight. This NSF Grant  award will provide funding for young researchers from the US  mathematical commmunity to participate in the IHP program,  and hence will help to ensure a strong level of US expertise  in these new developments in number theory.  \r\n \r\nThis award is being supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (Algebra and Number Theort program), the Divison of International  Programs (Western Europe Program), and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate .\r\n",
