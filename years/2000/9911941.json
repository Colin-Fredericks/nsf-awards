 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NAE Committee on Engineering Education (CEE) was established in August 1999 within the NAE's Independent Program Office.  The mission of this new committee is to strengthen the National Academies' (NAE,NAS,IOM, and NRC) collective voice and service to the nation on issues pertaining to the vitality and currency of engineering education in the United States. As a standing committee, the CEE consolidates the membership, functions, and ongoing activities of both the former NRC Board on Engineering Education (BEEd) and the former NAE Academic Advisory Board (AAB), thus bringing the Academies' efforts in the area of engineering education into close affiliation with the Office of the NAE President.\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation will support the planned core activities of the CEE for the period October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2004.  \r\n\r\nThe general objectives of the CEE's proposed effort are to:\r\n\r\nIdentify significant issues in engineering education and collect the information necessary for their detailed examination;\r\n\r\nDevelop long-term strategies for engineering education in the context of changing national and global circumstances, technologies, and societal and industrial needs;\r\n\r\nRecommend specific policies to implement these strategies to appropriate national and state government agencies, and university administrations;\r\n\r\nOrganize studies on future possibilities in technologies and industrial practices and serve as a bellwether for the improvement of engineering curricula and institutions;\r\n\r\nEngage in public education and outreach on issues relevant to its mission; and\r\n\r\nProvide for ongoing assessment of the impact of CEE activities on the currency of engineering education in the United States.\r\n",
