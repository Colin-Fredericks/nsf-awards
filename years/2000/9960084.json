 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop compact, all-solid-state drivers for powering laser diode arrays and thereby increase their lifetime.  New ultra-high-current semiconductor switch technology will be coupled with new proprietary diode protection circuits to extend diode laser lifetime tenfold.  This leads directly to a tenfold reduction in annual laser operating cost. Recent breakthroughs in high power semiconductor technology, namely the GCT (Gate Commutated Thyristor) switch, also offer a tenfold improvement in speed and power over existing commercial devices. SRL (Science Research Laboratory )  proposes to develop an advanced, compact pulsed power module based on these technologies that has the power, speed and protection circuitry needed to reliably drive high power laser diode arrays.  This GCT-based power conditioning technology offers the improvements in system compactness, reliability and lifetime that are essential to the economic viability of laser diode arrays for many new commercial applications. \r\n \r\nGCT technology coupled with proprietary SRL fast protection circuitry offers a tenfold decrease in diode laser array size and weight and a tenfold increase in diode lifetime.  This new technology is also essential to developing the pulsed power required for critical medical applications including new and improved methods of detecting metastatic cancer and new cancer therapies now under development at SRL and at other laboratories.\r\n",
