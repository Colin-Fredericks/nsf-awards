 "awd_abstract_narration": "9986854\r\nCRISMOND\r\n\r\n\"Design\" is an aspect of the science standards with which middle school teachers have little experience, and where the professional development need is acute.  \"Science by Design\" takes this need as its starting point. Its focus is to upgrade the content and pedagogical knowledge of science teachers' knowledge in design-based science.  The primary approach is to create eight videotaped vignettes of design in action based on exemplary design-based curricula.  They will illustrate exemplary teachers and are based on prototypic design curricula developed in the United States and in Britain.  The vignettes can be utilized in professional development meetings to engage teachers in reflective talk.  Beyond videos, the project will produce supporting CD-ROM and paper-based professional development materials that provide commentary by internationally known engineering design and technology experts on the design process, the culture of design, and pitfalls one can expect in teaching design in classrooms.  To integrate design activities into their classrooms successfully, teachers engage in activities that help them acquire expert knowledge in using design-based science to challenge students.  That knowledge is anchored in exemplary curriculum materials and on prototypic demonstrations.  In turn, these teachers then help their students to acquire scientific expertise by constructing scientific knowledge through insights provided by the design process. \r\n\r\n",
