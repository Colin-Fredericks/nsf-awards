It is directed at students and teachers of biology in grades 8-12.  In addition to a 5-part series of 20- to 30-minute instructional videos, there will be a comprehensive teacher's guidebook and a web site to provide additional background information, classroom learning activities and independent research projects.  Basic knowledge of genetics, particularly molecular genetics, is becoming more and more important for every person in our nation.  Recent advances in food production and medicine in particular mandate that all people have a solid understanding of fundamental genetic principles.  However, the content is new and complex.  This project will introduce difficult concepts in genetics with an engaging format designed to appeal to the student audience through the creative use of music, animation and humor.  It will easily integrate into existing biology curricula, and will serve as a launching point for inquiry-based investigations.  There is a well-conceived dissemination plan, which includes public broadcasts on Public Broadcasting Stations in the US and Canada, with subsequent sales.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n",
