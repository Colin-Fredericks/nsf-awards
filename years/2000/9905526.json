 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine the role of Reynolds number in the structure of the turbulent boundary layer.  Measurements of important terms in transport equations will be made at the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science (SLTEST) facility at Reynolds numbers ranging from 103 to 106.  The SLTEST facility makes use of the atmospheric surface layer that flows over the Great Salt Lake Desert in western Utah.  Probes will provide spatially and temporally resolved measurements of the individual terms in the equations describing the transport of axial stress and concentration variance.   Measurements will also be made of the velocity-vorticity correlations.  A scalar transport probe, consisting of two photo-ionization sensors and four hot-wires, will be used to obtain data relating to the scalar variance transport equation. The SLTEST facility will produce low-speed, large length-scale boundary layers.  The importance of these facilities is that they allow highly resolved spatial and temporal measurements.  For the purposes of engineering applications such as aerodynamic vehicle drag reduction, fundamental understanding of transport mechanisms could be useful in design.",
