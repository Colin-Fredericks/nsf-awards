 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year study will document in depth, and develop explanatory constructs for, practices in four urban schools where the schools and/or specific teacher have an outstanding record of placing or sustaining students in college preparatory mathematics:  a San Francisco middle school with large numbers of African-American and Latino students, a Boston K-6 pilot school with a similara demographic profile; and a high school/feeder school pair in Jackson, MS, with 99% African-American students.  The study will use ethnographic methods to examine classroom teachers', administrators', youth interactions, in the context of the school and community.  Classrooms and aftershcool learning environments will be extensively videotaped,  and interactions will be analyzed.  The analyses will detail the development of mathematical ideas as well as the social processes of teaching and learning.  As a secondary goal, the researchers will examine dimensions and varibles emerging from  the analysis and consider problems of measurement and \"operationalization\" for large-scale quantitative research.  The research draws on current theoretical perspectives and research methods on learning, including situated learning, integration of social and individual aspects of learning, communities of practice that indluence students' learning and identities as mathematics learners, and methods for analysis of discourse, paraticipant structures, and mathematics content.  The participating schools are members of the \"Algebra Project,\" a middle schyool project founded in the mid80s to increase proportion of minority students who complete algebra siccessfully in late middle school or high school and enter college preparatory studies.",
