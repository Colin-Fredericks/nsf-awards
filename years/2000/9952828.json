 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  This project is developing laboratory experiences that combine modeling exercises with student-designed experiments to improve the ability of students to connect biological content (e.g., theories, empirical knowledge) with experimental design and results.  Much of the modeling employs the STELLA programming package.  With this software, students generate and explore dynamic computer models that realistically simulate lab and field-based experiments.  The Systems Thinking and Curriculum Innovation Project (STACI) demonstrated that such exercises improve students' ability to understand causal relationships in complex systems and to develop and interpret models and their output.  Following initiatives undertaken in the Department of Biology at Wake Forest University where students employ STELLA modeling explore population dynamics and physiological response, we are adapting this software to our present investigative teaching laboratories by developing model-experiment experiences across all levels of the biology curriculum.  Modeling efforts prior to experiments help students design more relevant experiments, articulate specific hypotheses, and generate quantitative predictions that logically follow from their hypotheses.  Following experiments, summary models force students to clarify outcomes and provide opportunities to apply their results to novel situations, much like practicing biologists.  Models and experiments are integrated into diverse fields of study that include animal behavior, ecology, and plant physiology.  This project also is expanding three major experimental capabilities; quantitative analysis of behavior using a video-image capture and processing system; nitrogen and phosphorus analysis of tissues, water and soils using a continuous flow autoanalyzer; and growth of plants under elevated carbon dioxide conditions in open-topped growth chambers.  Each extends the capacity of students to carry out meaningful experiments, and each is used in combination with modeling exercises to enhance investigative learning in several different courses.  This project presents a strategy for integrating modeling with experiments in teaching laboratories that strengthens Union College's curriculum.  \r\n\r\n",
