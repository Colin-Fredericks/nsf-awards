Using techniques from human behavioral ecology and microeconomic theory, this project will investigate the causes of dowry inflation in Bangalore, South India. It will specifically test a number of hypotheses concerning the relationships between economic factors, fertility patterns, parental investment, and marriage systems. Survey data on these variables will be collected from 200 women in four endogamous communities in Bangalore. These communities have different population profiles regarding socioeconomic status, education, and degree of modernity. This will be supplemented with structured interviews on the social and economic history of each community, and the marriage arrangement and negotiation process. This project will contribute to theory in human behavioral ecology, and to our understanding of the factors shaping marriage practices cross-culturally.\r\n\r\n",
