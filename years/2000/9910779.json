 "awd_abstract_narration": "The function of vision is to provide information to the observer in order\r\nto facilitate subsequent action on the environment.  Accurate perception\r\nentails discernment of the boundaries, coherence, and unity of objects.\r\nThis process is challenged by the fact that many objects are partly\r\noccluded by other, nearer objects.  Successful object completion under\r\nconditions of partial occlusion resides in the appropriate attention to and\r\nutilization of several sources of visual information, such as the\r\nluminance, color, texture, motion, and depth of visible surfaces.  A\r\ncomplete account of object perception must include studies of its\r\ndevelopment, and recent research has contributed important information to\r\nour knowledge in this area.  Interestingly, at birth infants seem to\r\nrespond to a partly occluded object as if it consists of two disjoint\r\nsurfaces, even if it provides a clear percept of unity to adults.  By 2\r\nmonths of age, in contrast, infants have been found to perceive object\r\nunity under some circumstances, and this skill improves over the following\r\nmonths.  Thus humans are not born with the ability to perceive object\r\nunity, but it develops very rapidly over the first few months.  At present\r\nthere are disagreements among researchers with respect to the mechanisms of\r\ndevelopment of perception of object unity.  For example, young infants have\r\nbeen claimed to rely exclusively on motion, and not other cues such as\r\nsurface appearance, to disambiguate visual scenes involving partial\r\nocclusion.  Other approaches invoke \"core principles\" that guide object\r\nperception from birth, such that the perceptual experience of bounded,\r\nsegregated objects is shared by all human observers, even very young\r\ninfants.  Recent research, however, provides evidence against both these\r\nviews:  Young infants, like adults, appear to rely on several sources of\r\nvisual information in object perception tasks, including motion as well as\r\nsurface orientation, color, texture, and depth.  On this account, the\r\ndevelopment of veridical responses to objects proceeds via improvements in\r\nthe utilization of all these cues.  Despite this advance in theoretical\r\napproaches to the development of object perception, important questions\r\nremain.  The present research will investigate issues surrounding how infants\r\nrespond to the depth and segregation of objects in their environment.  The \r\ngoal is to further elucidate the constraints that guide this fundamental perceptual \r\nskill in the first few months after birth.  This will be accomplished by testing\r\nthe role of specific visual cues in young infants' perception of object unity, as\r\nwell as explorations of young infants' visual scanning of object displays, to chart\r\ndevelopmental changes in attention to visual cues.",
