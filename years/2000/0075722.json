 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop algorithms and tools for interior point methods.  \r\nThe investigator will continue his ongoing research into interior point methods with \r\nthe aim of advancing several outstanding topics in semidefinite programming (SDP) and \r\nrelated problems.   A better understanding of neighborhoods and paths is needed in SDP, \r\nand in programming over a symmetric cone in general.  This is necessary in order to \r\ndevelop more efficient algorithms in terms of faster asymptotic convergence and numerical \r\nstability.  The investigator intends to develop effective mathematical tools to deal \r\nwith these issues.  Programming over homogeneous cones and hyperbolic cones are likely \r\nto become the next emerging fields in interior point methods, and there is a need to \r\ndevelop efficient, long-step interior algorithms for such problems.  Eventually, \r\ninterior point methods will need to deal with even more complicated industrial \r\napplications which must be solved efficiently.  The project will involve all of these \r\nareas of interior point methods; efficient algorithms will be devised in all cases, \r\nand the needed mathematical tools will be developed.  The project also has two other \r\ngoals. The first is an extension of duality theory beyond its traditional convexity, \r\nand the second one is the development of faster proximal point algorithms for convex \r\nprogramming.  \r\n \r\n\r\nInterior point methods have been successful in solving many large scale industrial problems \r\nin industry: in civil and electrical engineering, management, communication networks, \r\nfinance, and others.  Further applicability of these methods depends on a better \r\nunderstanding of their behavior and continuous development of appropriate software.  This \r\nproject aims to search for efficient algorithms and improved mathematical tools so that large \r\nscale optimization problems arising from diverse industrial disciplines can be efficiently \r\nsolved. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
