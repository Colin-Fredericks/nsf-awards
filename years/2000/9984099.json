 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric problems arise in numerous application areas such as computer\r\ngraphics, geographic information systems (GISs), spatial database systems,\r\ncomputer aided design, robotics, physics, and meteorology. The field of\r\ncomputational geometry is largely motivated by this fact. In the last\r\ntwenty years impressive progress has been made in the field. However, even\r\nthough computational geometry is now a rich and mature discipline, the\r\nalgorithms and techniques developed in the field have had too little\r\npractical impact in application areas. One reason for this disparity is\r\nthat the goal of traditional algorithms design has been to optimize\r\ninternal memory computation time (CPU efficiency). However, many geometric\r\napplications frequently involve massive amounts of data. Often the datasets\r\nare too large to fit in main memory and must reside on disk, and\r\ncommunication between internal and external memory, and not actual\r\ncomputation time, is the bottleneck in the computation.  This effect arises\r\nfrom the huge difference in access time of fast internal memory and slower\r\nexternal memory such as disks.\r\n\r\nThis project contains a challenging career development plan focusing on\r\nInput/Output-efficient (or I/O-efficient) computational geometry\r\nalgorithms. Key components of the plan are the rich and important\r\npossibilities for interplay between theory and practice in the area, as\r\nwell as the exciting possibilities the area gives for interdisciplinary\r\ncollaboration and for bringing research into the classroom. Theoretical\r\nwork will concentrate on developing I/O-efficient algorithms and data\r\nstructures for geometric problems. A main goal is to develop simple and\r\npractically efficient algorithms, and in order to do so, theoretically\r\ndeveloped algorithms will be implemented and tested using real-life\r\ndata. In this work, focus will be on problems with direct practical\r\napplications and on collaboration with researchers in other areas of\r\ncomputer science, as well as with researchers in application areas. A key\r\nobjective of the career plan is for the PI to obtain a certain level of\r\nexpertise in select application areas and to build up a ``track record'' in\r\nthese areas. Curriculum development is also an integrated part of the plan.\r\nWork will be done on incorporating I/O-efficiency into the curriculum of\r\nundergraduate and graduate algorithms classes, and new classes, as well as\r\neducational material, will be developed.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the outcome of the project will not only be theoretical\r\nadvances in I/O-efficient geometric algorithms, but also the development\r\nand implementation of practical efficient algorithms as well as curricular\r\ninnovations. At the same time the project will build a strong foundation\r\nfor the PIs continued work in research and education.",
