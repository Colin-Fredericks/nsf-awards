Salamo, a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student from the University of Arkansas and Mathieu Chauvet and his research group at the University of Franche-Comte.  The investigators propose to develop ultra-fast, Kerr soliton based, optical interconnect arrays in a semiconductor material that could be integrated into electronic packages.  An optical spatial soliton is a beam that maintains a constant profile during propagation.  Spatial solitons using the Kerr effect in an Aluminum-Gallium-Arsenic/Gallium-Arsenic semiconductor slab waveguide will be studied.  The U.S. team brings to this collaboration expertise in semiconductor materials growth and physics.  This is complemented by French strengths in the fabrication of complex practical devices.  They are expert in the use of Kerr modulation in device construction.  \r\n\r\nThis award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S. investigator, postdoctoral researcher and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance understanding of optical interconnect arrays and their potential applications in telecommunications.\r\n",
