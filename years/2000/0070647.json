 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal ties together several areas of mathematics: finite groups of Lie \r\ntype, integral lattices and linear codes, and finite permutation groups. The \r\nmain unifying ingredient is the representation theory. The PI continues his\r\ninvestigation on some problems on representation theory of finite groups of Lie \r\ntype; progress on these problem will lead to important applications in the \r\nintegral lattice theory and in the theory of finite primitive permutation\r\ngroups. The PI proposes to determine the complex representations of a finite\r\ngroup of Lie type, which are irreducible modulo the defining characteristic.\r\nHe also intends to classify cross-characteristic representations of finite\r\ngroups of Lie type of low dimension. The PI then applies the results on these\r\ntwo projects to achieve significant progress on a number of applications: the\r\nThompson-Gross problem on classifying globally irreducible lattices, the problem\r\nof finding the minimum of Euclidean integral lattices, the ``lifting'' problem,\r\nand the problem on maximality of certain quasi-simple subgroups of finite\r\nclassical groups.\r\n\r\nThe main area of research in this proposal is group theory and the\r\nrepresentation theory of groups of Lie type. Groups in mathematics grew out of\r\nthe notion of symmetry. The symmetries of an object in physics, chemistry, or\r\nmathematics, are encoded by a group, and this group carries a lot of\r\nimportant information about the structure of the object itself. The\r\nrepresentation theory allows one to study groups via their action on vector\r\nspaces. It has fascinated mathematicians for a century and had\r\nmany important applications in physics and chemistry. Thus, the representation\r\ntheory of Lie groups played a vital role in quantum mechanics and in the theory \r\nof elementary particles. The finite analogs of Lie groups - finite groups of Lie\r\ntype - and their representations have already proved valuable in coding theory\r\nand cryptography, and are expected to play an important role in the new era of\r\ncomputers and communications. The PI's research is and will be mostly focused \r\non the representation theory of this important class of groups and its \r\napplications.",
