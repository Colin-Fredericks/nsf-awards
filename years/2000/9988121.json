 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe Symposium on Inference for Stochastic Processes will be held at the University of Georgia from May 10-12, 2000. At the Symposium leading researchers in the field will give invited talks on their original research, and interact with young researchers and graduate students. Publication of selected (refereed) proceedings is planned. Particular efforts will be made to include African American, female participants and persons with disabilities. The Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) will co-sponsor the Symposium as an IMS Special Topics Conference. Moreover, the Symposium is recognized as a Satellite meeting of the Fifth World Congress of the Bernoulli Society, and an important component of the program will be devoted to Inference Problems in Stochastic Geometry. A unique feature of the Symposium will be the small size which has been designed for maximum interaction of participants on the very significant topic of Inference for Stochastic Processes.",
