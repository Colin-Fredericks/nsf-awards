 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the work of one of the distinguished practitioners of statistical mechanics.   During the last two decades, starting with work in two dimensions with applications to surface properties, this PI's work has evolved towards a variety of topics, which are centered on a study of defects such as domain walls.  This grant supports work in four projects consisting of: (1) Novel anisotropic scaling phase boundaries in equilibrium crystal shapes, (2) Long range reconstruction order in growing crystal surfaces, (3) Applications of dynamic absorbing state phase transitions in crystal surfaces and granular materials and (4) Scaling functions for one dimensional stochastic processes.\r\n%%%\r\nSteps at growing crystal surfaces are characteristic defects.  This grant supports research on a study of steps and other defects at surfaces.  It continues the highly innovative and insightful research of this group on properties of growing crystal surfaces and related equilibrium phase transitions.  Specific questions which are addressed here are: the effects of anisotropies, possibility of surface reconstruction during growth, problems in crystal surface growth which are also shared with the subject of granular materials and a search for exact solutions for one dimensional problems.\r\n***\r\n",
