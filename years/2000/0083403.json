Willows\r\nFSML Housing for Visiting Researchers and Students at Friday Harbor Laboratories\r\n\r\nThe Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL) of the University of Washington has initiated a program to invite up to 8 research groups/year, each group made up of an independent researcher plus her/his graduate and post-doctoral colleagues and 5-8 undergraduate apprentices, to conduct research at FHL for a 3-month period. Four such groups were selected and invited to FHL in 1999, and 6 in 2000, with FHL providing laboratory and field facilities plus full salary to the faculty, graduate research assistants, and support personnel (computer staff, marine and instrumentation technologists, administrative staff), and stipends to the student participants. FHL will expand this program to incorporate groups from around the US and abroad.  FHL plans to provide an increased, intense, academic year opportunity for research people and undergraduate apprentices to take advantage of FHL field, laboratory and housing facilities, and to focus upon current, important research opportunities in marine sciences.  In order for the station to be able to accommodate more national/international participants, FHL will build two new duplex housing units with financial support provided by this award and the University of Washington.\r\n\r\nFHL is located at the junction of Juan de Fuca and Georgia Straits, at a site of unusual biological diversity. FHL supports research from molecular and cell biology along a scale of increasing spatial dimensions to animal behavior and community ecology and has traditionally encouraged innovative and cross-cutting original research by eminent scholars, researchers, and students in wide ranging fields, including zoology, oceanography, botany, and basic biomedical sciences.\r\n",
