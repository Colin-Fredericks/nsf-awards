 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator's main theme is to explore the representation theory\r\nof wild finite dimensional algebras by analyzing specific classes of\r\nrepresentations and the homomorphisms among them with an array of\r\nmethods, ranging from geometric through combinatorial to\r\nhomological.  Roughly, these classes can be grouped under the\r\nfollowing headings: (1) Classes of modules having fixed sequence of\r\nradical layers and, more generally, classes of modules with fixed top\r\nand fixed vector space dimension. (2) Classes of modules forming\r\ncontravariantly finite or covariantly finite subcategories within the\r\nfull category of finitely generated modules. (3) Classes of infinite\r\ndirect sums (mainly of generic and finitely generated modules)\r\nenjoying finiteness conditions over their endomorphism rings.  A\r\nrelated investigation aims at the geometry of finite complexes of\r\nmodules and derived categories as an alternate setting for the study\r\nof maps among representations. There are methodological\r\ninterconnections among these lines, as well as strong links in terms\r\nof the overall strategy of gaining a better understanding of algebras\r\nthat have wild representation type. \r\n\r\nUnder a wider angle, the project should be seen in the following\r\nframework: The majority of our physical models for the universe are\r\nplaced within finite dimensional vector spaces. Frequently, such\r\nspaces carry additional structure, such as a Lie or associative\r\nalgebra structure, for example. Associative finite dimensional\r\nalgebras are the objects of the investigator's research. One approach\r\ntowards understanding them is to explore their representations, which\r\ncan be thought of as 'linearized photographs' within sets of square\r\nmatrices, both coarse-grained and fine-grained pictures containing\r\nvaluable information. The representation type of the considered\r\nalgebra is called 'tame' if the representations of any fixed matrix\r\nsize can be subdivided into finitely many 'manageable' series (these\r\nseries themselves may be infinite), otherwise it is called 'wild'.\r\nThe wild case being the one predominantly encountered in mathematical\r\nnature, this is the case which the investigator is presently\r\ntackling. Her idea is to thoroughly understand important subclasses\r\nof the full class of representations of algebras of wild type, and to\r\nthus establish an interlinked mosaic of analyzed territory. Attention\r\nis being paid to choosing lines that optimally connect with the needs\r\nof adjacent fields (such as the theory of algebraic or quantum groups)\r\nand with the body of insights already established.",
