 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of alkenyl(aryl)iodanes as synthetic reagents.  The generation of high-energy primary vinyl cations and the use of alkenyl(aryl)iodonium and alkynyl(aryl)iodonium salts in nucleophilic substitution reactions will be explored.  New cyclic (benziodoxole or benziodoxolone) alkenyliodanes will also be prepared and the scope of utility for the reagents will be examined.  Revamping of the undergraduate laboratories and introduction of computer-based molecular modeling are two areas that will be enhanced by the award.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award,the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Robert J. Hinkle of the Department of Chemistry at the College of William & Mary.   Professor Hinkle will focus his research on various aspects of hypervalent iodine chemistry with the goal of developing new synthetic reagents.  The educational foci of the project involve course development and undergraduate research.",
