 "awd_abstract_narration": "The key objective of the proposed research is to understand the basic mechanisms of the oxidative enzymatic polymerization of electroactive polymers using multi-nuclei solution and solid state NMR spectroscopy.  This approach involves a simple, one-pot, environmentally compatible reaction that leads to the synthesis of a new class of water soluble, electrically and photonically active polymers.  This nobel biocatalytic approach provides, obviates the experimental difficulties previously encountered with traditional chemical reactions and now affords exciting new opportunities to understand these fundamental oxidative mechanisms.  NMR spectroscopy will be used extensively in this program both as a probe to understand these oxidative coupling mechanisms and as a tool to optimize the reactions such that the electrical and optical properties of the resulting polymers may be enhanced.  The main focus of this effort will involve two sub areas of investigation using both multi-nuclei solution and solid-state NMR techniques:  (a) Oxidative coupling mechanisms for phenols and substituted phenols, and (b)  Reaction mechanisms of enzymatic polymerization for polyaniline and the role of polyanionic or polycationic templates on enzymatic polymerization.  This study will significantly advance the basic understanding of the mechanisms and nature of enzymatic oxidative coupling and as a result allow for the controlled optimization of the reactions.  It is expected that this new insight will led to the ability to molecularly engineer a wide variety of novel electroactive polymers that should find wide commercial application.\r\n\r\nThis biocatalytic approach to polymer synthesis is environmentally friendly and offers an effective alternative approach to the synthesis of electroactive polymers.  The processing of these enzymatically-synthesized polymers can also be carried out in an environmentally benign manner given their water solubility.  Advancement of research in this area thus will help to reduce the use of hazardous chemicals both during the synthetic steps and processing.  A deeper understanding of the molecular basis of the enzymatic synthesis may lead to potential technological innovations beneficial to the society.\r\n",
