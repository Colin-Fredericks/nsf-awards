 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Wisconsin supports an interdisciplinary research program on nanostructured materials and interfaces.  The research is carried out in three interdisciplinary research groups, with appropriate seed projects.  Within IRG 1 the Center focuses on the mechanisms  associated with materials integration onto silicon.  The ultimate aim is to create \"smart\" systems based on Si technology for electronic and optical applications.  The Center's activities are aimed at understanding and managing heterointerfaces, understanding bonding between dissimilar materials, understanding the role of strain, and effectively utilizing self-organization growth techniques.  All of the above are focused on the nanometer scale.  Within IRG 2 the goal is to understand actual grain boundaries in high temperature superconductors, which requires an interdisciplinary approach to film growth, materials characterization and modeling.  The potential impact is the increase of  the maximum current densities that can be carried in such materials for advanced superconducting devices.  The activities in IRG 3 are centered on understanding  the role of nanostructured textured surfaces on the growth and behavior of biological systems (proteins, viruses, and cells) which have been deposited onto these substrates.  A strong feature of the Center's strong educational outreach is the development, testing, and dissemination of instructional materials which can be integrated into high school or college science courses.  Of particular interest is the Development of Instructional Materials Program (DIMP) that enables MRSEC graduate students to develop new instructional materials based on their research.  The Center carries out an aggressive program to increase the participation of underrepresented groups through enhanced contacts with minority serving institutions.  The Center supports well maintained shared experimental facilities, which are accessible to outside users and has a very extensive program of collaborations with industry.\r\n\r\nParticipants in the Center include 29 senior investigators, 9 postdoctoral associates, 20 graduate students, 15 undergraduates, and 4 technicians and other support personnel.  Professor Thomas F. Kuech directs the MRSEC.       \r\n",
