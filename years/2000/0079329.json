 "awd_abstract_narration": "A confocal laser scanning microscope will support research projects at Oklahoma State University (OSU).  This instrument will be housed in the University's central Microscopy Laboratory and used in the research of three major projects as well as numerous smaller projects by OSU faculty, students and staff.   In addition, graduate students will be trained in the use of the new microscope to broaden and enhance their research training.\r\n\r\nAccess to a confocal microscope will allow OSU investigators to enhance their research capability in the biological sciences as well as the materials sciences.  In biology, they will obtain real time images of dynamic processes occurring in plant and animal cells.  Specific projects in which the confocal microscope will be used include the study of interactions between plants and microbial organisms, the movement of large molecules between cells in plants, the movement of small molecules inside of plant and animal cells, and research in synthetic materials designed to create new forms of matter which can be used as catalysts or as optical materials. \r\n\r\nRecently there have been major breakthroughs in several areas of research at Oklahoma State University and these advances have relied on many advanced techniques including molecular biology and electron microscopy.  To continue to play a leading role in these fields, a confocal laser scanning microscope is needed. Current trends in science in academia as well as industry in the United States have placed an emphasis on advanced methods including microscopy to analyze genes and their products in living cells. Confocal microscopy is one of the latest advances in cell biology, and its addition to existing equipment will allow OSU faculty and students to remain competitive in the national and international \r\n",
