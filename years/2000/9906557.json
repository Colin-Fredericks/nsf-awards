 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT Crawford - AST 99-06557\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks a one-time organizational development grant which will allow the International Dark Sky Association (IDA) to expand its membership base with a targeted strategy that is expected to lead to a firm financial basis, ensuring the vitality of the organization as it pursues it's goal of fighting light pollution.  IDA seeks to preserve dark skies for the benefit of astronomy and society in general, through promotion of good outdoor lighting practices.  IDA has been effective in over the past decade in developing awareness of the light pollution issue, and in devising effective solutions.  IDA now must expand to meet its significantly increasing workload, and must create an organizational structure to eliminate dependence on volunteers, who carried the work of the organization until now.  IDA intends to significantly expand its membership base, to support its budget from membership contributions.\r\n\r\nThe strategy IDA intends to follow to achieve its membership goal is to do large mailings to selected groups with an interest in astronomy. With the funding sought, IDA will be able to greatly expand its outreach efforts and expects to achieve its goals.  IDA has been a major factor in protecting U.S. investment in astronomical facilities (optical telescopes) and developed an effective working relationship with the business and professional lighting communities, by adopting a cooperative win-win strategy for ameliorating light pollution, that at the same time results in large savings through energy conservation.  The organization expects to be strengthened, to continue its battle against light pollution, and in defense of U.S. and worldwide optical astronomy facilities. \r\n\r\n",
