 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54)\r\nIt is widely agreed that success as an engineer requires sound technical knowledge. However, employers are increasingly emphasizing the importance of non-technical skills to include effective communications, team leadership, a dedication to lifelong learning, and a commitment to the sharing of this knowledge through mentoring. If these skills are to be cultivated in future engineers, they must first be instilled in their instructors, who themselves must be able to serve as role models. Engineering faculty must therefore have a specific and distinct non-technical skill set. Ironically, unlike K-12 teachers, critical education skills are not taught to most college faculty. This void is the motivation for the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) continued commitment to the Excellence in Civil Engineering Education (ExCEEd) Teaching Workshop (ETW). This project improves upon the Teaching Teachers to Teach Engineering (T4E) workshop previously conducted at the US Military Academy, West Point and supported by NSF. ETW is an evolution of T4E designed to benefit a larger population of faculty. It is an intensive, one-week workshop for civil engineering and civil engineering technology faculty with less than five years of teaching experience. An important component is the inclusion of observers/assessors from other engineering professional societies, which ensures the quality improvement of each future workshop and which holds the potential to disseminate this activity to other engineering organizations interested in offering faculty development opportunities to their membership.",
