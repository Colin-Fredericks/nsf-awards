 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Balachandar - 9910543\r\n\r\nThis project is to develop a new generation of predictive methodology for complex and turbulent multiple-scale flow problems.  The PIs are looking for natural separation of the entire flow domain into multiple zones, each characterized by their own range of length and time scales.  Different techniques, both experimental and computational, will be employed over the different domains, as appropriate.  The goal is the development of generalized data-facing that will permit seamless interfaces between the different techniques across different zones.  Data-facing involves matching of flow physics across interfaces between different zones, as well as consistent transfer of numerical data.  The methodology to be used involves two techniques: large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flow and multi-dimensional velocimetry experiments, in particular, particle image velocimetry (PIV).  The approach to dynamic data-facing between parallel PIV experiments and LES computations is the use of conditional statistics, approximated by the stochastic estimation procedure.\r\n\r\nThe above concept of dynamic data-facing between integrated experiments and computations will be applied to the problem of flow in a stirred tank.  The mixing of two or more fluids is a complex physical process that is fundamental to a wide range of engineering applications.  In many chemical industrial processing units the rate at which mixing can be achieved determines the overall throughput and profitability of the plant.  In other devices, such as turbines that rely on the combination of fluid mixtures, the thermal efficiency depends on the quality and speed of mixing in a sensitive way.  Scale-up is critical to good plant design.  Through integrated PIV and PLIF experiments and large eddy simulations, accurate prediction of macro-scale mixing and the problem of reliable scale-up will be addressed using a range of laboratory to pilot plant scale stirred tank geometries.\r\n",
