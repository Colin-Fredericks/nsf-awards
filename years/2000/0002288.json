 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tSince passage of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in the United States, many other countries have implemented similar laws.  Administrative procedural openness is important for democratic consolidation because its reduces arbitrariness and increases predictability in government, increases bureaucratic accountability, and allows active citizen participation in agency decision making.  The recent passage of APAs in two new democracies, Korea and Taiwan, highlights an apparent paradox that is embedded in the passage of all APAs.  APAs limit the power of the executive.  So, why would presidents sign APAs that are designed to restrict their powers.  In this project, it is argued that a president supports an APA when:  (1) her support coalition (either a multi-party coalition or a factionalized ruling party) has heterogeneous preferences; (2) her ability to appoint cabinet ministers is constrained by a constitutional requirement for legislative approval and the legislature does not share her preferences; or (3) she is confronted by bureaucrats with different preferences and she cannot replace them.  To test these hypotheses, statistical and case study analyses of countries with APAs (Korea, Taiwan, the United States) and without them (the Philippines) are conducted.  Some of the necessary data that support the hypotheses currently exist.  The remaining data would be gathered with NSF support.",
