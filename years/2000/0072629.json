Specifically, the outcome of \r\nthis project is to provide a methodology to optimally place sensors and \r\nactuators and to construct practical reduced order controllers.  The \r\napproach is based on a unique combination of computational mathematics \r\nand distributed parameter control theory. The framework is based on an \r\nintegral representation of the optimal feedback control that arises from the \r\nsolution of the infinite dimensional control problem. Computation of the \r\nkernel of the integral (feedback functional gain) may be accomplished by \r\nsolving a numerical approximation of the infinite dimensional algebraic \r\nRiccati equation. However, this approach is intractable for even the two \r\ndimensional heat equation on a fairly coarse grid. The approach proposed \r\nherein is based on the use of computational methods to directly solve \r\nChandrasekhar partial integro-differential equations for functional gains.  \r\nRecent results on the smoothness and support of these functional gains can \r\nthen be exploited to optimally place sensors and actuators.  Moreover, \r\ninitial studies show how the gains can also be used to design robust low-\r\norder compensators.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this work comes from the need to have efficient, \r\npractical controllers for complicated physical systems. The focus of the \r\nproposal is the development of an approach that is applicable to a wide \r\nvariety of areas ranging from materials processing to flow control.  In \r\napplications from such areas, there are several issues of primary \r\nimportance that must be addressed. Among these are where to place \r\nsensors to obtain accurate measurements to be used by the controller, what \r\nto measure, where to place actuators (which implement the control), and \r\nhow to design the controller so that the system is controller in real-time. \r\nTypically, the issues with respect to sensors and actuators are solved \r\nthrough engineering intuition. However, the mathematical framework that \r\nwe propose gives specific answers to these questions. Moreover, it \r\nprovides motivation for real-time control which is nearly optimal (in the \r\nsense that the design comes from the solution to a mathematical \r\noptimization problem) and is robust, which means that it is effective in the \r\npresence of disturbances, or dynamics which may have been neglected in \r\ndesigning the controller.  The potential benefits of this work are enormous. \r\nIt would be applicable to complicated (and varied) problems such as \r\nstabilizing vibrations arising from shuttle docking at the space station, \r\nreduction of drag in aerospace vehicles, and optimal control of \r\nsemiconductor manufacturing. It would provide a systematic approach to \r\nreduced order controller design, eliminating much of the guesswork that \r\ncurrently takes place.\r\n",
