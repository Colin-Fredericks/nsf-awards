 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nKaminker\r\n\r\nThe researcher will work on three projects.  Investigation will be\r\ncontinued on the connection between hyperbolic dynamical systems and\r\nK-theory of C*-algebras. In particular, the zeta function of a Smale\r\nspace will be expressed in terms of the K-theory of the stable algebra\r\nand the induced homomorphisms.  This leads to a general program to use\r\nthe K-theory of these C*-algebras as a replacement for ordinary\r\nhomology groups which were used in the past to study hyperbolic\r\nsystems. The second direction involves the study of the relation between the\r\nExactness conjecture and the Novikov conjecture for finitely presented\r\ngroups.  If a group acts amenably on a compact space then both of\r\nthese conjectures hold.    The relation between the existence of such\r\nan action and approximation properties for the reduced C*-algebra will be\r\nstudied and precise relations between the two conjectures will be established.\r\nIn a third direction, work will be done on obtaining a higher index\r\nformula for regular Lie groupoids.  This will provide a formula for\r\nthe pairing of certain cyclic cocycle on the smooth convolution algebra of\r\nthe groupoid with the class in K-theory representing the analytic\r\nindex of an elliptic operator.\r\n\r\nThese projects are part of a general program to see how symmetry, in\r\nits various forms, effects different parts of mathematics.  It is\r\noften the case that unexpected symmetry has important implications.\r\nSolutions to important equations in physics and engineering have\r\nbeen discovered and studied by using the fact that their form must\r\nbe unchanged under certain transformations.  It is hoped that the\r\nresults of the present project will have similar applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
