While much work has been done in in vitro cell culture  studies to document  biological effects of small lipids, it is only with the recent cloning of receptor families for small lipids that it has become  to systematically study potential sites and mechanisms of action in vivo.  In particular, while these lipids promote the survival of immature non-neuronal supporting cells in vitro, it would be of use to know if there are similar effects in the adult organism. The studies impossible this POWRE  Proposal will determine which non-neuronal cell types possess receptors for bioactive lipids and also test whether differences in receptor levels influence the survival of these cells in vivo.\r\nThis POWRE proposal will allow the investigator, after a career interruption for family responsibilities, an unprecedented opportunity to acquire new skills in the use of molecular biological techniques.  It is anticipated that this funding will provide support for the generation of pilot data that is necessary to compete for grants by standard mechanisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
