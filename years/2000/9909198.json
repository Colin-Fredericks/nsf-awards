 "awd_abstract_narration": "9909198\r\nHougen\r\n\r\nThis award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Dr. Jon Hougen of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and Professor Nobukimi Ohashi of the Kanazawa University in Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking a spectroscopic study of inter-and intra-molecular interactions related to information transmission and peptide-chain folding.  The information transmission part of the project will investigate, using primarily the techniques of jet-cooled molecular-beam microwave spectroscopy and group-theoretically derived effective tunneling Hamiltonians, how information is transmitted between functional groups capable of large-amplitude vibrational motion, over distances too large for direct steric interactions to be important.  In particular, how does one functional group sense changes in conformation or degree of complexation of another functional group.  While the study will be limited to rather small molecules in the gas phase by their desire to record rotationally resolved spectra, the high precision and high certainty of results obtainable from high-resolution spectroscopic techniques should partially offset the disadvantage of not studying directly the more important related question of conformational changes stimulated by docking phenomena in large biological molecules.  The protein chain folding part of the project will use jet-cooled molecular-beam terahertz spectroscopy to determine vibrational frequencies and potential functions for torsional motions around the peptide linkage in small (i.e. vaporizable) protein mimetics, coupled with similar microwave studies to determine precise folding structures for a number of low-energy conformations.  The structural determinations will also be extended to unbranched alkenes or alkanes, which represent the simplest straight-chain carbon backbone skeletons.    \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. Results of the research will provide important, qualitatively new information.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of a postdoc.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific meetings. \r\n",
