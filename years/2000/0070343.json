 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be done to establish the phenomenon of localization\r\nfor physically relevant models of disordered media where existing\r\nmethods have widely failed in the most relevant case of dimension\r\nthree. Particular models to be investigated are the\r\nBernoulli-Anderson model, the Poisson model, and the Random\r\nDisplacement model. The main obstacle to overcome is the lack of\r\nmonotonicity properties for these models, which causes significant\r\ndifferences to the more successfully studied Anderson model. In\r\nprevious work, the PI and his collaborators have shown that\r\nmethods from scattering theory can be used to establish\r\nlocalization for one-dimensional non-monotonic models. These\r\nmethods will lead to further results in one dimension and provide\r\nnew tools in higher dimension such as using the total scattering\r\ncross section of single sites to identify energies where extended\r\nstates exist. Some related goals are to establish Wegner estimates\r\nfor the eigenvalues of finite box hamiltonians and Lifshitz tail\r\nasymptotics for the integrated density of states in the above\r\nmodels, as well as to understand the effects of correlations\r\narising from long range single site scatterers.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical theory of disordered media aims at understanding\r\nthe spectral and scattering theoretic properties of irregular\r\nsolids such as, for example, crystals with impurities, alloys,\r\nmaterials with lattice deviations and amorphous media. Different\r\nmodels of random operators are used to describe the various types\r\nof disorder. This provides a mathematical framework to decide on\r\nconductivity properties: If localization of states can be\r\nshown, then the solid is electrically insulating, while the\r\nexistence of extended states characterizes a conducting material.\r\nThe PI's research aims at establishing these properties for models\r\nof high physical relevance, which have so far resisted a rigorous\r\nmathematical treatment. For example, localization properties are\r\nnot yet understood for realistic models of alloys. Ideas from\r\nstatistical physics and solid state physics will be combined with\r\nmethods from scattering theory, spectral theory and harmonic\r\nanalysis to make progress.\r\n",
