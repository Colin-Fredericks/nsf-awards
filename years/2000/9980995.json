The LaCEPT model is based on a philosophy of 'reform form the bottom up, lateral assistance and support from the top down.' It drives reform by providing instructors with information, supporting individual creativity, promoting collaboration, creating buy in, and drawing on the knowledge distributed throughout the organization. The course M 1100 is a required part of the K-8 teacher education program and is taken by about 200 future teachers every year, together with an additional 400 to 500 students fulfilling quantitative literacy requirements. It is presently the only mathematics course where future K-8 teachers at LSU encounter probability and statistics.  The content areas for the course include the language of mathematics, probability, statistics, and financial mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
