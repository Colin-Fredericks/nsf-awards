 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to study the underrepresentation of females and minorities in IT careers.  The study will use a theoretical framework based on expectancies, values, and achievement behaviors.  It was developed to study why females are underrepresented in mathematics, physics, and engineering.  For the past 17 years, this framework has been used to study educational and occupational choices among children, adolescents, and young adults, using longitudinal survey designs that include multiple indicators from children, their parents, teachers, and school records.  As a result, there are three longitudinal data sets that will be used in the study.  In addition, the necessary supplementary IT-related data will be collected and added to the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions (MSALT) data set.  Part of this data will be collected via surveys and the rest via interviews.  This project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the underrepresentation of women and minorities IT careers.",
