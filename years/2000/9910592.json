 "awd_abstract_narration": "The power of opinions to inspire individual and collective action is well-documented. Just as dramatic is the speed with which opinions can change. These properties of opinions can be attributed to the fact that opinions are formed partly as a function of the social context, particularly by comparisons with other people or groups. The social psychological processes that underlie opinion formation and change, however, are still not well-understood. This project includes seven experiments to test a new approach for understanding how comparisons with other people contribute to the formation of opinions. The new theory proposes that there are three main types of opinion comparison. One type concerns how people validate their personal preferences. Other persons who are similar in general background seem to furnish the most relevant information in these cases. A second type concerns the evaluation of beliefs which is best addressed through comparison of opinions with persons who have more expertise. However, expertise is not sufficient -- these \"experts\" also need to be perceived to share certain underlying values connected to the belief topic. This aspect of the theory has the potential to elucidate our knowledge about our interactions with outgroups. The opinions of expert outgroup members (e.g., someone from a different ethnic or socioeconomic group) might be rejected despite their greater knowledge. The third major type of opinion comparison involves prediction about future situations or choices. In this type, comparisons with other people who have already experienced the situation provide the most useful information, but only if they also have a similar background or expressed consistent reactions in past circumstances. The seven laboratory experiments will test the three-process theory predictions concerning selection and impact of comparison using a variety of opinion issues. Because opinion comparison plays a substantial role in decision-making, group behavior, and persuasion, the proposed theory and research should advance basic knowledge about social problems where these processes are involved.\r\n\r\n",
