 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop a sustainable and replicable industry-academia partnership model for helping talented but financially disadvantaged students complete their baccalaureate degrees in timely fashion and move successfully into the workforce. The intent is to demonstrate that significant improvement in retention, placement, and workforce throughput can be achieved for all students - including women, minorities, and persons with disabilities - through a unique combination of scholarships, professional development activities, intervention, and academic support.\r\n\r\nThirty qualified motivated junior-level students in engineering and computer science are participating in the two-year program as a cohort group. Program highlights include a summer industry or research internship between the junior and senior years of study. Other professional development activities designed to enhance student workforce \"readiness\" include industry mentors, shadowing programs, involvement in professional societies, and a one credit-hour Professional Development Workshop each semester created especially for this project. A Project Advisory Committee, with members from industry, is guiding development and execution of the project. One of their tasks is to assure that industry involvement provides real intellectual engagement with students. \r\n\r\nAcademic support activities center on creation of a learning environment in which students feel empowered to take responsibility for their own success. Special orientation sessions held at the beginning of each project year, cooperative learning activities in the Professional Development Workshops, interactions with peer mentors, personal counseling and advising, inter- and intra - group communication, and tutoring are among the activities. Networking, mentoring, and social interactions are featured. Scholarships of $2,500 per year are enabling students to concentrate upon their studies and development activities. \r\n\r\nResearch objectives for the project focus upon five issues of national interest and importance, all associated with human resource development:\r\n* The future engineering and computer science workforce. \r\n*Under-representation of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in this workforce. \r\n*Preparation of students for productive contributions upon entry into this workforce. \r\n*The increasing length of time required for students to earn degrees. \r\n*Increasing numbers of transfer students in engineering and computer science baccalaureate programs. \r\n\r\nSuccess of the project in addressing these issues is being systematically evaluated and reported. Of special significance to engineering education are the data that is being obtained on performance of upper division and community college transfer students, groups largely overlooked in previous studies of retention and academic performance. \r\n",
