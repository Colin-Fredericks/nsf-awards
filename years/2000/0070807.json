Hodge theory of\r\ndifferential forms has come to play a central role in this rather modern\r\napproach. The Jacobian determinants and the wedge products of the exact\r\ndifferential forms are subjected to a great deal of investigation, as they\r\nprovide the means of achieving continuity, compactness, or normal family\r\ntype results. It is important to realize that the higher integrability\r\nproperties of the Jacobians can only be observed for mapping in the\r\nOrlicz-Sobolev classes. More recent developments have emphasized the\r\nconnection between quasiconformal mappings and the theory of nonlinear\r\nelasticity already formulated by S.S. Antman and J. Ball in 1976-77. This\r\nconnection is an important aspect of the proposal. And that is why we\r\ndepart from the usual quasiconformal theory quite far towards mappings\r\n(deformations of elastic bodies) with unbounded distortion. However, some\r\ncontrol, such as BMO-bounds, of the distortion tensor will be necessary to\r\nachieve concreate results. The governing equations for mappings of finite\r\ndistortion are non-linear first order systems of PDEs. There are also\r\nrelated second order systems which arrise naturally as the Euler- Lagrange\r\nequations of the associated variational integrals (stored energy of the\r\ndeformation). An analogy between the analytic aspects of the holomorphic\r\nfunctions and mappings of finite distortion is particularly pronounced in\r\neven dimensions. A fruitful idea when studying these mappings is to view\r\nthem as conformal with respect to certain measurable metric or conformal\r\nstructures. Many of these notions extend to Riemannian manifolds, and\r\naccordingly, while we do not develop this aspect in full all the machinery\r\nwe set up is ready and willing for these generalizations.\r\n            The reader interested in developments along these lines and a\r\ncomprehensive account of the geometric function theory is warmly referred\r\nto the forthcoming monograph of G. Martin and PI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
