 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this grant Prof. Charles Misner of the University of Maryland with the assistance of graduate students will develop simplified computer models of idealized systems of binary neutron stars emitting gravitational waves.  These models should allow the testing of novel methods for simplifying the computation of the gravitational wave signals from such exotic systems.  After development and testing using a simplified gravitational theory, these methods are intended to be introduced into large multi-institutional computational \r\nefforts where the full Einstein gravitational theory is being modelled numerically.  \r\n\r\nThis theoretical and computational effort is being done in support of the NSF's gravitational wave observatory LIGO whose shakedown is expected to end, and science runs to begin, in 2002.  Improvements in the accuracy of the computational models of expected sources of gravitational radiation will result in improved sensitivity for the LIGO facility in observing the corresponding gravitational waves.  There is hope that this new (gravitational) eye on the cosmos will produce results as exciting as those given in the past by radio astronomy, X-ray astronomy, and gamma ray astronomy.\r\n",
