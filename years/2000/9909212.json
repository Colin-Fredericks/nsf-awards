 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to measure fluctuation in the Earth's magnetic field on time scales between 0.1 s and 1000 s.  These \"micropulsations\" are the result of the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere.  By studying these variations over periods of time comparable to a complete solar cycle and at a variety of locations, it is possible to learn more about how variations in the solar wind effect the Earth and man made systems.  Magnetic variations have important effects on such systems as power grids and pipelines, and it may be important to predict such disruptions.  This is now becoming possible, since satellite systems are in place to monitor the solar wind as well as to view solar activity.  The main reason to do work of this nature is to obtain a better understanding of the world, but the prediction of space weather is also an important aspect.\r\nThis project uses magnetometers that are distributed at high latitude in both the Antarctic and Arctic so, for that reason, the work is supported by both the Arctic and Antarctic programs of the Office of Polar Programs.  The principal investigator is a professor at an undergraduate institution.\r\n",
