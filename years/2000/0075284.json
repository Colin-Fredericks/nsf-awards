SU\r\nUniversity of Florida\r\n\r\nCISE Next Generation Software: Research on Advanced Technologies to Support Internet-based Scalable E-business Enterprise (ISEE)\r\n\r\nThe Internet and Web technologies have brought about rapid and significant changes in the way business enterprises operate and have altered the nature of business competition.  To remain competitive in the Internet -connected world a business enterprise needs to adopt these and other available information technologies (IT), including the distributed object technology exemplified by CORBA, JAVA RMI, DCOM, and Enterprise Java Beans.   The integration of Internet, Web and distributed object technologies provides the basic information infrastructure, which allows distributed, heterogeneous application systems to be interconnected and to share all sorts of resources in a structured manner in the form of communicating distributed objects.  This basic infrastructure is not sufficient to support scalable enterprises because e-business requires not just accessing data and application systems over Internet but also the management of business events, constraints, rules and process/workflows.  \r\nA more powerful integrated information infrastructure is needed for Internet-based scalable e-business enterprises (ISEEs).\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this one-year project are:\r\n\r\n1) Investigate the architectures, processing techniques and algorithms associated with the proposed technologies and use the industrial endorsers to evaluate the practicality of the results.  The development code will be made available to all through the Internet.\r\n\r\n2) Train students who will participate in this project and incorporate the concepts and results in relevant graduate courses in three different home departments of PIs and CO-PIs.\r\n\r\nIdentify additional research tasks and form a team of academic researchers and industrial participants who are qualified to tackle these tasks, and develop a joint proposal for submission to NSF for the follow-up work.\r\n",
