A successful outcome would be approximation algorithms that are widely-accessible and effective in the control of complex systems.\r\n\r\nProposed approximation methods build on work in the area of neuro-dynamic programming which is sometimes called \"Approximate Dynamic Programming\" or \"Reinforcement Learning.\"  Algorithms that will be developed are based on approximate value iteration, temporal-difference, learning, and linear programming.  A method for \"feature selection\" involving the use of value functions associated with simplified problems will also be explored.\r\n\r\nTo promote a pragmatic view of methods under development, and to provide a testbed for evaluation of ideas, two applications have been chosen to play integral roles in the project: dynamic risk management and the control of multiclass queuing networks.\r\n\r\nThe educational component of this project includes a new graduate level course on neurodynamic programming together with a realignment of current courses to incorporate a greater emphasis on computation, to foster an appreciation for the use of approximations when system become more complex, and to promote a unified view of stochastic control problems across many disciplines.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
