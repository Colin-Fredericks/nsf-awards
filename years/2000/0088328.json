 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The Physics Department is restructuring its introductory physics classes. This Interactive Physics Classroom Project promotes conceptual understanding through enhanced student interaction within the traditional laboratory and lecture structure by adapting and implementing three nationally-recognized educational practices that have been demonstrated to be more effective than traditional instructional strategies. (1) The project is integrating Sokoloff, Laws, and Thornton's RealTime Physics into the introductory algebra- and calculus-based laboratories to create inquiry-based Microcomputer-Based Laboratories (MBL)s. (2) MBLs are also being integrated into the lectures, adapting Thornton and Sokolov's Interactive Lecture Demonstrations to provide a bridge to the laboratory work. (3) Our current implementation of Mazur's Peer Instruction is being expanded to additional class sections and enhanced with a ClassTalk-style response system. These improvements provide a broad range of science students (approximately 1,800 per year) with a rich learning environment based on active peer-based engagement. These advances are extremely well suited for helping students to adapt to the increasingly technology- oriented world. \r\n\r\n Evaluation of the program is being done throughout the project period using standard testing instruments, surveys, and interviews. Results are providing on-going feedback for the program participants and are also being disseminated to the general physics and education communities through publications, conferences, and the web. Additionally, to have the broadest impact on the diverse South Florida community, several workshops per year are being held to describe the techniques. Participants are from the local university and community college faculty, as well as high school physics teachers who are in the position to influence potential college students. \r\n",
