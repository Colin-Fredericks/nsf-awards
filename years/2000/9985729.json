 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support of a Gordon Research Conference on photosensory receptors and signal transduction.  This is the first comprehensive conference organized around this theme in recent years and the first on this subject to be sponsored by the Gordon Research Conferences.  The conference has been organized in view of the recent breakthrough discoveries of new photosensory receptors and rapid progress on their activation and signaling mechanisms over approximately the past five years. The focus is on molecular mechanisms of receptor phototransduction and brings together investigators who study microbial, plant, and animal photoreceptors.  The meeting will provide a very much-needed opportunity to exchange information and ideas and for investigators to become aware of the diverse and incisive molecular tools available. It is expected that the conference will stimulate exciting discussion of emerging insights, general principles, and the most engaging mysteries on the cutting edge of photosensory signal transduction.  The meeting is to be held April 30-May 5 at the Gordon Research Conference site in Barga, Italy.   Nine sessions will address the following areas:\r\n\r\nPhototransduction: insights from atomic structure and dynamics\r\nArchaeal sensory rhodopsins\r\nMammalian visual pigments\r\nNew photosensory receptors in eukaryotic microbes\r\nCryptochromes\r\nPhototropin\r\nPhytochromes in lower plants & cyanobacteria\r\nPhytochromes in higher plants\r\nPhotoactive yellow protein\r\n\r\nThe invited special evening lecturer will be H. Gobind Khorana, Nobel laureate, who will speak on rhodopsin structure and function.  Speakers have been chosen to represent the field as broadly as possible, and the meeting is designed so that wherever possible, young investigators will have an opportunity to present their work and ideas.\r\n\r\n",
