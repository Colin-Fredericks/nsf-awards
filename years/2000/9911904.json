The University of Nevada at Las Vegas and the greater Nevada University System will cooperate with the District by providing professional development and content expertise.  The 1,033 elementary teachers in 18 schools in the project will take part in the 130 hours of professional development during the life of the project.\r\n\r\nThe MASE K-5 project builds on prior LSC projects in several ways.  Six of the strongest MASE schools will now be utilized as leadership sites by becoming Collaborative Learning Center Schools (CLCS) in each geographic area of the District.  These CLCS will be models of best practice that will guide the implementation of innovative, reform-based curricula and pedagogy.  CLCS will pair with new project schools, thus mentoring and assisting new schools while advancing their own practice.  Teachers from new project schools will take part in demonstration/laboratory lessons and other professional development opportunities at the CLCS.  Professional development for MASE K-5 teachers will be offered during workshops, seminars and institutes as well as during site-based study groups.  The MASE K-5 project will utilize Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) and Lead Teachers who already are professional development leaders in the District. These teachers will assist in the leadership of the project by co-teaching (with content experts and outside consultants) the summer institutes and workshops, leading study groups, facilitating school-based sessions, conducting demonstration/laboratory lessons at the CLCS, and other leadership development and organizational tasks.\r\n\r\n",
