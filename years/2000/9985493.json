 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will measure structural and dynamical properties of aggregates of the protein tubulin. These measurements will test the current understanding of microtubule dynamic instability, improve the ability to discriminate between competing models of the conformational change of tubulin and, within those models, refine the description of the structure-function relationship. This approach is inspired by the hypothesis that GTP-hydrolysis results in the unfolding of a portion of the beta-monomer of the tubulin dimer into a random-coil. This hypothesis is part of a unique, physical approach to understanding protein design. This radical new approach could have profound impact. In the context of tubulin, the hypothesis, if supported, will inform proposed mechanisms for how various proteins and drugs interact with tubulin to affect the stability of its aggregates. More broadly, evidence of the proposed 'simple' conformational change will stimulate novel applications of polymer physics to protein design, which might elucidate the engineering of single molecule machines. One set of experiments will involve varying assembly conditions and measuring structural differences among the resulting tubulin aggregates. Parameters to be varied include tubulin concentration, proportion of non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, and concentration of non-specific solutes (e.g. glycerol) which, by altering the solvation of polypeptides, predictably change the effective size of a random coil. Structural measurements will be made using transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Another set of experiments will involve observing single microtubules by video-enhanced DIC microscopy and characterizing their dynamic instability as a function of similar parameters. The focus will be on microtubule disassembly and the distribution of lengths lost. The innovation is to observe disassembly in microtubules that were intentionally grown to very long lengths under one set of solution conditions and then switched to the solution conditions of interest and/or severed in situ, so as to optimize the chances of observing a transition to the growing state. These experiments are biochemically simple, but technically complex. Their interpretation will demand quantitative analysis and rigorous physical modeling. Thus, they are ideally suited for physics students at both the graduate and undergraduate level, providing a concrete and tested path for introducing them to the basics of biochemistry and cell biology. A final experiment will involve directly engineering a variant of tubulin to have a smaller random-coil domain. It offers a well-motivated introduction to the powerful techniques of molecular biology for a student with interdisciplinary undergraduate training. As a result, students involved in this educational program will be well prepared to appreciate and contribute to the unfolding \"biotech\" renaissance. Meanwhile, their experience will be vital in formalizing an interdisciplinary education along such lines, including a minor in biophysics and a graduate program in bioengineering and physics. Educational aspects of this proposal that are not directly related to the research plan, are also designed to involve students in hands-on discovery. The central aim of the educational component of this project will be to place students at the limits of their knowledge in an environment where they can learn by doing.",
