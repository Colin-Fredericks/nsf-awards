 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will explore, using numerical modeling and prototype testing, the feasibility of using axially actuated valves for flow control of various viscosity and two-phase fluids.  Preliminary research with the innovative Venturi Off-Set Technology (VOSTtm) valves indicates that these valves exhibit a linear flow response as a function of valve actuation position.  Because these valves require short (1/2 turn) and therefore rapid actuation motion, they have great potential\r\nfor use as flow control devices in a variety of industries.  However, before throttling valves can be designed and produced, problems with seals and wear within the valve must be addressed solved.  Solution of these problems requires understanding the flow within the valve.  The purpose of this Phase I research is to investigate the feasibility of using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools to model flow within the unique VOSTtm valve flow passage when used as a throttling or control valve.  Two significant challenges are presented by this problem.  First, the need to determine flow through the valve at a variety of opening positions imposes unique demands on the computational grids that model the geometry.  Second, it may be difficult for the flow solver to capture details of the flow field in this complicated internal passage.  Once CFD modeling feasibility is demonstrated in Phase I, CFD design tools and techniques will be developed in Phase II for use in developing VOSTtm valves for a variety of difficult flow control applications involving high viscosity or multiple-phase fluids.  Utilizing University of Wyoming modeling and measurement capabilities and Big Horn Valve Inc. flow testing facilities, investigators will:  (1) develop CFD tools to simulate flow characteristics within the flow passage; (2) fabricate a throttling valve body to verify\r\ncomputer results; and  (3) conduct parametric studies of flow behavior for high viscosity or multiple phase conditions.  Successful research in this arena will strengthen the understanding of valve throttling and performance characteristics, while also investigating new ways to perform numerical flow modeling of changing geometry.  \r\n\r\nTransfer of CFD analytical tools and techniques into the industrial environment will permit designers to develop low loss linear flow control valves for a variety of industries.  Initial applications to be studied will be for slurry transport of solids (Trona industry) and for use in the petrochemical industry.  Petrochemical process valves alone constitute a $1.4B US industry.",
