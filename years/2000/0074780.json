 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the proposed research of this POWRE award is for the PI to acquire new experimental skills and a broad-based knowledge of molecular biology.  The PI proposes to accomplish this by working in the laboratory of her collaborator, Dr. D. A. notterman, in the Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University.  There, she will focus her efforts toward integrating nanotechnology with molecular biology.  Specifically, she will be developing an integrated microchip which, using a combination of microfluidic channels and nanoelectrodes, can measure the dielectric properties of single cells.  Correlations between these dielectric properties and the DNA content of cells will be examined.  Since DNA-content analysis and related measurements, such as the determination of S-phase fraction, are potentially useful strategies for detecting cancer cells, the proposed device will be an \"on-chip\" detector of cancer cells.  The PI will be learning how to culture and manipulate cells for this project.",
