 "awd_abstract_narration": "This scholarship program for financially disadvantaged students facilitates their success through faculty-mentored summer research for credit at Stevens that represents a departure from the standard mode of undergraduate research. An alternate route is for the scholars to engage in industry-sponsored design projects during the academic year for those students not inclined towards research. The distinguishing feature of the program is its relationship to an Institute-wide initiative that Stevens is implementing known as Technogenesis. Technogenesis refers to an organizational orientation that seeks to foster interdisciplinary collaboration in scholarship and learning that spans the continuum from the discovery of knowledge to its application in technology, from conception through to commercialization. \r\n\r\nThe Undergraduate Scholarships Program for Technogenesis (UPT) builds on our extensive experience of engaging undergraduates in research, but with the added innovative dimension of also educating students in the transitioning of research to technology realization. It also builds upon the wealth of successful experience at Stevens in helping disadvantaged students succeed in college and their careers.\r\n",
