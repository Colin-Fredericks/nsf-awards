A second, long wavelength target station would make use of the SNS accelerator to increase the performance of neutron scattering instruments making use of neutrons with wavelengths greater than two angstroms (compared to the High Power Target Station being built by the SNS Project).  This will significantly enhance the capabilities of SNS for the academic user community in magnetism, polymers science, biomaterials and structural biology, liquids and amorphous materials, and other fields where characteristic lengths are greater than ten angstroms and characteristic energies are less than 1 meV.  Instrument designs and the science they will enable will be developed by the scientific community and coordinated with the design of the target and moderator systems that produce the neutrons.                                . \r\n%%% \r\nNeutrons are a powerful tool for the study of the structure and dynamics of materials.  Instruments that measure the patterns produced by neutrons scattered from materials can be used to determine where the atoms are and how they move.  This proposal will fund work to develop a design for an experimental hall and associated instruments to be built at the Spallation Neutron Source, a new neutron scattering laboratory being built in Oak Ridge.  The same accelerator being built for SNS can also be used to produce neutrons at this second, Long Wavelength Target Station.  Adding such a target station to SNS will greatly enhance its scientific capacity for academic researchers in physics, chemistry, biology, engineering materials, and nanomaterials.  The proposal will involve researchers from many institutions in the design and development of a facility and its instrumentation with a full proposal for the Long Wavelength Target Station to be completed in the first year\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
