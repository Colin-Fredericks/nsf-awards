 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCardinal splines (i.e. splines with equally-spaced knots) provide a \r\ncanonical example for demonstrating the mathematical structure of \r\nmultiresolution analysis (MRA), which is a very powerful tool for the \r\nconstruction of orthogonal, semi-orthogonal, and bi-orthogonal \r\nwavelets.  However, for practical applications, splines with arbitrary \r\nknots are often needed; and although the multi-level (ML) structure of \r\nspline subspaces is still valid, the Fourier approach to the study of \r\ncardinal splines and their corresponding wavelets no longer applies to \r\nthis more general study.  In addition, even for the cardinal setting, \r\northogonal and semi-orthogonal splines must be replaced by tight affine \r\n(or wavelet) frames when compact support (or finite time-duration) is \r\nneeded for both spline-wavelet analysis and spline-wavelet synthesis.  \r\nFurthermore, for CAD/CAM applications, there is also the need of \r\nrational B-splines (or NURBS) for precise representation of various \r\ngeometric objects such as conic sections.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is based on our recent results on tight frames of \r\ncardinal splines and on our newly developed complete ML structure of \r\nNURBS in terms of their weights. We propose to introduce non-stationary \r\ntime-domain techniques to build a unified mathematical foundation of \r\ntight affine frames of compactly supported splines with arbitrary \r\nknots, and more generally, of NURBS.  This will be followed by \r\ndevelopment of efficient algorithms and computational schemes \r\nassociated with these new basic functions, which will be used as \r\nanalysis and synthesis tools for CAD/CAM and computer graphics \r\napplications.  We also propose to develop software libraries of these \r\nanalysis and design tools that will be fully compatible with the \r\nindustrial standards such as IGES, STEP, and PHIGS, for the CAD/CAM/CAE \r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
