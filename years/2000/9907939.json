 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methods are described for using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model system for genetic analysis of mechanisms that control lifespan and behavior during adult life. In the fly, as in humans, there is a scenario of up and down regulation of various genes as life progresses. The project describes methods for identifying the genes involved and measuring their activities. Three special groups of mutants to be used for the analysis are 1)short-life mutants, 2) mutants that are sluggish in their locomotor activity during life, and 3) mutants that have extended lifetimes. In some cases, the mutants have been found to have late-onset neurodegeneration and characterization of those phenotypes will continue. Identification and cloning of the genes affected in such mutants and monitoring their activities during life, can provide keys to the underlying events. An investigation into the genetics of pain will also be initiated.\r\n\r\nGenetic analysis of Drosophila development has had dramatic success in analyzing early events in embryogenesis and postembryonic events in the larva and pupa. However, many studies end at the point of emergence of the adult, which, with the exception of gametogenesis, is generally regarded as postmitotic and finalized, with the nervous system hard-wired. But the newly emerged adult fly continues to undergo important developmental and behavioral changes and the nervous system retains plasticity, as demonstrated by the fly's ability to learn. This proposal uses genetic analysis to address such on-going events in the adult.\r\n\r\n",
