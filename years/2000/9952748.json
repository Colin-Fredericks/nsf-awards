 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) This project uses gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) experiences to enhance the undergraduate curriculum.  The instrumentation is incorporated into the laboratory component of seven courses including general chemistry, organic chemistry, instrumental analysis, three advanced courses (organic, inorganic and analytical), and undergraduate research.  This instrumentation adds a new and necessary dimension to the array of equipment used by students to solve real and complex problems.  Based on a belief that it is important for students to comprehend the fundamental physical and chemical principles involved in GC/MS, to understand the major design features of the instrumentation, to recognize appropriate applications of the technique, and to appreciate the limitation of the data provided by GC/MS, this project will add an important practical component to courses where before it was only possible to present theoretical descriptions of GC/MS through classroom instruction.   A series of experiments, beginning with the first term of general chemistry and extending through the senior year, are being adapted from the educational chemical literature (primarily the Journal of Chemical Education) and implemented. Through these laboratory experiences students are learning to interpret isotopic mass and abundance data, to interpret fragmentation patterns, to analyze complex mixtures and to make qualitative identifications through use of library match software. They are also developing a sound background in the fundamental operating principles of the technique.  The unique feature of this project is the sequenced manner in which GC/MS experiences are built into the curriculum at three levels and integrated to develop the student's comprehension of the technique through multiple direct experiences.",
