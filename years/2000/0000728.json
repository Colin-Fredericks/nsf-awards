Nejat Veziroglu, Director, Clean Energy Research Institute, University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, Dr. M.H. Barakat, Solar Energy Department, the National Research Center (NRC), Cairo, Egypt, and Dr. Ahmed Fakhry, Emeritus Professor at the NRC in Cairo, Egypt.  These scientists plan to conduct theoretical and experimental investigations of the assessment and optimization of the annual performance of solar photovoltaic (PV)-hydrogen (H2) energy systems.   Two systems will be investigated - one with a storage system to even out the diurnal and seasonal insolation changes, and the other, with no such storage.   In the theoretical part, the relations between the operational characteristics and efficiency of each system and the variables will be obtained.  The results will be optimized for the most efficient solar PV Hydrogen Production System for a given set of conditions.  Also a program will be generated for optimizing the cost.  In the experimental investigation, a solar PV Hydrogen Production system will be operated around the year, and the results will be used to check and refine the theory.\r\n\r\nScope: The US PI is an active investigator with extensive experience in both solar energy and hydrogen energy.  The Egyptian scientist is a leader in the research on solar energy in Egypt.  The topic of solar PV- Hydrogen energy development and optimization is important to developing countries as well as to the United States.  Egypt has a serious problem with air pollution as it expands its economy to meet the needs of a growing population, and is seeking new and clean means for energy generation.  This project is designed to address that need.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.",
