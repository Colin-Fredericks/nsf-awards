 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University will upgrade a 300 MHz NMR and acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) synthesis of natural products and biologically active compounds using chiral auxiliary mediated asymmetric synthesis; b) the design and use of stereoregular polymers in direct lithography schemes; c) synthesis of multiporphyrin light-harvesting arrays and related molecular photonic devices; d) polymers with well-defined architectures; e) paramagnetic ligands for novel extended solids and porphyrins as building blocks for molecule-based magnets; and f) coumarin based cyclic prodrugs of peptides and peptidomimetics.  \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
