 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThis proof-of-concept project addresses the four major problems that inhibit undergraduate students from taking computer graphics courses:  (1) course materials are inadequate, (2) the \"programming approach\" alone is insufficient to spark the students' imagination and interest, (3) the \"design/modeling\" element is virtually missing, and (4) the graphics curriculum has not kept pace with the rapid advance of graphics technology.  To provide students with a set of comprehensive knowledge and skills in computer graphics, the primary goal of this project is to design an introductory graphics course that covers all four major components of graphics (i.e., rendering, modeling, animation, and post-processing) in a coherent way with a breath-first, hands-on, learning-by-doing approach. \r\n\r\nTo go beyond the current popular \"programming approach\" and to promote the \"I hear, I see and I do\" scheme, the secondary goal is to design software tools that incorporate all four components into a single and unified interface for students to (1) quickly appreciate each concept and algorithm, (2) practice design and modeling skills, (3) visualize the inner working of concepts and algorithms, and (4) perform semester-long programming projects without spending time on non-essential programming effort just to get a simple implementation working. \r\n\r\nAfter taking this course, the students will be familiar with the state-of-the-art graphics technology, acquire basic knowledge and skills, and be well-prepared to approach graphics applications and their software development with confidence. The impact of this project may also include an improved retention rate of computer science students and an increased employability of graduates in graphics related areas.  The outcomes of the project include the development of a new course with five teaching modules, the development of supporting software tools for teaching the modules to be disseminated on a CD-ROM, and the results of an evaluation of the impact of new course on student learning and retention.  If this project is successful, future plans include the development of a textbook with CD-ROM for national dissemination\r\n",
