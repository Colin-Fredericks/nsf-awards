Haddow, Michigan State University\r\nProposal Number 0084947\r\nThe Dynamic Performance of Nonlinear Vibration Absorbers\r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed work is to gain an improved understanding of\r\nthe dynamic response and performance of systems that utilize multiple\r\nvibration absorbers and to distill this knowledge into design guidelines.\r\nOf specific interest are centrifugally driven pendulum absorbers that are\r\nused for reducing torsional vibrations in rotor applications.  These\r\nabsorbers consist of masses that are suspended from the rotor in such a\r\nmanner that their motion counteracts the effects of fluctuating torques that\r\nact on the rotor.  This study employs both analysis and experimentation of\r\nsuch absorbers.  The analysis focuses on mathematical modeling and the\r\napplication of predictive techniques, including perturbation methods and\r\nsymmetric dynamic bifurcation theory.  The desired performance of absorbers\r\nis achieved by proper selection of design parameters that are included in\r\nthe formulation.  Experimentation is carried out on an existing torsional\r\nvibration facility that allows for control of the mean rotor speed and\r\nfluctuating torque components.  Specific topics being investigated include:\r\nthe application of absorbers to reduce vibrations in rotating beams, the use\r\nof absorbers for shake reduction, the avoidance of localization in absorber\r\nsystems, absorbers for multi-harmonic excitation, and the transient\r\nperformance of absorbers.  By systematic investigation of nonlinear\r\nbehavior, instabilities, and vibration localization, this study offers\r\nstrategies for avoiding effects that limit the performance of absorber\r\nsystems, and the results are used to provide useful recommendations for\r\nimplementation of systems of absorbers in rotating systems.\r\n*******************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
