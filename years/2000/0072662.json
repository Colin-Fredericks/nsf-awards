In \r\nparticular, we will consider those lengths that can be derived directly from \r\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, which is the main model for a \r\nfluid flow. Examples of such scales are the those resulting from the \r\nFourier spectrum of solutions, such as the inverse of the wave number at \r\nwhich the Fourier spectrum is cut off exponentially, and the length scales \r\nmeasuring complexity of level sets of solutions.  Related problems will be \r\naddressed also for other dissipative partial differential equations arising in \r\nfluid dynamics, such as the Ginzburg-Landau and the Kuramoto-\r\nSivashinsky equations.\r\n\r\nNavier-Stokes equations are perhaps the most widely studied system of \r\nnonlinear partial differential equations. They are generally believed to \r\ncontain necessary ingredients to explain much of turbulence phenomena. \r\nThis project will address properties of solutions which would have \r\nimplications in understanding creation and properties of fine structures in \r\na flow.  Potential applications include quantifying complexity of a fluid \r\nflow, establishment of spectral properties of solutions, estimation of the \r\nsize of the mesh needed to resolve a flow numerically, and information on \r\nlocating observables for the flow's monitoring\r\n",
