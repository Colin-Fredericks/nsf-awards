 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, jointly funded by the Divisions of Chemistry and Chemical and Transport Systems, renews support to the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology of the National Academy of Sciences for the Chemical Sciences Roundtable. The Roundtable provides a forum for the leadership of the chemical sciences from universities, industry and government to discuss research, education and economic issues of great current concern to the chemical community. The Roundtable serves as means to exchange information among the chemical sciences leadership and through them to disseminate this information broadly within that community. It also organizes and sponsors workshops on topics of critical current importance to the chemical sciences making the proceedings of these workshops widely available to that community as well. It does not make recommendations or provide advice. As a neutral, credible forum managed by the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology of the National Academy of Sciences the Roundtable facilitates communication among all stakeholders in the chemical enterprise.",
