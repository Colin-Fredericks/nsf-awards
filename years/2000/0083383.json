A critical challenge for humanity in the 21st century will be adapting our technology and lifestyle choices to live in harmony with our natural resource base and to protect the integrity of the earth's natural ecosystems.  For scientist and educators, this requires an understanding of the functioning of complex biological systems and of the dynamic interactions between human and natural systems.  It also requires the education of citizens so that they better understand the impacts of lifestyle choices and are empowered to adopt sustainable lifestyles.  Initially, the program will involve faculty from Conservation Biology, Soil Science, Engineering-Center for Environmental Research and Technology (a laboratory whose principal focus is air quality), Political Science and Anthropology.  As the program matures, it is expected that faculty encompassing the various physical sciences, social sciences and humanities will become involved.  This project will take the first steps toward identifying interdisciplinary research and educational opportunities relating to biocomplexity in Riverside County, which stretches from the outskirts of Los Angeles to the Arizona border.  It will provide the resources for investigators to share data sets and models, including data from the Riverside County Integrated Plan, for exploratory research into new approaches for modeling and analysis.  This grant will serve as a catalyst for development of an integrated approach to research and curriculum that will use Riverside County as a living laboratory to illustrate academic concepts and to provide opportunities for research.*** \r\n",
