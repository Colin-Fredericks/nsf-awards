The\r\nprimary missions of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute\r\nare a) to stimulate and propagate new work in the Mathematical\r\nSciences through broadly based programs and workshops in a\r\nvariety of fields of Mathematical Sciences, and b) to serve as a\r\ncenter for postdoctoral education.  The Institute accomplishes\r\nthese ends primarily by assembling a variety of researchers in a\r\nprogrammatically focussed environment.  These scientists include\r\nlong- and short-term visitors who are selected from the leaders\r\nin the fields of interest, as well as postdocs and other young\r\nresearchers. This award includes funding for postdoctoral\r\nfellows, whose mentoring is an important part of the Institute's\r\nactivities.  Secondary missions include the communication of\r\nmathematical science both within and outside the mathematical\r\ncommunity and the development of human resources in the\r\nMathematical Sciences.\r\n\r\nMSRI hosts scientific programs on short (one weekend to a few\r\nweeks) and long (semester and academic year) time scales.  The\r\nInstitute has no permanent faculty or research personnel and\r\nanchors the participant lists for major programs in a base of\r\ndistinguished visiting members and one- or two-year postdoctoral\r\nresearchers.  Topics for the long programs are drawn from the\r\nbroad range of mathematical sciences and repeat infrequently.\r\nMany of the lectures and other presentations at MSRI are\r\npublically available on the World Wide Web through streaming\r\nvideo or lecture notes (http://www.msri.org).  The Mathematical\r\nSciences Research Institute in Berkeley is supported by the NSF\r\nas a Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, funded by the\r\nDivision of Mathematical Sciences.\r\n",
