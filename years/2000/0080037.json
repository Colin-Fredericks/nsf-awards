Freire\r\n\r\nThe Barrett Lectures at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in\r\nMay 2000, \"New Directions in Differential Geometry\" will present\r\nfour main speakers and a number of additional lecturers.  These\r\ntalks will address a broad spectrum of recent work in the\r\nsubject, including lecture series by four leading researchers on\r\npartial differential equations and analytic methods, minimal\r\nsurfaces, symmetries and isometries in Riemannian geometry, and\r\nLagrangian cycles in symplectic geometry.  The major component of\r\nthis award will support participation in the lecture series by\r\ngraduate students and recent Ph.D.s.\r\n\r\nThe Barrett Lectures have been held annually since 1972, covering\r\na variety of topics and attracting a national audience.  They are\r\none of the few long standing lecture series in mathematics in the\r\nsoutheastern United States.  The subject of these lectures for\r\n2000 is differential geometry, the study of aspects of a space\r\nthat can be captured by measures of length, angle, surface area,\r\nvolume, and related notions.  Riemannian geometry concentrates on\r\nissues related to curvature, the measurable quantity that makes\r\nrigorous the notion that a flat plane and a round sphere are\r\ndistinct even at very small scales of attention.  Symplectic\r\ngeometry concerns an idealization of the structure underlying the\r\nHamiltonian framework for mechanics, a structure that enables\r\nmeasurements of areas and volumes but does not require that\r\nlength and angles be measurable.  Both of these flavors of\r\ngeometric information have dramatic consequences for problems\r\nconcerning efficient or optimal placement of objects such as a\r\nsurface in a three-dimensional space, consequences which are\r\nmostly expressed in the language of partial differential\r\nequations and related ideas from mathematical analysis.\r\n",
