The co-organizers are Professors Theodore Wu at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena and Professor Minoru Nagai at the University of Ryukyus in Japan.  The topic will cover aquatic locomotion of all sizes, from microorganisms to fishes and cetaceans, such that the viscous-inertial effects range the entire span known to fluid physics.  The biophysical interest will contain the microfibril mechanisms found in flagellar and ciliary locomotion, the muscular energetics of the various kinds of fish swimming, and the physiological metabolism of aquatic animals.  The seminar will comprise a series of topics delivered by specialists in the areas of physiology, microbiology, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, control, robotics, and branches of engineering.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives are to improve our understanding of how the various kinds of aquatic locomotion and mechanisms are developed and thriving, to analyze why such ranges of high efficiency are achieved, and to apply the existing and newly gained knowledge to further research and future technologies.  The Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  It is expected that information on proceedings of the meeting will be available in \"Flui\r\n",
