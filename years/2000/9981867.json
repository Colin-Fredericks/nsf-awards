Project ideas are proposed by therapists who work with the disabled and have needs that are not met by commercially available devices. The therapists are to serve as advisors during the semester, and students can consult with them to insure the device will meet their needs. Students will spend the semester designing and building the device, and at the end of the semester, the students are to give the device to the disabled individual(s) and their therapists. The class is to be supported with lectures by the instructor and guests, as well as field trips, writing assignments, and oral presentations.   \r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator is to provide an annual report that includes a description of the projects successfully completed during the previous academic year. The report will be combined with similar accounts from other NSF-supported Design Projects and published in a book for general distribution. \r\n",
