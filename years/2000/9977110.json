 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal describes theoretical research on two topics.  Research on reciprocity will develop an axiomatic foundation for preferences \tthat may exhibit both altruism and spite. It is proposed to use this representation to provide a systematic explanation of a large body of experimental results; to develop the theory to develop definitions of nice and nasty behavior in games; and to provide evolutionary foundations for preferences for reciprocity.\r\n     Research on standards will extend work on the dynamics of barriers created to gain entry into elite groups. One study will generalize previous results on declining standards to environments in which candidates may supply more than the minimum necessary to enter the group. Another study will develop a model that explains how the composition of a group changes over time. This study may provide an understanding of what rules lead to group quality to be stable over time. It also will provide a theory of segregation based on differential abilities to observe quality. A third study will discuss how the ability to create new standards leads to a degradation of existing standards.\r\n",
