 "awd_abstract_narration": "0078311\r\nBothwell\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is currently believed that biologically active polypeptides, such as\r\npeptide hormones and growth factors, may be secreted by two alternative\r\nprocesses - an unregulatory secretory pathway and a regulated pathway, and\r\nit is thought that all polypeptides share the same regulated secretory\r\nmechanism.  For cells that display regulated secretion of several different\r\npeptide hormones and growth factors, this model predicts that cells cannot\r\nregulate release of these polypeptides independently.  Preliminary results\r\nindicate, however, that there must exist at least two distinct pathways for\r\nsecretion of biologically active polypeptides, potentially allowing cells to\r\nindependently control the release of hormones and growth factors that have\r\ndifferent functions.  The novel pathway is revealed by studies of the\r\nsecretion of the neurotrophic factor, BDNF.  Regulated secretion of BDNF by\r\nbrain nerve cells is of profound importance, because BDNF participates as an\r\nimportant regulator of synaptic transmission in the context of memory and\r\nlearning. The general goal of this proposal is to examine the mechanisms\r\nregulating secretion of BDNF in pituitary cells (which serve as a convenient\r\nmodel system for study of regulated secretion) and in nerve cells from the\r\nhippocampal and cortical regions of the brain.   Secretion of BDNF will be\r\ncompared to secretion of structurally related neurotrophic factors, NGF and\r\nNT-3.  Also secretion of BDNF will be compared to secretion of\r\nneuropeptides, such as ACTH and NPY.  Some experiments will directly monitor\r\nthe release of these polypeptides, from cultured cells, using immunoassays.\r\nOther experiments will compare the distribution of these polypeptides in\r\nsecretory vesicles within the cell, by immunohistochemical techniques.\r\n\r\nThese studies may have broad importance for understanding hormone action in\r\nthe endocrine system, and for understanding nerve cell communication in the\r\nbrain.  The orderly function of all tissues of the body is dependent on\r\ncommunication between cells.  A major method of cell-cell communication\r\ninvolves secretion of specific polypeptides, which act as messenger\r\nmolecules.  The release of these polypeptides, which may be called peptide\r\nhormones, neuropeptides, or growth factors, must be carefully controlled.\r\nThis project explores the possibility that cells can control release of\r\nthese polypeptides much more cleverly than was realized previously.\r\nThoroughly characterizing these controlled release mechanisms is essential\r\nfor a basic understanding of biological processes ranging from hormone\r\naction to memory and learning.\r\n",
