Instrumentation will be operated by technicians provided by University of Miami, and will record data from weekly repeat tracks that cross major oceanographic boundaries and traverse through an important zone of atmospheric variability.  Instrumentation to be acquired with NSF support includes a wind profiler, pyranometer, photometers, nephelometer, condensation particle counters, CO and ozone analyzers, sea water fluorometer and other items; additional oceanographic and atmospheric sensors are being provided with separate support by NOAA and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, the vessel operator. In addition to recording data with the sensors supported here, the University of Miami personnel will include public outreach programs on the vessel, as well as research training courses, high school teacher training courses, on-board lectures, and distance learning programs.  The project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. University of Miami and their non-federal partners will provide cost-share support for more than 30% of total project costs.\r\n***\r\n",
