 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nProject COMPACT is continuing to develop, test, and disseminate a new type of application-oriented, integrated curriculum software for SMET education.\r\n\r\nThe project materials employ a \"learning situation-focused\" approach rather than a conventional domain-centered approach to involve students of various backgrounds and abilities in learning physics, science and technology. The goal is to engage students in exploring learning situations associated with their career objectives. COMPACT'S open-ended software includes an Active Shell, Modeling Activities, Interactive Applets, Problem Solving Tutor, scriptable Instructor's Agent, Interactive Lessons and a tool to design them, Tools for Assessing student progress, and more. The Simulation module is based upon a \"real-life situation.\" It enables students to actively participate in modeling and virtual experimentation and observe the physical processes from macroscopic to microscopic levels. The package includes tools that help teachers assemble a single computer based learning environment from heterogeneous educational resources and the WWW.\r\n\r\nCOMPACT's materials are designed to address a wide audience including: (1) two-year college students enrolled in science, technology and engineering programs, (2) non-science majors seeking scientific and technology literacy in anticipation of workplace demands, and (3) high school students taking physics - in particular those in Tech Prep, School to Career or vocational education programs. The software has a multilevel structure and flexible format to accommodate students with poor backgrounds in science and mathematics, those with some knowledge of algebra and geometry, as well as advanced students. The software may be used in classrooms equipped with stand-alone computers, a local network, or over the Internet for distance learning.\r\n\r\n",
