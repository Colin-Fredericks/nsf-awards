 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal deductive systems play a central role in the areas of programming languages\r\nand logics. Firstly, they are used to define languages and their semantics at a very\r\nhigh-level of abstraction (e.g., type systems or operational semantics). Secondly,\r\nthey form the basis for the implementation of algorithms pertaining to languages\r\n(e.g., type inference or interpretation). Thirdly, they provide a common basis for\r\nthe study of meta-theory of programming languages and logics (e.g., preservation of\r\ntypes under evaluation).\r\n\r\nMotivated by the tremendous variety of deductive systems of interest in com-\r\nputer science and logic, general meta-languages for their specification have been\r\ninvestigated by the author and others. These meta-languages are often referred to\r\nas logical frameworks. When they emphasis is placed meta-theoretic reasoning they\r\nhave been called meta-logical frameworks. The primary objective of the proposed\r\nwork is to further the theory and practice of logic-independent, computer-assisted\r\nformal reasoning and meta-reasoning.\r\n\r\nThis is a renewal of the current NSF Grant CCR-9619584. Prior relevant work\r\nby the proposer and the results from the current grant include the design and im-\r\nplementation of the logic programming language Elf based on the logical framework\r\nLF, released in September 1998 under the name Twelf. Extensive case studies have\r\nconfirmed the wide range of applicability of the methodology underlying Twelf and\r\nits extension to a linear type theory. The primary emphasis of the work proposed\r\nunder this renewal will be applications in education and research, and the practical\r\nand theoretical issues suggested by these applications.",
