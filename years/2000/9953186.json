The problem is even more acute in rural and urban areas with high minority populations. Southwest Texas State University, the leading certification institution in the state, is collaborating with the Texas Statewide Systemic Initiative, the feeder community colleges and K- 12 schools in Central/South Texas to establish a model new certification program for middle school mathematics teachers. The goal of this project is to significantly increase the numbers of qualified middle school mathematics teachers, trained in appropriate student-centered content and pedagogy who are enthusiastic about teaching and remain in the profession. This is being effected through a collaborative process involving recruitment, mentoring, curriculum improvement and implementation, certification and induction. The three-year project involves the revision of the core math, science and education curricula for middle school teachers in alignment with national and state standards and informed by other NSF CETP projects. Although efforts are concentrated on curriculum reform, the development of recruitment, teacher mentor, and induction strategies are also components of the project. Immediate outcomes of the project are the production of over 100 new highly qualified middle school math teachers for Central/South Texas and the development of a model certification program for implementation throughout the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
