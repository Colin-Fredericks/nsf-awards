 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to extend previous efforts to desulfurize hydrocarbons using alkanes as a source of hydrogen, with reacts directly with sulfur.  The use of hydrogen for desulfurization requires expensive and energy-intensive steam reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas.  Hydrogen-rich alkanes offer alternative hydrogen sources if they can be used directly during their processing to remove sulfur as hydrogen sulfide.  In previous work the feasibility of this concept was demonstrated using reactions of propane-thiophene mixtures on zinc and cobalt exchanged zeolites.  The current work extends this chemistry to a broader range of cation-exchanged zeolites, to sources of hydrogen that include methane and higher hydrocarbons, and to more refractory sulfur and nitrogen compounds.  In addition, the mechanism of coupled hydrogenation-dehydrogenation requirements and the specific role of cation and acid sites in the chemistry will be studies with the aim to develop predictive structure-function rules that will guide the synthesis of more effective catalysts.  This technique for sulfur removal may form the basis for an efficient and environmentally-benign process.\r\n\r\n",
