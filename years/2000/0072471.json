 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Yip plans to investigate the motion of interfaces in solid materials \r\nfrom a mathematical point of view. He will concentrate on two topics.\r\nThe first one concerns the modeling of epitaxial thin film growths. \r\nThese films can have important semi- or super-conducting properties. \r\nThe goal of this work is to accurately describe the thin film \r\nevolutions at large length scales. The investigator plans to capture the \r\nsurface diffusion and nucleation phenomena on the film surface at the \r\ncontinuum level. Both of these mechanisms can have profound effects on\r\nthe film growth and the resultant film properties. The starting point of the \r\nresearch is the Burton-Cabrera-Frank model for the behavior of atomic layers \r\nand its generalizations. The mathematical content of this work involves \r\nnonlinear partial differential equations and numerical simulations.\r\nThe second topic is to investigate the effects of noise on motion by\r\nmean curvature in the case of non-uniqueness. Such type of motion is\r\na simplified model for surface evolutions in solidification processes. \r\nIt is well known that the equations can possess more than one solution. \r\nThe question arises which is the physically relevant one. This non-uniqueness\r\nis a major obstacle to a better mathematical understanding of the interface \r\nmotion. In particular, if the solutions are not unique, it is not clear which limiting \r\nsolution will be picked by approximation schemes. Dr. Yip plans to investigate \r\nthe selection effects brought out by the presence of noise, that is small random \r\nperturbations. Such an approach has potential applications in many other \r\ntypes of nonlinear evolution problems.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical modeling of materials growth phenomena has long been\r\nan active research area. New materials are being continuously searched\r\nfor and manufactured. A correct mathematical model can predict and \r\ncontrol in positive ways the outcome of the production processes. \r\nThis research has two goals. The first is to bridge in an \r\naccurate manner the microscopic and macroscopic descriptions in \r\nepitaxial thin film growths. These films have great applications \r\nin electronic materials. The second is to investigate the effects of \r\n\"noise\" (that is, random perturbative effects) in the modeling of the motion \r\nin interfaces in materials, such as the interface between different components \r\nin alloys. Even though such noise is known to be present in materials growths, \r\nits consequences still have not been understood completely. Both topics will \r\ninvolve mathematical analysis and physical intuition.\r\n",
