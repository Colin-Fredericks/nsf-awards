 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Ming-Yang Kao\r\nInstitution:  Yale University\r\nProposal Number:  9988376\r\n\r\nIn scientific disciplines, significant issues are sometimes assumed\r\naway by overmodeling, which results in lost knowledge.  Such\r\novermodeling is often caused by analytical or computational difficulty\r\nof the issues involved.  By shifting the existing balance among\r\nmodeling, analytical, and computational components of the current\r\nsolution to an issue, one inevitably discovers new technologies.\r\nMotivated by this research philosophy, this project has three general\r\nthemes.  The first is to explore trade-offs between modeling and\r\ncomputation in finance with emphasis on advancing computational\r\ntechnologies for practical and theoretical finance problems.  The\r\nsecond is to develop finance ideas to help solve computer science\r\nproblems.  The third is to formulate novel finance problems which\r\nbreak away from traditional paradigms of finance research.\r\n\r\nThis project pursues these three themes in five interrelated areas of\r\ncomputational finance: (1) market modeling, (2) investment and trading\r\nalgorithms, (3) risk management, (4) market index design, and (5)\r\nauctions.\r\n\r\nFor the area of market modeling, the main goal is to study short-term\r\npredictability of stock markets using agent-based approaches. The\r\nmodels established will be used to test algorithms developed for other\r\nparts of the project.\r\n\r\nFor the area of investment and trading algorithms, this project\r\nfocuses on two fundamental issues: (1) what sorts of information can\r\nbe used to enhance the performance of a portfolio and (2) how to\r\nmeasure the performance of investment and trading algorithms.  Results\r\nin this area can be useful for long-term investors such as those who\r\nsave for retirement.\r\n\r\nFor the area of risk management, this project investigates two basic\r\nissues: (1) how to assess the risk of a portfolio of assets and (2)\r\nhow to design optimal portfolios which meet security requirements.\r\nResults in this area may be used to help institutional investors\r\ndetect and minimize unwanted risks.\r\n\r\nFor the area of market index design, novel optimization problems will\r\nbe formulated to help design portfolios which are easier to manage\r\nthan popular market indices but can track or outperform the indices.\r\n\r\nFor the area of auctions, the primary goal is to use auction\r\nalgorithms to design solutions to computer science problems.  To this\r\nend, the project will identify auction primitives which can be used to\r\nconstruct complicated auction mechanisms.\r\n\r\n",
