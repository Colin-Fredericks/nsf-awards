 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research on the stoichiometric and catalytic transformations involving f-element and related organometallic molecules by Professor Tobin Marks of the Chemistry Department at Northwestern University.  Using primarily heavier group 14-16 metallocene complexes synthesized by the P.I. and collaborators, reaction calorimetry is utilized to quantify the strengths of metal-ligand multiple bonds. The scope and mechanisms of organolanthanide/actinide catalyzed reactions will be determined, to include hydroamination, phosphination and boration as well as olefin polymerization to produce polymers end-capped with a hetroatom (Si, Sn, B, Al) group.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to discover, understand, improve and apply chemical transformations involving organometallic molecules and molecular fragments to numerous areas of US industrial chemistry. The work focuses on the use of organometallic complexes of lanthanides and actinides, a relatively unexplored area, to effect these transformations which include catalytic processes for the production of fuels, polymeric materials, pharmecuticals and other economically important chemicals. This project will help to build both a broad knowledge base and a technically skilled cadre of researchers trained to develop more efficient, selective, environmentally benign and economically competitive process technologies.   \r\n",
