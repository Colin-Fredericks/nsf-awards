 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies a variety of problems concerning\r\ninterface dynamics in fluids and materials.  The problems are 1)\r\ncontrol of droplet formation and 2) microstructral evolution in\r\nanisotropic and inhomogeneous elastic media.  He brings together\r\nphysical experiments, modeling, mathematical and numerical\r\nanalysis, and large-scale scientific computations to study\r\ncertain fundamental problems related to interface motion, such as\r\ninterfacial pinch-off and evolutions of interfaces in\r\nthree-dimensional systems.  One of the major goals is to develop\r\nand apply start-of-the-art computational tools with emphasis on\r\nutilizing adaptive methods and parallel computing, and designing\r\nrobust numerical methods for integro-differential equations\r\ninvolving multiple physical effects with multiple spatial and\r\ntemporal scales.\r\n     The investigator studies some fundamental problems related\r\nto multiphase phenomenon in physical systems.  In particular, he\r\ndevelops mathematical models and performs large-scale\r\ncomputations to investigate diffusional evolution of\r\nmicrostructure in solid/solid phase transitions and control of\r\ndroplet formation in a fluid/fluid system.  Many structural\r\nmetals, such as steels, aluminum alloys and superalloys, are\r\nproducts of solid-state diffusional transformations.  The\r\nmulti-phase microstructure resulting from such transformations is\r\na key variable in setting the macroscopic mechanical properties\r\nsuch as stiffness, strength and toughness of the alloy.  A goal of\r\nthis study is to model and simulate the process of microstructure\r\nevolution through mathematics and computations, and eventually to\r\nprovide engineers information on how to generate different\r\nmicrostructures with desirable material properties.  The\r\ninvestigation of droplets concerns how to control the formation\r\nof drops of many sizes (frequently referred to as satellite\r\ndrops) in a situation like a dripping faucet or in the breakup of\r\na jet.  The presence of satellite drops is undesirable in many\r\npractical situations such as in ink jet printers and disk\r\natomizers.  He studies the use of focused, external acoustic waves\r\nfor the control of satellite drops.  If successful, this idea can\r\nbe applied to many modern technologies.",
