Students examine incorrect work and identify what errors caused the incorrect answers.  The project will develop video and print materials for K-8 students, along with professional development materials for teachers on how to use the student materials.  At grades K-3 the materials will focus on beginning number and operation concepts, and at grades 4-8 the materials will focus on rational numbers.  In total there will be 81 full lessons, 126 mini lessons, 10 \"Kids' Cases\" for grades 4-8; all of these materials will be developed in English and Spanish.  There will also be two videotapes (one for primary grades and one for intermediate grades) to help students learn to engage in discourse.  The teacher materials will be teaching guides for each full lesson and mini lesson, 3 teacher's manuals (grade K, grades 1-3, and grades 4-8), and two additional videotapes (one for primary grades and one for intermediate grades) on conducting mathematical discourse.  Preliminary research was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the pedagogical approach used by the materials, and extensive piloting of the materials will take place in California, Arizona, Missouri and Georgia.  The evaluation will include analysis of students' learning of key concepts, teachers' use of materials, and the degree of dissemination.  The materials are expected to be published by Heinemann and disseminated through a national network and an administrators' roundtable.  The project will be conducted by WestEd in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
