 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants recognize and respond to pathogen attack with specific defense\r\nmechanisms. The rapid production of Reactive Oxygen Intermediates (ROI),\r\nfrom molecular oxygen, in plants has been correlated with resistance\r\nresponses against pathogens. These oxygen derivatives can be toxic to\r\ninvading microbes and can serve as signals to the plant cells being\r\ninvaded. ROI accumulation is frequently correlated with the Hypersensitive\r\nResponse (HR), a kind of programmed cell death (PCD) which probably also\r\nrequires nitric oxide (NO) formation. In addition, ROI play a role in\r\nmorphogenetic phenomena like cell elongation, strengthening of the cell\r\nwall, lignification and response to other stresses such as wounding attack\r\nby insects, saline and cold stress. Examples of developmentally regulated\r\ncell death include the formation of specialized structures like xylem,\r\norgan sculpting (formation of certain leaf lobes, floral organ abortion),\r\nthe degeneration of organs once they have accomplished their function (the\r\nembryo suspensor, or the aleurone and the endosperm after the seed\r\ngermination) and senescence. In flowers, the interior cell layer of the\r\nanther locule (the tapetum) undergoes PCD during pollen development. The\r\nrole of ROI in these processes is largely unexplored.\r\n\r\nSeveral biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain ROI generation\r\nby plants. However, various lines of evidence implicate an NADPH oxidase,\r\nanalogous to that which generates the respiratory burst in mammalian\r\nphagocytes, as the source of the ROI detected in plants, at least upon\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThis investigator has found transposon insertions in the coding region of 8 Arabidopsis Atrboh\r\nhomologs of the mammalian gp91phox, the key membrane bound NADPH-binding\r\nflavocytochrome b558 so far identified. These mutant lines are an\r\nincomparable tool to dissect the role of specific gp91phox homologues, not\r\nonly in plant defense but also in relation to developmental processes, PCD\r\nand other responses to the environment. Preliminary data demonstrate\r\nthat there is redundancy in this gene family, and that ROI generated via\r\nthe gp91-phox protein play a role in at least one critical developmental\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe identification of the Atrboh genes enables the PI to look for more\r\ncomponents in early steps of the signal transduction pathway to defense,\r\nand to study the mechanism that activates the plant NADPH oxidase.\r\n",
