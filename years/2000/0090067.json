Ronnie Sircar\r\n    Department of Operations Research & Financial Engineering\r\n Princeton University.\r\n\r\nIn modern financial markets, investors are increasingly faced with\r\nexposure to changing and uncertain volatility. This project concerns\r\nmathematical models in which volatility is a stochastic process, and\r\ntheir use in derivative pricing and risk management.  The main aim is\r\nto develop an efficient and robust framework in which models are\r\ncalibrated from observable market data and then used to design\r\nrisk-minimizing strategies that hedge a portfolio against the\r\npotentially serious consequences of changing volatility. This problem\r\nis important for investors from large trading institutions to\r\nindividuals with pension funds.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular growth in the size of the derivatives market over the\r\nlast twenty-five years (currently it has a turnover of trillions of\r\ndollars in the US) plus recent infamous (and equally spectacular) risk\r\n(mis)management disasters, such as the Barings, Orange County and Long\r\nTerm Capital Management fiascos, have created an urgent need for smart\r\nmathematical and computational models to quantify the respective risks\r\nand rewards of such investments. This project aims to build on the\r\nmethodology introduced by Black, Scholes and Merton, to take into\r\naccount the fluctuating nature of market volatility. Mathematical\r\ntools are combined with statistical analysis of past prices to produce\r\nformulas and software that accurately capture the potential losses and\r\ngains in today's vast derivative market.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
