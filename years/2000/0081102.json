The\r\nvoluntary and self-directed nature of these informal activities make them\r\nideal for reaching populations outside traditional education settings.\r\nWith respect to informal education on programming, modern visual simulation\r\nenvironments have many features that make them appealing.  This research\r\nwill investigate the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art simulation\r\nprogramming environment as support for informal education of a diverse\r\npopulation of end-user programmers within the context of an ongoing\r\nresearch project on community network infrastructure.  Key research\r\nobjectives include:\r\n\r\n* Characterization of the programming literacy gained through visual\r\nsimulation programming and a determination of how this knowledge and its\r\naccusation is mediated by the maturity and background of end users.\r\n\r\n* Analysis of the role of the existing local community as a learning\r\ncommunity in building and maintaining the programming skills of end users\r\nof varying ages and roles.\r\n\r\n* Prototyping and evaluating a framework for cumulating and sharing the\r\nartifacts and practices of end-user programming within the learning\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n",
