 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nShortages of qualified mathematics and science teachers in America are reaching \r\nepidemic proportions. Some estimates suggest that as many as 40% of current math and science teachers do not have the training nor the background to do so. One result is that even though we are one of the richest nations on earth, our children consistently lag behind peers in other countries in terms of mathematics and science preparation. An untapped resource for improving mathematics and science instruction at the K-12 level lies in our colleges of engineering. Engineering students and faculty, with their highly developed mathematics and science skills as well as their unique perspective on the application of mathematics and science to real world problems, are ideally suited to assist in alleviating this crushing national problem. This project is improving mathematics and science instruction in the K-12 system through implementation of three activities. The first is the development of a course on Engineering Applications in Education and a teaching minor for Technology and Design for future secondary teachers. These courses are being developed and delivered by engineering and technology faculty at Michigan Tech and are also being adapted by Northern Michigan University which is closely partnering with Michigan Tech on the project. The second activity is the development of a program whereby students are receiving an accredited Bachelor's of Engineering degree while simultaneously satisfying teacher certification requirements--all within a normal four-year course of study. Internships with local school districts will ensure that interested students have critically important experiences in the classroom. The third activity is the development of summer coursework aimed at introducing engineering principles to current K-12 teachers, especially those working in school districts with high minority populations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
