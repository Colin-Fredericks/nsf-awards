 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research by Lee Brammer, Chemistry Department, University of Missouri-St. Louis, on hydrogen bonds that involve metals. Three aspects will be addressed. The first is the direct involvement of metal ions in hydrogen bonding. Here, early transition metals will be studied as H-bond acceptors. The second area concerns the indirect influence of metals via electronic interaction with ligands capable of hydrogen bonding. Research will focus on understanding aggregation by hydrogen bonding in supramolecular structures.  Finally, the spatial influence of metal coordination geometry in directing the mutual approach of metal complexes that are then linked via ligand-ligand hydrogen bonds will be studied.  In this domain, the role of hydrogen bonding in solid state and crystal engineering will be investigated using new compounds composed of coordination and organometallic compounds. The ultimate objectives are the rational design of solid state materials and understanding host-guest chemistry of \"metal-walled\" receptors and channels. The compounds synthesized will be characterized by solution and solid state spectroscopy, single crystal and powder diffraction studies, calorimetry, gravimetric analysis, and computational modeling.\r\n\r\nHydrogen bonding is important in chemistry and biology, but its role in organometallic chemistry, materials, and bioinorganic chemistry is not well understood, particularly as it affects new areas such as supramolecular chemistry, self-assembly, and crystal engineering.  Research will be focused on hydrogen bonds that involve metals.  Traditional studies have considered non-metal elements.  The research is expected to lead to a better understanding of proton transfer reactions involving metals, new hydrogen-bonded hybrid organic-inorganic materials, and a new class of host or channel structures involving organometallic compounds.  Students will gain experience in a variety of experimental techniques that will be invaluable as they seek careers in emerging areas of chemistry.\r\n",
