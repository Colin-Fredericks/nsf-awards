 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exponential uses have many uses in mathematics.  Historically, they\r\narose in problems in number theory.  More recently, they have found\r\napplications in cryptology and coding theory.  The main question that\r\narises is to find sharp upper bounds for the absolute value of an\r\nexponential sum.  The standard approach, based on P. Deligne's\r\nfundamental work on the Weil conjectures, is to compute the l-adic\r\ncohomology groups associated to the exponential sum.  Recently, the\r\ninvestigator and his collaborator computed the p-adic cohomology of\r\nsome new classes of exponential sums.  The calculations indicate that\r\nthese classes of exponential sums should have \"good\" upper bounds.\r\nThe investigator plans to search for more such classes of exponential\r\nsums and try to compute their l-adic cohomology, thus obtaining the\r\ndesired upper bounds.\r\n\r\nExponential sums originally arose in basic problems in number theory,\r\nsuch as trying to find the number of integer solutions to a given\r\nequation.  Usually it is very difficult to find the exact number of\r\nsuch solutions, so the next best thing is to approximate that number.\r\nIt was discovered that this question could often be reduced to the\r\nproblem of estimating the size of certain sums of complex numbers,\r\ncalled \"exponential sums.\"  A substantial theory has developed over\r\nthe years to deal with this subject, and it has found modern\r\napplications in the fields of cryptology and coding theory.  The\r\ninvestigator has discovered new classes of exponential sums which he\r\nbelieves it should be possible to estimate.  He will try to extend the\r\nexisting theory to cover these new classes.\r\n",
