 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schlick\r\n0071877\r\n     The investigator and her colleagues organize a\r\nmultidisciplinary workshop on methods for macromolecular\r\nmodeling.  The aim is to bring together both developers of\r\ncomputational tools for biomolecular simulations and those\r\nbiological and chemical scientists who use computer modeling to\r\nstudy macromolecular problems.  The workshop highlights recent\r\nadvances in simulation techniques, most notably in the areas of\r\nconformational sampling, fast electrostatics, molecular dynamics\r\nintegration, and quantum-mechanical calculations, that are having\r\nsignificant impact on structural biology.  It surveys developments\r\nin algorithmic approaches, hierarchical spatial representations,\r\nand improved computing platforms that continue to enhance the\r\nreliability of macromolecular simulations and increase their\r\napplicability and relevance to biomolecular research.  The topics\r\nhighlighted are: (1) new methods for long-term molecular dynamics\r\nsimulations; (2) conformational sampling: equilibrium and\r\nnonequilibrium processes; (3) multiscale modeling; (4)\r\nquantum/classical mechanics; (5) fast electrostatics; and (6)\r\napplications to enzyme catalysis, DNA modeling, and DNA/protein\r\nsystems.  The workshop is held at the Courant Institute of\r\nMathematical Sciences at New York University on October 12-14 and\r\nco-sponsored by SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied\r\nMathematics), as part of SIAM's new Activity Group in the Life\r\nSciences, as well as by National Science Foundation programs in\r\nApplied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, Theoretical and\r\nComputational Chemistry, and Molecular Biophysics.\r\n     Computational methods are increasingly being recognized as\r\nvaluable tools for the study of biomolecular structure and\r\nfunction.  The interdisciplinary nature of biomolecular\r\ncomputational approaches is largely driven by the many important\r\npractical applications in the field, such as drug design,\r\nbiomedical engineering, and food chemistry.  The workshop program\r\nprovides a timely and unique opportunity for close interaction\r\nand scientific exchange among biomolecular researchers, computer\r\nscientists, and applied mathematicians.  In the era of integrative\r\nscience, such synergy kindles new ideas and helps educate young\r\nscientists for cross-disciplinary research at the interface of\r\ncomputational science and biology.  The meeting brings researchers\r\nabreast of current developments in algorithms and computational\r\nmethods.  It also highlights critical problems in structural\r\nbiology and new application areas, and it fosters\r\ninterdisciplinary collaborations.  The results of the workshop are\r\ndisseminated through the collected scientific articles by the\r\ninvited speakers, which will be published in Springer Verlag's\r\nLecture Notes series in Computational Science and Engineering\r\n(LNCSE).  These tangible records, in addition to a carefully\r\ndesigned program, are expected to serve the community by\r\neducating junior scientists at disciplinary interfaces,\r\nstimulating new ideas in computational techniques for\r\nmacromolecular modeling, and identifying key areas for future\r\nresearch.\r\n",
