 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) As part of an interdisciplinary program in neuroscience, which is in the early stages of development, we are striving to promote student learning of fundamental concepts in cellular, systems, behavioral and clinical neuroscience, and to offer collaborative laboratory experiences in neurophysiology. A neuroscience concentration is being created that is centered around four core courses ranging from an introductory to an advanced level. The experiences of peer institutions in establishing neuroscience programs are being adapted. The requested equipment optimizes development of new laboratory-based courses, and enhances existing courses offered in the departments of biology and psychology. Addition of this new strength to our curriculum provides the breadth of training and cultivates the necessary critical thinking and technical skills for our students to enter the expanding number of clinical, industrial and academic careers in neuroscience.",
