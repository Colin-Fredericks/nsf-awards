 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it has long been known that the plant hormone auxin plays a role in virtually all aspects of plant growth and development, it is only recently that biologists have had the tools available to address questions regarding the specifics of these processes.  The application of new technologies and vastly improved analytical methods are leading to dramatic advances in understanding of auxin transport, auxin biosynthesis, auxin metabolism, and auxin mode of action.  The first international workshop devoted entirely to the subject of auxin biology will include sessions on auxin and genomics, auxin and embryonic pattern, auxin and vegetative pattern, auxin and flower/fruit development, and auxin and cell division.  Researchers from around the world will meet to discuss recent research progress as well as to plan new collaborations that exploit all of these new tools.  NSF support of this conference will provide funds to help defray travel costs for junior scientists and for some of the invited US speakers. \r\n",
