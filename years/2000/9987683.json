 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Clinton Administration has approved hundreds of habitat conservation plans (HCPs), taking an obscure provision of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and making it the centerpiece of their strategy to resolve the raging conflicts between species advocates and defenders of private property rights. This dissertation research project will study efforts by a group of local experts to assemble a set of ecological facts, theories, and models that are acceptable both to cosmopolitan scientists and to political stakeholders who have agreed to reach consensus on an HOP. Once accepted, these technical claims will serve as a basis for agreement on how much money and land private landholders have to provide in order to be allowed to kill endangered animals or eliminate a portion of their habitat, which is otherwise forbidden under the ESA. Using participant observation, videotaping, interviews, and documentary analysis, the project will examine the preparation of two HCPs in California. More specifically it will examine how interaction at different temporal scales shapes how each local experts attempt to reach consensus on technical claims, ranging from everyday achievements such as data standards to long-range achievements such as developing a highly abstract ecological model from a collection of heterogeneous ecological data. The project will also trace how the interpretation of these technical claims by cosmopolitan scientists is shaped by the narratives and representational techniques that regulatory actors use to communicate the timing and extent of their interaction.",
