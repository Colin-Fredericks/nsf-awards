This will be done in a unique way by using temporal and spatial data collected at SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience).  During the 18 years that SAGE has operated, the faculty have recognized a major lack of understanding of important fundamental geophysical concepts after courses at home campuses and after completion of the SAGE program.  This is despite special efforts with extra lectures and demonstrations in these topics at SAGE.  Topics such as the consequences of digitizing (aliasing, truncation, Fourier analysis, filtering, etc.) and wave phenomena such as scattering, phase and group velocity, and dispersion are simply not appreciated by most students (especially undergraduates).  In today's increasingly digital world these concepts must be fully understood for basic competency in geophysics.  The two topics chosen are critical to understanding many fundamental relations in several geophysical methods.  The goal is to insure that those geophysics students completing SAGE, and at campuses elsewhere, understand how digital analysis is used in seismology, electromagnetics, and potential methods (gravity and magnetics).  And, that they know the principles of wave propagation in low-loss, low frequency electromagnetic waves.  The computer-based aids are expected to sharply increase a student's fundamental grasp of modern geophysics.  The two learning modules will be integrated and hyper linked and will utilize the latest in computer simulations, visualizations, and interactive self-discovery to teach basic ideas.  Advantages to tying the proposed effort to SAGE include using past, co-located SAGE data collected with different geophysical methods and to provide a unique assessment environment.  The topics will be reinforced at SAGE as the students complete their own field work and apply their understanding first-hand to the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the new results.  The tools will be incorporated back at the home campuses of SAGE students and faculty (including one community college) and they will be disseminated to other campuses via Internet access.  Success of the modules will be determined by appropriate testing especially with SAGE REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) students since they return six months after SAGE for a winter workshop.  To insure proper testing the PIs have enlisted the assistance of the Center for Research in Math and Science Education at San Diego State University (SDSU).  Development of computer graphics, animation, and visualization will be done by SDSU's Instructional Technology Services under the technical direction of SAGE faculty.\r\n",
