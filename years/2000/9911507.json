 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tIn response to the growing international interest in the role of law in globalization, the Law and Society Association (LSA) proposes to establish global Collaborative Research Networks (CRNs) and to hold two Workshops to help scholars plan and carry out international research collaborations.  The Association believes that international collaboration in research on these issues will be more comprehensive and better informed because it will combine complementary perspectives and data from different research communities. Younger scholars will be targeted because the Workshops will have the greatest likelihood of influencing the career trajectories of these scholars, and through them, establishing a foundation for a new generation of research on global issues.  Scholars in Latin America and Eastern Europe will receive particular encouragement in order to take advantage of the workshop sites, Miami in the year 2000 and Budapest in 2001.  The Association will create internet-based CRNs accessible from all countries in order to promote contact and mutual engagement that will heighten awareness of opportunities and capacity for collaborative research.  The CRNs will also help identify younger scholars from Latin America, Eastern Europe and the US with similar research interests and committed to collaboration who can be invited to attend the Workshops.  At the Miami Workshop, participants will plan specific collaborative research projects.  At the Budapest Workshop, they will present and discuss reports on the progress of their research during the first year.  Follow up will continue to encourage completion of the planned research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t",
