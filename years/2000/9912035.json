 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tundra on the north slope of Alaska is covered with a large number of thaw-basin lakes which are the primary site of carbon storage via peat formation.  This three-year collaborative study will evaluate the overall coverage by lakes of the tundra near Barrow and Atqasuk (Alaska) based on high resolution satellite data.  Detailed on-site examination of thirty lakes will be done using ground penetrating radar to determine the thickness and distribution of peat and soil under the lakes.  Sediment cores will be collected to check the validity of the radar data.  Also, detailed examination of strata within the cores will be made based on soil composition, microfossil identification, pollen analysis and other measures.  In 4 detailed cores, the ages of the various strata will be determined by radiocarbon dating.  These results will allow the investigators to assess the carbon storage and peat formation history in the thirty lakes.  The regional history of peat accumulation may be estimated when the individual lakes are put in context of the regional lake distribution assessed via satellite data.  Consequently, this study may yield valuable information about carbon storage and peat formation in the Alaskan tundra.",
