Yet now, with such great reliance on software in every aspect of our lives, there is even greater need to address quality in software development. High quality software means software whose specifications meet customers' requirements and whose implementations meet specifications.  The focus of this proposal is helping software developers design quality into their systems, which is far more cost-effective than relying solely on post-implementation quality evaluation and corrective maintenance. In particular, the proposed research encompasses a plan for combining for the first time (1) formal architecture and component design models, (2) analysis and testing techniques based on these formalisms, together with (3) cognitive-based, design environments for critiquing software design. The proposed research explores innovative user interface approaches to delivering critical design-related quality assessment information to software developers as they interactively develop designs. The information to be delivered is based on design heuristics, formal analysis and testing, and usage data and feedback. Information is to be delivered in a manner consistent with research in human cognition. Finally, to ensure that this research has the potential to impact real work, the formal architecture and component design models leverage and extend industry standards.\r\n",
