 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of semiconductors in the contemporary industrial society is strikingly evident.  Their pivotal role in defense applications is equally manifest.  With its beginnings in the Second World War, the rapid post war developments in the science and technology of semiconductors show how basic science leads to revolutionary applications with profound impact on all aspects of life.\r\n\r\nThe symposium proposed will feature internationally known experts in the physics of semiconductors and related materials.  Their talks will focus on an exciting range of contemporary issues in the field and how they are being addressed with powerful experimental techniques and theoretical approaches.  While underscoring Purdue's role in the history of one of the major industrial revolutions of the 20th Century, it will serve to instruct and inspire the current generation of young and aspiring scientists by exposing them to a broad spectrum of current activities in semiconductors.\r\n\r\nThe symposium is to be held at Purdue University on October 21-22, 2000. \r\n",
