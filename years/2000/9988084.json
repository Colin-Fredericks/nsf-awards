 "awd_abstract_narration": "The starting point for many tasks of data-driven knowledge discovery is a data matrix whose rows are individuals, columns are numeric and/or symbolic features, and entries are feature values.  The usual goals of discovery or data analysis include finding classifiers, clusters, association rules, and Bayesian networks.  The new question posed by the PI in this work about a data matrix is:   Given one individual (or row) that is of special interest, what is unique about that individual?  That is, concisely articulate that individual's niche within the overall context.  One challenge the PI intends to address here is to better understand what statements of individual uniqueness people tend to find understandable and interesting.  Preliminary results indicate that the criteria for these two properties are mostly general, and only partly domain-dependent.   A prototype implementation of niche finding, using a set covering approach, has been applied to a newly assembled dataset on 236 major U.S. universities described by 123 features.  The PI will extend the methods by adding new feature types, scaling up to larger datasets, comparing against alternative approaches and different approximation algorithms, and by applying niche finding to significant problems in science and other professional fields.  The overall goal is to make niche finding as usual a discovery task as the others cited.   The PI expects to show that there is a new, simple, and interesting question to ask about datasets that has broad applicability in science and other professional fields.  He also intends to enhance public appreciation for knowledge discovery and information processing by developing special versions for baseball, with plans for use on public media and as a museum exhibit\r\n",
