 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\nThe author proposes to study a set of problems in harmonic analysis and\r\nrelated areas where the Gaussian curvature, the determinant of the\r\ndifferential of the Gauss map taking the point on a hypersurface to the\r\nunit normal at that point, plays an important role. More specifically,\r\nthe author proposes to study the following three basic problems:\r\nregularity of averages over surfaces, distribution of lattice points in\r\nconvex domains, and the existence of orthogonal exponential bases for\r\ndomains in Euclidean space. In the context of averages over surfaces, we\r\npropose to find a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the\r\nLebesgue space boundedness of these averages in terms of natural and\r\neasily computable geometric criteria. In the context of lattice points\r\nin convex domains, we propose to compute a sharp rate of growth for the\r\ndiscrepancy between the volume of a dilated convex body and the number\r\nof lattice points trapped inside, again in terms of natural geometric\r\nproperties of the boundary. In the context of orthogonal exponential\r\nbases, we propose to make progress towards the proof of the Fuglede\r\nConjecture, which says that a domain has orthogonal exponential basis if\r\nand only if it is possible to tile Euclidean space with disjoint\r\ntranslates of this domain. Combinatorial and number theoretic methods\r\nare expected to play an important role.\r\n\r\nThe study of the maximal averaging operators and other similar operators\r\nin harmonic analysis is partially motivated by the following interesting\r\nquestion: How close can we come to recovering a set of data from the\r\nvarious kinds of averages of that data? The question is of potential\r\npractical value since scientists are often called upon to make\r\npredictions based on average information. For example, meteorologists\r\nmake predictions about the rainfall in a particular location based on\r\nthe average rainfall in years past in nearby towns.\r\nSeismologists make earthquake predictions based on the pattern of shocks\r\nin the surrounding area. The tradeoff involved in the study of these\r\nphenomena is, roughly speaking, the following. If the data is very\r\nprecise, then it can, generally speaking, be recovered from any kind of\r\na reasonable average. If the data is less precise, then we have to make\r\nsure that the averaging process compensates for the deficiencies of the\r\ndata. The main thrust of this project is to study the averaging\r\nphenomenon when the data is given by a certain kind of a mathematical\r\nfunction, and the average is taken over a curved surface. The study of\r\nthe distribution of lattice points in convex domains and the associated\r\ndiscrepancy function is motivated by the desire to approximate discrete\r\ninformation, for example integer points in the plane, by more easily\r\ncomputable continuous information, in this case the area. Finally, the\r\nstudy of orthogonal exponential bases is motivated by an important\r\npractical problem of approximating functions by trigonometric functions.\r\nThese types of approximations have numerous applications in physics,\r\nengineering, and many other areas of science and technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
