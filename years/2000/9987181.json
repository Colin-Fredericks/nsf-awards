 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science and Mathematics Scholarships (CSMS) Program at Westminster College improves the retention of low-income, high-achieving students seeking degrees in computer science and mathematics, while improving these students' professional development and employment opportunities. A clear benefit is stronger relationships between the college and corporations which employ graduates with computer science and mathematics degrees.\r\n\r\nThe CSMS program facilitates a collaboration between the College's Mathematics and Computer Science faculty and its Office of Financial Aid, as well as its Career Resource Center and advising and academic support center. The result is a team effort to identify, encourage, and support eligible students, provide them with academic and career development support to completion of baccalaureate degrees, leading to their placement in graduate school and/or employment. Selected students are full time students who expect to complete their mathematics or computer science degrees within the two-year program duration. They are eligible to receive a Pell Grant and must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher (3.2 in major courses).\r\n\r\nCSMS program success will be evaluated using a number of parameters including pertcentage of students retained through the baccalaureate degree and successfully entered in graduate programs and discipline-related employment.",
