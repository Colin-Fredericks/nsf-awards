 "awd_abstract_narration": "Principal Investigator: Stephen R. Quake, CalTech\r\n\r\nProposal Number: 0088649\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nIn this research, chips will be fabricated by monolithic integration of replication molded fluidics with optics and active detectors.  These devices will consist of flow channels, including valves and pumps, made from silicone elastomer.  In the simplest design, these will be aligned onto micro-optic detector chips with filtered p-n diode detectors and diffractive optic lenses for coupling light into and out of the chip in order to perform fluorescence measurements and manipulation of sub-nanoliters volumes of fluid.  The integration of optics with replication molded microfluidics is expected to lead to the construction of very compact but versatile biological testing systems.\r\n\r\nThe main application for these chips will be rapid analysis of cellular information, either of gene expression pattern by RNA analysis or of protein levels through antibody assays. It is also anticipated that this effort will enable the construction of inexpensive and disposable multifunctional bio-sensor chips compact enough to ultimately be implanted into a host.  Since valves and pumps are already integrated into the microfluidic system, the resulting chips can concentrate and measure pathogens or toxins as well as deliver drugs in-situ to the host, or perform complex chemical and biological analyses.\r\n\r\n",
