 "awd_abstract_narration": "9909684\r\nByerly \r\nThe 3.2 to 3.6 billion year old Barberton greenstone belt is a well-preserved, generally weakly metamorphosed sequence of volcanic and sedimentary rocks that has been the subject of considerable attention over the past 30 years.  Contained within this sequence is some of the best evidence for the earliest known life on Earth, unusual surface conditions due to higher temperatures and oxygen-poor atmosphere, large meteorite impacts, complex development of continents, and diverse styles of volcanism.  Indeed, the Earth during this era may be a good analog for a major evolutionary stage of many terrestrial planets, including Mars.  This project will evaluate the distribution of the very-high temperature komatiitic lavas within the greenstone belt, especially those in the younger formations, 3.2 to 3.4 billion years old.  Field studies will continue a long-term mapping project by LSU and Stanford geologists, especially examining relationships in structural blocks along the northern margin of the belt.  Geochemical studies will examine major and trace element compositions of primary igneous minerals (spinel and pyroxene) and whole rocks.  Geochronological studies will be conducted to correlate volcanic units across major structural boundaries, and to further delineate the existence of progressively younger, and compositionally more complex, komatiitic volcanic centers toward the northern margin of the belt.  This study should contribute to our understanding of how early mantle processes formed stable continental blocks through episodic, plume-driven komatiitic volcanism; and at the same time  contribute to our understanding of the evolution of biological and surficial systems on early Earth.\r\n",
