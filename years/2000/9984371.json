Such techniques offer a promising direction for further\r\nboosting performance. However, the benefits so obtained are only as good as the\r\nunderlying prediction-based methods are at guessing what the program needs.\r\nThis project investigates slice-prediction, a paradigm that aims at providing\r\nhighly accurate prediction beyond what is possible with the existing methods.\r\nExisting methods are primarily outcome-based since they rely on repeating\r\npatterns in a program's outcome stream (e.g., addresses or branch directions).\r\nHowever, such patterns do not always exist. More importantly, as current\r\noutcome-based methods are perfected, irregular patterns increasingly dominate\r\nperformance. Slice-prediction attacks such cases by predicting the computation-\r\nslice that produces such irregular yet performance-critical outcomes. Predicted\r\nslices are then treated as miniature, autonomous programs, which can precompute\r\nperformance critical outcomes. The intuition is that while the outcome of a\r\nprogram can be irregular the method used is typically relatively simple and\r\nfairly stable.\r\nThis project focuses on architecturally invisible, hardware implementations of\r\nslice-prediction, and targets the following applications: (1) Branch Prediction\r\nand (2) Data Prefetching. Performance achieved by slice-prediction is evaluated\r\nthrough a detailed software simulator over a set of widely used benchmarks.\r\n",
