 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on multiclass scheduling and congestion control for computer communication networks\r\nis proposed.  Emphasis is placed on multiple qualities of service, including throughput and delay,\r\nand on multiple classes of packet data.  Two complementary research topics are addressed.  The\r\nfirst topic is causal scheduling of packets with multiple priority classes and deadlines.  The goal\r\nis to investigate a new scheduling criterion and related algorithms for dealing with conflicting\r\nrequirements for throughput and delay for multiclass traffic with deadlines.\r\n     The second topic is multiclass implementations of end-to-end congestion control, with pricing\r\nbased on explicit congestion notification.  Recently Gibbens and Kelly proposed the idea of charging\r\nnetwork users for marks placed on packets by network routers.  A mark on a packet is an indication\r\nthat the packet caused congestion.  This research explores the use of this pricing mechanism with\r\nthe addition of a small number of packet classes and a multiclass service discipline at the routers,\r\nbased on the classes.  Limited or no use of per flow state information will be made at the routers.\r\n     The approach will be to perform modeling, analysis, and design.  Models will be based on current and anticipated future technology, and cover a broad spectrum of user demands and network\r\ntopologies.  The analysis techniques will include simulation, asymptotic analysis based on fluid limits, diffusion limits, and large deviation theory, and stability analysis based on Lyapunov functions\r\nderived from convex analysis.  Methods for optimization, such as convex programming methods and\r\ncombinatorial optimization, and classical scheduling theory will be used.  Nonstochastic methods\r\nsuch as investigation of sample path optimality properties and competitively optimal scheduling\r\nwill also be considered.\r\n     Successful completion of the proposed research will provide (1) improved algorithms for scheduling multiclass traffic with strict time constraints, (2) an improved understanding of the implementation choices and the value of congestion based pricing using a small number of packet classes for the purpose of end-to-end congestion control in large scale networks, and (3) new mechanisms for end-to-end congestion control in large-scale computer communication networks.  \r\n",
