Each recipient receives an award equivalent to the cost of his/her full-time tuition and fees. The objective of the NSF Scholars Program is to provide a holistic model of student support, including guidance, mentoring, peer networking, financial assistance, and professional development to ensure the students' academic success, retention, shortened time to graduation, and permanent career opportunities in engineering and computer science after degree. The first cohort of students to begin the program in January 2000 is being recruited from the 160 upper division students who are already enrolled in the College of Engineering and Computer Science and meet the low-income and underrepresented eligibility focus, with future cohorts being recruited from outside the University as well. Potential recipients are selected based on their academic merit as well as on indicators of professional success. Each candidate fills out an application, submits letters of recommendation, and engages in a behavioral interview. Award recipients attend an orientation, participate in monthly meetings with all other NSF Scholars, meet with the Retention Counselor bi-weekly to assess academic progress, and take part in study groups and tutoring sessions, if necessary. In addition, program participants engage in a minimum number of hours of community service within the College to share their knowledge with lower-division students and reinforce their own skills. NSF scholars also pursue professional development by attending career guidance courses, resume writing and interviewing workshops, as well as a full-time paid co-op/internship placement for a semester with an industry sponsor in the student's field. One of the great strengths in the NSF Scholars Program is the dual financial support provided by NSF scholarships as well as paid co-op employment. Without having to work during the semester, students can concentrate on their studies, achieve academic success, and graduate sooner. This program clearly enables a greater number of students from groups historically underrepresented in Engineering and Computer Science to earn degrees in their fields of study. \r\n",
