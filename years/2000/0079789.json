 "awd_abstract_narration": "0079789\r\nCosterton\r\nThis is a development proposal to build a miniature confocal laser scanning microscope for in situ imaging of bacterial biofilms in their natural environments.\r\n\r\nConfocal microscopy is the dominant imaging modality for the study of bacterial adhesion onto surfaces, and their organization into communities called biofilms.  Our understanding of these microbial communities is limited to those species that can be coaxed to grow in optically compliant environments such as flow cells, which are compatible with conventional microscopy tools.  Extension of studies to films in their native environment, such as inside pipes and vessels or underground, are hindered because we do not have imaging tools that are compatible with those environments.\r\n\r\nThe applicant proposes to exploit recent advances in Silicon micromachining and microlens technologies to produce a confocal microscope smaller than 2 mm in diameter and only 10 mm long.  Called the confocal microprobe, the instrument may be introduced through the working channel of a borescope or endoscope to permit in situ studies of biofilm formation and growth.  The confocal microprobe will support brightfield imaging as well as fluorescent imaging with submicrometer resolution.  It will interface to an existing commercial confocal optical microscope, and operation of the microprobe will be controlled via the user interface of our commercial instrument.\r\n\r\nThis new miniature instrument will be used extensively in the Center for Biofilm Engineering, where its impact will be felt on several programs.  One of those programs is the study of biofilm formation in porous media such as soil, where biofilm research is targeting 'biobarriers\" for isolation of pollutants or to improve secondary recovery of oil from injection wells.  Another research direction in the Center that will benefit from this development is the microscopic study of fouling and microbially influenced corrosion in nuclear storage facilities, using an ultraminiature microscope delivered through the working channel of a borescope.  The study of mixed species biofilms (such as subgingival plaque) in their natural environment is extremely important, and the confocal microprobe will offer tremendous advantage for those studies.\r\n\r\nThis instrument will be used collaboratively between the Center for Biofilm Engineering, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Microvision, Inc., the world leader in micromechanical laser beam scanning devices.  Microvision is well positioned to capitalize on this development program and would be a willing partner to transition this technology from the university lab environment into the commercial arena.\r\n",
