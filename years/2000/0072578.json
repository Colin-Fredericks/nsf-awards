 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies two interrelated function estimation problems, \r\nnonparametric regression and linear inverse problems, using wavelet \r\nmethods via the approach of block thresholding and ideal adaptation \r\nwith oracle. The goals are to build a bridge between the traditional \r\nmultivariate normal decision theory and the adaptive wavelet function\r\nestimation, and to develop a family of estimators that achieve \r\nsimultaneously three objectives: adaptivity, spatial adaptivity, \r\nand computational efficiency. A major innovation and a consistent \r\ntheme throughout the research is the use of block shrinkage\r\nmethods which include the standard term-by-term thresholding as a\r\nspecial case. Block thresholding is studied via the approach of\r\nideal adaptation with oracle. It will be demonstrated that block \r\nthresholding serves as a bridge between the classical normal decision \r\ntheory and adaptive wavelet function estimation.  This leads to a \r\nsystematic way of developing a coherent set of rate-optimal estimators\r\nwith good empirical performance, all of which may be useful in different\r\nestimation problems.  \r\n\r\nTo fully understand why block thresholding works ``better''\r\nthan the standard term-by-term thresholding, and more generally,\r\nseparable rules, I will explore the connection between adaptability\r\nand information-pooling in general orthogonal series estimation, of\r\nwhich wavelets are a special case. Preliminary results show that\r\nseparable rules lack adaptability; they are necessarily not fully \r\nrate-adaptive. A key to adaptively achieve the exact minimax rate is\r\ninformation-pooling. I will further carry out research in this topic\r\nand will derive a lower bound on the amount of information-pooling\r\nrequired for achieving full global adaptivity. These results together \r\nwill offer a deeper understanding of the benefit of information-pooling \r\nin nonparametric function estimation, and also serve as a guide for\r\nthe construction of fully adaptive estimators. Besides theoretical\r\ninvestigation, I am also interested in applications of the wavelet \r\nmethods. I am collaborating with colleagues on using wavelet methods \r\nfor archiving and retrieval of medical images from tomographic databases. \r\n\r\n",
