 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nUse of a modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer and adaptation of relevant experiments developed at other institutions and published in a variety of chemistry journals enable continued planned improvements in the chemistry curriculum.  The institution's vision for undergraduate education is to develop a set of laboratory experiences that are thoughtfully sequenced and integrated to promote the full intellectual and skills development of students in all courses.  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been one of the most powerful structural tools available to chemists since its inception.  Within the last two decades, tremendous improvements in field strength and stability, computer hardware, software, and user interfaces, have allowed much  more complex experiments.  Today, detailed studies of molecular interactions, dynamics, and the characterization of complex structures are becoming routine.  Knowledge of how to access molecular level information is extremely important if graduates are to tackle complex questions in the areas of biochemistry, geochemistry, materials science, and environmental chemistry.  In many undergraduate chemistry programs, the greatest technology gap between undergraduate education and graduate or industrial research is often in NMR spectroscopy.  Use of a modern NMR spectrometer in the curriculum prepares undergraduates to meet research challenges presented in industry and academia.  This spectrometer provides students with variable temperature, high resolution, proton and carbon-13 NMR spectra as well as spin-lattice relaxation data, magnetization transfer spectra in biochemical kinetics, polarization transfer (DEPT) spectra, and a variety of 2-D spectra such as COSY, NOESY, ROESY, TOSY, HMQC.  Solid-state NMR capabilities also allow obtaining magic angle spinning cross polarization (CPMAS) NMR spectra.",
