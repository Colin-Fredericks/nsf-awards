The recent discovery of stable undercompressive \r\nwaves in driven films has created the opportunity for a unique \r\ncollaboration between experiments and mathematical theory. This research \r\nprogram will include related studies of solid-liquid-vapor interfaces, \r\nmoving contact lines, and surface tension effects. Analytical and \r\ncomputational studies will be integrated with a series of experiments that \r\nincludes a search for undercompressive waves in a spin coating geometry, \r\nmotion of contact lines near room- temperature critical points, and high-\r\nspeed video imaging of the dynamics of singularity formation in finite-\r\ntime rupture of fluid interfaces. Mathematical analysis will include models \r\nfor film rupture, stability of driven contact lines, and numerical analysis of \r\nschemes for computing these problems.\r\n\r\nLiquid films and moving contact lines arise in problems ranging from \r\nindustrial design of paints and microchip fabrication to medical \r\napplications including contact lenses and the lining of the lung. All of \r\nthese problems involve interactions across widely different length-scales \r\nin which the physical laws are not clearly understood. This is a \r\ncollaboration between researchers from the Mathematics (Bertozzi, \r\nWitelski) and Physics (Behringer) Departments at Duke University and \r\nthe Mathematics Department at North Carolina State University (Shearer). \r\nThis effort combines mathematical modeling, analysis, and numerical \r\nsimulation with new laboratory experiments to study fundamental \r\nproblems in driven films and moving contact lines.  Computational and \r\nmathematical models will direct the design of experiments investigating \r\nnew phenomena in spin coating processes and dewetting films. The \r\nprogram will involve undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral \r\nassociates, and visiting scientists from other institutions. This research will \r\nfoster curriculum developments in the Departments of Mathematics, \r\nPhysics and the Center for Nonlinear and Complex Systems at Duke \r\nUniversity\r\n",
