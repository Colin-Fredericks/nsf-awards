 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project offers a novel approach to the problem of automatic recognition, and eventually automatic translation, of American Sign Language (ASL). The approach takes advantage of the fact that signs are composed of components (handshape, location, orientation, movement), in much the same way that words are composed of consonants and vowels. Instead of attempting sign recognition as a process of matching the input against a stored set of lexical signs, sign recognition will be treated as the end result of several separate but interrelated component recognition procedures, of which the current project focuses on handshape recognition.\r\n\r\nThis design eliminates the enormous storage and processing-time difficulties associated with storing and retrieving 3-D moving images of signs in a look-up lexicon. Hand motion will be represented by the parameters of Hidden Markov Models; additionally, the approach aims to identify an input handshape from among the set of possible ASL handshapes. When coupled with similar procedures that identify locations, orientation, and movement, the composite identified set of components should yield a single lexical sign in a dictionary look-up.\r\n\r\nThe project uniquely integrates several areas of basic research: linguistic research on the structure of signs in ASL, psycholinguistic research on human perception of ASL, and advanced techniques from statistical pattern recognition and computer vision to analyze input from stereo images of signers. The procedure is designed so that linguistic information about ASL handshapes can be used to assist the computer in deciding which handshape it \"sees\". The long-term goal is to integrate the recognition procedure as the user interface of an ASL-English machine translation device. Such a device would support interactions between signers and speakers in practical settings, including the workplace and classrooms.",
