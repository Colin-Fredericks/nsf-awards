 "awd_abstract_narration": "GEOLOGY (42) The project adapts and implements a number of approaches to successful undergraduate introductory and advanced hydrology curricula. With the field and laboratory equipment and information technology we have implemented discovery-based learning of the hydrological system in communities surrounding Bowdoin College in mid-coast Maine. This motivates inquiry by linking hydrological studies to environmental issues in local communities, including groundwater supply and contamination and non-point-source pollution of local rivers and estuaries.  We have adapted Experimental Well Fields (Fletcher, 1994, J. Geol. Ed. 42, 491-493) which is used on the campuses of Dickinson College (Niemitz and Key, NSF ILI Award #9550929) and Queens College, NYC (Belitz and Ludman, NSF ILI Award #9851444).  This allows students to compare and contrast groundwater geochemistry and aquifer characteristics between fractured bedrock and sand-and-gravel settings. Two research watersheds with hydrological instrumentation, such as those at Alfred University (Hluchy, NSF ILI Award #9751265) and SUNY-Plattsburg (Franzi, NSF ILI Award #9551126) provide continuous time series of weather, flow, and water-quality variables, and afford students the opportunity to integrate study of the meteorological, surface and hillslope components of the hydrological system at the event scale. An internet-accessible database and visualization software, adapted from the GLOBE Project and a number of government sources, provides hydrologic and environmental data and metadata to undergraduate students, K-12 teachers and students, and resource managers and conservation groups in the area, linking a \"hydrologic community of learners\" in common discovery and education. The project also involves undergraduate faculty and students in enhancing earth-science education at nearby and remote rural middle schools, benefiting both in-service and pre-service teachers. \r\n\r\n",
