The principal\r\ninvestigator will work on (1) existence and uniqueness of\r\nsurfaces minimizing the Willmore bending energy, (2)\r\ndetermination of the moduli spaces of complete constant mean\r\ncurvature surfaces (CMC) with finite topology, (3) geometric\r\nanalysis of brownian motion and potential theory on properly\r\nembedded minimal surfaces with infinite topology, and (4) the\r\nexistence and geometry of energy-minimizing knots and links.  In\r\naddition, the principal investigator will work at GANG with\r\nsenior scientist N. Schmitt on the approach to constructing CMC\r\nsurfaces using monodromy of flat (loop) SU(2)-bundles over a\r\nRiemann surface; this will include an experimental aspect\r\n(computation and visualization of families of examples), as well\r\nas a theoretical aspect (relationship between integrable systems\r\nand the functional/ geometric analysis methods).\r\n\r\nWhile the motivation for most of this work is primarily\r\naesthetic, it should be noted that minimal, CMC and Willmore\r\nsurfaces arise in physical situations as interfaces between\r\nfluids, and thus their geometry may have some value in predicting\r\nthe behaviors of certain natural and synthetic materials.  For\r\nexample, vast resources are wasted when automatic soldering of\r\nelectronic microcomponents results in short- or open-circuits:\r\nsome of the principal investigator's work on CMC surfaces has\r\ndirect application to this problem; he has freely shared his\r\nideas (at NIST and elsewhere) with people trying to solve it.\r\nThe principal investigator's recent work on ropelength of knots\r\nand links (some published in the general science journal, Nature)\r\nrepresents the first careful effort to mathematically investigate\r\n-- and, in certain instances, correct -- claims in the literature\r\nabout the geometry of long polymeric chains (such as DNA); he is\r\nactively collaborating with natural scientists around the world\r\non this topic.  Schmitt's visualization work on new CMC surfaces\r\nhas been documented in the recent GANG film \"Surfaces, Flows &\r\nHolonomy,\" scenes of which are available at www.gang.umass.edu.\r\nThis award is cofunded by the program in Computational Mathematics.\r\n",
