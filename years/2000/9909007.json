 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research effort will contribute to the development of a new Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model that will advance the state of the art in mesoscale numerical weather prediction and provide a common modeling system for use in both research and operations.  In addition to the support provided to the University of Oklahoma's Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms under this award, the other collaborators include: the National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Division; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP); and the NOAA Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL).\r\n\r\nThe WRF Model is being designed to provide a high-resolution forecast system that will accurately predict significant weather over a broad range of scales, with particular emphasis on precipitation systems.  It will contain advanced numerics for the model solver, and several new prototypes will be evaluated as candidate architectures.  A parallel implementation for the model is being designed within a single source code that is flexible and efficient across a diverse spectrum of computer architectures.  A new variational data assimilation system will be developed for WRF that will include observations at smaller scales, such as Doppler radar and mesonetwork data.  In the area of model physics, the involvement of the broader research community will he actively solicited in developing and evaluating improved physics for high-resolution applications.\r\n\r\nWithin the three year time frame a full physics, research quality WRF modeling system will be made available and supported for broad use as a community research model.  Development will continue beyond this proposal period, with the expectation that the WRF Model will become a candidate for replacing the regional operational models in about five years.  Through the joint development and use of WRF, this project has the potential to enhance significantly the interactions between research and operational scientists, and in particular, to streamline the transfer of research advances into operations.\r\n\r\n",
