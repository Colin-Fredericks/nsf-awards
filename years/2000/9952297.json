 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics  (13)  This project is developing a new method for teaching introductory physics sequences for science majors by employing a process that promotes conceptual understanding, integrates theory and experiment more closely, and actively involves students in experiencing and building models of real-world phenomena. In addition, it is providing science majors with a stronger foundation in the skills of computer-aided data acquisition and analysis.\r\n\r\nThe project is providing a coherent, active engagement approach to several physics introductory courses, emphasizing guided discovery learning of concepts, the connection between real-world phenomena and models, and the use of computers as a tool.  Specifically, exemplary experiments involving active learning and the use of computer-based tools are being adapted for three introductory laboratory courses.  Many of these experiments are based on RealTime Physics.  The project is also introducing several digital video capture experiments and implementing Interactive Lecture Demonstrations in the corresponding lectures to complement the RealTime Physics experiments.  In addition, selected computer simulations are being adapted for demonstrations and as supplements to laboratory experiments.  RealTime Physics and Interactive Lecture Demonstrations have been used in large classes before, but this project adapts them to a situation in which lecture and laboratory are quite closely connected and small group work and projects are encouraged. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
