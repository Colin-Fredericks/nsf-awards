 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators develop very efficient adaptive\r\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for transient hyperbolic and\r\nsingularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems.  These\r\nmethods use discontinuous bases and thus are very effective at\r\ncapturing discontinuities.  In addition, they simplify adaptive\r\nh-, p-, and hp-refinement, are simple to implement on\r\nunstructured meshes with irregular boundaries, parallelize very\r\nwell, and satisfy local (element level) conservation principles.\r\nAdaptive enrichment by h-, p-, and r-refinement or combinations\r\nthereof has typically been guided by a posteriori estimates of\r\ndiscretization errors.  The investigators study asymptotically\r\ncorrect error estimates of discretization errors under h- or\r\np-refinement that provide very reliable measures of solution\r\naccuracy.  A posteriori error estimates are developed for linear\r\nand nonlinear hyperbolic and singularly perturbed\r\nconvection-diffusion problems.  The investigators implement these\r\nDG methods for large-scale problems on modern parallel systems\r\nranging from advanced supercomputers to clusters of workstations.\r\nParallel procedures must address heterogeneity at the processor,\r\nmemory, and communications levels as adaptivity greatly\r\ncomplicates matters.  A balanced parallel computation may cease\r\nto remain so under adaptive h- or p-refinement.  Computational\r\nloads must dynamically be redistributed during the solution\r\nprocess to restore and maintain balance.  Procedures to migrate\r\nwork between the processors so as to minimize the computational\r\ntime have hardly been addressed in such a heterogeneous\r\nenvironment.\r\n     Complex realistic computer simulations of physical problems\r\nlike the flow about a vehicle, weather prediction, and materials\r\nprocessing require long times on the fastest supercomputers.  The\r\ninvestigators develop very efficient and reliable computational\r\ntechniques based on the discontinuous Galerkin method that should\r\nhave advantages for parallel and network computation.  Accuracy\r\nand reliability of the results are guided by estimates of\r\nsolution errors that are automatically obtained as part of the\r\ncomputation.  These are used to create adaptive procedures that\r\nassign computational resources to regions where they are needed\r\nmost.  The efficiency provided by adaptivity leads to more\r\naccurate computer simulations, better products, and shorter\r\ndesign cycles.",
