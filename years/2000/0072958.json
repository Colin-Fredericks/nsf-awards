Please let me know if you think that further revision is needed. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nBo Li\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nProposal number:        DMS-0072958. \r\nPrincipal investigator: Bo Li, Univ. of Maryland, College Park. \r\nTitle of proposal:      Microscopic Process and Macroscopic Behavior of Material: \r\n                        Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis\r\n\r\nProposal Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project concerns the modeling, simulation, and analysis of a variety\r\nof microscopic processes and macroscopic behaviors of materials that in\r\ncommon involve phase transitions, multiple components and multiple scales,\r\nand moving interfaces. They include the epitaxial growth of semiconductor\r\nthin films, microstructural evolution of elastically stressed solids, and\r\nmacroscopic properties of martensitic microstructures. The proposer will\r\nfirst continue and extend his work initiated during his participation in\r\na DARPA/NSF VIP project to develop and improve continuum models for the\r\nepitaxial growth of thin films. In particular, he will carefully examine the\r\neffect of edge diffusion and kink convection as well as that of crystalline\r\nasymmetry and anisotropy to the thin film morphology and growth scaling laws.\r\nHe will then develop hybrid numerical techniques that incorporate finite\r\nelement methods and multigrid algorithms into level set formulations to\r\nsimulate the three-dimensional evolution of stressed microstructures. He\r\nwill finally expand his previous research to further investigate complex\r\nmartensitic microstructures with an emphasis on the effect of applied stress\r\nto their formation, evolution, and stability.\r\n\r\nThe design of innovative, intelligent, and high quality materials such as\r\nthose to be studied in this project is essential to the advance of modern\r\ntechnologies. The success in such design demands greatly a deep understanding\r\nof the fundamental principles and basic mechanisms of the underlying physical\r\nprocesses and material behaviors. It is therefore the goal of this research\r\nto systematically develop rational scientific concepts and novel research\r\ntechniques to accomplish such an understanding. The fulfillment of such a\r\ngoal will potentially provide experimentalists with detailed information on\r\ncontrollable physical data, making possible the development of new and improved\r\nmaterials for applications in many modern technologies and industrials ranging\r\nfrom communication to aerospace to medicine. Highlighted by its nature of\r\nscientific integrity, on the other hand, this project will naturally foster\r\nand promote an interdisciplinary research that involves materials science,\r\nphysics, applied mathematics, and high-performance computing.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n",
