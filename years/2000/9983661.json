 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves an integrated career development plan centered around research in the area of self-assembly in water.  The research explores various aspects of self-assembly and molecular recognition, particularly those which mimic the many instances in nature where hydrophobic effects are found to effect functional molecular assemblies.  Specific aims include the synthesis of self-complimentary facially amphiphilic molecules as building blocks for self-assembly in water.  Recognition motifs will include facial amphiphiles as receptors for ammonium groups and lysine containing peptides, implicated in the emergence of vancomycin resistant bacteria.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program supports the research and educational activities of Professor Lyle D. Isaacs of the University of Maryland College Park.  Professor Isaacs seeks to understand how molecules in nature recognize each other and come together to form specific, functional aggregates.  This will be carried out by exploring the interactions of molecules in water, relying on water-repellent surfaces on these molecules placed in pre-determined locations.  The proliferation of on-line resources for chemical knowledge and the development of computational chemistry packages has changed the way in which chemists learn and do research.  The educational plans will develop course modules in these areas, and integrate with the research goals through the development of supramolecular chemistry components for use in the classroom.\r\n",
