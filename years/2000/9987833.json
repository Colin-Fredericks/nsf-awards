 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to develop an efficient gene knockout strategy to facilitate the functional genomic analysis of an archaeon.  Although archaea constitute one of the three major branches of the tree of life, their molecular and cellular biology is not as well characterized as that of bacteria and eukarya.  Genome sequencing has provided significant insights into archaeal biology, but the function of many genes remains untested.  Further progress requires a method to systematically disrupt all genes in an archaeon.  As a first step toward this goal, experiments are described to develop a gene knockout strategy for the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum.  H. salinarum has many advantages as a model archaeon, including ease of culture, selectable markers, vectors and homologous gene replacement.  Its genome sequence is nearly completely determined.  To develop a strategy for functional genomics of this organism, a newly developed ura3-based gene knockout strategy will be modified to allow high-throughput disruption of open reading frames.  A gene implicated in bacteriorhodopsin biogenesis, brp, will be used as a target to develop the strategy.  PCR and both selection and counterselection with ura3 will be used to replace the brp open reading frame with a small, unrelated open reading frame.  By this strategy, potential polar effects on expression of downstream genes may be avoided.  The gene knockout strategy in H. salinarum may provide the most rapid route to systematic functional analysis of an archaeal genome.  Major insights into the role of individual genes in molecular and cellular processes would be possible.  The methodology may also facilitate ongoing studies of H. salinarum transcription, protein biogenesis, phototaxis and chemotaxis.",
