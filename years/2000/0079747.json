 "awd_abstract_narration": "The characterization of materials that possess a complex hierarchical organization and are composed of multiple constituents, is an important problem in materials science and engineering.  To obtain a comprehensive understanding of such materials, a direct imaging technique that will allow chemical contrast and spatial resolution on the nanometer scale would be extremely useful. Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy (NSOM/SNOM), a relatively new technique, is showing great potential for the topographic and spectroscopic imaging of the surfaces of metals, polymers, semiconductors and biological materials in air as well as in liquids at a submicron scale.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this grant is to set up a NSOM system at the University of Arizona for research and research training in the optical characterization of the surface of materials in air as well as in liquids. The major components of the instrument system are (i) a NSOM with Atomic force microscopy (AFM) capabilities, (ii) a micron Raman spectrometer, (iii) a fluorescence \r\nspectrometer and (iv) a laser source.  A team of researchers from a variety of disciplines such as materials science and engineering, optical science, mechanical engineering and surgical biology will be able to use this equipment system for advanced research and research training.  It is also proposed to use the NSOM system for training and educating undergraduates, especially through the NSF supported Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program that has been active in the department of materials science and engineering  since 1989.  The acquisition of the system will tremendously benefit K-12 outreach activities as well as the recruitment of under represented and minority students.  It is also planned to use the NSOM facility as the core of a more comprehensive Arizona Major Analytical Center (AMAC) for instrumentation and materials characterization.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
