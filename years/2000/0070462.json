These restrictions give rise to various, sometimes unexpected,\r\nphenomena of analytic continuation in several complex variables. The goal of\r\nthe proposed research is to solve some concrete old problems and to provide\r\na further progress in the study of  analytic continuation and  related\r\nareas.  The main method of investigation is the reflection principle, which\r\nwill be combined with other methods from analysis, geometry, algebra and\r\ndifferential equations.\r\n\r\nComplex analysis has been used as a powerful tool in mathematics and its\r\napplications for a long time and has a tendency to a larger role in certain\r\nareas. For example, the famous \"edge of the wedge\" theorem, which is now one\r\nof the main ingredients of the reflection principle, was discovered by  a\r\nphysicist  N. Bogolyubov with respect to his research in quantum field\r\ntheory. Another important object in theoretical physics - the Heisenberg\r\ngroup -\r\nis closely connected with the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the\r\nunit ball in the 2-dimensional complex space.\r\nI believe that this research program will be useful not only for complex\r\nanalysis but also for the strengthening its ties with other areas of\r\nmathematics and sciences by means of potential applications. It will also\r\ninfluence mathematical education at Indiana University via involvement of\r\ngraduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
