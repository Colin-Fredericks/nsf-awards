 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I proposal focuses on the development and characterization of in-situ energy dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDXRD) by using polycapillary x-ray optics and a newly developed superconducting microcalorimeter detector.  EDXRD is the method of choice if access to the sample is restricted or the diffraction data needs to be acquired quickly.  This applies to in-situ applications, since the sample is surrounded by processing equipment and data has to be acquired quickly to observe different intermediate states of the sample.  However, EDXRD is rarely used, since the energy resolution of available detectors is limited.  In addition, intense continuous parallel beams require high power x-ray sources.\r\n\r\nThe research team will use a superconducting microcalorimeter detector.  The energy resolution of this detector approaches the natural line width of characteristic x-rays and removes the energy resolution as a limitation.  The intense 'white' x-ray beam will be provided by a polycapillary x-ray optic.  It will collect and collimate x-rays from a low power source.  A second optic will concentrate the diffracted beam onto the detector.  With this system it will be possible to perform EDXRD at a resolution that has only been possible in wavelength dispersive systems.  The proposing team, the material scientists from X-Ray Optical Systems, will ensure that the research effort is focused on important thin film processing applications and the system will become rapidly commercialized once successfully demonstrated.\r\n",
