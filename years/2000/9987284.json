 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Chemical (53), Engineering - Civil (54), Engineering - Electrical (55), Engineering - Mechanical (56), Computer Science (31)\r\nThis Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) plan builds on existing support mechanisms established by the Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity (CEED) for upper-division students. The most powerful CEED retention strategies are being extended to upper-division, low-income students, providing a focused intervention program for the academic, personal, and career development of the forty selected CSEMS students. The plan supports a collaboration between School of Engineering and Applied Science senior faculty, CEED programs, and industry partners to provide the authority, expertise, management and resources to effectively develop, graduate, and place CSEMS students into career or graduate school positions. The objectives are: 1) to increase the number and professional attributes of CSEMS students entering the senior year and graduating in engineering and computer science; 2) to improve the academic performance of CSEMS and other CEED students in their major area; and 3) to provide a comprehensive plan for 100% of CSEMS targeted students to successfully transition to the high tech workforce or to graduate study. The Associate Dean/Principal Investigator (PI) chairs an NSF Academic Support Committee, with faculty members assigned as advisors for the all NSF CSEMS Scholars. Each NSF Scholar is matched to a faculty advisor/mentor. The PI and Co-PI meet with these faculty advisors every three weeks to assess the progress and needs of the NSF Scholarship recipients. Additionally, a Professional Development sub-committee is organizing career planning and corporate readiness workshops with members from the CEED Industry Advisory Board. These activities include: 1) critiqued video-taped mock job interviews, 2) resume critique sessions, 3) a career interest testing program, 4) a live interview and evaluation session with CEED Industry Advisory Board Members, and 6) corporate situational problem-solving activities designed by CEED Industry Advisory Board Members. The project leadership is collecting committee reports on student participation in programs and tabulating academic performance results. In addition, efficacy of program components is being assesed with the help of the following indicators: 1) a database for tracking course progress and time to graduation for NSF Scholars; 2) attendance at workshops and performance on quizzes provide monitoring and efficacy of workshops; 3) NSF Scholar GPA and number of scholars exceeding the 3.2 GPA norm for SEAS graduating seniors; and 4) the number of scholars securing summer internships and offers for career positions before graduation. The project aims to impact 80 underrepresented minority CSEMS students over the duration of the two-year grant. \r\n",
