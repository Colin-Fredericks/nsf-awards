 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous work has hinted that human brain signals may be able to control a computer.  However, traditional mouse-oriented interaction techniques are tedious and error-prone for users controlling a computer with neural signals.   In order to increase the efficacy of direct brain-computer interfaces, new paradigms of human-computer interaction must be devised in order to facilitate faster and more accurate control with minimal effort on the part of the user, through use of auditory, visual, haptic feedback.   The PIs will explore hysteretic (\"nudge and shove\") user interfaces as a possible means to this end, combining the new techniques with ideas adapted from Georgia Tech's \"Aware Home\" research in an effort to find ways to improve the quality of life for locked-in patients by giving them the ability through their brain signals to control features of their personal environment such as lights, television, radio, and temperature.   The PIs plan to implant six new patients and to continue working with the two patients who are already implanted.    This project will lay the groundwork fir innovative methods for communication (including phonemes, codes, and iconic languages that could be mapped directly to neural signals), for  Internet access (including web browsing and electronic communication);    and eventually for effective ways of giving implant patients control of prosthetics which could restore movement to paralyzed limbs.",
