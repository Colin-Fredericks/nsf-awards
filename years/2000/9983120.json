 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than one-fifth of all proteins are membrane proteins, many of which allow living cells to sense their environment. However, all proteins are made on the inside of the cell, in the cytoplasm, not in the membrane. One of the fundamental problems in understanding how membrane proteins work is understanding how membrane proteins get from the cytoplasm into the cell membrane. Many membrane proteins, like the opsins in eye cells that enable us to see, snake across the membrane many times, and are called polytopic membrane proteins. Loops of these protein snakes are exposed outside the cell and inside the cell cytoplasm. For the past 25 years, how membrane proteins move from the cytoplasm to snake across their membrane homes has remained a mystery.\r\nThe goal of this study is to discover how bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a retinal-containing polytopic membrane protein produced by the archaebacterium Halobacterium is inserted in the membrane and matured into a protein capable of turning light into energy. The biogenesis of polytopic membrane proteins, which span the membrane multiple times, is essential for vision, energy production, and nutrient transport. Individual steps in biogenesis, which include membrane insertion, folding, and co-factor binding are poorly understood at the molecular level. BR is the ideal model for these studies, because it is the only membrane protein whose structure has been determined at high resolution in its native lipid (membrane) environment. Its biogenesis includes the insertion of the bacterioopsin (BO) apoprotein into the membrane, the formation of a 7-transmembrane helical bundle, the binding of retinal, and the assembly of the purple membrane, a 2-dimensional crystalline lattice. The pathway by which BO inserts into the plasma membrane will be determined using a novel kinetic assay to time insertion of the extracellular regions of BR and their order of insertion. Whether the secretory translocase SecY protein is involved in insertion of BO will be tested, by determining whether SecY and BO interact genetically and biochemically. The cellular factors that mediate the binding of retinal to BO will be identified. The proposed studies of BO insertion and retinal binding will yield basic insights into how membrane proteins insert and bind co-factors.\r\nUnderstanding the biogenesis of polytopic membrane proteins at the molecular level is important for achieving the high-level expression of physiologically and biotechnologically important membrane proteins. \r\n",
