 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Instrumentation Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, Jeffrey I. Steinfeld of Massachusetts Institute of Technology will convene an NSF Instrumentation for Environmental Science, 2000 Workshop.  The focus of the workshop will be on identifying key measurement needs in environmental science and emerging measurement technologies that could have a significant impact on environmental measurements.  Some unique challenges that may be further discussed at the workshop include (i) finding the signal in the noise; (ii) the highly complex sample environment; and (iii) in situ versus remote sensing, among others.  The overall goal is to assist NSF in planning its programs and funding priorities for analytical instrumentation that will provide reliable, cost-effective environmental measurement techniques. The workshop will be held on November 10-12, 2000, in Dedham, Massachusetts, just outside Boston.  Approximately 40 scientists from academia, government and industry will participate.  The workshop will prepare a report and present its findings at the Pittsburgh Conference in March, 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
