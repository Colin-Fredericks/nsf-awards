 "awd_abstract_narration": "9985954\r\nPaschal\r\nMany imaging modalities can be used for study of the lung including chest radiographs, radionuclide perfusion scanning, computed tomography (CT), and pulmonary angiography. While these methods are very useful in evaluating pulmonary vasculature, they have serious limitations. All involve exposure to ionizing radiation. Pulmonary angiography is invasive. All but CT provide only projection images. Quantitative information is not available with radiographs, CT, and pulmonary angiography and only limited quantitative information is available with radionuclide methods. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not involve ionizing radiation, is at most minimally invasive, can provide true three-dimensional (3D) image volumes, and can give some quantitative flow information. Preliminary results demonstrate that the signal in at least one 3D magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) method can be used to accurately estimate differential pulmonary perfusion, that is the percent of cardiac output that goes to each lung. Additional preliminary results demonstrate that 3D MRA can also accurately estimate perfusion in the upper, central, and lower portions of the lung.\r\n\r\nNewer contrast agent enhanced, breathold 3D MRA techniques produce very detailed depictions of lung vasculature in an extremely short period of time. The objective of this project is to evaluate 3D MRA methods with and without contrast agent as means to quantify regional and global perfusion in different flow states, using radioactive microspheres as the gold standard for flow measurement. The hypothesis of this work is that magnetic resonance imaging can be used to quantitatively assess regional and global pulmonary perfusion with minimal to no invasiveness.\r\n\r\nTwenty pigs will be imaged with 3D MRA techniques both before and after a perfusion altering intervention. A velocity and flow measuring MRI technique (2D phase contrast imaging) will also be used before and after the intervention to measure flow in ml/min to each lung. Two different radiolabels of micro spheres will be used to determine regional perfusion in the different flow states. The indicator dilution method will be used to measure cardiac output before and after the intervention. MRA results will be compared against the gold standards of micro spheres and indicator dilution.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work could have tremendous impact on investigations of lung physiology by providing scientists with a fast, non-destructive, non-invasive technique for measuring perfusion in different regions of lung. This would open the door to serial studies with no harm to the animal or human subjects. In comparison to radioactive microspheres, the proposed MR based approach to measuring regional perfusion under multiple physiologic conditions would also be less expensive.\r\n\r\n",
