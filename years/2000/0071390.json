Cecil\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator and his collaborators, Quo-Shin Chi\r\nand Gary Jensen, will study submanifolds of Euclidean space and\r\nthe sphere within the context of Lie sphere geometry.  Of\r\nparticular interest are submanifolds with special curvature\r\nproperties.  These include isoparametric hypersurfaces, which\r\nhave constant principal curvatures, and Dupin hypersurfaces,\r\nwhich have the property that each principal curvature is constant\r\nalong each of its corresponding curvature surfaces.  The main\r\nproblems to be studied are the classification of isoparametric\r\nhypersurfaces of the sphere with four principal curvatures, and\r\nthe classification of locally irreducible Dupin hypersurfaces\r\nwith four or six principal curvatures.  This research is\r\nprimarily local in nature, using the method of moving frames in\r\nLie sphere geometry.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on an important class of surfaces, Dupin\r\nsurfaces, which have very special curvature properties.  Examples\r\nof Dupin surfaces are planes, spheres, circular cylinders and the\r\ncyclides of Dupin, which have been useful in recent years in\r\nadvanced computer-aided design.  Dupin surfaces have higher\r\ndimensional analogues which were first studied by the great\r\nFrench mathematician Elie Cartan in the 1930's and which have\r\nbeen researched extensively by many mathematicians over the past\r\nthirty years.  The goal of the proposed research is to classify\r\nthese higher dimensional Dupin surfaces.  Another important\r\naspect of the proposal is the principal investigator's mentoring\r\nwork with undergraduate students.  Over the period of the grant,\r\nthree undergraduate students will be supported by the grant for a\r\nsummer of directed independent study in an area related to the\r\nprincipal investigator's own research. Each of these students\r\nwill then write an honors thesis based on this study.  In the\r\npast ten years, most of the students who have written honors\r\ntheses under the principal investigator's supervision have then\r\npursued graduate study in mathematics.  In this way, the\r\nprincipal investigator's previous grants have played a\r\nsignificant role in the education of some of the next generation\r\nof scientists.\r\n",
