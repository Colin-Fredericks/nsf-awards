Cohen\r\nDMS-0072173\r\n\r\nThe projects outlined in this proposal are directed toward \r\nthe interplay between homotopy theory, group theory, and the \r\ntopology of function spaces. Artin's braid group plays a \r\ncentral role.  The main projects are as follows:  (1) \r\ncontinuation of a program to finish Barratt's finite exponent\r\nconjecture, (2) computations of the group cohomology for certain discrete groups with varying choices of representations, \r\n(3) a further investigation of the connections between the\r\ncohomology of function spaces, group cohomology, as well\r\nas the connections with the topology of function spaces, \r\nconfiguration spaces, and hyperplane arrangements, \r\n(4) an analysis of the overlap of properties of homotopy \r\ngroups with other structures such as the Lie algebra attached \r\nto the descending central series for Artin's pure braid group, \r\nand the Lie algebra obtained from the higher homotopy groups \r\nof configuration spaces, and (5) a detailed analysis of \r\ncertain groups of coalgebra morphisms as well as their \r\nconnections to braid groups, and homotopy theory.\r\n\r\nThe main goals of the projects here involve geometry of \r\ncircles moving through space. These circles can be thought \r\nof as the motions of planetary objects in orbit around each \r\nother. The interplay between the geometry of these orbits \r\noccurs in mathematics as well as in mathematical physics.  \r\nPrecise information concerning these orbits has provided \r\nfruitful mathematical applications to several subjects. \r\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to measure different \r\nquantities in the subject as well as analyzing concrete \r\nuseful answers, and computations.\r\n",
