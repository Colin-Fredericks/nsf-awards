Manifolds in two and three \r\ndimensions provide the geometric models for many physical phenomena. \r\nComputational issues are playing an increasing role in mathematical \r\ninvestigations in these areas. Research in low-dimensional manifolds \r\nin turn is making contributions to computational geometry and topology. It also\r\nimpacts computational complexity theory, which studies questions \r\nsuch as how long it takes a computer to solve a problem. Techniques of \r\ncomputational topology have already led to  improvements in algorithms\r\nin computer graphics,  visualization, medical and molecular modeling \r\nand image recognition.  Several problems on the theme of computational \r\ntopology will be investigated in this project. \r\n\r\nThe computational complexity of many important problems in topology \r\nand geometry is unknown, even when explicit algorithms exist. \r\nRecent results have revealed intriguing connections between complexity theory, \r\nminimal surface theory, normal surface theory and isoperimetric \r\nproblems. The project will pursue research  in this direction, \r\nexamining the complexity of Knot Recognition,  Knot Genus, Homology Genus\r\nand related topological problems. The project also includes plans to \r\ninvestigate the generalized theory of normal surfaces. Normal surfaces\r\nare particularly  simple surfaces relative to a fixed triangulation of\r\na 3-manifold. They are the analogs of minimal surfaces in the PL Category. \r\nThe collection of such surfaces is discrete and well suited \r\nto computation, leading to applications in classification, complexity, \r\nenumeration and algorithmic recognition. Index-one, or almost normal \r\nsurfaces, were applied with spectacular success in recent work \r\non manifold recognition. A third focus of the project \r\nconcerns multi-region isoperimetric problems, which ask what \r\nare the shortest boundaries enclosing multiple regions of a \r\ngiven size. The goal is to give a mathematical proof that \r\nthe configurations assumed by soap bubbles are optimal. \r\nQuestions such as finding the shortest curve enclosing three given areas \r\nin the plane remain open. Also missing is an understanding of general \r\nproperties of stable soap-bubble-like configurations, such \r\nas whether the minimizing configurations always have connected \r\nregions.  Finally, the project examines questions of curve \r\nand surface evolution, using ideas based on normal surfaces. \r\nSuch evolution methods have the potential \r\nfor practical applications in many areas, similar to the many \r\napplications of mean curvature evolution. \r\n\r\n",
