The principal objective of the series will be to explore issues with significant implications for the vitality of science and engineering in the borderless, knowledge-based economy of the 21~ century. A Coordinating Committee will be responsible for the organization and implementation of the series of events. Consideration will be given to the establishment of an Advisory Board representing leading government and nongovemment scientific institutions in the two countries to provide strategic guidance. This proposal covers planning and oversight for the first three years and travel costs for participants in the first two events planned in the series.",
