 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof. Charles Wilkins of the University of Arkansas will develop a state-of-the-art laser desorption Fourier-transform mass spectrometer (FTMS) for aerosol and bacteria analysis.  This new analytical tool will employ multiple lasers for aerodynamic sizing and laser desorption of particulate samples.  For mass analysis, a 3 Tesla ion trapping FTMS will be used.  The combination of an aerosol source with FTMS will make possible the acquisition of size-correlated laser desorption mass spectral data from single particles, allowing correlation of chemicals identified with the sizes of particles upon which they are found.  Because of the trapping features of the FTMS, structural elucidation of unknowns using multiple stage mass spectrometry will be possible.  Thus, it will be possible to apply powerful MS/MS structure elucidation methods to species desorbed from single particles of known sizes, sampled in real time from inhomogeneous sources.  \r\n\r\nKnowledge of the detailed chemical composition of individual aerosol particles is essential for understanding such diverse topics as the chemistry and dynamics of the atmosphere, how to control small particle contamination in microelectronic fabrication facilities, and the health implications of particulate exposure as a function of size.  The new aerosol FTMS will allow high sensitivity-high resolution mass spectral analysis of particles with sizes determined simultaneously.  Potential applications to bacterial and small organism analysis also will be explored.  The instrument developed in this project will also serve as a prototype for field portable versions, which will allow application of the new technology to a wide range of practical analytical problems.",
