 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Dynamic Domain will enable computer users to create wrappers so that web sites can be queried as if they were databases.  The key innovation of this proposal is a method for semi-automatically generating wrappers from examples.  The approach combines supervised and unsupervised learning methods to minimize the amount of information required from users to generate wrappers.  As a result, unsophisticated users can rapidly create their own wrappers.  The research has the potential to make it vastly easier to access and integrate data to create large scale, virtual databases because it makes it possible for information users to create virtual databases, rather than relying on information providers to carry out this task.\r\n\r\nDynamic Domain proffers technology with the potential to transform the economics of information integration by giving ordinary users the power to integrate and query information sources.  While existing, commercially viable applications of this technology include tools for developing shopping agents and specialized search engines, new possibilities abound for Internet automations.  For example, consider a manufacturer who wants to integrate his production schedules with his business partners in a very fluid market where his partners frequently change.  Rather than requiring his partners to employ the same enterprise resource planning software that he uses or asking them to develop specialized interfaces, he can easily import data they make available via the web in whatever format they choose.\r\n",
