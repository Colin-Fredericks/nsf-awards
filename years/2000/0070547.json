 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n        This proposal deals with problems concerning the isomorphic structure\r\nof classical Banach spaces and their quantized analogues, operator spaces.\r\nThe problems to be studied lie in the following four areas:\r\n   I. The complementation problem for ideals in C* algebras.\r\n  II. Certain extension properties for separable operator spaces.\r\n III. The structure of complemented subspaces of nuclear C*-algebras.\r\n  IV. The structure of non-commutative L^p-spaces.\r\nSpecific problems include the following:\r\nArea I:  Let J be an ideal (closed, 2-sided) in a C*-algebra A with A/J\r\nseparable. Is J Banach complemented in A?  An important special case is\r\nwhere J = K, the ideal of compact operators on separable infinite-dimensional\r\nHilbert space; this is related to the uniform approximation property in\r\nclassical Banach space theory.\r\nArea II: Does every separable operator space X with the CSCP completely\r\nembed in K?  X is said to have the CSCP if it is locally reflexive and\r\ncompletely complemented in every separable locally reflexive superspace.\r\nArea III: Is every complemented subspace of a separable nuclear C*-algebra\r\ncompletely isomorphic to a nuclear operator space?  Is the converse true?\r\nArea IV: Let N be a von Neumann algebra and X be a subspace (infinite-\r\ndimensional, linear, and closed) of the predual of N.  Does l^p embed in\r\nX for some 1 < or = p < or = 2?  If M is another von Neumann algebra, and the\r\npreduals of M and N are Banach isomorphic, do M and N have the same type?\r\n\r\n        The study of operator spaces involves mathematics underlying the\r\nfoundation of quantum mechanics.  Important \"quantized\" Banach spaces include\r\nC*-algebras such as the Fermion algebra and the algebra of compact operators\r\non Hilbert space, and the preduals of von Neumann algebras, i.e.,\r\nnon-commutative L^1-spaces.  The problems concerning the structure of these\r\nspaces will be approached from the perspective of classical Banach space\r\ntheory.  This approach has already had considerable success, yielding basic\r\nproperties of the space of compact operators, and the Banach distinction\r\nbetween the preduals of finite and infinite von Neumann algebras.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
