Montgomery\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will search for new solutions to the\r\nNewtonian N-body problem using a combination of the direct method\r\nof the calculus of variations, a detailed knowledge of ``shape\r\nspace'', and a careful investigation of the action functional\r\nnear collisions of the bodies.  By the ``shape space'' we mean\r\nthe space of either similarity classes or congruence classes of\r\nN-gons.  In recent joint work with Alain Chenciner, this\r\nthree-pronged approach proved its utility by yielding a hitherto\r\nunknown orbit for the three-body problem.  In our new orbit all\r\nthree masses chase each other around the same figure eight shaped\r\ncurve in the plane. Our orbit turns out to be dynamically\r\n(actually KAM) stable.  The chief technical difficulty to be\r\novercome in successfully applying the method is that of avoiding\r\ncollisions between the masses.  Unlike the action in problems\r\nwith strong-force potentials, the action with the Newtonian\r\npotential admits finite-action solutions with collision.  One\r\nknows very little about minimizers with collision. In particular\r\nthey need not be regularized in any of the various senses.  The\r\nproposer will focus on the collisions.  If an action minimizing\r\nsequence tends to a curve with collisions, under what\r\ncircumstance are those collisions Levi-Civita regularized?  Are\r\nthere blow-up techniques which will enable us to better\r\nunderstand such sequences tending toward collision?  These are\r\nsome of the questions we will consider.\r\n\r\nThe three-body problem is the problem of understanding the long\r\nterm behaviour of three masses (planets, stars, satellites)\r\nattracting each other according to Newton's laws of physics.  It\r\nis one of the oldest problems in mathematics,dating back to\r\nNewton.  About 100 years ago the French mathematician Poincare\r\nmade fundamental progress. He showed that chaos exists in the\r\nthree-body problem, in contrast to the the two-body problem,\r\nwhere the motions are very regular (and well-approximated by that\r\nof the earth around the sun).  He also pointed out the central\r\nimportance of periodic orbits to the problem. Periodic orbits are\r\nmotions of the masses which repeat the same pattern indefinitely\r\nlike a point going around a circle.  We propose to find new\r\nperiodic solutions to the three-body problem and the N-body (N is\r\nfour, five, six,...)  problem by using a combination of\r\nmethods. The methods themselves are not new, but their\r\ncombination is.  This approach has already proved successful in\r\none instance -- by yielding a new solution in which three equal\r\nmasses chase each around a figure eight curve, never catching\r\neach other.  Our work could lead to further significant advances\r\nin the understanding of the N-body problem. The techniques may\r\nprove to be useful in other dynamical situations.  There is some\r\npossibility that our orbits might be found to exist somewhere in\r\nthe universe, or used in space missions someday.\r\n",
