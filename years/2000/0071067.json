 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project demonstrates methods to accelerate the preparation of computing professionals for upward mobility in the fields of computer and information technology through vendor certifications and college degree completion. The methodology also has the potential to level the playing field for access to technology education opportunity and associated employment opportunities by making delivery of affordable technical education neutral to the diversity of the client base. The project focuses on demonstrating that access to and proficiency in post-secondary computer and information technology education can be enhanced significantly through distance education via computer, specifically the World Wide Web, and outcomes-based assessment via computer based testing.\r\n\r\nProject activities culminate with the award of the Regents College Associate in Science degree in Computer Information Systems. Project participants earn general education credits through examinations offered by Regents College and technical credits by examinations such as those offered by the Institute for the Certification of Computer Professionals (ICCP). Students also are able to apply credits earned by examinations for various IT vendor certifications, e.g., Microsoft, CompTIA, Novell. All examinations are administered through a national network of examination delivery centers. Examination preparation is available on line through specially developed guided learning modules in self-paced and facilitated modes.\r\n\r\nThe primary strategy is to use the Regents College model of the virtual university that stresses assessment versus instructional approaches for degree programs at the associate and baccalaureate levels in computer and information technology. As computer platforms and the Internet's World Wide Web become more prevalent as vehicles for educational delivery and assessment, these innovative programs of educational delivery at virtual universities will offer solutions to the looming crisis in engineering and technology employment. This project relies on the increasing access to personal computers and the Internet now documented. With that, the proposed approach offers opportunities that are particularly vital to training displace workers and those historically underserved and underrepresented in technical higher education. The project seeks to create a replicable model of use to other distance learning based programs and institutions.\r\n",
