 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nEvans\r\n\r\nI will continue my ongoing research in nonlinear PDE, \r\nwith emphasis on these topics:  (i)   PDE methods for Hamiltonian dynamics:\r\nThe goal here is to use the (nonsmooth) solution of the appropriate cell\r\nPDE to study Hamiltonian  dynamics on the Aubry-Mather set, for problems\r\nwith many degrees of freedom.  (ii) Regularity for optimal Lipschitz extensions:\r\nThe boundary value problem for the ``infinity-Laplacian'' is a highly\r\ndegenerate nonlinear PDE, which is  extremely interesting since\r\nit is a sort of Euler-Lagrange equation for a calculus of variations\r\nproblem ``in the sup-norm''. I intend to study carefully the possible\r\nregularity of weak solutions. (iii) Relaxation approximations for Hamilton-Jacobi\r\n equations: Formal asymptotics strongly suggest that perturbing a Hamilton-Jacobi\r\nPDE by a wave operator, with large enough wave speed, should in the limit\r\nproduce a viscosity solution. A proof of this would dramatically extend\r\nthe applicability of viscosity solution methods, to cover approximations\r\nwith no maximum principle.  (iv) Mass transfer problems:\r\nI continue to be interested in PDE methods for Monge-Kantorovich mass\r\ntransfer problems, especially those occurring on fast time scales, \r\ncoupled with slower dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\nPartial differential equations (PDE) occur as  mathematical\r\ndescriptions of an extremely wide variety of physical and other phenomena,\r\nand nonlinear PDE are especially difficult, since they do not permit us to decompose\r\ncomplicated solutions into a superposition of simpler solutions. Many  important\r\nnonlinear PDE do however have a variational structure, meaning that \r\nthey correspond to a sort of optimization principle. The overall\r\ngoal of the calculus of varitations is finding ways to exploit these variational principles,\r\nto help us understand the nature of solutions to the corresponding nonlinear PDE. \r\nIn this project I will (mostly) continue to study several important classes of variational\r\nproblems, to understand more about (i) certain nondissipative dynamical systems, \r\n(ii) optimal extension problems, (iii) wave-like approximations to dissipative\r\nphenomena, and (iv) optimal mass reallocation problems.    \r\n",
