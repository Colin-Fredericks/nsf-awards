 "awd_abstract_narration": "The movement of large mammals through multiple-use landscapes is essential to the viability of many large mammal populations that occur in national parks and nature reserves. This incubation grant will be used to develop a conceptual, theoretical and methodological approach to study large mammal movement through multiple-use landscapes of East Africa: in the Masailand of northern Tanzania and the Laikipia Plateau in central Kenya. This effort will require a synthesis of four active areas of ecological and interdisciplinary inquiry: (1) Landscape Ecology; (2) Behavioral Ecology; (3) The mathematical modeling of animal movement; and (4) Land tenure and economics.  A review paper on large mammal movement through multiple-use landscapes will be written and a mathematical model linking landscape pattern to components of animal movement behavior will be developed. \r\n\r\nNature reserves everywhere are increasingly isolated by multiple-use human landscapes.  A number of important studies suggest that all but the largest reserves are too small to maintain populations of all resident vertebrate species.  Thus, the ability of animals to disperse through the multiple-use landscapes that surround nature reserves becomes essential..  The effort to link reserves with wildlife corridors is hindered by our relative ignorance of the ability of multiple-use landscapes to support the movements of these species.  The conceptual, theoretical and methodological approach developed in this incubation grant will serve as a template for the study of large mammal movement through multiple-use landscapes. By developing a quantitative understanding of the effect of landscape patterns on movement it will be possible to evaluate the effects of changing land use on animal movement.  By examining how land tenure and economics affect landscape pattern, these social factors can also be linked to animal movement and nature reserve viability.\r\n",
