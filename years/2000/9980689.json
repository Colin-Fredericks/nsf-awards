 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)  \r\nWe have developed a field Geophysics course based on adaptation of teaching materials and techniques from other universities (U.C. Riverside, Lancaster University, Georgia Tech, U.C. San Diego, and M.I.T.) and integration with commercially available products for satellite image processing and mapping. The course has been implemented with standard commercial field equipment used in the geotechnical community. Each year the class is structured to focus on a different scientific problem attacked with a variety of observations.  This approach was used successfully at M.I.T. for a number of years. The specific goals of the course are to teach the students: 1) how to design a field experiment, 2) how to incorporate the techniques of modern satellite and GPS based methods, 3) how to use computers in synthesizing results, 4) how to work as a group to develop a consensus set of conclusions, and 5) how to present their results in a coherent manner.  The success of the students in achieving these goals is assessed on their performance in field camp, but primarily on the basis of a written report which we have structured to measure the objectives. We have developed this course by adapting tools used by other institutions: a magnetometer, an electrical resistivity system, a RTK-GPS survey system, a total station,  and an in-field computing system coupled with advanced analysis software (ER Mapper for satellite image processing, ISIS for processing seismic data, MatLab and SAC2000 for analysis, and ArcInfo for mapping) to acquire the capability of in-field analysis.  In the first year we started with simple analyses of gravity, resistivity, and seismic refraction data.  The gravity analysis was freeware from Lancaster University. The resistivity package was from UC Riverside.  For use with magnetics observations we have software that was obtained from U.C. San Diego (Scripps Institution of Oceanography).  In future years, we anticipate including seismic reflection and interactive image processing, as well as complete in-field interpretation of the results. The course syllabus, reading lists, and information related to specific field areas will be posted on the Web for anyone to use.  Scientific results that arise from the course will be submitted for publication.  Our experience with particular field areas, data we acquire in those areas, and software we use for in-field interpretation will be freely shared with other academic institutions.",
