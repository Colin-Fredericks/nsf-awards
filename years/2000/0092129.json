 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eight Phase II Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI) states, consisting of Louisiana, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Texas, and Vermont believe that the substantial investments in systemic reform made by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other key partners must become more networked and optimized.  In order to move in this direction, the SSI states developed A Blueprint for Systemic Reform in Science and Mathematics, which describes the essential elements of an empirical theory of reform that would inform the work of the SSI states in the immediate future. \r\n\r\nThe Blueprint includes the following recommendations to ensure effective networking within the SSI states, with NSF, and other states and local districts undergoing systemic reform in science and mathematics:\r\n\r\n1. Collaborate with researchers at the national level to articulate a generalized model of systemic reform within the context of the evolving empirical theory of systemic reform.\r\n\r\n2. Synthesize, organize, and disseminate numerous reform products, such as instructional materials for standards alignment, standards-based curricula, assessment instruments, algebra materials, self-assessment tools, and strategies for aligning allocation of resources, and governance with the systemic reform that have been tested and developed by the remaining eight SSIs. \r\n\r\n3. Conduct collaborative research on the elements within the generalized model of systemic reform in areas, such as equity, standards-based curricula, assessment, pedagogy, and leadership.\r\n\r\n4. Provide academic and technical assistance to national organizations, industries, businesses, and foundations investing in education to help them to understand and use a comprehensive systemic approach in improving student performance in science and mathematics.\r\n\r\n5. Provide academic and technical assistance to education systems that want to undertake systemic reform with emphasis on standards and on reaching a commitment to reach all students in their systems.\r\n\r\nIn coordination with the Eisenhower Regional Alliance of the Northeast and Islands, the eight SSI states propose to demonstrate the effectiveness of a systemic support network by collectively initiating the implementation of these recommendations.  The SSI states will serve as a Systemic Practices Resource Network to supply successful practices and tools to newly funded NSF grant recipients, resulting in a support collaborative consisting of mature systemic partners with empirical experience that can work with existing or new programs.",
