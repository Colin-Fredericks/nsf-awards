 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology - Cognitive (73)\r\n\r\nThe realm of the mind is mental processes: thinking is not an object, but an intricate activity carried out by the brain. Traditional educational vehicles (classroom lectures, books) cannot depict the dynamic character of human thought processes. Instead, they merely describe mental processes. Here we are developing modules for a new web site, Psychological Processes, that provide students with interactive demonstrations and experiments designed to reveal our current understanding of the dynamics of thinking. In this proof-of concept proposal, our goal is to develop two modules covering \"The Descriptive Mind\" and \"The Adaptive Mind.\"  Each module is being designed as a set of numerous Java programs that allow students to conduct experiments, interact with psychological models, and experience demonstrations about psychological processes.  From these experiences, we expect students to acquire a better understanding about how human thinking works, as well as a better appreciation for the role of experimentation in illuminating psychological processes.\r\n\r\nEach of the areas is based on a functional schema of human thinking designed to provide a unified framework that encompasses many seemingly distinct phenomena. The development process is based on staged deployment, with considerable beta testing using college undergraduates and gradual introduction into our existing Introductory Psychology course.  Evaluation of the modules will include a comparison of a traditional text-based treatment against the new form of presentation.  National distribution will occur initially through the web.  Instructors nationwide will have access to a mailing list that shares new developments, bug reports, comments, and invitations to participate in beta testing of new modules or provide comments about modules under development.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
