 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Proposer intends to work on a number of diophantine questions, with\r\nparticular emphasis on mixed polynomial-exponential type equations in\r\nseveral variables, and on Diophantine approximation in positive\r\ncharacteristic.  For polynomial-exponential equations, the goal will be\r\nto obtain bounds for the number of solutions, which are independent of\r\nthe coefficients of the equations.  As for approximation in fields of\r\npower series of positive characteristic, the aim will be to exhibit new\r\nclasses of algebraic series with explicit continued fraction expansions,\r\nand to obtain new information on \"Roth exponents\".  The Proposer\r\nfurther plans to address the question (connected with a former conjecture\r\nof Artin) of how many variables are needed to guarantee that a form of\r\ndegree  d  with p-adic coefficients has a nontrivial zero, and he is\r\ninterested in a certain question on polynomials with applications to\r\nSidon sequences.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of computers, and in modern cryptography, ``discrete''\r\nmathematical questions, in particular questions involving integers, have\r\nturned out to be of increasing importance.  The Proposer intends to\r\ncontinue his work on \"Diophantine equations\", i.e., to study integer\r\nsolutions of equations.  Whereas most work up to now has been on\r\npolynomial equations, the new project will also involve exponential\r\nequations, involving terms with ``exponentially fast'' growth.  There\r\nwill be applications to linear recurrence sequences, of which the best\r\nknown is the Fibonacci sequence, which occurs, e.g., as data relating to\r\nsome plants. The approximation of more complicated numbers by the more simple\r\n\"rational numbers\"  (i.e., ordinary fractions) is at the forefront of\r\nmuch current work.  For instance, how well can the number  \"pi\"  be\r\napproximated?  The Proposer intends to work on the analogous question, on\r\nhow well a more general function can be approximated by the simpler\r\nrational functions.  Again of particular interest here is the discrete\r\n(positive characteristic) case.",
