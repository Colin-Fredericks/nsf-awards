Such geologic events occur on a backdrop of local and global climatic conditions that may be linked to the drifting of continents into different latitudes.  Consequently, both tectonics and climate could exert significant influence on the composition of sediments that result from rifting processes.  In this regard, the composition of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks deposited during and subsequent to the fragmentation of a continent serve as a recording of not only evolving source rock compositions and positions relative to rift flanks, but also of the prevailing climatic conditions during the time of separation.  The proposed investigation endeavors to critically examine Neoproterozoic- and Cambrian-aged siliciclastic rocks in the southwestem United States that were deposited during, and in the wake of, the fragmentation of Rodinia.  A goal is to determine the relative significance of tectonics and climate in shaping the composition of the sediments.  This information, coupled with extant sedimentologic and stratigraphic data, will then be used to build a comprehensive data bank in which to decipher the early geologic history of this rifted continental margin, whose evolution is still in great debate.  Data collected in this study will be principally petrographic, geochemical, and isotopic, and aimed at tracking mineral and elemental abundances transferred from source rocks to sediments by considering chemical weathering and diagenetic processes.  The study will also focus on determining the whole-rock and detrital feldspar isotopic compositions (Sm-Nd, Pb/Pb), as well as single-crystal zircon U-Pb analyses, as mechanisms to identify specific source rocks and localities, and their relative abundances through time.\r\n\r\n",
