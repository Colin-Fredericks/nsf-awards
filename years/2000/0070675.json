In particular, the proposer will\r\nwork on  the invariant subspace problem for various classes of operators such\r\nas the Lomonosov-amenable operators, the sub-n-normal operators, the contractions\r\nwith spectral radius one, and the power bounded operators. These classes are more\r\ngeneral than some others in which the proposer has been instrumental in the solution\r\nof the invariant subspace problem.\r\n    Operators on Hilbert space may be thought of as the natural generalization of\r\nfinite complex matrices, and such matrices play an important role presently in\r\nthe solution of many problems in the real world such as signal processing, populationstudies, various types of optimization procedures, etc. But the natural mathematical\r\nsetting in which to cast certain problems in computing, quantum physics, nuclear\r\nfuel processing, etc. is in the more general setting of operators on Hilbert space.\r\nAnd there is ample evidence to show that knowledge about such operators, obtained\r\nfrom a purely mathematical investigation, very frequently is useful in resolving\r\nreal-world problems of the sort mentioned above. This project aims to increase\r\nsuch basic knowledge about operators.\r\n\r\n",
