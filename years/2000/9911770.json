The program will prepare participants to integrate inquiry-based science pedagogy and web-based information technologies into daily practices.  The project will also deepen understanding of online learning models and strategies for professional development.\r\n\r\nThe 33-credit hour program will be comprised of six-credit hour modules and an introductory three-credit hour course entitled \"Try Science.\"  Participants will do one module of work each college term, thus completing the program in two years.  Each module will have two instructors who together will bring science and pedagogy expertise to learners.  Participants will conduct real-world investigations, which will be facilitated through on-line instruction.  This approach will open the course to those from areas without convenient access to university campuses.  \r\n\r\nWith increasingly common technologies-Internet connectivity, a web browser and CD-ROM-learning will be accessible in teachers' homes or schools in asynchronous time, allowing teachers to better balance personal commitments and professional growth.  \r\n\r\nApproximately 25 participants will move through the master's degree program together.  In addition, within the project time frame, it is anticipated that a minimum of 500 teachers will receive 90-135 hours of professional development.\r\n\r\nThe request is for $2,447,668.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
