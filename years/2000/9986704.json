 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores the synthesis and properties of sterol-based ionophores.  A series of conjugates is proposed which will be used to test several hypotheses, including the efficacy of long polyether moieties in thick membranes and the possibility of matching the sterol moiety to a particular membrane-bound sterol composition.  The long-range goal of this program is to generate lead compounds for a new class of antibiotics by rational design.  In the undergraduate teaching lab, experiments will be carried out involving the characterization of a new class of cross-linked polystyrene resins, which are expected to bond bile acids via covalent attachments under physiological conditions.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues to support the research and teaching activities of Professor Steven L. Regen of Lehigh University.  Professor Regen's research efforts center on the design of molecules that act in cell membranes in ways that are similar to several important antibiotics.  The molecules that are being designed will aid in understanding how these antiobiotics work, and may result in new antibiotics for clinical use.  In addition, Professor Regen has designed an undergraduate organic laboratory curriculum whereby students participate in experiments studying a type of cholesterol-binding polymer.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
