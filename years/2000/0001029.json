 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adrian Lenardic \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA continental craton is a region that has remained tectonically stable for on \r\nthe order of a billion years. Many cratons are also associated with thick \r\nlithosphere that has been isolated from mantle recycling for an equally long \r\nperiod of time. Understanding the factors that provide for the stability of \r\ncratons and for the longevity of deep cratonic lithosphere are related issues \r\nthat bridge the gap between studies of continental tectonics and of mantle \r\ndynamics. To address these issues, the investigators will constrain the present day \r\nthermo-chemical structure and explore the thermo-tectonic evolution of the \r\ncrust and mantle lithosphere below several cratons. They will work with \r\ncollaborators from Montreal and Australia to collect and compile data \r\nconstraints for thermal models of the cratonic lithosphere in the Canadian \r\nShield and in Western Australia. They will then develop data constrained models \r\nfor the present day thermo-chemical structure of cratonic lithosphere within \r\nthese regions. The heat that comes from the convecting mantle will be treated in \r\na fully self-consistent way and both vertical and lateral \r\nvariations in lithospheric structure will be explored. The researchers will also work directly with data oriented colleagues to collect, analyse, and synthesize all the data that can constrain the evolution of target cratons. They will then explore models of \r\ncoupled mantle convection and continental tectonics to isolate the factors that \r\nallow for the longevity of deep cratonic lithosphere and the stability of \r\ncratonic crust. This will be accomplished using a powerful new numerical \r\nsimulation tool that has been designed to bridge the gap between mantle \r\nconvection modeling and continental tectonics modeling. The advanced modeling \r\nmethodology, together with the data that will be brought to bear on the problem at \r\nhand, will allow this team to develop rigorous and testable models that address the \r\ncratonization of continental crust and the longevity of cratonic lithosphere in \r\na self-consistent manner. \r\n\r\n",
