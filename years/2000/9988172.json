Prompted by its successes in the hardware industry,\r\nmodel-checking techniques have been developed for analyzing requirements of\r\ndistributed and embedded systems that go beyond classical safety and liveness\r\nproperties.  These richer requirements include game properties, timing\r\nproperties, and probabilistic properties.  All three classes of properties\r\nhave in common that the underlying system model is no longer the Kripke\r\nstructure, but a structure equipped with multiple players (the game graph),\r\nwith clocks (the timed automaton), or with probabilities (the Markov decision\r\nprocess).  While these three structures are reasonably well-understood, and\r\ncorresponding model-checking tools have been implemented, any combination of\r\nthe three features --games, time, and probabilities-- gives rise to genuinely\r\nnew phenomena.\r\n\r\nFirst, consider the combination of games and probabilities.  The resulting\r\nmodel of a system is the concurrent game, where the players choose, in each\r\nconfiguration, their moves simultaneously, independently, and possibly at\r\nrandom.  We develop algorithms for solving concurrent games, in order to\r\nimprove the compositional (divide-and-conquer) approach to model checking.\r\nFor example, game-theoretic methods facilitate the early detection of error\r\nscenarios, and the automatic synthesis of environment assumptions for system\r\ncomponents.  Second, consider the combination of games and time.  The\r\nresulting model of a system is the timed game, where the players choose, in\r\neach configuration, their moves together with delays that indicate when the\r\nmoves are played.  We develop algorithms for solving timed games in order to\r\nprovide a method for synthesizing software controllers of physical plants.\r\nThird, consider the combination of time and probabilities.  The resulting\r\nmodel of a system is the timed probabilistic system, where in each state,\r\nevery enabled action has associated with it both a probability distribution\r\nover successor states and an expected delay before the state transition\r\noccurs.  Timed probabilistic systems permit the analysis of performance and\r\nreliability properties.  We develop a temporal-logic framework for\r\nclassifying performance properties and practical (iterative) algorithms for\r\ntheir analysis.  Finally, the combination of games, time, and probabilities\r\nresults in timed concurrent games.  We study define and these systems in\r\norder to facilitate the compositional analysis of real-time systems and the\r\nautomatic synthesis of randomized controllers.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms developed in this project are implemented in the\r\nmodel-checking environment Mocha and applied to case studies from\r\ncomponent-based design (compositional model checking), embedded systems\r\n(controller synthesis), and network protocols (performance evaluation).",
