 "awd_abstract_narration": "9985004\r\nHagness\r\n\r\nPhotonic microstructures may enable the development of high-density\r\nphotonic integrated circuits with unprecedented optical information\r\nprocessing capabilities.  Their success critically depends upon the\r\navailability of accurate and efficient modeling techniques to understand\r\nand exploit the novel effects that emerge as the dimensions of optical\r\ndevices are reduced to the length-scale of the optical wavelength.  The\r\nprimary objective of the proposed research plan is to develop advanced\r\nfirst-principles simulation tools based on the finite-difference\r\ntime-domain method for modeling electromagnetic wave propagation in\r\nphotonic microstructures.  These tools will be used to investigate\r\ndispersive and nonlinear effects in photonic crystals and antiguiding\r\nstructures in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.  The computational\r\nmodels will be experimentally validated through collaborative work at the\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin and at the Hewlett-Packard Laboratories.  The\r\nprimary objective of the proposed educational plan is to enhance\r\nelectromagnetics education through the use of innovative teaching\r\napproaches in two core undergraduate electromagnetics courses and the\r\ndevelopment of a graduate-level course on methods in computational\r\nelectromagnetics.  Web-based lectures will be developed and assessed for\r\nstudent use outside the classroom so that more time in-class may be used\r\nfor potentially higher value-added experiential activities.   Numerical\r\nmethods will be incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate-level\r\ncourses.\r\n***",
