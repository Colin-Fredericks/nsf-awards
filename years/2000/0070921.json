 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  project  is   devoted  to  the  following  topics  of noncommutative  geometry:  a)  Theory  of D-modules  and  differential operators  on noncommutative  locally affine  spaces and  schemes.  b) Noncommutative  local algebra and  its applications  to representation theory  of  quantum  enveloping   algebras  and  related  algebras  of mathematical physics.  c)  Noncommutative smooth locally affine spaces and  related  structures.   Main  purposes of  the  project:  Studying D-modules  on noncommutative  spaces,  in particular  on quantum  flag varieties and noncommutative smooth spaces.  Developing an analogue of the  crystallin approach to  D-modules in  the case  of noncommutative spaces  and  schemes.   Combining   methods  of  D-module  theory  and noncommutative local  algebra, study the  spectrum and representations of  quantum  enveloping  algebras  and  other  important  algebras  of mathematical physics.   Studying properties and  important examples of noncommutative smooth  spaces and their  applications.  Results should have  impacts  on  noncommutative  geometry,  noncommutative  algebra,\r\nrepresentation  theory, deformation  theory and  some other  topics of\r\nmathematical physics.\r\n\r\nNoncommutative geometry is a relatively new field of mathematics which is now becoming one of important tools, or ruther ways of thinking, in many areas of  mathematics and theoretical physics. It  takes roots in quantum mechanics and representation  theory. But the main motivations come from recent amazing developments in mathematical physics (quantum groups  and  related quantized  'spaces')  and  from  physics. In the recently proposed M-theory (which  is nowadays regarded as a candidate for the  theory describing all  interactions existing in  the Nature), the geometry of physical  space-time is noncommutative. A considerable part  of the  project, the  one concerned  with  smooth noncommutative spaces (which the investigator  studies together with M.  Kontsevich), is naturally related to  M-theory on curved spaces.  The inverstigator and  his collegues  expect  that  the language  and  new intuition  of noncommutative spaces will be used not only in 'pure' mathematics, but also in modern physical theories.",
