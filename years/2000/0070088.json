 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the investigation of effective and cost-efficient methods to reduce the levels of cutting fluid mist present in machining environments.  Experimental and analytical efforts will result in the development of a mist baseline, and a computational model to predict the mist motion.  The mist baseline, derived from experimental data, will contain detailed information concerning the mass concentration and partial size spatial distribution of the mist over time.  The computational fluid dynamics code, including a coagulation model, will be capable of simulating laminar or turbulent multi-phase flows by using a combined Lagranian/Eulerian method to explicitly track the fluid mist in the air.  Using these tools, an investigation of the utilization of kinematic coagulation, the capture of mist particles through the introduction of a spray of larger cutting fluid droplets into the machining environment, will be performed.  Experiments will be conducted to validate the developed analytical coagulation model and to investigate the performance of the kinematic coagulation system based on its environmental and health impact.  Cost analysis for the implementation of this system will be performed and compared to systems currently in use.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will result in the development of new strategies that will substantially reduce or eliminate the airborne mist present in current machining environments.  This will be accomplished, in part, by using the mist baseline to identify the most hazardous machining process conditions.  More importantly, implementation of the proposed analytical work will lead to the development of cutting fluid mist removal systems that are cost-efficient, provide healthier industrial environments, and serve as solutions to the air quality problem until such time as other processes, such as dry machining, are feasible and can be affordably implemented by all industries.  The final result will be a significant reduction in the acute and chronic effects of mist on workers.  \r\n\r\n",
