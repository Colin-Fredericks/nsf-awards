 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility a rapid, low-cost method of manufacturing continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic composites (CFCCs). CFCCs are a class of material whose tremendous market potential has been thwarted by their excessive cost, resulting from the current, inefficient manufacturing methods.  Thor Technologies, Incorporated will team with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to integrate three technologies into a single efficient manufacturing process:  (1) preceramic polymers; (2) high frequency microwave (HFMW) radiation;  and (3) polymer infiltration/pyrolysis (PIP) processing.  The HFMW-PIP process will produce CFCCs in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of current methods.  Preliminary studies have mitigated the technical risk, and the potential for greatly enhanced productivity over current methods mitigates commercialization risk.  The proposed effort will characterize the effects of HFMW radiation on the materials, will demonstrate process feasibility by manufacturing and testing coupons and simple shapes (tubes), and will assess the productivity and economic potential of the process.  The Proposed PI has substantial experience with preceramic polymers and the PIP process, while our collaborators at LANL have extensive experience with HFMW heating. Thor Technologies has the managerial and financial resources to develop the process to full-scale production.  A wide variety of industries, ranging from aerospace to the petroleum and chemical processing industry, would benefit from the availability of low cost materials that are stable under hot, oxidizing conditions, do not corrode, and weigh less than metals yet are strong and tough.  Although their price has relegated CFCCs to small, niche market to-date, reducing their cost to the point at which they compete with metals, such as intermetallics and superalloys, will open substantial new markets.  Applications in transportation and energy will result in increased productivity and a cleaner environment for the nation.\r\n",
