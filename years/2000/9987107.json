 "awd_abstract_narration": "WThis scholarship program is providing support to 25 undergraduate students enrolled in the fields of Computer Science, Mathematics and Management and Information Systems. In addition to the scholarships, the institution is providing tutoring, mentoring and counseling to the participants in order to strengthen student retention and to ensure graduation within the program's time constraints. Students are selected for the program based on their financial status, their current grade point average and their leadership abilities. Since nearly 25 percent of the institution's enrollment is American Indian the scholarship program is also helping to address the underrepresentation of minority populations in science and engineering fields. Recruitment takes place through advertisements in local and area newspapers and radio and cable television stations, brochures and announcements at local and area junior colleges and in tribal newspapers and events. Students are required to have completed a minimum of fifty hours of undergraduate credit and to have gained acceptance into the Mathematics, Computer Science or Management and Information Systems programs. \r\n",
