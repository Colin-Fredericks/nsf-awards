 "awd_abstract_narration": "9981978\r\nMcWilliams\r\n\r\nThis award supports a 3-year collaborative research between Dr. Roger McWilliams, University of California, Irvine and Professor Hong-Young Chang at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).   The proposed collaboration aims to exchange ideas on plasma sources and diagnostics between U.S. and Korean plasma physicists and to develop next generation plasma sources.\r\n\r\nCollaborative experiments at the University of California, Irvine and KAIST will work to characterize and develop next generation plasma sources.  Plasma processing and basic physics laboratory plasmas are increasingly reliant on larger diameter plasma sources.  The ion and electron distributions created by these sources are central to their usefulness, for either industry or basic science studies.  Professor Chang's group in the Physics Department at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has extensive experience with electron diagnostics and particularly close connections with next generation plasma sources needed and planned for semiconductor industry use.  Professor McWilliams' group in the Physics Department at the University of California, Irvine has extensive experience with ion diagnostics and has developed many plasma sources for basic plasma science use.  The two groups wish to collaborate to merge diagnostic and plasma source capabilities to benefit plasma processing and basic plasma science.\r\n\r\nThis project will be performed in conjunction with Professor Chang's group at Korea under the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program.   By personnel visits to both laboratories, the full complement of next generation plasma sources and diagnostics will be used together swiftly for technological and scientific advance.  Additionally, people at both labs will be trained in the experimental expertise of the other lab, thereby expanding each laboratory's capabilities by the end of the collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\r\n***\r\n",
