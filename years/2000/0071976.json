The research is to propose finite sample performance\r\ncriteria of multivariate location and scatter estimators based on \r\ntheir ``tail behavior'', to investigate and assess the performance \r\nof existing and new multivariate location and scatter estimators \r\nwith respect to the proposed criteria, and to provide guides to \r\nstatistical practices in applications. \r\n \r\nGiven an estimator of some unknown parameter, a natural question\r\nis -- how good is the estimator? or how should one measure its \r\nperformance? These questions are fundamental in statistical \r\nestimation and inference. To answer these questions, various \r\nperformance criteria have been proposed and studied. Among the \r\nexisting performance criteria, asymptotic approaches including \r\nFisher consistency and large sample normality are the most prevalent \r\nones. These approaches have been based on the behavior of the \r\nestimator as the sample size approaches infinity. This, however, \r\nraises some serious concern about the relevancy of the asymptotic \r\nresults in practice, where the sample size is always fixed and \r\nfinite. The study of the finite sample performance of multivariate \r\nlocation and scatter estimators thus is not only practically \r\nsignificant but also theoretically interesting. In sharp contrast \r\nwith the asymptotic approaches, in this research the performance \r\nof multivariate location and scatter estimators is studied for \r\nfixed and finite sample size.   \r\n\r\nThe research develops new methodology and valuable insights \r\ninto the comparison of estimator performance particularly from \r\nrobustness standpoint. Inherent connections of our finite sample \r\nperformance measures with two most crucial and promising notions \r\nin the robust and nonparametric statistical analysis and inference, \r\nthe finite sample breakdown point and the data depth (especially\r\nTukey-Donoho halfspace depth), are to be explored and illuminated. \r\nIt is to be shown that the estimators with high breakdown point or \r\nhalfspace depth possess remarkable finite sample tail performance. \r\nFindings like this in the research offer new insights into and deepen \r\nour understanding of the notions of breakdown point and halfspace depth, \r\nand establish the important role of the finite sample tail behavior as a \r\nquantitative assessment of robustness of estimators. The research has \r\nprofound impact on statistical applications in various disciplines of \r\nsciences such as social, behavior and life sciences, environmental and \r\nbiology sciences, industry, and economics. The research suggests, \r\nfor example, that location estimators with appealing tail performance \r\n(e.g. depth-based multivariate medians) should be preferred in practice\r\nto traditional least-squares estimators (e.g. the multivariate mean) \r\nfor robustness against the influence of extremities of observations in \r\nmultivariate data analysis. The research also benefits education through \r\nthe training of graduate students and the incorporation of the developed \r\nmethodology in statistics courses.\r\n",
