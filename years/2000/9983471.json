 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will involve the experimental study of a novel millimeter-wave source (MWS) that will provide short-wavelength radiation for numerous civilian and military applications. The MWS is based on novel synchronous interactions between a pencil electron beam and rotating wave fields. Our Phase I studies confirm that the MWS will offer order of magnitude improvements in the overall size and weight when compared to conventional millimeter-wave sources which will make these new devices less complex, more affordable, and readily available for a diversity of applications. Some of the applications for these devices include high-resolution radar, satellite telecommunications systems, power beaming, and electron cyclotron resonance heating of fusion plasmas. Also, due to the fact that the MWS does not require a focusing magnetic field, it should be suitable for airborne and mobile applications, as well as other commercial applications where size, weight, and efficiency are critical. Detailed experimental analysis of this concept is proposed during Phase II in order to evaluate key issues such as beam transport, maximum output power, efficiency and gain. \r\n\r\nOnce successfully developed, the MWS will be the basis for a new generation of millimeter-wave sources capable of producing high-power ultrahigh frequency radiation with high efficiency in a very compact and lightweight package.\r\n",
