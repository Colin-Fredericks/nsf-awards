An interdisciplinary nucleus of faculty and students interested in molecular microbial ecology has developed here, with representatives from the Department of Biology, the Center for the Management, Utilization and Protection of Water Resources, and the Department of Civil Engineering engaged in funded research in the area of microbial ecology. The research activities have grown beyond a level which can be supported by our manual sequencing facilities.\r\n\r\nThe research projects that would immediately employ an automated sequencer include an rRNA-based survey of the distribution of parasitic dinoflagellates in Chesapeake Bay, the analysis of protistan food vacuole contents, the determination of the identity of prokaryotic symbionts of termite flagellates, the screening of natural and man-made habitats for the presence of\r\nLegionella-like amoebal pathogens, and the determination of the effects of pesticides on prokaryotic communities living in constructed wetlands. Although microbial ecologists would be the primary users of the machine, other faculty members would also use an automated sequencer if one were available.\r\n\r\nAn automated DNA sequencer would facilitate the ongoing research of faculty members at TTU, help provide necessary infrastructural support to a new Ph.D. program in environmental sciences, and allow both graduate and undergraduate students to be involved in DNA sequencing projects. It's presence would also eliminate the risk and inconvenience of radioisotope use.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
