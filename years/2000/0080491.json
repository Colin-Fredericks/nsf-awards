They plan to apply the constrained Hartree-Fock method to predict the properties of multi-hyperon nuclei at normal and above-normal densities accessible to relativistic heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\nScope:  The Applied Science University (ASU) of Jordan, the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and the International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics (IITAP) at Iowa State University, each have unique and complementary strengths needed to achieve the stated objective. Students from Iowa State University and the Applied Science University will participate and benefit from this collaborative project.  A key element of the plan to efficiently carry out this research project is to develop and operate a \"virtual laboratory\" over digital networks to exchange research notes, figures and tables, perform calculations, discuss results and draft papers for publications.  This proposal meets the INT objective of encouraging collaboration by US and foreign scientists in areas of mutual benefit.",
