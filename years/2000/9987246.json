 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle objective of the project is to extend access to computer science, engineering and mathematics programs to low-income, but academically talented students, as well as to increase their retention to degree.  The proposed project builds upon existing efforts at the university to achieve similar goals, particularly for women and minority students. \r\n\r\nThe project includes the following key activities: Award of forty scholarships to high-achieving but financially needy juniors, seniors and graduate students enrolled in computer science, engineering, and mathematics degree programs; Participation by each scholarship recipient in fifty hours of supervised work experience (mini-internship) in an active research laboratory or extension center relevant to their degree area and personal interests; Participation of each recipient in their second year as a mentor to younger students; Special emphasis on increasing the retention of women and Native American students in computer science, engineering, and mathematics degrees; and Assessment of individual and program success in achieving project goals.\r\n\r\nThe sponsoring university is in a unique position within the northern Rocky Mountain and northern plains states to offer such a program.  Both the academic qualifications and financial need of its student population is high.  Furthermore, there is no other single campus in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, or the Dakotas that offers comprehensive (B.S. through Ph.D.) degrees in computer science, engineering and mathematics, as well as the B.S. and M.S. degrees in engineering technology.  Together with the other successful support programs already in place at the university, the activities proposed can achieve the project's objectives.\r\n",
