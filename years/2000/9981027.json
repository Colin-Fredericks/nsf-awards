The course is also serving as an elective for computer science students. The course aims at teaching students, using a top down approach, the design methodology by which the MC could be used as a tool to solve practical and important engineering monitoring and control problems. Hence, the course originates with a real world monitoring and control application that serves as a focal point and a case study for the entire course. This application is used as a vehicle to learn about important MC functions, programming techniques, and interfacing of various devices while providing students the opportunity to integrate this knowledge into a meaningful control design experience. In developing this course, the PI is relying heavily on a course developed by another NSF funded PI at the University of California at Berkeley 'Microprocessor Control of Mechatronic Systems'. This course is based on the same top down approach at Berkeley however,  it takes a complementary approach. Whereas the course in Berkeley is concerned with control systems in a broad sense and handling complex control problems using off-the shelf hardware and software modules.  This project aims to give students a deeper, more focused experience with the MC within the context of a fairly complex control problem. Developing expertise in MCs is crucial for biological and agricultural engineers since several instruments in their fields are becoming increasingly complex with multiple MCs embedded in them. This course is bringing together teams of students and faculty with diverse backgrounds. Approximately 100 students a year will benefit from this course/laboratory.\r\n",
