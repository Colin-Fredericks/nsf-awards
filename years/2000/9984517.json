 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ever-decreasing scale of electronic and micro-electro-mechanical devices\r\n(MEMS) indicate that material properties are needed in regimes which material\r\nlength-scale effects cannot be ignored.  As industry looks towards polymers\r\nand new soldering alloys, temperature-dependence and creep behavior is of\r\nprimary concern.  This program will perform novel rate- and\r\ntemperate-dependent experiments on length-scales ranging from the sub-micron\r\nto macroscopic, and detailed mechanical modeling to establish the link between\r\nmicro-tests and material properties.  At the core of this integrated research\r\nand education plan is the development of novel test procedures that will be\r\nimplemented into an existing nano-indentation facility.  These micro-bend and\r\nmicro-torsion tests will be developed within existing senior design and\r\naccelerated master's degree programs.  These projects will expose students to\r\nthe challenges of cutting-edge product development and research, and provide\r\nthem with considerable technical skills not typically found in an\r\nundergraduate program.\r\n\r\n",
