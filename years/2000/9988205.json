 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimization problems arise in all areas of science, engineering, and industry.  They\r\ninvolve choosing variables to satisfy certain constraints while minimizing an objective\r\nfunction such as cost or weight.  Large problems may have many thousands of variables\r\nand constraints, but they are usually sparse in some way.  For example, each constraint\r\nmay involve only a few of the variables.\r\n\r\nThis proposal describes a 3-year program of research to develop new computational \r\nmethods for solving large real-world optimization problems.  The design of algorithms\r\nto exploit sparsity is the main focus of our research.\r\n\r\nOur large-scale solver SNPOT already represents a major advance.   Its Sequential\r\nQuadratic Programmin (SQP) algorithm is efficient on large problems if the number\r\nof degrees of freedom is moderate (i.e., the number of binding constraints is nearly\r\nas large as the number of variables).  Many important applications are of this\r\nkind - for example trajectory optimization for spacecraft and aircraft.  However,\r\nsucces on such problems inevitably generates the demand to solve larger problems.\r\n\r\nWe must develop a new sparse QP solver (the heart of an SQP algorithm).  Other\r\nadvances are proposed to improve SNOPT's performance on problems whose nonlinear\r\nfunctions are cheap to evaluate.  This includes a vast array of applications generated\r\nby the algebraic modeling systems GAMS and AMPL.\r\n\r\nA key aim of this project is tranferring results to the scientific and industrial\r\ncommunity by developing mathematical software.",
