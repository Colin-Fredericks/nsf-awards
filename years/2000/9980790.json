 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThis project combines efforts to enhance student learning and collaboration with the new technology of handheld computers. This combination enhances the student's ability to learn both inside and outside of the classroom and laboratory environments, to better collaborate with other students, and to more easily and effectively communicate with the instructor. The project is being implemented after extensive planning and research into ways to combine the new handheld computer technologies with new programming languages and pedagogical strategies made possible by the portability of the low cost equipment. \r\n\r\nThe project prototypes tools to enhance the learning environment and to leverage technology across the computer science curriculum. Students and faculty are equipped with handheld computing devices used to enhance the computer organization and assembly language programming course as a proof-of-concept for use in other computer science courses. Student progress is being assessed by surveys, interviews, and mastery of the material. \r\n\r\nOutcomes from the project include a body of research and information to support learning enhancement using handheld computing devices, a set of concrete educational tools and lessons to leverage the use of these devices in the context of computer science curriculum, and a specific example of implementation in the computer organization course. The results are being disseminated through a series of papers and national and regional conference presentations. The tools, lessons, and lab exercises are being made available over the internet. If the projects succeeds with the successful implementation in a single course, a plan will be developed for implementation of the use of handheld computing devices across the other courses in the computer science curriculum to be tested at other institutions.\r\n",
