 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project comprises a career development plan of integrated educational and research activities.  The research project is aimed at finding ligands or \"caps\" for exposed Watson-Crick-paired bases at the termini of oligonucleotide duplexes.  They are expected to enhance mismatch discrimination by creating a molecular environment that mimics the interior of duplexes.  The project will involve the synthesis of 3'- and 5'-amino terminal nucleotides and their incorporation into duplexes.  Physical characterization of the anticipated effects will be made using spectrometrically monitored selection experiments, mismatch binding studies, and NMR experiments.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program supports the research and educational activities of Professor Clemens Richert of Tufts University.   Professor Richert's research activities are directed toward an understanding of ways to make DNA strand pairs more robust, so that their use in laboratory experiments can be carried out under a greater variety of conditions and with greater efficiency.  The project incorporates educational activities that are designed to bring discussions of scientific ethics into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum and, on the graduate level, to introduce students to the new science of combinatorial chemistry.\r\n",
