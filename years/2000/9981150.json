 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) This proposal addresses the need to increase our understanding of the relationships between Web-based learning, the development of higher-order skills, and an understanding of the nature of science among students enrolled in introductory Earth science classes.  We hypothesize that Web-Based Learning (WBL) is most effective in supporting the development of higher-order skills in learners when WBL modules employ learner manipulation of data, the development and testing of conceptual models based on available evidence, learner exposure to authentic, complex and ill-constrained problems; and contain explicit instruction in cognitive and metacognitive strategies.  The project objectives include (1) the design of two interactive, intelligent, database-driven WBL modules based on problem-based learning and explicit instruction in cognitive and metacognitive strategies, (2) the implementation of the WBL modules in introductory Earth science classes, and (3) the evaluation of the efficacy of WBL to support the development of higher order skills in learners and increase student understanding of the nature of science.\r\nBoth modules ask students to pose hypotheses, acquire, organize, and analyze Earth science data and model results, and solve authentic, ill-constrained problems.  Design elements incorporated within the modules help students with the exercises.  These elements include web-based concept mapping software to develop cognitive and metacognitive skills and intelligent tutor systems that individualizes instruction.  The first module has students explore the interactions of seismic waves with typical Earth structures and how these waves have been used to develop models for the internal structure of the Earth.  Exercises are organized around student manipulation of simulations of seismic waves behavior in various models of Earth structures.  Finally, students are also introduced to the global networks of seismic stations that form the basis for modern data acquisition.  The second module has students explore the relationships between geology, human activities, and water quality in the South Platte River of Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska.  In this module, students are asked to organize and interpret USGS water quality observations within the watershed based upon maps of geology and land-use.  The modules are evaluated using qualitative and quantitative techniques, including the analysis and review of (1) online student surveys, (2) student progress through the modules using server logs, (3) student portfolios that include answers to problem sets and metacognitive exercises, and (4) student responses collected in small focus groups of students interviewed after completion of the modules. Dissemination of the modules developed in this Proof of Concept project is through the Internet.",
