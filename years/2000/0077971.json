ATP driven protein motors\r\nplay a central role in many cell functions.  For example, kinesin\r\ndrives intracellular vesicle transportation and moves chromosomes\r\nduring mitosis; myosin drives muscle contraction, and the\r\nV-ATPases regulate intracellular acidity.  Understanding the\r\noperating principles of the ATP driven motors is crucial to\r\ncomprehending intracellular protein transport and cell motility.\r\nStructural studies are providing the atomic details of motor\r\nproteins, and are revealing more information about the\r\nconformational changes associated with the chemical reactions\r\nthey catalyze.  Current experimental technologies permit measuring\r\nforces of a single protein motor with piconewton precision and\r\nmotions with nanometer resolution.  These advances, along with\r\nadvances in mathematical modeling and computer power, make it\r\npossible to explore the mechanochemical energy transduction in\r\nmolecular motors in unprecedented detail.  In this project, the\r\ninvestigator and colleagues pursue the mathematical and physical\r\nissues that arose in the previous studies of F1 ATPase.  These\r\nconcern the molecular details of how protein motors should be\r\nmodeled and what mathematical formulations are adequate for\r\nmodeling them.  In particular, the study focuses on the mechanism\r\nof force generation at the catalytic site during the ATP\r\nhydrolysis cycle.  Resolution of this key process will illuminate\r\nthe operating principles of this ATP driven motor, and likely\r\nother protein motors as well.  To accommodate more sophisticated\r\nmodeling, the investigator develops methods for analyzing protein\r\nstructures and solving complex model equations.  The results of\r\nthese studies set the stage for modeling the mechanochemical\r\nenergy transduction in myosin and kinesin dimers.  The approach is\r\nto model the continuous stochastic motion of the motor using\r\nstochastic differential equations and couple these to the\r\nchemical reactions described by discrete Markov processes.  The\r\nmodel equations are constructed from basic physical principles,\r\nstructural data, and biochemical and biophysical measurements.\r\nThese equations are then analyzed numerically.  The hope is that\r\nthis will lead to a unified view of ATP driven motors.\r\n     To facilitate the fast growing field of biotechnology, it is\r\nnecessary to deduce concise mechanisms for biological systems\r\nfrom experimental results.  This requires the application of\r\nfundamental principles from the mathematical and physical\r\nsciences.  The purpose of this interdisciplinary project is to\r\nstudy the mechanisms by which proteins use chemical energy to\r\ngenerate mechanical forces.  In turn, these forces drive a wide\r\nvariety of cellular processes essential to life.  In all living\r\ncells, the universal chemical energy molecule is ATP (adenosine\r\ntriphosphate).  ATP is produced using the energy extracted from\r\nfood, and the life of every cell depends on processes that are\r\npowered by ATP.  For example, muscle contraction is directly\r\ndriven by the ATP protein motor myosin.  Therefore, understanding\r\nthe operating principles of the ATP protein motors is central to\r\ncomprehending the life of cells.\r\n",
