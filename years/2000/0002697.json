 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pleasant View Farm Complex (PVFC) has been a major center for research and information exchange for the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study, a long-term ecosystem and biogeographical study of a northern hardwood forest and its associated aquatic ecosystems.  The study focuses on large-scale phenomena such as precipitation chemistry, on regional-scale phenomena such as forestry practices, and on demographic shifts in ecologically sensitive populations.  The National Science Foundation and the United States Forest Service have supported the study since its inception in 1963. \r\n\r\nThis award for institutional planning support a series of workshops involving academic researchers, Forest Service staff, and facilities experts.  The objective of these workshops will be (1) to assess facility needs at the Pleasant View Farm Complex (in the context of strategic planning of science and research), (2) to evaluate facilities options, and (3) to develop an integrated facilities plan.  The institutional planning effort will result in clearly defined facilities program goals, site plans, schematics and construction budgeting information.  The award also includes a small amount of funds to assist with emergency repairs to the existing buildings to insure that safe working conditions are provided in the interim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
