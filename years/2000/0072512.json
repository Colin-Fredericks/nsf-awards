 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0072512\r\nDusa McDuff\r\n\r\nMcDuff will continue studying the structure of symplectic \r\nmanifolds and of the group G(M) of diffeomorphisms that \r\npreserve the symplectic structure on a given manifold M. \r\nWorking together with Francois Lalonde, she recently \r\ndiscovered that these diffeomorphisms do not twist the \r\nmanifold topologically very much. Indeed, using ideas \r\nfrom quantum homology, they have shown that the homotopy \r\ngroups of the Hamiltonian subgroup H of G(M) act trivially \r\non the rational homology of the underlying manifold M.  The\r\nconjecture is that any fiber bundle with structural group\r\nH  is a product as far as its rational cohomology is concerned.  \r\nShe also plans to study other topological implications of the\r\nexistence of quantum homology, in particular its consequences \r\nfor the Flux conjecture. \r\n\r\nA  symplectic structure is a very basic structure on space \r\nthat underlies the equations of classical physics.   They \r\nhave become very prominent recently because of their \r\nappearance in modern theories of duality, especially in \r\nthe \"mirror symmetry\" phenomena of high energy physics.  Mathematically, they are very interesting and help in \r\nunderstanding 4 dimensional spaces (curved space-times).   \r\nRecently McDuff has focussed her attention on studying \r\nthe different ways that the points of a space can\r\nmove while still preserving this structure.  Working with \r\na collaborator, she has found that some ideas coming from \r\nstring theory (known in the field as \"quantum homology\") \r\nshow that spaces with symplectic structures are much more \r\nrigid than ones without, and cannot be moved and twisted up\r\nvery much.  She intends to pursue this line of questioning \r\nduring the period of the grant.  Many very interesting \r\nsymplectic rigidity phenomena have been discovered, but \r\nthere are still plenty of open questions.\r\n",
