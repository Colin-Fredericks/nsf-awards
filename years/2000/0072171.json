He will \r\nalso continue his study on Courant algebroids and Dirac \r\nstructures from the viewpoint of  Dirac generating operators,\r\nas applied to objects in  Poisson geometry  such as moment \r\nmaps and equivariant cohomology.  This project also involves \r\nthe study of deformation quantization, in particular on quantum groupoids.  More specifically, it includes the  study of universal enveloping algebras of Courant algebroids, Kontsevich's formality\r\ntype conjecture for Lie algebroids, and cohomology theory of deformation of Hopf algebroids, all  of which are components in quantization of Lie bialgebroids.  An important  application is to study quantization of  classical dynamical r-matrices.\r\n\r\nPoisson geometry is largely motivated by physics, which is\r\nin fact a mathematical tool used to give a theoretical framework \r\nencompassing large parts of classical mechanics. Quantization\r\nis developed  in order to gain a better understanding between\r\nclassical mechanics and quantum mechanics. At present, Poisson \r\ngeometry finds various applications including control theory, \r\nmachining automation and robotic manipulation.\r\n\r\n",
