For example, the ACL2 theorem prover has been used by Advanced\r\nMicro Devices, Inc., to find bugs in the AMD-K7 TM floating-point hardware, bugs\r\nthat had escaped over 80 million test vectors. Theorem provers also enable symbolic\r\nsimulation of new designs from formal specifications  and security analysis of\r\ndevices for use in e-commerce (see below). Such applications represent the practical\r\nemergence of applied symbolic logic.\r\n\r\nFormal logic is the mathematical tool of choice for modeling computing\r\nsystems, in exactly the same sense that differential equations are the tool of\r\nchoice for modeling physical systems. While study of logic is well established, the\r\napplication of logic is new, because until the invention of the digital computer,\r\nengineered artifacts were essentially mechanical. The semiconductor industry is now\r\nturning to logic-based mechanized tools because models of modern processors are too\r\ncomplex to analyze any other way; and that complexity cannot be eliminated because\r\nit is used to buy speed and speed provides the competitive edge. \r\n\r\nThe semi-automatic theorem provers that make such analysis possible are industrial-\r\nstrength symbol manipulation engines. These engines process symbolic data\r\nrepresenting logical formulas. Intermediate formulas may consume megabytes of\r\nstorage. The engines explore vast search spaces determined by thousands of\r\ndefinitions and theorems in data bases created by various design team members.\r\nProofs may contain millions of primitive inference steps. The engines use decision\r\nprocedures where feasible and are otherwise guided both by heuristics and the human\r\nuser.\r\n\r\nDue to the computational intensity of the problem, today's semi-automatic deduction\r\nengines are designed for use in an iterated guess style, where the guess\r\ndetermines the search space. When a proof attempt fails, the rea-son is often\r\nmathematical rather than search-strategic. The user's role is creative: diagnose the\r\nproblem and invent the mathematical abstractions necessary to facilitate proof. This\r\nmay require defining new formal concepts to state generalizations or decompositions.\r\nSuch input from the user fundamentally alters the search space.\r\n\r\nThe research proposed here will produce a new paradigm for semi-automatic theorem\r\nprovers in which the user steers the system in real time. Visualization paradigms\r\nfor symbolic data and symbolic manipulation will be developed, including what we\r\ncall symbolic spreadsheets which allow inter-related symbolic data to be displayed\r\ncoherently. The search space will be explicit, visible and dynamically computed.\r\nStructure will be imposed via the definitions and lemmas in the data base. Four\r\nfundamental research topics will be addressed: (i) selection of the abstract\r\nentities to be visualized, the visual reification of these abstractions, and the\r\nrequirements for effective steering; (ii) visualization algorithms for efficient\r\ndisplay and interrogation of symbolic logical data and processes; (iii) theorem\r\nproving algorithms producing human surveyable proofs while allowing real-time\r\ninteraction; and (iv) a client/server model of semi-automatic theorem proving\r\nallowing the visualization and deduction engines to be decoupled but interoperable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an ideal setting in which to study the visualization of symbolic data\r\nprocessing, with a clear path to immediate and critical applications in the\r\nsemiconductor industry and, due to the pervasiveness of formal systems in computing\r\n(e.g., programming languages) promising connections to much wider applications. The\r\nresearch will deeply affect both applied logic and visualization.",
