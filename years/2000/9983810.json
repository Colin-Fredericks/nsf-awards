 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe magnetic dipole moments of short-lived radioisotopes near the proton drip-line will be measured to explore the limit at which protons and neutrons can be treated as identical particles in the bound nucleus.  The experiments\r\nwill be performed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at\r\nMichigan State University.  The desired radioactive nuclei will be produced\r\nusing the fragmentation of intermediate-energy heavy-ion beams provided by the Coupled K500-K1200 Cyclotron Facility and selected from other species using the new A1900 fragment separator.  The method of nuclear magnetic resonance on beta-emitting nuclei will be employed to deduce the ground state magnetic moments of very light magnesium and silicon isotopes.  A method to directly measure the spin of the nuclear ground state will also be developed using\r\nnuclear magnetic resonance and overtone spectroscopy.\r\n\tThe state-of-the-art research facilities at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory provide a unique arena to advance the nuclear chemistry education of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students.  The environment at the university-based cyclotron facility allows for a hands-on training experience for students at all levels.  To bring practical nuclear\r\nscience experience to the classroon, a new junior/senior level chemistry class will be developed at Michigan State University.  This course will provide students with a background in fundamental nuclear process and radiation detection\r\ntechniques.  Students will then apply this new knowledge to understand both cutting edge nuclear science research as well as current events having ties\r\nto nuclear science.\r\n\r\n",
