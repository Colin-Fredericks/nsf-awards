 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves construction and optimization of a novel high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detector that can resolve the chemically complex analyte mixtures encountered in environmental and pharmaceutical laboratories. Standard HPLC analysis of such complex mixtures is severely hampered by peak overlap.  Even under optimal separation conditions, which necessitate long elution times and drive up analysis costs, the species of interest are often only partially resolved.  Dakota Technologies, Inc. has patented a novel detection scheme that concurrently records fluorescence decay curves at four or more emission wavelengths and is ideally suited to HPLC fluorescence detection.  The scheme uses fiber optic delay lines to control the arrival of different wavelength fluorescence components at the single photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector.  The two dimensional detector (fluorescence wavelength and decay time) is simple, robust, and significantly less expensive than competitive detectors, which are limited to just the wavelength or decay time domain. Proof of principle has been established but further technical developments are needed to optimize the approach for analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).  In this Phase I SBIR project DTI will implement a flow cell that that employs total internal reflectance to deliver the excitation light, resulting in higher light fluxes at the PMT.  A new-to-the market 9-bit digital phosphor oscilloscope (DPO) will be incorporated to increase the accuracy and speed of data acquisition. The optimal emission wavelength sets for individual PAHs will be found by experiment and chemometric algorithms will be tested.\r\n",
