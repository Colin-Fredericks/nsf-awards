 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a beam steering system that will enable each pixel on a light valve to become four color pixels thus doubling the light valve's resolution in both directions and adding color without banding effects.  The goal of any display device is the creation of a compelling illusion that the user is observing a real object.  This is particularly true in simulation applications where realism is paramount or where faithful and accurate reproduction of a physical object is required, as in medical imaging.  These applications require ultra high definition. DTI has conceived an optical technique that can use a state-of-the-art light valve with 1.3 million pixels and double its resolution in both directions to produce a display with 5.2 million pixel resolution. Research to date indicates that to be technically viable, an effective mechanism is needed to direct spot illumination to multiple well focused spots with the precision to optically increase the resolution of the light valve. This innovation will enable display products to achieve resolutions not possible though conventional means to meet the most demanding digital display requirements including those for digital mammography, simulators, HDTV and digital cinema. \r\n\r\nUltra high definition product monitors resulting from this research can be commercialized in a number of markets demanding high quality images with fine details and improved realism. These include digital cinema, multi-media presentation, dome simulators, digital mammography and radiology and HDTV.\r\n",
