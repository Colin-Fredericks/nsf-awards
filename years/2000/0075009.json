 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will spend 12 months in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Mississippi State University from August 2000 to August 2001. During this visit, he plans to obtain a broad exposure to the general area of biochemistry and molecular biology, and some in-depth understanding of important research issues in computational biology. This will be accomplished by participating in joint research projects with researchers in that department, attending department seminars and  professional conferences, and exchanging ideas with colleagues through regular discussions. The PI's long term interest is in modeling and simulating various signal transduction and metabolic pathways in living organisms using nonlinear reaction-diffusion partial differential equations and high performance parallel computers.  During the proposed visit, he expects to identify long term interdisciplinary research projects in which computational simulations can play a significant role in solving biological problems, and to develop joint proposals with bioscientists for funding to sustain long term research in computational biology.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the research activities, the PI will also emphasize the education aspect by combining computational simulations and mathematical modeling with biosciences. He plans to involve graduate students \r\nin the joint research projects both during and after the visit, examine the current curriculum in biosciences at Mississippi State University to identify the needs for computational simulations, and establish connections \r\nwith faculty members in biosciences who can help students work on cross-disciplinary projects in \r\ncomputational biology, either as co-advisors or as program committee members.  This kind of \r\ncross-disciplinary research experience will significantly broaden students' career options and \r\nenhance their competitiveness in the job market.  This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
