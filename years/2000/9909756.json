The co-organizers are Professors Ignatius Tsong at Arizona State University and Professor Ayahiko Ichimiya at Nagoya University in Japan.  Physics and chemistry at mesoscopic length scales produce a rich variety of thermodynamic, kinetic, structural, electronic and magnetic phenomena.  Engineering on the mesoscopic scale poses serious technical challenges.  The purpose of the seminar is to explore fully all the critical issues confronting both theory and experiment carried out on mesoscopic phenomena that occur on surfaces of solids.  Mesoscopic systems are not described well by continuum models and yet are too large for microscopic first-principle methods.  These are the issues that require new theoretical approaches.  \r\n\r\nIn view of the continual emergence of exciting new areas in this field and its tremendous growth potential in the new century, it is timely to hold a topical seminar to discuss the critical issues confronting the study and understanding of mesoscopic phenomena that take place on surfaces.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Dissemination plans for the seminar proceedings include publication in the international journal \"Surface Review and Letters.\"\r\n",
