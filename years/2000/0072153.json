The research aims to\r\nprogress towards proving the conjecture about the existence of a\r\ngeneric topological instability in such systems, known as\r\n\"Arnold's diffusion\", effected via resonances. The first goal is\r\nto obtain an adequate local description of various geometric\r\nobjects that the perturbation causes to appear. These objects can\r\nbe characterized by their rotation vectors.  First, they are\r\nlower-dimensional partially hyperbolic (whiskered) tori and the\r\nLagrangian manifolds (whiskers) asymptotic to these tori.\r\nGenerally, the collection of all the rotation vectors yielding\r\nwhiskered tori form a set of the first category. Rotation numbers\r\nin the \"gaps\" in it describe so-called \"Aubry-Mather sets\". Yet\r\nthe latter term is somewhat obscure beyond the case of two\r\ndegrees of freedom.  Incorporating many of the above mentioned\r\nobjects of all types into a single global geometric framework\r\neffected as an atlas over the phase space, is the second, and the\r\nmain goal. Apropos of \"Aubry-Mather sets\", this will require\r\nmutual interpretation of the results obtained via variational\r\nmethods of Lagrangian mechanics and geometric implicit function\r\ntheorems, such as KAM, of Hamiltonian approach.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research focuses on instability as a generic feature\r\nof complex mechanical systems, be it the Solar system, or a\r\npolyatomic molecule. In order to describe such, one needs to know\r\nthe present state of the system, and the equations of its future\r\nevolution. Typically, due to their complexity, one cannot obtain\r\nthe solutions of these equations with the initial conditions\r\nincorporated. Otherwise, and this is an exceptional case, the\r\nsystem is called integrable. Such would be the Solar system if\r\none considers only the interaction of each individual planet with\r\nthe Sun, disregarding in particular the mutual gravitational\r\nattraction between the planets, etc. Yet the laws of motion are\r\nknown exactly, the initial state of a system has to be measured,\r\nwhich leads to errors, however small. The hypothesis of\r\ninstability, alias \"Arnold's diffusion,\" suggests that two\r\ninfinitesimally different initial conditions may result in two\r\nqualitatively different scenarios ad infinitum. In particular,\r\nthis is believed to be true for small perturbations of integrable\r\nsystems, e.g. if one takes into account the influence of the Moon\r\nor Jupiter on the orbital motion of the Earth. The suitable\r\nmathematical enviroment to model the systems in question is\r\nprovided by geometrical mechanics. The technological motivation\r\nfor this research comes from molecular chemistry and biology\r\nwhere billions of years it would take the instability to develop\r\nitself on a cosmic scale, translate into fractions of a second.\r\n",
