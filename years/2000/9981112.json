 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropology (81)\r\n\r\nThe subject of human origins engenders universal interest, but its potential as an aid for science education has been relatively neglected by the academic community. Humans represent an excellent example of how the biology and natural history of an organism can be shaped as a result of the processes of adaptation and evolution. Thus, the study of human evolution (paleoanthropology) is a potentially powerful instrument for communicating the nature of scientific evidence and the principles of scientific inquiry to a wide audience. This 'Proof-of-Concept' project is part of an initiative by George Washington University, in collaboration with the 'Human Origins Program' of the National Museum for Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution, to establish a comprehensive Human Evolution Database (HED) that will support education and research in several different ways. Namely, the HED will 1) introduce general users to the basic principles and evidence of human evolution, 2) provide an on-line or CD-ROM-based reference that can supplement traditional educational materials, 3) provide problem-based learning experiences that teach research methodology for a range of undergraduate courses, and 4) archive advanced data sets suitable for use by graduate-level researchers.  A lack of teaching materials has been a major factor limiting the teaching of human evolution. Accordingly, the finished HED will be posted on the Internet, and thus will be accessible to students both at home and in the classroom. As such, HED represents the most extensive plan yet attempted to integrate computer technology into the teaching of human evolutionary studies. The HED will be designed primarily for use by undergraduates, but ultimately its flexibility and accessibility will make it suitable for use in educational settings ranging from secondary school (grades 9 - 12) up through doctoral programs.\r\n",
