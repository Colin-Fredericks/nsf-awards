The proposed project is to develop an educational\r\napproach that will appeal to women and provide them with an appropriate\r\nlearning environment for IT courses.  There are four components to the\r\nproject.  First, will be efforts to build upon results of investigations on\r\nhow to use technology to increase learning and decrease costs as taught\r\nwithin an IT fluency course.  Second, will be research on learning styles\r\nto provide quantitative evidence to explore the validity of learning styles\r\nin general, and the consistency of women's learning styles, particularly,\r\ncorrelations between learning styles, learning environments and\r\nperformance.  Third, will be research on how to improve Web-based\r\ncollaborative experiences.  Fourth, will be the testing of findings through\r\ncomparisons of learning achieved in a traditional environment with learning\r\nin an environment restructured to take into account the project's findings\r\nand those of other researchers in the field.  The specific application of\r\nthe project will be the development an a women-friendly information design\r\nand technology undergraduate certificate program that is accessible to\r\nstudents of any major.  The introductory courses of the certificate program\r\nwill be designed so that students can move easily into either a traditional\r\ncomputer science or media studies program.\r\n",
