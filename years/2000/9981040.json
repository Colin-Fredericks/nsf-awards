 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) The overall goal of this project is to provide students with a technology enhanced laboratory experience throughout their first year of chemistry. This is  accomplished by the use of 28 workstations, each consisting of a LabWorks Il Interface system and PC. These systems are  distributed between two dedicated general chemistry laboratories where ports for connection to the Internet are available. The computers in the two labs are linked on an Intranet and they are networked to an already existing computer lab facility (undergraduate) in place in the department. The LabWorks system  permits the computer data acquisition of temperature, pH, conductivity, and colorimetric data, and is enhancing existing experiments. Fast computer data acquisition and analysis frees up more time during the laboratory sessions for students to focus on the critical-thinking aspects of the experiments. Also, the computers allow for the efficient compilation of data for class discussions.  In this project, the goals are accomplished by adapting discovery-based experiments and experimental modules.  These are drawn, in large part, from the NSF sponsored ChemLinks and ModularChem web based materials and modules and also from the MADCAP project (Middle Atlantic Discovery Chemistry Project).  Students access websites sponsored by the NSF supported initiatives and have some choice as to the projects on which they work.  A collaborative learning environment fosters a teamwork approach as an invaluable experience in real world chemistry.   The technology rich, discovery-based laboratory environment created through implementation of this project totally revitalizes the general chemistry curriculum.   Positive effects from the project are expected to spill over into an already technology-rich upper-level curriculum as a result of more enthusiastic and better technologically prepared students emerging from first year chemistry.\r\n",
