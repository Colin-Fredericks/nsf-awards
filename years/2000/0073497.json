This is termed \"code compression.\" The size of programs can adversely affect the performance of a computer in several ways, but until recently, code\r\ncompression has been targeted at low cost systems, where chip size and thus cost is at a premium. Reducing chip size suggests that the code compression techniques may also reduce power consumption, because the power consumed by a chip is related, among other things to its area. Furthermore, earlier studies by the Principal Investigator have shown that compression can improve the memory system efficiency and, as a result improve system performance. There are three directions being pursued in this research: 1) to explore the use of code compression to reduce chip size and cost; 2) to explore the use of code compression to reduce power; and 3) to explore the use of code compression to improve performance. The impact of this work is expected to be reduced chip size and power consumption for the same or better performance. The research leverages tools that were created by the Principal Investigator in prior code compression work.\r\n\r\n",
