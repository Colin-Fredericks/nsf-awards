 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Purdue University VIGRE Program has the goal of diversifying and broadening the educational preparation of undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral students in the mathematical sciences. It will simultaneously integrate research and educational activities while promoting involvement with industry and K-12 education. The program is a cooperative effort by the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Statistics whose highly ranked research programs offer a broad range of diverse assets that are mutually beneficial to all.  The VIGRE participants are organized in research groups that allow introduction and in depth exploration of specific research areas.  Each will include an interdisciplinary aspect involving faculty outside the mathematical sciences. These groups will include undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty. High school faculty and/or middle school faculty will participate in summer activities of the groups.  The group will provide a ladder of mentoring among the participants with each individual responsible for mentoring those less experienced than herself or himself.These same groups will provide expository lectures to members of other groups to broaden their exposure to a variety of areas.\r\n\r\nThe expository lectures of the research groups will be part of a series of seminars at several levels to introduce undergraduates and graduate students and postdocs to the breadth of research areas in the departments. In addition, a seminar series in teaching and communicating the mathematical sciences will be a part of the program. The long tradition of research consulting experiences for graduate students in statistics will be expanded to mathematics.  Significant teaching experiences for both postdoctoral fellows and graduate students are a key part of the program. They are meant to provide a meaningful exposure to classroom teaching that does not overemphasize this aspect of the typical experience at a large state university. A project management team will monitor and report on the activities and success of the program.\r\n\r\nThis program is being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities from the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
