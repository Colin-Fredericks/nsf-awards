 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid advances in computation and communication technologies are giving rise to an ever wider use of automation in the monitoring and control of dynamic engineering and computing systems in\r\nmanufacturing, communication networks, transportation, and electric power systems, to mention but a few key areas.  The software programs that monitor and control these systems are responsible for various functions, including start-up and shut-down procedures, monitoring and control, detection and isolation of significant events, system reconfiguration, etc.  We refer to all of these software programs as the \"supervisory control software\".  This proposal is focused on systems that are distributed over several sites and where the supervisory control software is distributed as well.  The goal is to conduct fundamental research on novel formal generic methodologies for designing distributed software systems that monitor and control systems with decentralized information.  We propose to bring the concepts and techniques of Systems, Control, and Decision Theory to bear on the problem of designing distributed software systems that are provably correct and efficient. As part of this effort, we will educate computer science and engineering students at the University of Michigan and Wayne State University on the fundamental issues associated with distributed software design.\r\n",
