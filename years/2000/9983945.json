The approach is to: (1) Understand and improve the use of surfactants as corrosion inhibitors; (2) Quantitatively describe the role of adsorption density in corrosion inhibition by surfactants; (3) Determine the relationship between the nature of surface bonding and its role in corrosion inhibition; (4) Improve surfactant selection criteria for corrosion inhibitors on the basis of surfactant type, hydrocarbon chain length, functional group, and the application environment; and (5) Maximize corrosion mitigation training and learning opportunities for students through labs, demonstrations, science projects, and distance learning. The project research goals are achieved using a variety of state-of-the-art instruments to analyze mild steel corrosion in the presence of surfactant corrosion inhibitors. Adsorption density measurements are made using Fourier-Transform infrared spectrometer and quartz crystal microbalance tools. The effects of surfactant adsorption on corrosion inhibition are evaluated using potentiodynamic scanning, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy. Light microscopy and scanning probe microscopy examine the role of surfactants in pitting corrosion inhibition. Important learning experiences are provided to students through laboratory exercises that are designed around identifying, understanding, and mitigating corrosion through group projects. Students learn about corrosion minimization through a new introductory web-based corrosion course that will be offered with interactive tutorials as part of this project. High school students are involved through corrosion monitoring projects and through presentations made at local schools with large minority populations and low educational advancement success. \r\n%%%\r\nIn the United States it is estimated that $30 billion could be saved on an annual basis through the use of economically viable corrosion mitigation technology. However, proper application of such technology is contingent upon education, training, and research. This project addresses corrosion minimization through integrated research and education.\r\n***\r\n",
