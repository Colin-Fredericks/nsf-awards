On \r\nspaces that include strata of odd codimension as well, \r\nself-duality of the latter sheaf fails to hold in general. \r\nIn recent research, we have shown that \"Lagrangian structures\" \r\ncan be employed to construct self-dual intersection homology \r\non such spaces. We propose to study the variance of the \r\nassociated characteristic classes as the Lagrangian structure\r\nchanges. In many situations, the effective manipulation of \r\nself-dual sheaves places heavy demands on the stratification \r\nof the underlying space. We propose to investigate the potential existence of a good \"sheaf package\" on weakly stratified \r\nspaces (the homotopically stratified sets of Quinn), using the technology of teardrop neighborhoods and manifold stratified approximate fibrations. Further, in collaboration with Sylvain \r\nCappell, we are interested in developing characteristic class\r\nformulae for the signature of singular spaces in the presence of\r\nnon-trivial monodromy, via a synthesis of Atiyah's formula for manifolds and the Cappell-Shaneson signature formula.\r\n\r\nTopology is the study of geometrical objects focusing on the neighborhood relations between points rather than on measurement \r\nof distances. In the last century, considerable effort has been directed towards studying \"manifolds\" -- spaces that locally look uniform, at each point and in each direction. This effort has \r\nbeen immensely successful; a central insight was that crucial information about a manifold is carried by one number: its \r\n\"signature,\" measuring intersections of geometric sub-objects \r\nwithin the manifold. In the last two decades, topologists have \r\nstudied \"singular\" spaces with increasing interest, due to their numerous occurrences and applications within pure mathematics (algebraic geometry, number theory) and outside pure mathematics (mathematical physics). In contrast to a manifold, a singular \r\nspace may locally look different from point to point. The proposed research tries to define, understand, and compute topological \r\ninvariants for singular spaces.\r\n\r\n",
