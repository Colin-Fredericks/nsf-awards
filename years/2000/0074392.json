Two free-living strains of the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus, one representing a coastal clade and the other an open ocean clade, are being compared to assess physiological differences and adaptive capacities to nitrogen starvation.  Subtraction cDNA libraries are being produced and the sequences analyzed to identify protein sequence and motifs of nitrate transporting proteins.  Generated sequence is used to produce a microarray, and chip experiments are designed to examine and compare the magnitude and kinetics of the two strains to nitrogen deprivation.  This data will help answer the question of whether different strains differ in expressional patterns in ways that indicate niche adaptation or resource partitioning, both of which are frequent evolutionary responses to competition.\r\n",
