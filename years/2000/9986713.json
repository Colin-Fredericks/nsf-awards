 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, receives one of the highest blood flows of any organ and its capillaries have unique properties that facilitate the exchange of substances between hormone-producing cells and the circulation. One growth factor, named vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), maintains the integrity of the vasculature, stimulates growth of new blood vessels and affects vascular permeability.  Little is known which pituitary cell type produces VEGF, how its production is regulated, whether there is a constant remodeling of the pituitary capillaries and what are the mechanisms that control permeability, thereby affecting the rate of hormone release.  The first aim will identify the pituitary cell types that produce VEGF as well as peripheral and brain-derived hormones that control its synthesis. The second aim will determine whether locally-produced VEGF binds to nearby capillaries, inducing them to form gaps through which hormones and other molecules can be exchanged. \r\n\r\nThe pituitary is the master endocrine gland which regulates growth, reproduction and metabolism.  By incorporating knowledge gained from other vascular systems, together with the use of state-of-the-art cellular and molecular techniques, this research will generate new information on the physiological regulation and proper function of the pituitary gland and will provide an attractive training environment for a new generation of scientists.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
