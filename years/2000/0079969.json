The objective is the completion of four design projects annually, which will assist individual disabled persons served by the Copper Country Intermediate School District (CCISD). Each design project will be assigned to a team consisting of three to five senior students in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. Students in other disciplines may participate, depending on skills required for a given project. Local high school students will be engaged in fabrication of some of the projects, through a partnership with Hancock (MI) High School's industrial arts program. Each project will be advised by a faculty member -- either one of investigators, or another member of the engineering faculty who has appropriate expertise and interest.\r\n\r\nAll students who participate in one of these projects will complete a workshop on professional ethics and standards, prior to beginning a project. This workshop will inform the students of applicable standards and issues in patient confidentiality, liability, and intellectual property rights. This workshop will be conducted jointly by members of the professional staff of CCISD and the investigators.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will, by July I of each year, provide the National Science Foundation with a report describing the projects completed.\r\n\r\n",
