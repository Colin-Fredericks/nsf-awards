Husson\r\n Clemson U.\r\n\r\nMolecular imprinting provides a promising technique for designing materials that possess the molecular recognition properties of biological systems.  This process produces a polymeric material that contains a molecular imprint of a target molecule with size and shape dimensions that match those of the target molecule.  This research describes a methodology that uses surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy to examine peptide adsorption dynamics on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) surfaces.  The project has three primary goals: i) to synthesize uniform, ultrathin MIP films with predetermined thickness on SPR biosensor chips; ii) to measure in real time the adsorption properties of target peptides on their corresponding MIP films; and iii) to apply fundamental information gained from these measurements to design and test chromatographic separation materials for peptide separations.  The first goal will be achieved by carrying out surface-confined living radical polymerization (SCLRP) on the SPR biosensor chips in the presence of target peptides.  SPR spectroscopy will be used to accomplish the second goal.  The third goal will be met by synthesizing our MIP films on commercially available chromatography support materials.  Synthesis of an MIP film by SCLRP and subsequent use of SPR to measure the fundamental adsorption properties of these films represent the novel features of this research career plan.  Results of the research will broadly impact the development of a range of MIP materials, including tailor-made separation materials, antibody and receptor binding sites mimics in recognition and assay systems, enzyme site mimics for catalysis, and recognition elements in biosensors.\r\n\r\nElementary school teachers assigned to teach multiple subjects often cite mathematics and science as their least comfortable subjects to teach. The education plan has four primary goals: i) to teach elementary school teachers and preservice teachers that teaching mathematics and science means interaction with materials and fostering independent thinking; ii) to educate teachers about programs that employ inquiry-driven, activity-based learning; iii) to train and support teachers to implement these programs; and iv) to encourage and aid teachers to disseminate their experiences to other teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
