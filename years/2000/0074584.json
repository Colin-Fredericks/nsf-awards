 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is clear that nervous system function can be influenced by factors released from a variety of non-neuronal cells. The PI, Dr. Clatworthy, has been using a simple model system, the marine mollusc Aplysia californica, to understand fundamental mechanisms underlying the modulation of neuronal activity by non-neuronal cells. Specifically, she has established that a population of non-neuronal cells (hemocytes) present in the blood of Aplysia can influence the electrophysiological properties of a population of identified sensory neurons. To further develop this line of research, it will be necessary to learn the identity of these hemocyte-derived neuromodulators. \r\nThe goal of this POWRE proposal is to allow the PI, an electrophysiologist by training, to spend 12 months in the laboratory of Dr. Ken Bost, a molecular biologist, learning a variety of molecular techniques that will be applied directly to identifying the factors released by the hemocytes in Aplysia. This cross disciplinary approach will advance knowledge in the field of sensory plasticity by allowing the PI to integrate information from both electrophysiological and molecular studies. Results obtained in this simple model system can then be used to formulate hypotheses regarding non-neuronal cell modulation of sensory neuron function in more complex, less accessible model systems. Furthermore, because hemocytes have a cellular defense function in Aplysia, learning the identity of hemocyte-derived factors may also provide important clues regarding the origins and evolution of mediators of the immune system.\r\n",
