Professor S.D. Mahanti of Michigan State University and Indian collaborator Arghya Taraphder of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur will study the electronic structure of magnetoresistive oxides.\r\nThe research will focus on construction of realistic model systems for manganites and double perovskites. They will relate the results of Hartree-Fock calculations to those of more tractable theoretical models.  The investigators recognize the strengths and limitations of Hartree-Fock and local spin density approximations in electronic structure work, and plan to use both to learn what might not be learned from either alone.  The results are expected to have wide applicability in condensed matter physics. \r\n\r\nScope:  Oxide materials continue to represent a vigorous area of research in the U.S.  The investigators have excellent track records, have made many important contributions to the field, and their collaboration is likely to lead to broadly interesting results.  The connection with the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur is excellent and the students at both institutions will benefit from the exchange of scientists.  This award is supported jointly with the Government of India's Department of Science and Technology.  \r\n",
