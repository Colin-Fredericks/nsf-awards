 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is the application of computer vision\r\ntechniques, in particular stereo vision techniques, to the domain of\r\nimage-based rendering (IBR) --- the problem of synthesizing novel\r\nviews of a scene based on existing images.  The long-term goal is to\r\ndevelop a system that builds an image-based scene representation from\r\na stream of input images, while actively selecting new viewpoints.\r\nSpecific topics of investigation will include: the development of new\r\nperformance measures for IBR methods; the development of new IBR\r\ntechniques based on stereo vision; the application of texture\r\nsynthesis techniques to occlusion issues; the utilization of visual\r\nlandmarks for calibration; and the development of on-line and off-line\r\nalgorithms for the selection of reference viewpoints.\r\n    Undergraduate students will be involved significantly in all\r\naspects of the research project, including implementation,\r\nexperimentation, authoring papers, and attending conferences.  Other\r\nstudents will benefit through the integration of current research\r\ntopics into the curriculum, and through use of the lab facilities\r\ncreated in the context of the project.  The PI's long-term educational\r\ngoals include developing non-traditional courses aimed at students not\r\nordinarily specializing in the sciences, and establishing contacts to\r\nindustry for a real-world perspective.\r\n",
