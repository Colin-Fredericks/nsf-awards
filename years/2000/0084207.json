 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many large-scale ecological studies the diversity of fungi and their roles in ecosystem function and change are almost totally ignored.  Recent advances in the fields of DNA sequencing, bioinformatics, and phylogenetic analysis have made possible many advances in studies of microbial diversity.  A system for performing routine surveys of fungal biodiversity in Duke Forest (Durham, NC) based on molecular systematics is being developed. The Duke Forest lies near the eastern edge of the North Carolina piedmont plateau and supports diverse plant species (over100 tree species), soils, and land use conditions and research projects currently underway include surveys of arthropod diversity, studies of the effects of environmental change including elevated carbon dioxide, different land use histories, and the dynamics of naturally evolving forest communities.  The Duke Forest Mycological Observatory (DFMO) will permit the study of those fungal communities which form the core group of saprophytic and mycorrhizal fungi in temperate forests.  As a pilot project, plots representing a range of forest types will be surveyed in order to establish a baseline data set of basidiomycete diversity from the forest.  Plots located within several long-term studies including the recently initiated Free-Air Carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment will next be studied.  Early data from the FACE study indicate shifts in the microbial population in the soil, but as yet there have been no surveys of microbial diversity by FACE.  Shifts in the abundance, activity and diversity of mycorrhizal fungi are particularly likely (in response to a greater supply of root exudates in the FACE plots) and may play an important role in long term forest/ecosystem health and stability.  This study will develop a DNA-sequence database framework (based on ribosomal ITS sequences) linked with sites within the Duke Forest. Extensive molecular databases are already available for most fungal groups, making it possible to identify isolates to the genus in most instances and often to the species level. The focus will be on soil, litter and mycorrhizal samples from these sites, which will provide a more unbiased estimate of microbial diversity than estimates based 'above ground' sampling of fruit bodies or cultivable diversity.  These data will then form a basis for the long term monitoring of fungal microbial diversity within the Duke Forest and FACE site.  This project will provide baseline data about soil-inhabiting, mycorrhizal, soil, and litter-fungi from a variety of habitats.  This project will also be one of the first studies of fungal community structure to assess the impacts of various environmental variables such as increases in carbon dioxide concentration on fungal diversity.",
