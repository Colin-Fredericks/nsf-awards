 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nOne of the beautiful and applicable parts of mathematics is the study of symmetry, that is, the actions, or representations, of groups of symmetry transformations on physical objects.  For example, the square has eight symmetry transformations.  These symmetries simplify the analysis of many physical systems based on a square shape (e.g., the analysis of vibrations of a square mechanical system or the spectrum of a square molecule.  The same holds true for other shapes, making the theory of group representations a powerful tool for mathematicians and scientists.  The theory however is somewhat technical; so, group theory is usually taught and described in courses at the graduate level. \r\n\r\nThe proof-of-concept project is developing an undergraduate, upper division course and accompanying textbook to teach the theory of the representations of finite groups, with specific and detailed applications, to mathematics majors, mathematics education majors, and to students majoring in science and engineering.  This work is making available to a larger audience the study of a beautiful and powerful branch of mathematics and to teach its applications to a larger group of scientists and engineers.",
