 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Science  (61)  This project adapts the unique and tractable ecology, genetics, physiology and biochemistry of an extremely halophilic (i.e., \"salt loving\") bacterium to a junior level teaching laboratory in molecular techniques.  It is based on pedagogical techniques outlined by the Johnsons (Johnson, D. W. and R.T. Johnson, 1993, Cooperative Learning and College Teaching Newsletter, 3:6-9), further detailed by Herreid (Herreid, C.F., 1998, BioScience 48:553-559).\r\n\r\nThis project accomplishes four objectives: 1) students are made aware of the importance and relevance of the ecology of the group of organisms used as models in the molecular techniques laboratory; 2) students learn that biology is a quantitative science, not solely an observational one; 3) all students participate equally in an authentic \"hands-on\" molecular biology laboratory; and 4) students are prepared for more sophisticated molecular experiments in an advanced senior level course and in independent, undergraduate research projects.  Students and faculty whose majors and backgrounds are traditionally not considered \"molecular\" in nature are welcomed and encouraged to enroll in the course.  In addition, a laboratory manual (both hard copy and Web-based) is being produced and disseminated, and bacterial strains and environmental samples are supplied for the asking. \r\n\r\n",
