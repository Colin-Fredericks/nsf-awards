 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the social movement that has emerged around AIDS-related issues in Brazil over the last 15 years, focusing on issues of political and social (health) mobilization at the community level. It will specifically examine 1) how this social movement reflects earlier AIDs movements, 2) how this movement has influenced social responses to the epidemic, 3) how state policies and programs have been shaped by the movement, and 4) how the epidemic itself has been affected by the movement. The team of researchers is composed to two Americans and two Brazilians, all experienced in studying AIDS issues. It will adopt a multi-sited approach, gathering data in five Brazilian cities. The research will contribute to efforts to combat the spread of the disease through effective social programs and policies. It will also contribute to our theoretical understanding of the processes inherent in the creation and efficacy of social movements.\r\n\r\n",
