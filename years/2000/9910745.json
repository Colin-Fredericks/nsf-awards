 "awd_abstract_narration": "Now in its fifth year, the Rocky Mountain Teacher Education Collaborative (RMTEC) has achieved a record of sustained change in preservice teacher preparation and undergraduate teaching and learning in mathematics and science. The purpose of RMTEC is to (1) improve the preparation of preservice teachers, with emphasis on restructuring, reforming, and developing innovative curricula and instructional methods for teaching mathematics and science; (2) develop collaborations among the primary partner institutions, community colleges, and school districts; (3) recruit and retain women and ethnic minorities for teaching careers in mathematics and science. Three of the higher education partner institutions, in collaboration with teachers and administrators of school districts throughout Colorado, propose to conduct a three-year summative evaluation of the RMTEC project. This evaluation is organized to address assessment in three overarching areas: collaboration, institutionalization, and student outcomes.",
