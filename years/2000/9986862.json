After an initial two-week orientation workshop, ten teams of teacher-pairs will team up with a research scientist mentor and undergraduate students for a 40-day research fellowship (20 teachers per year).  Scientist mentors will be drawn from the University of Montana, the US Forest Service, and the Montana Natural History Center, which will formalize a partnership between local schools and these agencies.  Teachers will participate in a series of four two-day follow-up workshops during the academic year to develop ecological inquiries for their own students based on their summer research experiences. Undergraduate ecological interns, the project staff, and the mentor scientists will support teachers in their efforts throughout the school year.  This project will enable teachers to develop problem-solving skills, confidence in inquiry-based teaching and learning, improved scientific literacy, and a greater long-term interest in science by using ecological investigations focused on topics and issues of local interest. Teaching practices that focus on \"learning by doing\" and inquiry instruction will be promoted, the development of local ecological research sites during and beyond the project will be supported.  The project will instill scientific ways of thinking and understanding in participating teachers and their students through the development of authentic research experiences in their schoolyards and adjacent habitats. \r\n\r\n",
