 "awd_abstract_narration": "An unresolved and underdeveloped area for the evolving Internet is the issue of ubiquity. Rural areas\r\nacross the nation are affected by the lack of network access; solutions are either prohibitively expensive,\r\nor many years away from implementation. The research and education communities have immediate\r\nconnection needs, for researchers working in remote areas (in the field, in observatories, and with\r\nautonomous telemetry sensors) and for remote educational facilities, at reasonable performance levels to\r\nthe Internet.\r\n     The goal of this project is to create a substantial and robust wireless backbone network for bidirectional\r\ntraffic flows by expanding upon a prototype connection recently installed by the Measurement and Network\r\nAnalysis Group of the National Laboratory for Applied Network Research (NLANR) and the San Diego\r\nSupercomputer Center (SDSC), the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), as well as the School of\r\nEngineering and its Center for Wireless Communications (CWC).\r\n     This proposal is a collaboration between network researchers and disciplinary researchers in geophysics,\r\nand other fields. Multiple different users with different impacts will help to define and understand\r\nrequirements, as well as appropriate parameters for the implementation of a high performance wireless\r\nnetworking environment, with high performance extending beyond raw speed and including aspects of\r\npredictability, as well as spacial and temporal availability. The project is heavily leveraged with the existing\r\nnetwork measurement and analysis activity of NLANR, as well as the seismic measurement and analysis\r\nactivities at SIO.\r\n     The immediate impact of providing services to researchers and telemetry stations in the field and a delivery mechanism for distance education in disadvantaged areas (in San Diego County) is clear. This network will have the technological capability to accommodate a high volume of data (for both communications and telemetry), thus increasing the scope and area of many projects currently limited by these constraints. The wireless network's primary function as an applied test bed to address distance access issues over a\r\nrelatively large rural area in general, and to assess performance characteristics of such a network will result in long-term developments and advances in the area of Internet technology.\r\n     The impact of this Internet Technologies project will be substantial and wide-spread. Benefits to the\r\nresearch and education communities - and ultimately, the public - include improved functional capabilities\r\n(across a variety of disciplines), facilitated collaborations between institutions, better and more reliable\r\nnetwork access, and a prototype which can be emulated throughout rural areas in the U.S.",
