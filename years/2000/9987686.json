Presentations at the conference cover a wide range of corrosion-related topics, but all fall under the conference theme: 'Corrosion Research in the Next Millennium; Reliability and Lifetime Prediction.' The conference features 18 invited lectures. The speakers include well-established and long-standing names in the field of corrosion, younger newcomers now making cutting-edge contributions, and scientists who are involved in corrosion research but not in the mainstream of the corrosion community. There are speakers from academia, national laboratories, and industry. Discussion leaders involve senior people with in-depth knowledge of the session topic that are experienced in the Gordon Research Conference format.  They have demonstrated ability to stimulate vigorous discussion of the key issues with broad audience participation. The demographic mix of speakers and discussion leaders reflect that of the worldwide community of people working in the field of corrosion.\r\n%%%\r\nCorrosion is not a new field, but it continues to be an area of extreme technological and economic importance, as well as scientific vitality. The annual cost of corrosion (as a percentage of the US GNP) has decreased as a result of a range of measures that has developed from our fundamental understanding of the field. Like many fields in the physical sciences, industrial funding for corrosion research has decreased as companies put more focus on short-term problems. However, the current funding for fundamental research in academia is quite strong, with vigorous activities existing in universities across the US and the rest of the world. New approaches using the latest in technology are being applied to long-standing problems, such as the replacement of chromates in corrosion-protective coatings with more effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. This vigor is reflected in the list of speakers invited to participate in this Gordon Research Conference.\r\n***\r\n",
