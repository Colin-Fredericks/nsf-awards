 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) is an innovative Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) process which is capable of manufacturing metallic parts with complex shapes directly from a computer aided drawing. This new manufacturing process can significantly reduce manufacturing costs, reduce the time from design to market, and improve the performance of components used in the die casting, injection molding, aircraft, and automotive industries. The overall objective of this CAREER project is to initiate an effort in interdisciplinary research and education in SFF using the LENS process. A research team of graduate students and faculty in the Materials and Mechanical Engineering Departments at Lehigh University and Lafayette College will collaborate with scientists at Sandia National Laboratory to develop LENS processing methods that can be used by industrial partners. Teaching modules in SFF will be developed by the faculty for undergraduate instruction in manufacturing as part of a capstone course that involves students from the engineering, business, and arts & sciences colleges at Lehigh University.\r\n\r\nThe final \"products\" of this program will be: 1) Processing methods that can be used by industry for improved control and consistency of the LENS manufacturing process, and 2) Graduate and undergraduate students with an improved understanding of the interdisciplinary approach required in today's modern manufacturing environment.",
