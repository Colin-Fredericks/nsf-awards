 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a regional university with a polytechnic emphasis enrolling many low-income and first generation students. It is also an Hispanic Serving Institution, with 25.7% of the enrollment of Hispanic descent. The students typically work many hours per week, and often at more than one job. In many cases the demands of life outside the university cause their studies not to be their first priority. There are limited institutional scholarships available and even very talented students find themselves having a difficult time meeting both the demands of school and the demands of work and family. \r\n\r\nThe project provides scholarships to US citizens with demonstrated financial need, enrolled full-time in computer information systems, engineering, engineering technology or mathematics at the baccalaureate or masters level, with a 3.0 or above GPA, who demonstrate professionalism through personal statement and letters of support.  The university has in place an integrated system of support services for students. The scholarship students are further supported in their development by the PIs and by faculty mentors in each remaining area. Regularly scheduled meetings between students and mentors allow the kind of intrusive advising that is so often necessary. \r\n\r\nTo further increase the scholarship recipients' motivation to graduate and their placement potential after graduation, each recipient is required to take a 1-credit course involving the exploration of technical careers. The primary activity in the course is close interaction with visiting speakers who talk about their careers, education, and research. Speakers are drawn from professionals in local business, industry and universities. The anticipated results include reduced times to graduation, increased completion rate, increased numbers of transfer students recruited to these majors and  higher levels of student achievement for low-income and academically talented students in the fields of computer information systems, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. \r\n",
