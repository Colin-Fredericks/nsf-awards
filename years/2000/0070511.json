 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  range of studies in measurable dynamics of are  proposed.\r\nThey lie generally in extensions and applications of orbit equivalence methods.  The PI\r\nhas helped to develop two general approaches here.  The first is Restricted Orbit \r\nEquivalence, where\r\none places restrictions on the sorts of orbit preserving maps allowed.  The second,\r\nand new, method is an \"orbit transference method\" where the orbit equivalence is \r\narbitrary\r\nbut measurable with respect to an algebra orthogonal to the algebra of interest.   \r\nAmong the\r\napplications proposed for these methods are:\r\n1) a deeper and perhaps complete understanding the the Weak Pinsker property of \r\nThouvenot\r\n2) a version of the theory of Isometric Extensions of Bernoulli automorphism for some \r\nclass of restricted orbit equivalences, in particular for standard dyadic reverse \r\nfiltrations.\r\n3) extensions of restricted orbit equivalence beyond actions of descrete amenable \r\ngroups to spaces of labeled random graphs, to not necessarilly descrete groups and \r\nto non-singular actions.  Most important here is that one should look for good examples, \r\nfor example an entropy theory for nonsingular actions.\r\n\r\nLarge scale phenomena can often exhibit a random behavior. Crystals often include random inclusions.  Large data bases often (always?) \r\ninclude random errors.  The genome can be modeled as an infinite sequence of base \r\npairs that in places is random and places not so.  One models such  structures in \r\nprobabilistic terms as a space of linked nodes to which are attached labels, colors if \r\nyou will, endowed with some notion of the probability of occurance of some particular \r\nlocal labeling or picture occuring within an infinite picture.  It is natural to look for ways of \r\ncoding and comparing  such random arrays among themselves.   One can seek \r\nextremely rigid encodings that allow no  distortion of the nodes and their links, just an \r\nencoding of the label at a particular node to that same node in the other labeling\r\nof the array.   Or  more generally and interestingly  one can allow the nodes and links to \r\ndistort as well.   By setting some control on the distortions one can craft an approach to \r\nunderstanding a variety of properties of such systems.  Although the goals of this \r\nproposal are of an abstract nature, one of the first such controlled distortions (called \r\nf-bar) was brought over from genetics where it was used as a measure of evolutionary \r\nrelatedness among DNA molecules.   What is proposed here are a variety of \r\napplications of methods involving controlled distortion of such labeled arrays to \r\nunderstand such random phenomena more deeply.  \r\n\r\n",
