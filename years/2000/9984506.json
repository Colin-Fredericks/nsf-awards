 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nComputer Animation is a powerful medium for communication, with potential to explain, educate, or\r\nentertain. However, the potential of animation beyond entertainment is largely untapped because of the\r\ndifficulty and cost in producing it. While the state of the art provides tools for expert animators to craft\r\nworks of art, it offers little help for those without considerable time and talent.\r\nOur vision is that computer animation will be a widely used medium for communication, that a wide range\r\nof users will choose to share their messages in this medium, and that the availability of this medium will\r\nimpact how we educate students. The widespread availability of internet bandwidth offers the mechanism\r\nfor creators to share animation: what is missing are the tools to create it.\r\nOur premise is that:\r\n1. The power of animation can be more broadly used, with particular impact in education, if we can lower\r\nthe barriers to its production with tools that democratize the medium.\r\n2. Techniques for transforming motions can enable such tools by allowing users to leverage the work of\r\nothers if we can devise technologies that retain the desirable properties of the original during\r\ntransformation.\r\n3. The spacetime constraints approach to motion transformation can provide this technology if it is more\r\nfully developed.\r\nThis proposal presents a faculty career development plan committed to the vision of ubiquitous animation.\r\nThe research component will develop technologies that enable a wider range of uses of animation, and the\r\neducation component will use animation for education and better prepare computer scientists to work with\r\nvisual media.\r\nThe overall goal of the research effort is to create enabling technologies for new animation tools that are\r\nmore accessible to those who are not skilled animators. We propose techniques for transforming motions to\r\nnew uses, for example applying an action to a new character or new environment. The challenge is to create\r\ntransformations that both meet the new needs, yet preserve the desirable properties of the original. Our prior work introduced the spacetime constraints approach to motion transformations. Mathematically, the\r\napproach poses motion transformation as a constrained optimization problem: what motion meets the\r\nspecified needs yet best preserves the original motion? Unlike most animation techniques, spacetime\r\nconstraints consider entire motions simultaneously, rather than computing instants in time individually. This requires solving a single, large numerical problem for each motion computation. Our work to date shows the spacetime constraints approach is a viable approach for tackling important problems in computer animation. The research component of the development plan is to leverage our initial results with the spacetime constraints approach towards the broader goal of democratizing animation. Specifically, work is proposed to improve the mathematical foundations of the approach to enhance its reliability and applicability, to develop new types of motion transformations, to implement systems that provide motion transformations to our target users, and to demonstrate how these new types of tools can be used for the production of effective\r\nvisual messages.\r\nThe education component of the development plan consists of three parts. First, the plan addresses the need\r\nto train students at the University of Wisconsin in graphics and animation by developing new courses and\r\nproviding research and project opportunities for students at all levels. Second, the plan proposes to use\r\nanimation to improve pedagogy: by creating materials for classes as well as for outreach. Third, the plan\r\nproposes to help foster the development of animation technology through outreach to the technical\r\ncommunity.\r\n",
