Autonomous Systems are defined as permanent geophysical or astrophysical installations that are self-sustaining over periods of months and years. They acquire data on a regular time interval or upon a triggering event and either store that data or transmit it to a data center. Many investigators conduct research in polar, sea floor, or other extreme environments that require autonomous systems. Because of the burgeoning scientific potential for such systems, the present is a good time to bring the community together during a workshop in order to discuss the special challenges associated with developing these systems for extreme environments so that past mistakes can be minimized and past successes can be built upon toward better scientific output. The conference venue was the Von Karman Auditorium at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the conference was held in September, 1999. The goals of the workshop were to promote dialogue on autonomous system design, make recommendations on power, thermal, data, communications, and packaging systems, and to decide on standardization for future systems. The workshop also included discussion of, and recommendations for, testing criteria that should be met before systems could deployed in extreme environments. These funds are to prepare, publish, and disseminate the results of the workshop.\r\n\r\n",
