 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at establishing a collaborative research program between Purdue University and Precise Corporation to develop state-of-the-art technologies for high- speed spindles.  The research efforts will focus on developing comprehensive analytical and empirical models as well as conducting critical experimental studies for new high spindles with hybrid ceramic bearings.  The study will determine the potential benefits of ceramic bearings in terms of dynamic and thermal characteristics as well as durability.  Analytical modeling will include lubricant effects and fully three-dimensional thermal expansion in addition to bearing geometry, bearing material, preload, preloading method, external load, operating conditions and spindle shaft configuration to determine dynamic and thermal characteristics. Experimental test rigs will be developed to determine friction and temperature characteristics of hybrid ceramic bearings under operating conditions.  The research will establish speed-load regions for advantageous application of hybrid ceramic bearings, and thus will lead to the establishment of a scientific and technological basis for high speed spindles with ceramic bearings that can provide full benefits of high speed machining. \r\n\r\nThe analytical modeling tool and experimental database to be developed from this joint effort will provide a systematic tool to help achieve optimal design of high speed spindles to avoid a costly failure of expensive machines.\r\n",
