 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project is creating a partnership to develop curriculum concurrently with emerging technology for Fieldbus and Process Control Systems (PCS) Maintenance Education. This partnership of higher education institutions and national industries is writing curriculum modules that interrelate the technical programs of computer maintenance and networking, electrical, instrumentation, and process technologies because these programs are affected by industries that focus on process and computer network technologies. Faculty enhancement activities are assuring that faculty and teachers in the consortium are prepared to teach the courses.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of the Center is the creation of laboratories that \r\nduplicate the working arrangements for technicians. These laboratories serve students and industry as applied research facilities that emulate an actual working site rather than an academic laboratory. \r\n\r\nThe educational partners represent both school districts and institutions of higher education. Some of them are Lamar University, College of the Mainland, and Del Mar College in Corpus Christi, Texas. Some of the 21 industry partners supporting the Center are Bayer Corporation, DuPont, Exxon USA, Fisher-Rosemont, Kellogg Brown & Root, and Siemens Energy & Automation.\r\n",
