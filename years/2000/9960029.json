 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I  proposal introduces an innovative idea to generate a very high brightness laser beam from a clad-pumped multicore fiber laser array embedded in a common low loss cladding with a unique 'isometric' structure. In a very low-loss cladding region, very strong evanescent-wave coupling among the fiber cores can provide the highest modal gain for the fundamental supermode. A technique has been introduced to reliably manufacture the isometric multicore fiber arrays. A computer model has been developed to calculate the far-field radiation patterns emitting from multicore fiber laser arrays arranged in isometric rings. Results indicate that a high brightness, diffraction limited laser beam in the far-field with an amplitude 40dB greater than the side lobes, can be obtained from isometric multicore phase locked fiber laser array in uni-phase with a V-value of <2 and a core separation of 1.5 times the core diameter. However, the remaining issues that need to be addressed in Phase I, are the conditions under which a stable oscillation can be maintained in uni-phase. Under the Phase I-SBIR, four tasks have been identified for the purpose of determining quantitatively all laser parameters and operating conditions for the establishment of a stable laser oscillation at the fundamental supermode from a hase-locked, clad-pumped fiber laser array. The results of this Phase I are crucial for the Phase II follow-on to construct and demonstrate a phase-locked fiber laser array with a high degree of confidence.\r\n",
