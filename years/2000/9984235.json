 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will further develop the passive acoustic system to non-destructively pressure test concrete water pipelines.  It will locate points of structural weakness in these water pipes to permit reinforcement, and in so doing it will avoid the costs and consequences of catastrophic ruptures. The established goals of the project include:  (1) Autonomous Hydrophone System Enhancement - The AH-3 acoustic test system developed and demonstrated during Phase I will be enhanced to incorporate those improvements that will make the system commercially viable;  (2) Pipeline Distress Research - The characteristics of concrete pressure water pipe deterioration will be replicated under field conditions in cooperation with one of the major pipe manufacturers. This will provide greater insight into the process of pipe deterioration as well as providing a proving ground for the field testing of the acoustic system;  (3)  Commercial Feasibility - The research has the potential to greatly prolong the useful life and reliability of the $40 billion U.S. water pipeline infrastructure.  PTI has seen significant growth in revenue fueled in part by commercial acceptance of its early technology.",
