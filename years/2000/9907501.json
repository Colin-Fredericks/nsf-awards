 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gravity waves are believed to affect the atmospheric circulation, temperature, and mixing processes at levels ranging from the troposphere through the mesosphere and above.  However, they are too small in scale to be resolved in general circulation models (GCMs) and must be treated via parameterization.  That is, their effects must be described approximately for inclusion in large-scale models.  This research program aims to quantify the properties of gravity waves and determine their sources, their geographic and seasonal variations, and their effects on the atmosphere.  The goal is to improve the ways of parameterizing their effects in GCMs.  The approach focuses on analysis of observations from the ER-2 stratospheric aircraft to derive information on the momentum flux and the temperature perturbations associated with gravity waves.  This information is used to define the detailed properties of gravity waves and to test theoretical models of wave generation.  Collaboration on including gravity wave effects in GCMs is planned with researchers at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.",
