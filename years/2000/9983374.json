 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with a new method of PVC smoke suppression and fire retardance, which involves the reductive coupling of the polymer chains by zero- or low-valent metals that are formed from metal compounds within the polymer matrix.  Specific objectives of the proposed research include a furtherance of the mechanistic understanding of reductive coupling chemistry as it applies to chlorinated polymers.  In addition, the synthesis of potential smoke suppressants will be undertaken and additives screened.  Ultimately, extension of the technologies developed herein to other commercial polymers will be pursued.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professors William H. Starnes, Jr. and Robert D. Pike of the College of William and Mary.  Professor Starnes and Pike will apply their respective knowledge of polymer and organometallic chemistry to the problem of smoke and fire retardance in PVC plastics.  This is undertaken through the use of metal catalysts that will cause the coalescence of small, volatile molecules into larger, sooty particles under the conditions encountered during combustion.",
