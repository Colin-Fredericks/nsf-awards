 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThis proof-of-concept project is developing educational materials to integrate research progress in image related computation (computer vision, image processing and image analysis) into the undergraduate computer science and engineering core curriculum. Recent years have experienced an explosion of image gathering modalities along with a resultant increase in the demand for expertise in image related computation. Considerable progress has also been made in fields such as image processing, image analysis, and computer vision. It is no longer sufficient to address this need for image expertise through one upper level elective course in computer vision. The need to incorporate image related knowledge units in core undergraduate courses such as data structures, introductory programming courses, automata theory, computer ethics, databases, networks, coding theory, and computer algorithms, preferably without major change in the content of these courses is essential. \r\n\r\nThe materials for these knowledge units are being developed so that they can be used by instructors who are not necessarily computer vision specialists. An added advantage of using image related knowledge units in various courses is that, because of their inherent visual nature and large sizes, images offer an excellent medium for the better understanding of underlying core computer science concepts.\r\n\r\nAs deliverables, the project is developing specific image-related knowledge units and instructional support materials, such as class handouts, transparencies, lecture materials, software, and descriptions of active learning contexts. Dissemination is being accomplished through the development of a textbook and freely available website.  The accumulated experience and evaluation results are being presented at major computer science education conferences, workshops, and through journal papers.",
