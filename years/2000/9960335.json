 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop catalysts to improve indoor air quality by the room temperature catalytic oxidation of pollutants. Initial focus will concentrate on the oxidation of formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde is classified as a probable human carcinogen and studies have shown it is present in many homes and businesses at levels exceeding recommendation levels.  Formaldehyde sources include many materials used in construction and furnishings, environmental tobacco smoke, and both indoor and outdoor combustion sources.  The ideal solution to indoor formaldehyde would be catalytic, room temperature aerobic oxidation to carbon dioxide and water.  TDA Research, Inc., in collaboration with the research group of Prof. Craig Hill at Emory University, proposes to develop polyoxometalate (POM) catalysts for formaldehyde oxidation.  The catalysts will be supported on fabrics, and could be included in draperies, upholstered furniture, and panels used in office cubicles.  Previous work has shown that fabric-supported POMs can catalyze the oxidation of several related compounds by O2 at ambient temperature.  The Phase I research to evaluate these catalysts will be aided by use of a high-throughput test apparatus, previously developed at TDA, which will allow us to test a large number of catalyst systems.\r\n\r\nBecause polyoxometalates are inexpensive and because room temperature catalysis requires no energy input, a successful project will lead to an simple system to improve indoor air quality. This system should find ready acceptance by manufacturers of many products used in both homes and businesses.\r\n",
