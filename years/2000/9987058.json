 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Purdue University School of Science (Departments of Computer Science and Mathematics), School of Technology (Engineering Technology Departments and the Departments of Computer Technology and Computer Graphics Technology), and the professional Schools of Engineering (Aeronautics, Agricultural and Biological, Chemical, Civil, Construction and Management, Electrical and Computer, Industrial, Interdisciplinary, Materials, Mechanical, and Nuclear), are joining together to administer the Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship Program.  This project is improving student access and retention by expanding and enhancing long-term, well developed, institutionalized programs at Purdue University aimed at broadening the opportunities and enabling the full-time enrollment and participation of a cross-section of our financially needy students in the sciences and engineering.  The project is increasing the total number of low-income, but academically talented, students who complete their degrees in a timely manner, and also increasing the number of women and underrepresented minority students receiving their bachelor degrees in CSEMS disciplines.\r\n\r\nA careful nomination and selection procedure is being used to ensure program goals are met and 40 scholarship slots are filled each year (juniors and seniors).  In addition to support programs already in place on the campus of Purdue University, scholarship recipients are meeting weekly in small groups with engineering, science and technology faculty in order to discuss career options, choices and campus and societal issues.  The students are being afforded interdisciplinary research opportunities and are participating in poster displays and on-campus research gatherings during which their own research is being discussed with other students, faculty, and the general public.  Four graduate assistants are working closely with the PI.  They are participating in mentoring and tutorial activities and helping to ensure that the scholarship recipients 'stay on track', both academically and in a personal sense, for 'on time' graduations in CSEMS fields and successful transitions to the work force or to educational programs leading to advanced degrees.\r\n\r\n",
