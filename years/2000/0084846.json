 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is the feasibility study of fundamental control mechanisms for\r\nagent-based systems that facilitate network resource management and traffic control. The primary\r\nemphasis is on orchestrating the work of multiple intelligent mobile agents such that the resulting\r\ncollaboration scales well with the size, the resource availability, and the dynamics of the\r\ninfrastructure. The proposed research investigates the feasibility of autonomously adapting the\r\nsize of the agent population as a function of parameters that describe properties of the\r\ninfrastructure directly or indirectly. The underlying idea is the separation of network centric\r\nfunctions from the nodes into a mobile sub-layer. The researchers expect that this approach will yield a more\r\nscalable architecture for solving a variety of different network centric problems. To facilitate this\r\napproach, thet  have defined fundamental mechanisms such as agent cloning, agent merging,\r\nknowledge acquisition, and agent migration. It is through the use of these mechanisms that the researchers\r\nattempt to show the feasibility of integrating the intelligent mobile agent paradigm into system-level\r\ntasks. The proposed work will involve a formal analytical study of the behavior of the agent\r\npopulation as a function of properties of the infrastructure and computational progress of\r\nindividual agents. The analysis will further be based on carefully constructed simulation\r\nexperiments and the emulation of a large distributed network environment.\r\n     This proposal intentionally disregards several issues of agent-based systems, such as knowledge\r\nrepresentation, fault tolerance, and security, and focuses on the design and analysis of the\r\nfundamental mechanisms. We believe that the limited scope of the proposed project and its\r\nintrinsic exploratory nature makes it an ideal candidate for the Small Grants for Exploratory\r\nResearch (SGER) program.",
