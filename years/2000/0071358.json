We have constructed a `quantum Birkhoff normal\r\nform' of the Laplacian around a bouncing ball orbit and have\r\nproved that it is a spectral invariant. We will investigate the\r\nextent to which a bounded simply connected analytic plane domain\r\nis determined by its normal forms at one or more bouncing ball\r\norbits. We will also investigate a new connection between the\r\nspectrum and X-ray tomography of the domain.  The second group of\r\nproblems involves applications of a recently developed\r\nprobabalistic theory of holomorphic sections of line bundles over\r\nKahler manifolds.  We have at this time determined much of the\r\nlocal statistics of sections over small balls.  We have also\r\ngeneralized the results to symplectic manifolds. We now aim to\r\napply these results to determine hole probabilities,\r\nprobabilities of transversality, and other matters which arise in\r\ncomplex and symplectic geometry.  The third group of problems\r\nbelongs to Quantum Chaos. We have introduced a new model of\r\nrandom quantum maps, obtained by quantizing stochastic\r\nHamiltonian flows.  We propose to investigate the main problems\r\nof Quantum Chaos for this model.\r\n\r\nMuch of physics of the twentieth century has revolved around the\r\nquantum mechanics of particles and fields, in particular around\r\nthe Schrodinger equation, and the physics and engineering of the\r\nfuture will be even more quantum mechanical.  Quantum systems are\r\nquite un-intuitive and one of the best ways to understand what\r\nthey do is to compare them to the classical systems which they\r\nquantize. For instance, a hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic\r\nfield can be thought of as a small particle moving in a force\r\nfield.  As the magnetic field gets stronger, the particle's\r\nmotion becomes more complex and chaotic. What does this say about\r\nthe quantum particle?  According to twenty years of numerical\r\nstudies, the behaviour of a chaotic quantum particle should be\r\nrandom, with statistics similar to those for random matrices.\r\nWhy should solutions of the Schrodinger equation know anything\r\nabout random matrices?  Our approach is to introduce a new model\r\nof chaotic quantum systems which allows one to consider large\r\nfamilies of systems at once.  In a sense, we are trying to\r\nshow that a `random' quantum system behaves similarly to a\r\n`random' matrix, despite the differences in these systems.\r\nSuch a model should be able to explain observations ranging from\r\nnuclear resonance levels to chemical reaction rates.\r\n",
