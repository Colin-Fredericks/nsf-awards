Morrison\r\n\r\nThis research project brings together a team of mathematicians\r\nand physicists based at three campuses to work together on string\r\ntheory.  Specific research tasks include the study of the quantum\r\ncorrections to the mypermultiplet moduli spaces in theories with\r\neight supercharges, the structure of the moduli spaces of\r\nheterotic string compactifications, M-theory models compactified\r\non seven-dimensional spaces whose global holonomy group lies in\r\nthe exceptional Lie group G2, M-theory models on Calabi-Yau\r\nfourfolds, and a study of the AdS/CFT correspondence for branes\r\nat singularities.\r\n\r\nString theory is a promising candidate for a unifying theory of\r\nthe universe at its most fundamental levels.  Although the basic\r\nidea is simple - elementary particles should be modeled as\r\nmathematical loops of stgring rather than as points - working out\r\nthe details of this theory has involved and inspired some\r\nsophisticated mathematical tools and ideas.  The task is by no\r\nmeans complete, even in an area where the synergy between\r\nmathematics and physics has been particularly productive, the\r\nstudy of the Calabi-Yau spaces that appear as solutions of the\r\nclassical string equations of motion.  This is one of three\r\nlinked awards to a research group that includes mathematicians\r\nand physicists at Duke University, Columbia University, and\r\nRutgers University.  Funds in this award provide core support for\r\nthe researchers at Duke and are supporting this interdisciplinary\r\ngroup's collaborations through videoconferencing and travel.\r\n",
