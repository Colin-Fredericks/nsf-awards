Jones and Farrell \r\nhave conjectured (\"Isomorphism Conjectures\") that the \r\nsurgery L-groups of G, L(G), and the algebraic K-groups \r\nof the integral group ring Z(G), K(Z(G)), should be \r\ncomputable in a simple way from the collections of all \r\nthe groups L(H), K(Z(H)) where H is any cyclic by finite \r\nsubgroup of G.  The truth of these conjecutures would \r\nimply rigidity results for aspherical manifolds \r\n(\"Borel Conjecture\") and also would yield much information \r\nabout the spaces of homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms \r\nof aspherical manifolds.  Jones,in collaboration with Farrell, \r\nis trying to verify the isomorphism conjectures for any group \r\nG which acts properly discontinuously via isometries on a \r\ncomplete Riemannian manifold having non-positive curvature.  \r\n \t\r\nModern day geometers and topologists are concerned with \r\n\"spaces\" and what they look like.  The surface of a donut, \r\nthe sphere and the plane are examples of 2-dimensional \r\nspaces which are all different from one another from both \r\nthe perspective of geometry and topology.  One way that \r\ntopologists study spaces (not just of dimension 2 but of\r\nhigher dimension also) is to associate to each space some \r\nalgebraic gadgets.  It is conjectured that for many \r\ninteresting spaces these algebraic gadgets act like  \r\na \"genetic code\" for the space, in that they tell us \r\nmost everything we want to know about the space.  Thus \r\nthere are two fundamental problems here: to verify this \r\n\"genetic code conjecture\"; and to decifer the genetic code \r\nfor the spaces which are of interest to geometers and topologists.\r\n\r\n",
