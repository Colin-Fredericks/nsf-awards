 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tThe plant hormone auxin plays an important role in virtually all aspects of plant growth and development, including formation of shoots and roots and responses to gravity and light. Auxin affects these processes through regulation of cell elongation, cell division, and cell differentiation. However, exactly what auxin does and how it does it at the molecular level are still poorly understood. The proposed research will increase knowledge of the molecular mechanism of auxin action in plant development by molecular characterization of the AXR6 gene of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely-studied member of the mustard family. Previous work has shown the AXR6 gene to be important for auxin function in all parts of the plant and especially in the embryo. The defects during embryogenesis in the plants with mutations in the AXR6 gene indicate that the gene is involved in patterning and normal development of the basal region of the embryo.\r\n\r\n\tThe AXR6 gene will be isolated and characterized using an approach combining genetic mapping to define the chromosomal location of the gene with testing of candidate genes identifed in the region by the Arabidopsis Genome Project. Once isolated, the gene's role in development and its biochemical function will be studied with a variety of approaches. This research should lead to a more complete understanding of plant physiology and development at the molecular level, and especially of the role of auxin. Such an understanding is fundamentally important, and will also enhance our ability to regulate plant development in desirable ways.\r\n\r\n\tThis project also includes as an integral component the training and mentoring of master's and undergraduate students. Their involvement in this research project will foster the development of laboratory skills and intellectual abilities that will enrich their lives and enable them to contribute to further progress in science. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
