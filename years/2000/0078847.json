 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Mary Wirth and her coworkers at the University of Delaware are applying methods of single molecule spectroscopy to the investigation of the phenomenon of strong adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces.  Strong binding of molecules to specific minority sites on silica and modified silica surfaces leads to poor separation in chromatographic methods.  A molecular level understanding of this strong adsorption process and diffusion of adsorbed molecular species on the silica surface is the goal of this research project.  Information gained from these studies will be useful in designing better separations media, as well as in addressing questions of protein surface interactions and biocompatibility in materials applications.  \r\n\r\nUsing single molecule spectroscopic probes, Professor Wirth and her coworkers at the University of Delaware are examining the strong interaction of molecular adsorbates with modified silica surfaces.  These spectroscopic probes provide structural information about the adsorption site, and can help to explain tailing in separations processes.  Information from these studies can also be used to design improved chromatographic materials, and can help to develop an understanding of the interactions of protein and tissue materials with implant and medical device surfaces.\r\n",
