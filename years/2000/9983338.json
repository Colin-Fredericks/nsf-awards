 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nervous system's ability to change in response to experience is exaggerated during distinct sensitive periods in development.  This is illustrated clearly by instances of early learning (e.g. language acquisition, imprinting, avian vocal learning), and by the susceptibility of developing sensory systems to early manipulations of input.  This proposal is aimed at identifying biological conditions that foster plasticity during these sensitive periods, and understanding how their timing is regulated.  The studies investigate vocal learning in songbirds, a phenomenon restricted to a discrete developmental period and controlled by a well described neural system.  An integrated series of behavioral, molecular, and anatomical investigations address the hypothesis that gonadal androgens regulate sensitive periods for learning by triggering specific neurochemical and neuroanatomical changes that influence the threshold for permanent synaptic change.  By accelerating or delaying androgen action in young birds it will be determined if androgens precipitate changes necessary and/or sufficient for terminating the sensitive period for song acquisition.  This will provide the crucial behavioral framework for two other experimental series investigating whether androgens regulate synaptic changes previously associated with the sensitive learning period.  Drawing on earlier work suggesting that vocal learning entails a competitive pruning of thalamocortical synapses mediated by activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor subtype, these studies will determine if androgens influence when learning occurs by controlling the time course of developmental changes in  NMDA receptor expression and composition.  Also, the possibility that androgens accelerate expansion and retraction of thalamocortical terminals to hasten closure of the sensitive learning period will be  investigated.  The combined results will critically address the working hypothesis that developmental changes in NMDA receptor expression and synaptic organization constrain behavioral plasticity.  Additionally, the work will broaden our understanding of how androgens affect neural and behavioral development in a context relevant to understanding the ontogeny of human language disorders.\r\n\r\n",
