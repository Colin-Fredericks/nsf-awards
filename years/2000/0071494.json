 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0071494\r\n\r\nDr. Meyer will  work on a variety of problems involving the $N$-body problem,\r\nHamiltonian systems and dynamical systems. Building on his recent work with \r\nDr. McCord on the integral manifolds of the spatial three body problem he will \r\nstudy the geometry and homology of the {\\it regularized} (compactified)\r\nintegral \r\nmanifolds of the spatial three-body problem.  These are eight-dimensional\r\nalgebraic\r\nsets which vary with the masses, energy and angular momentum of the particles. \r\nThese computations should refute Birkhoff conjecture, yield information on the\r\nexistence of cross \r\nsections, and answer the Birkhoff question on cross sections in the negative as\r\nthey did  in the non-regularized problem. As another application of the rich\r\ntopology found in the integral manifolds of the three-body problem, he will use\r\nvariational arguments to establish new classes of periodic solutions. Dr. Meyer\r\nwill also work on (i) simplifying the proof of the existence of Xia diffusion\r\nin the three-body problem; (ii) the existence of comet-like \r\nperiodic orbits in the N-body problem; (iii)  establishing the stability of an\r\nequilibrium point of a Hamiltonian system in the case of 1:1 resonance; and\r\n(iv) the evolution and bifurcation of invariant manifolds of a Hamiltonian\r\nsystem which depend on a parameter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Meyer will work on a number of problems in the qualitative theory of the\r\nequations \r\nwhich describe the motion of mechanical systems and celestial bodies, namely\r\nHamiltonian systems.  One of the important equations of this type is the N-body\r\nproblem which describes \r\nthe motion of N masses -- the planets.  Systems of this type typically conserve\r\nenergy and momentum and these conservation laws place global restrictions on\r\nthe possible motion of the bodies.  Dr. Meyer has an ongoing research program\r\nstudying the ramifications of these \r\nconserved quantities on the nature of the motion.  Dr. Meyer will also\r\ninvestigate the existence of regular and chaotic motions in these systems and\r\nhow these types of motions depend of various physical parameters.  One type of\r\nregular motion he will establish is \r\nperiodic motions in the N-body problem and one type of chaotic motion he will\r\ntry to establish is known as Xia diffusion. Dr. Meyer will also study the\r\nevolution of the stable manifold of equilibrium solutions i.e. the evolution of\r\nthe set of solutions which tend to \r\nan equilibrium (the stable manifold).  \r\n",
