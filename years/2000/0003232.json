The goal of the HBCU-UP Program is to strengthen the Nation's workforce by enhancing the quality of undergraduate Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (SMET) programs at HBCUs.  Support from the Foundation will enable the QEM Network to:\r\n\r\n(1) provide on-site technical assistance to six of the 1999 and six of the 2000 HBCU-UP awardee institutions with technical assistance linked to critical needs identified within each of the targeted institution's HBCU-UP funded projects;\r\n(2) enlarge the pool of potential HBCU-UP grantees through the conduct each year of The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network is requesting two years of support from the National Science foundation (NSF) to provide technical assistance in the Foundation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU-UP) Program.  The goal of the HBCU-UP Program is to strengthen the Nation's workforce by enhancing the quality of undergraduate Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (SMET) programs at HBCUs.\r\n (3) utilize the regional workshops to offer general technical assistance to, and serve as a dissemination vehicle for all current HBCU-UP grantees.\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes are that each of the six targeted 1999 and of the 2000 HBCU-UP grantees will successfully achieve their expected accomplishments for the year in which technical assistance is provided.  In addition, at lease 20 (67 percent) of the 30 HBCUs participating in the invitational regional workshops in years one and two will submit HBCU-UP proposals, at lease 10 (50 percent) of which will be successful the following year in obtaining HBCU-UP awards.\r\n\r\nIn year two, special workshop sessions will be held for institutions whose proposals were unsuccessful in the previous year's competition.  HBCUs that participated in the workshops in year one but did not submit proposals in the next Program competition will be replaced with new HBCUs if they do not demonstrate sufficient commitment to submitting a proposal during the next competition.\r\n",
