 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this multidisciplinary research program is to understand the historical origins and environmental conditions that led to selection and radiation of the major eucaryotic phytoplankton taxa, and the ecological processes that contribute to their continued success in the contemporary ocean. The research utilizes a combination of geological, molecular biological, ecological, and modeling approaches to address an important and complex puzzle in Earth system science. The primary goal is to develop the first quantitative models of eucaryotic phytoplankton community structure in the contemporary oceans based on paleoecological and evolutionary inference. The central question raised in this project is: Why have three phylogenetically diverse groups of eucaryotic, unicellular algae been so ecologically successful and what does their evolutionary history tell us about the history of Earth and the ability of eucaryotic phytoplankton to accommodate to change in the future?\r\nThe study seeks to test a set of three related hypotheses, from which a conceptual model for evolution and ecological success (dominance) of key phytoplankton taxa in the contemporary ocean will be developed. Thus the research program contains three basic elements: (1) A geological/geochemical team focussing on reconstructing the paleoecology at key periods in the Mesozoic; (11) A molecular biology/biochemical team engaged in elucidating how paleoecological processes have selected specific phenotypic traits that led to the origin and subsequent tempo of evolution of the major groups, and (111) An experimental ecophysiology/modeling group that quantitatively evaluates how phenotypic traits relate to the ecological success of specific taxa in the historical and contemporary ocean. These three elements will be integrated across traditional disciplinary lines and will include coordinated field, laboratory and modeling efforts. Modeling efforts will be directed towards hindcasting and forecasting the success of key phytoplankton groups using observational and experimental information.\r\nThe research program is also coupled to a strong educational effort, designed to provide a broad exposure and opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a K-12 and teacher training program designed to integrate Earth system science in primary and secondary school curricula.\r\n",
