The specific applications are in opthamology.  Developing the technology requires facing and overcoming several fundamental barriers that have plague computer vision systems.  These include poor quality image data during surgery, difficult to model biological tissues, large scale and unpredictable motions of the eye, a need for extreme accuracy over long duration, a need for predictable response in a real-time implementation, and a need for transparency of the system as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe computer vision technology will distinguish these instruments by making them \"spatially-aware\".  This means they include capabilities for spatially mapping and spatial referencing.  Spatial mapping is the problem of building and maintaining a seamless, wide-area map (mosaic) of the three-dimensional region of surgical interest and its surrounding.  This map will be constructed from images acquired during diagnostic exploration and forms the basis for absolute and hence verifiable spatial referencing.\r\n\r\nNovel aspects of the work in mapping include:  (1) a fast, recursive technique for tracing elongated structures and then detecting their branching and cross-over points, (2) a feature-based image-to-image matching algorithm that used a high-order transformation model and a hierarchy of robust estimation techniques, (3) a joint optimization of all image-to-mosaic transformations simultaneously, and (4) a 3-D reconstruction of the retinal surface despite an inherent inability to calibrate the imaging system.   These techniques are each useful in other domains besides ophthalmology.\r\n",
