 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nationwide there are only a few opportunities for upper-level undergraduates and beginning graduate students to gain experience in summer courses in neuroscience research.  To make an opportunity available in the southeastern United States, a summer course was started at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama in 1997, which can exploit the availability of simple marine organisms for introductory experiments.  This lab has excellent classroom and laboratory facilities with a research-quality library, and dormitory living.  The summer course provides an introduction to neuroscience and behavior, and has enrolled 10-15 students per year.  This award provides funds for additional laboratory equipment for the course to meet the increasing student demand.\r\n     The impact of this course upgrade will be in enabling more students in a new geographical area to gain experience with laboratory research techniques, and in fostering their potential career choices.\r\n",
