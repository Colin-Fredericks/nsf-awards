 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nEngineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nElectric drives and power electronics are enabling technologies for important applications such as robotics and automated factories. The energy conservation is estimated to save an equivalent of the energy consumed by the state of New York, electric and hybrid-electric vehicles that will reshape the trillion dollar/year automotive industry, the emerging micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and vital space and defense applications. This project is making a significant step towards reversing the national trend of falling enrollments in related course.\r\n\r\nThe project is developing an innovative curricula for Electric Drives(machines) and Power Electronics courses. The courses are based on the use of the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) software for control of various electric machines and drives. Specifically, laboratory manuals for both instructors and students are being developed. This DSP-based laboratory uses rapid prototyping tool and is providing students with real-world experiences. Real examples from industry are used to teach students the basic concepts of energy conversion. A natural extension of this effort is digital control of power electronics experiments, which meshes well with the trend towards digital control in industry, thus making students better prepared. \r\n\r\nThe project has 9 test-sites, Auburn University, Tuskegee University, Drexel University, Arizona State University, Howard University, Texas Tech University, Oregon State University, University of Missiouri-Rolla, and Penn State University, which will also serve as the regional distribution centers. In addition, the laboratory manuals will be disseminated by the use of the internet allowing for exchange of innovative ideas and suggestions for improvement.\r\n",
