 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation  Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an innovative approach for measuring vibration during characterization of advanced machine tools as well as during the machining process.  The approach uses a fluid jet as a probe that will make an accurate, robust, and low cost sensor.  The growing demand for high-speed milling, as well as increasing use of small size tools and difficult-to-machine advanced materials, call for improved characterization of machine tools and for controlling vibration and chatter during the machining process.  To do this, advanced machine systems must rely on accurate sensors to measure and to control vibrations.  Sensor requirements are: (1) accurate vibration measurements; (2) impervious to the machining environment; (3) dual use for characterization prior to operation and for monitoring during the milling process; and (4) small size and low cost.  To date, commercially available sensors  do not meet these requirements, whereas the Phase I sensor is expected to satisfy much of the need.\r\n\r\nThe fluid probe, as part of a machine control system, has the potential to reduce machine tool vibrations, thereby improving surface finish and increasing throughput.  The same sensor will be used both for characterization of the machine tools and for monitoring during machining.  The principal commercial market for the fluid probe is the machine tool industry.  Machining performance is critical in many industrial sectors, including automotive, aerospace, and rapid prototyping.",
