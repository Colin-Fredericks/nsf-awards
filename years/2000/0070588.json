The principal investigator plans to continue her research on the theory of commutant lifting theorem, including the numerical \r\naspect and the generalization to the multioperator setting. \r\nAt the same time, the principal investigator will continue her \r\nresearch on sums of eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators, \r\nand its connections with intersection theory in algebraic \r\ngeometry, Young tableaux, and representation theory. \r\n\r\nThis project is to try to obtain  a better understanding of the theory of linear\r\noperators acting on Hilbert space (``operator theory''). There are two main \r\nresearch areas that this proposal will focus on. \r\nOne is in the area of the theory of commutant lifting thorem, \r\nwhich has proven to be useful in control theory in engineering. \r\nThe other one is on a problem about eigenvalues of sums of (self-\r\nadjoint) operators. This problem originated in a celebrated \r\npaper of Weyl in 1912 while he was studying partial \r\ndifferential equations. Only recently that there was a \r\nsignificant break through and the solution depends on \r\nsome very deep theorems in algebraic geometry. It is our \r\nhope that this project will bring some insight into the \r\nproblem from the operator theory point of view. Furthermore we want \r\nto extend the existing theory to a setting that can be applied to \r\nquantum physics. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
