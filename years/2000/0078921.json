 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has as its goal the development of effective and general catalysts for the asymmetric Heck reaction.  Work in this direction focuses on the use of elaborated BINAP-phosphine ligands where significant enantioselectivity was demonstrated in an acyclic substrate.  Possible transition states of this class of phosphine ligand in asymmetric cyclization were suggested to aid in the rational design of additional catalysts.  Application in alkaloid synthesis and the use of solid supported palladium complexes in asymmetric catalysis will also be investigated.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Program's Organic Synthesis Program supports the research of Professor Duy H. Hua of Kansas State University.  Professor Hua studies a particular type of reaction known as the Heck reaction, which has many potential applications in the synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules.  However, one weakness of this reaction is its inability to govern the three-dimensional aspect of molecular assembly.  Professor Hua has made strides in this direction, and will continue to do so with the support of the Organic Synthesis Program.\r\n",
