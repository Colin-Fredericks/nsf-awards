 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project is focused on Internet telephony and novel ad-hoc data distribution\r\ntechniques.\r\n     In the area of Internet telephony research, the research proposes to focus on the following topics:\r\n\r\n     Programming Internet telephony services: The research proposes new mechanisms for programming In-ternet telephony services, usable by both end users and service providers.  The mechanisms\r\nare designed to be robust, offer predictable performance and allow a large set of users to\r\nsafely share server resources. The programming facilities are to be enhanced with a graphical\r\nservice creation environment for Internet telephony.\r\n     Feature interaction: The research plans to investigate the problem of feature interaction in Internet telephony, as the feature interaction problem differs significantly from that encountered in traditional\r\ntelephony.\r\n     Collaborative call filtering: The research plans to design, implement and analyze a system that allows Internet users to collaborate in filtering undesirable calls, based on group preferences.  This\r\navoids the current reliance on unlisted phone numbers and answering machines for call filtering.\r\n     Scaling Resource Reservation: Particularly for the large number of small flows anticipated for\r\nInternet telephony, associated with their stringent delay and loss requirements, scaling resource\r\nreservations is of vital importance.  The research proposes to investigate the performance of two\r\nnew scaling mechanisms, sink-tree reservations as part of the Border Gateway Reservation\r\nProtocol (BGRP) and partial reservations.\r\n     Performance prediction: The research plans to investigate simple statistical characterizations that predict\r\nthe performance of a variety of standard forward error correction and playout delay algorithms\r\nfor packet voice.\r\n     911 services: Internet telephony offers the opportunity to significantly enhance emergency call\r\nservices compared to existing mechanisms.  The research plans to investigate how to reliably identify\r\nusers and grant temporary access to personal data to medical personnel, without having to\r\nstore medical data in centralized locations.\r\n     Mobility: The research proposes to investigate application-layer mobility mechanisms to complement traditional IP-layer mobility, potentially affording greater security and faster hand-off, with no\r\nnetwork infrastructure modifications required.\r\n     In addition, the research proposes a new data and media distribution system, e*meme, that allows data to\r\npropagate in ad-hoc networks where network nodes are only sporadically connected to the wide-area\r\nnetwork, as is the case in areas where wireless connectivity is spotty.  The research plans to investigate\r\nefficient, popularity-based cache replication algorithms, taking into account the particular considerations\r\nof power- and storage-limited mobile computers.\r\n\r\n",
