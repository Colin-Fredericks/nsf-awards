The following objectives will be pursued over the 18-month project period: 1) To provide in-depth opportunities for K-12 teachers to increase their knowledge, understanding, and skills concerning key topics in the geosciences, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, and how to provide developmentally appropriate, inquiry-based, and interdisciplinary instruction.  2) To motivate participating teachers to integrate geoscience content and the use of GIS software into their local classrooms and buildings.  3) To strengthen collaborative linkages among K-12 educators, higher education faculty, and other researchers and professionals in the geosciences.  A 15-day geosciences institute for 20 teachers (primarily middle and high school, although elementary teachers will also be encouraged to apply), will be held in summer 2001, covering key topics in the geosciences (climatology, geomorphology, oceanography, volcanology, hydrology and glaciology, plate tectonics, petrology and soil science, natural hazards, and graduation, erosion, and sedimentation) and introducing the ArcView GIS software developed by the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) K-12 Schools and Libraries Program.  Institute workshops will be led by faculty and researchers from local colleges/universities and agencies/organizations such as the National Weather Service, American Meteorological Society, and Oregon Office of Ocean Policy.  Five days of the institute will focus on teacher team research using ArcView GIS to examine a particular question or issue in the geosciences.  Participating teachers will receive an ArcView GIS site license, and will develop and implement lesson plans and classroom projects that are based on their institute research.  Participants will also provide in-service presentations for other teachers in their local schools.   The lessons and projects institute participants develop will be reviewed by the principal investigator, district science specialists, the PPS Science Core Team of teachers, and collaborating researchers in terms of developmental appropriateness, geosciences content, alignment with inquiry-based approaches, grade-level achievement benchmarks in science, interdisciplinary connections, and effective use of the GIS technology.  Follow-up workshops scheduled at the beginning of the fall 2001 school year will allow teachers to refine their plans, share them with colleagues and professional researchers, and continue to improve their skills in using the software as part of high-quality geoscience education.  A geosciences lecture series featuring leading researchers will be established.  An advisory committee will provide oversight in meeting the project's stated objectives and timeline; foster collaboration among K-12 educators, college/university faculty, and other researchers in the geosciences representing government agencies and professional organizations; and plan for ongoing networking among project participants and the collaborative partnership.  Results will be shared via presentations at local, regional, and national meetings and conferences; articles and materials posted electronically; and progress reports to the funding agency, and other appropriate audiences.\r\n",
