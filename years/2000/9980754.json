 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests support for the fourth bi-annual open-invitation Conference on Zebrafish Development and Genetics.  The meeting will focus on the developmental biology, genetics and genomics of the zebrafish.  It will emphasize the cellular, molecular, and genetic regulation of development and growth in zebrafish, the only vertebrate in which systematic large scale screens for embryonic lethal mutations have been conducted.  The following sessions are planned:  1) Early development and patterning I; 2) Neural development; 3) Axonal pathfinding; 4) Neural crest and sensory organs; 5) Genomics and genetic strategies; 6) Methods and new technology; 7) Cell differentiation; 8) Cell fate choices; 9) Cell signalling; 10) Tissue and organ patterning; and 11) Zebrafish as a model for human disease.  The Keynote address will be given by an investigator whose primary interest is not zebrafish, but who is likely to stimulate zebrafish workers to broaden their ways of thinking about the ways they approach their research topic.  The proposed meeting will attract members from most zebrafish laboratories, and will provide an open arena for the presentation of the latest research results.  It will also provide an opportunity for the exchange of materials and information about evolving technologies and methodological approaches.  About 480 people attended the previous meeting and presentations were given by investigators from 26 countries.\r\n\r\n",
