The Cape Hatteras is a 135 ft. vessel, constructed in 1981, and is owned by NSFand operated by Duke University.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 190 operational days during 2000, of which 84 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support Navy, NOAA, and State projects.  The projects scheduled on the Cape Hatteras represent several oceanographic disciplines, including marine geology and geophysics and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel. Operations in 2000 will mainly take place in the North Atlantic ranging from Boothbay, ME to Florida.  The vessel will be in the shipyard for most of January.  Plans for a mid-life refit are underway, with a target date of actual shipyard time taking place in September-December 2001.  The refit includes plans for a 24 ft midbody addition to the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe Cape Hatteras is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
