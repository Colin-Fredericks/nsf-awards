 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to identify the essential mechanisms used by eukaryotic cells to control the transport and location of subcellular structures and macromolecules within the cell.  Such movement and regulation of subcellular location is absolutely critical to the life of the cell.  Eukaryotic cells have exceptional transport requirements for the movement of membrane-bound organelles among intracellular compartments, maintaining the position of intracellular compartments in the cytosolic space, ensuring proper distribution of genetic material at cell division, and changing cell shape.  Eukaryotes have evolved a specialized class of proteins, called molecular motors, that are responsible for many intracellular transport phenomena. Molecular motors are enzymes that, through the energy of ATP hydrolysis, generate forces sufficient for movement along actin and microtubule cytoskeletal tracks. Molecular motors bind to intracellular cargoes such as chromosomes, organelles, and cytoskeletal elements. Subsequent binding of the motor-cargo complex to the cytoskeletal tracks facilitates active directional movement within the cytoplasm.  Although much is known about how actin and microtubule motors transform the energy of ATP hydrolysis into work, the cellular mechanisms controlling motor-cargo interactions, directional movement within the cell, and dissociation of the motor-cargo complex upon arrival at its cellular \"destination\" are largely unknown. This investigation will address the extremely important question of how the microtubule-based motor protein, kinesin, \"knows\" which subcellular element to move, to where, and when. Current plausible hypotheses propose that protein receptors on the surface of kinesin's intracellular cargoes mediate kinesin-cargo interactions. In addition, previous investigations suggest that kinesin may be a target of phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways, thereby suggesting a mechanism for controlling kinesin-dependent motility in response to the transport requirements of the cell. To test these hypotheses, the genetically-tractable and well-characterized model organism, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, will be employed.  Proteins that bind to Drosophila kinesin will be identified and characterized. First, the yeast two-hybrid system will be used to screen Drosophila cDNA libraries for genes that encode kinesin-associated proteins (KAPs). Sequence analysis and in vitro binding experiments will determine which genes merit further attention. Drosophila genetic tools will be used to identify mutations in KAP-encoding genes to study their in vivo function, as well as possible genetic interactions with kinesin mutations. KAP-specific antisera will be generated and used to study the subcellular localization of kinesin-associated proteins, both in fixed tissue and subcellular fractions. Preliminary experiments have identified the kinesin binding protein KAP94E, which will be analyzed further. Second, membrane-bound KAPs will be identified by affinity purification of kinesin from Drosophila extracts enriched for kinesin cargoes such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and vesicles. By forwarding the analysis of the structure and function of kinesin receptors and regulatory molecules, these investigations have the potential to unravel the mechanisms controlling kinesin-dependent intracellular transport, and, more generally, will provide testable models that inform future investigations of molecular motor function and regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
