The programs that are formally linked to the UC-AGEP include: LSAMP, MESA-MEP, Ronald McNair Scholars, MARC, MBRS, and UCLEADS.  Additionally, each UC campus has developed links to undergraduate institutions that graduate large numbers of minority students with bachelor's degrees in SMET.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, the UC Office of the President assumes responsibility for routine coordination, data management, and communication with NSF regarding funding and reporting requirements.  To facilitate communication and collaboration among the campuses, two working groups (one in Northern California and one in Southern California) have been formed, and will meet at least twice each year.\r\n",
