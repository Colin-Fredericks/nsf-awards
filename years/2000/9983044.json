 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many organisms, including butterflies and some other insects, have very different larval and adult life stages. Many aspects of the life style, including food sources, differ between these life stages. Species differ in the quality and quantity of adult food available to them, resulting in differences among species in the relative importance of adult and larval food in egg production and adult survival, or life history traits. These patterns of importance of nutrients from different life stages determine the timing of egg production, and the nutrient make-up of the egg. Our work on nutrient allocation to eggs from larval and adult sources is aimed at understanding the constraints on possible combinations of feeding and reproductive habits, as well as the likely persistence of species in different environments.\r\n\r\nWe will use natural variation in stable carbon isotope ratios of food sources as a tool for tracing the origin of nutrients used to make eggs.  We will address three hypotheses. The first addresses how allocation varies among six species of Lepidoptera that differ naturally in availability and quality of adult food.  We will determine if the source of nutrients allocated to reproduction (i.e., larval food vs. adult food) varies with adult feeding ecology. The second hypothesis concerns the chemical identity of the two nutrient pools. This information allows us to understand the physiological mechanisms governing the relative use of larval and adult dietary nutrients in eggs. The third hypothesis explores how ecological factors, namely variation in nectar availability and time spent in flight, may affect allocation patterns within a species. Individuals of one species will be kept under varying conditions of food availability, and will be induced to fly for varying lengths of time daily.  Stable carbon isotope composition of eggs from these individuals will be analyzed to yield understand how allocation to reproduction interacts with feeding conditions and flight expenditure.  This experiment allows the extrapolation of our results to a field setting.\r\n\r\nThe results of our proposed work will provide information on the relationships among nutritional ecology, energy metabolism, and reproduction. This information has particular practical value for butterflies and other insects, many species of which are threatened or are important indicators in conservation biology. More generally, however, the proposed research will provide an important conceptual and empirical foundation for further work on both nutrient dynamics and the evolution of life histories. \r\n\r\n",
