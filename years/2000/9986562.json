Scholars in different fields work largely in isolation from each other.  To capitalize both on the advances of the past and on the present energy directed to group research, it is important to link disparate areas and to foster integrative positions.  We propose an extended conference of about 30 group theorists and researchers from diverse fields to take stock of the major findings in group research and to assess the current status of theory.  To promote constructive discussion among the different viewpoints the conference will be structured as follows: (1) it will incorporate extended periods of work through electronic group conferencing to articulate positions and search for commonalities, differences, and insights; and (2) it will utilize a two-stage conference structure that asks participants first to develop their preferred theories in their own terms and then to develop integrative positions between theories.  Expected products include books that integrate existing theory and research across fields, an agenda for future work, and development of an approach for interdisciplinary groups of scholars to engage in distributed work.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
