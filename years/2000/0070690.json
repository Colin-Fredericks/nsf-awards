 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to use microlocal techniques (including Fourier integral\r\noperators with complex phase) to study the following topics in global\r\nanalysis:  (A) The Toda PDE, a large N limit of the Toda lattice, in\r\nthe periodic and non-periodic cases.  Topics to be researched include\r\nlarge N estimates relating Toda lattice solutions and solutions to the\r\nToda PDE, and shock formation.  (B) Spectral problems for the\r\nLaplacian, including the semi-classical asymptotics of the scattering\r\nmatrix in manifolds with cylindrical ends.  (C) Symplectic geometry,\r\nvia generalized Szego kernels.  Specifically, the asymptotics of\r\nKodaira-type embeddings and the relationship between symplectic\r\ncapacities and geometric quantization will be researched.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quantum-classical correspondence is a deep feature of Nature,\r\nadmitting a variety of mathematical manifestations.  In general terms,\r\nthese manifestations take the form of relationships between dynamical\r\nsystems (systems of ordinary differential equations) and partial\r\ndifferential equations, in suitable asymptotic regimes (the\r\nsemi-classical limit).  The proposed research will investigate some\r\nsuch relationships, in the general areas of completely-integrable\r\ndynamical systems, the geometry of the Laplace operator, and\r\ndifferential geometry.  A particularly novel aspect of the proposed\r\nresearch is to the Toda PDE, a large N limit of the Toda lattice.  The\r\nproposed research will result in a deeper understanding of certain\r\nnon-linear partial differential equations, and of the geometry of phase\r\nspaces (symplectic manifolds).\r\n",
