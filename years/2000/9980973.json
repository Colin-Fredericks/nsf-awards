 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nAlmost no statistician would consider analyzing a data set by hand since the computer serves as the primary tool for every modern data analyst. While almost every introductory statistics course has some computer component, there have been numerous problems with providing students access to data and software, which have limited the impact of the computer in the area of statistical education.  The World Wide Web (WWW) can be used to solve many of the problems, which have impeded the full implementation of computer-based data analysis in basic statistical education. Students can now gain easy access to data and software to analyze it via the WWW. With this goal in mind, the PI's have created a statistical package called WebStat which runs as a Java applet. Using the platform independent features of Java, this package runs within all common WWW browsers and on every major computer platform. The project is designing a WWW site around WebStat software which will enable instructors from across the country to easily introduce students to modern data analysis using the full capabilities of the software. The site will feature a pool of meaningful exercises in data analysis from which instructors may setup assignments for their students. The site will have the capability to track, grade and accumulate student responses to a variety of questions testing their data analysis skills. The ultimate goal of the project is to enhance student comprehension of elementary statistics by supplying a flexible system of practice exercises which emphasize data analysis skills and the interpretation of results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
