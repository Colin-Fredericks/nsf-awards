 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies connections between knot complexity\r\nand polygonal knot spaces, and develops effective methods to\r\nquantify and and characterize knots.  The project involves\r\ncomputation and software development as well as analysis and\r\nexperiments.  With colleagues and students, the investigator\r\nexplores relationships between various experimental measurements\r\nof complexity of knots in physical materials, such as DNA and\r\npolymers, and mathematical characterizations of knot complexity.\r\nPreviously defined functions, such as energies and rope-length,\r\nare compared to new quantities, such as measurements of the\r\nconvex hull and of a \"smallest\" box containing the knot, to\r\ncapture various spatial characteristics.  These quantities\r\npredict the types of knots that are encountered as one moves\r\nthrough knot space.  They also are used to understand changes\r\nthat occur in small and large-scale knotting in polygonal knot\r\nspace as a result of perturbations.\r\n     From DNA replication to unraveling one's garden hose,\r\nknotting and tangling are a part of many physical systems.  Some\r\nknots are easier to tie (i.e. less complex), and thus more likely\r\nto occur in these situations.  How does one quantify the\r\ncomplexity of a knot?  What measurable attributes fully explain\r\nthe complexity of a mathematical knot (i.e. a closed loop in\r\nspace)?  Mathematicians have defined several functions, called\r\n\"knot energies\" that quantify the \"tangledness\" of knots.\r\nSimultaneously, scientists have completed physical experiments on\r\nknots made of real materials, such as DNA and polymers, that\r\ndetermine other measures of complexity.  To what extent are the\r\ntheoretical and experimental quantities related?  Are the\r\nquantities delivering the same information or does each number\r\nreveal something different about the knot?  In particular, can\r\none use these functions to create more realistic physical models\r\nof DNA?  In this project, the investigator, colleagues, and\r\nstudents explore the quantification of knot complexity and its\r\nrelation to spaces of polygonal knots by integrating theory with\r\ncomputer simulation.  Previously defined theoretical measures,\r\nsuch as energies and rope-length, are compared to new quantities,\r\nsuch as the surface area and volume of the convex hull, to\r\ncapture various spatial characteristics related to the knot.\r\nPhysical experiments and computer simulations are performed and\r\nstatistical analysis applied to understand their interrelations.\r\nThese quantities also predict the types of knots that are\r\nencountered as one moves through polygonal knot space and\r\nexplains changes that occur in small and large-scale knotting as\r\na result of perturbations.  This provides scientists with a\r\nbetter understanding of the mathematical models that are\r\ncurrently employed and suggest refinements to improve these\r\nmodels.",
