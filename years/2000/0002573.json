Respondents between the ages of 28 and 35 will be interviewed regarding three dimensions of relationships: practices, ideals, and expectations.  Results will be used to test hypotheses regarding how individuals make sense of their relationships, as well as some anticipated differences in the ways women and men structures their beliefs and practices.  Life history analyses will capture biographical details and perceptions as women and men account for their views and experiences.  Results will add to understanding of communication patterns, experiences, and gender differences in views of what close relationships mean, and what they should be.",
