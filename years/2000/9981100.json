 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Materials Science (57)\r\nThis project addresses the national need to educate plastics engineering technicians in the art and science of blow molding. Specifically, it addresses the expansion and dissemination of plastics curriculum at Pennsylvania College of Technology (Penn College) to include hands-on experiences in extrusion and injection stretch-blow molding technology with accompanying commercially viable laboratory educational materials. Curriculum development includes a focused, sophomore level blow molding course and inclusion of blow molding education within other survey and advanced courses. Laboratory experience is building on an existing extrusion blow molder by purchase and installation of a state-of-the-art polyethylene terephthalate (PET) stretch-blow molder, and fabrication of a vital piece of testing equipment--a polarized light table to measure product quality. Outcomes include: 1) establishment of a unique, nationally-relevant facility representing an academically based, commercial stretch-blow-molding curriculum; 2) enhancement of Penn College's plastics curriculum to offer students broader plastics education, making them more competitive in the marketplace and better able to adapt to a changing world of manufacturing technology; 3) introductory and advanced educational and professional development opportunities for secondary students and teachers, post-secondary faculty, and plastics technicians. \r\n\r\n",
