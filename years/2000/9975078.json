 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study explores the dialect of children and adults in a rural community in northern Vermont.  This community and the study include both European-Americans and Abenakis -- a Native American indigenous group.  The speakers, aged two through adulthood, will be interviewed and tape recorded, and both the content of the speakers' interviews and the features of their dialects will be used to examine the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. How do children acquire their dialects?  How does their speech resemble and not resemble that of their parents and peers?  How does the dialect-learning process of the children, in turn, affect the dialect of the speech community as a whole?\r\n\r\n2. Are there differences among the speakers in the dialect features they use?  If so, can this variation be related to social factors present in the community, such as gender, age, ethnicity, and attitude about and level of involvement in the community or in rural life?\r\n\r\n3. How do the dialect features found in northern Vermont speakers today compare with those reported in the literature 60 years ago (Kurath 1939-1943)?  Are any changes that may be found indicative of possible dialect death?\r\n\r\nKurath, H. (1939-1943) Linguistic Atlas of New England (vols. 1-3).  Providence, RI: Brown University Press.",
