 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0071202\r\nJulius L. Shaneson \r\n\r\nMost of the proposal concerns applications of relations\r\nbetween continuous and discrete summation in higher \r\ndimensions.  Such a relation is called an Euler-MacLaurin \r\nformula, and describes how to sum a function over a set of\r\nlattice points in a geometric region in terms of integrals \r\nof the function and its derivatives on the region and parts \r\nof the boundary.  For polynomial functions summed on lattice \r\npoints of a polytope with lattice point vertices, there are \r\nexact, closed formulae for doing this, due to the proposer \r\nand S. Cappell, obtained as  consequences of their results \r\non characteristic classes of singular varieties.  For general (transcendental) functions, there are approximate formulae of \r\ngiven length, together with remainder terms involving \r\ndifferential operators whose coefficients are related to generalizations of the classical Bernoulli polynomials on \r\nthe real line.  The capability to handle trascendental \r\nfunctions makes possible the use Euler-MacLaurin formulae \r\nthe study the growth of the number of lattice points in smooth \r\nregions, such as circles or the regions under a hyperboloid, \r\nas the figure expands. \r\n\r\nA lattice point can be thought of as a vertex point in a multidimensional grid or lattice-work. Results relating \r\nsummation over such points to some continuous summation \r\nprocess, i.e. some type of integration method, can \r\nimpact numerous applied mathematics problems, including \r\nrapid integration schemes, problems in network capacity, and \r\noptimization issues in shipping and communications.  \r\nIn addition, questions concerning the number of lattice \r\npoints in smooth regions, especially certain very symmetric \r\nones like circles or parts of hyperboloids, are well-known \r\nto arise in central parts of number theory, and good estimates \r\non these could lead to new results on the distribution of prime \r\nnumbers and other important questions. Finally, these counting \r\nmethods might be good test cases for the problems (\"P = NP\") of logic/computer science concerning the miminum time needed \r\nto perform certain kinds of computations.\r\n",
