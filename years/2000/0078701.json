 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research on the synthesis and characterization of new cluster compounds of the early transition metal elements W, Ta and Mo with chlorine ligands by Professor Louis Messerle of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa. New, low temperature solid state and solution techniques are employed for the preparation of these complexes, as well as reactivity studies. Characterization is accomplished by means of X-ray diffraction, NMR, electrospray MS and UV-vis spectroscopy. The physical measurements are supported by molecular orbital calculations.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to use low-temperature methods recently developed in the Principle Investigator's laboratory to synthesize new metal atom cluster compounds, and to determine their physical and chemical properties. These complexes will be useful for the production of many other organometallic and coordination compounds, and may they find applications as magnetic materials and in medical diagnostics as contrast agents. Many of the results of this work will be integrated into laboratory courses, and the undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project will learn a breadth of skills in both synthesis and instrumental methods as well as gain experience in an effort which links fundamental chemistry with medical and material applications.\r\n",
