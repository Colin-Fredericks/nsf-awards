 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapidly expanding information superhighway allows the storage and retrieval of\r\ninformation in a highly distributed information infrastructure. Yet this infrastructure\r\nrequires users to maintain a fixed and universally known position in the network,\r\nwhich restricts user mobility and portability, so users can not access data from\r\nanywhere and at any time. Now the next step is to make the information superhighway\r\navailable to mobile users. But this requires fundamental research that takes mobility,\r\nvariable communication conditions, energy limitations and high frequency of disconnection\r\ninto account when providing access to this distributed information infrastructure. To\r\nreach this goal, intensive cooperation of researchers from a number of different\r\ncommunities\r\nincluding the different wireless, distributed systems and information systems communities\r\nis necessary. Such collaboration currently appears at a risk. In view of this, our\r\nobjective is to\r\ndefine and establish a common infrastructure of the discipline and to develop a consensus\r\nbased document that will provide a foundation for implementation and standardization as\r\nwell as further research. This infrastructure will foster collaboration between these\r\ndifferent communities. Such collaboration is necessitated by teh current needs of\r\nwireless\r\ntechnologies, if new horizons of research and development are to be achieved in the next\r\nmillennium.",
