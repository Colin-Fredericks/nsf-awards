This proposal focuses on the genetic details\r\nthat tell cells to form the ear and where to form.  The mammalian ear\r\nformation involves a series of different signals from different adjacent\r\ntissues.  However, despite much speculation as to the signals from\r\nneighboring tissues, the identity of the signals and how the cells\r\ncommunicate with each other are not known.  A gene called Eyes absent 1 has\r\nbeen knocked out in mice.  Mutations in the same gene in fruit flies cause\r\nno eye formation.  Interestingly, Eya1 mutant mice develop no ears and the\r\ncells normally forming the ear die from very early embryonic stages,\r\nindicating that Eya1 is a key early gene required for ear development.\r\nThis proposal will use Eya1- and other Eya-deficient mice to study how the\r\nmammalian ears form in appropriate places in the body by molecular and\r\ngenetic approaches.\r\n\tThis project begins to dissect out the molecular and genetic\r\ninformation required for normal formation of the mammalian ear.  Thus, the\r\nmajor significance of the proposed studies is that they represent one of\r\nthe first attempts to define specific gene function in the context of the\r\nnormal developmental mechanisms operating in ear formation.",
