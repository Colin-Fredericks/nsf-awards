 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Signal transduction\" refers to the steps involved in transmitting a signal that is initiated by the binding of a growth factor at the cell surface, and is relayed to the nucleus (to alter gene expression), to the cytoskeleton (to alter cell shape and motility) or to the cytoplasm (to control the amount of specific mRNA in the cell).  The study of signal transduction is important because it reveals mechanisms via which extrinsic signals can influence the phenotype of the cell.\r\n\r\nIt has recently been documented that the purine nucleoside inosine induces unprecedented levels of axonal sprouting in the mature rat brain after injury.  In light of this finding, Dr. Jhaveri will explore the molecular mechanism via which inosine is able to regulate axon growth.  These experiments will be carried out in cell culture using PC12 cells.  In particular, Dr. Jhaveri will  study the role of a specific kinase (N-kinase) that is an important intermediary in the signal-transduction pathway that leads from inosine signaling to process outgrowth.  The experiments fit into an ongoing research program in the laboratory of Dr. Larry Benowitz,  at the Children's Hospital, Boston.  Dr. Benowitz and his colleague Dr. Nina Irwin have both agreed to give Dr. Jhaveri the requisite training for undertaking these studies.  In the course of this work, Dr. Jhaveri will become familiar with techniques for protein isolation, designing primers, PCR, cDNA library screening, analysis of protein phosphorylation, generation of mutations, and cell transfection.\r\n\r\nThis is a critical juncture in Dr. Jhaveri's career.  The POWRE award will allow her to gain some training in molecular biology; lack of such training has repeatedly been a perceived weakness in her research program.  Dr. Jhaveri hopes, in the near future, to apply for a tenure-track faculty position with an independent laboratory, and the training she will gain will greatly facilitate such an upward career move.",
