 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from AT Sciences will develop algorithms and software that allows screen reading software to be used by the visually disabled to access computers to respond to changes in task context while the user is browsing the World WideWeb (WWW).  Some screen readers can adapt their behavior to the current context of the active application through application-specific scripts--sophisticated macros that determine the behavior of the screen reader in response to the current state of the application.  Most screen readers do not provide this capability, however, and no screen reading software allows users to associate scripts with individual web pages or sites (linked collections of pages).  Software will be developed that will allow screen readers to generate page- and site-specific scripts automatically, based on (1) the Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML) code defining the pages comprising a WWW site and (2) an analysis of the user's actions within that site.  Page- and site-specific scripts will allow screen readers to adapt to the current task context while the user is browsing the WWW, which will increase efficiency and facilitate the performance of complex tasks that may span multiple web pages within a site.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of blind and severely visually impaired computer users require screen readers to access computers.  The algorithms to be produced during this project will be applicable to many screen readers and will be useful for automatically generating scripts for standard applications as well.  AT Sciences proffers technology that can be licensed by other developers to improve the performance of new and existing screen readers.  Thus, in light of the growing importance of the WWW, which will place a premium on efficient web access, the adaptation mechanisms to be developed during this research could serve several screen-reading products.\r\n",
