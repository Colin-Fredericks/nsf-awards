 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) \r\nTo support two new interdisciplinary majors in biochemistry and neuroscience, science faculty at Drew University are introducing the technique of fluorescence across the curriculum. The project seeks to bridge gaps in modern instrumentation necessary to enhance these majors, to overcome compartmentalization both within and between several science departments, to strengthen connections between the introductory and advanced levels of laboratory instruction across disciplines, and to increase interdisciplinary connections for students at all levels of classroom and laboratory instruction and undergraduate research. The project is purchasing a fluorescence scanner, inverted fluorescence microscopes, and spectrofluorometers to support the introduction of new laboratory exercises in introductory and advanced courses in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and archeology. Current laboratory exercises are also being enhanced, since the amount of equipment available for students in science courses is being increased. The project is expanding the novel use of \"Student Experts\" to facilitate cross-disciplinary learning, expanding the involvement of RISE fellows (distinguished, recently retired, industrial scientists at Drew) in teaching and mentoring undergraduate students, and enhancing undergraduate research opportunities available on campus. The project's model for studying neurobiology is being adapted from programs at Wellesley College and Macalester College (both supported by earlier NSF funding - USE #9251547 and DUE #9552134). In addition, material from an NSF funded chemistry project (DUE #9350850) is being adapted for use in chemistry coursework that supports the new interdisciplinary major programs.\r\n\r\n",
