 "awd_abstract_narration": "0084408\r\nHeath\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to support a workshop that will be designed to explore issues related to the future of nano-scale and molecular electronics. In particular, issues related to computer architectures for molecular and nano-electronics, chemical self-assembly as a fabrication technology, and the expected scientific challenges associated with making molecular electronics a reality will be discussed.  The meeting will include presentations by leading practitioners in the fields of computer architecture and design as well as physical scientists working in the areas of nanoscale systems and molecular electronics.  Of potential interest to both of these groups is the field of neuroscience, and a small number of participants (and a corresponding few scientific presentations) will be from that field.  The goal of this workshop will be to explore the common ground that exists between computer architecture, molecular and nano-scale electronics, and neuroscience.  The result will be a document that can assist the NSF in developing a strategy for funding these various areas.  The workshop is being co-funded by NSF Divisions:  ECS/ENG, CTS/ENG, DMR/MPS, DBI/BIO AND EIA/CISE.\r\n***\r\n",
