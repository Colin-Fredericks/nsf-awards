Efficient techniques have been proposed for positioning,\r\norienting, sorting, etc., rigid objects under a variety of constraints and\r\nsensory input.  Although several problems concerning rigid parts deserve\r\nfurther attention, recent advances in manufacturing also require the\r\nmanipulation of deformable objects such as cables, pipes, paper, etc.,\r\nneeded for producing compact assemblies.  Building on the theory of\r\nmanipulation of rigid objects, the postdoctoral associate will investigate\r\nthe manipulation of deformable objects and selected problems involving\r\nrigid object manipulation.  The goal is for the associate to assist in (a)\r\ndeveloping appropriate computational models for deformable objects, (b)\r\nstudying fundamental notions such as stable grasping and fixturing of\r\ndeformable objects, and (c) providing efficient procedures to compute the\r\nexpected deformations of objects under manipulation constraints.  One\r\nimportant and challenging application of the proposed work is the\r\nsimulation of deformable human tissues.  Such a simulation can lead to the\r\ndevelopment of virtual training environments for surgical procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
