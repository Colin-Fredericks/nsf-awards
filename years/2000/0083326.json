Rogers\r\nAffiliation:\t\t\tUniversity of Alabama Tuscaloosa \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Conference Award:  NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Green Industrial Applications of Ionic Liquids\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award supports partially the participation by American researchers in the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Green  Industrial Applications of Ionic to be held in Crete, Greece, from April 12 to 16, 2000. This workshop will deal with an exciting new area of chemistry that offers an alternative to toxic and volatile organic solvents for use in various types of industrial processing, the use of room-temperature ionic liquids.  It will bring together about 50 or so researchers from Europe and the US.  Both academic and industrial researchers will participate in sessions on separations, electrochemistry, catalysis, chemical syntheses, and other industrial applications of ionic liquids.\r\n \r\nThe major funding for the workshop is coming from NATO, but this organization has certain representational guidelines that limit US participation.  Minor support from NSF will be used to pay conference fees and partial travel expenses for US participants not covered by NATO funds, including some younger faculty and students.  Also, the funding will be used to insure adequate participation by industrial organizations. The communication resulting from this conference will stimulate the development of ionic liquids and their industrial applications as well as promote scientific cooperation between Europe and the U.S.\r\n",
