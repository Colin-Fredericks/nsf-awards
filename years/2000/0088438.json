 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of silicon-based technology, originally developed for microelectronics applica-tions, in the fabrication of microelectromechanical and microfluidic structures has ushered\r\nin a new era in which complex tasks can be performed by efficient, miniaturized devices.\r\nHowever, one limitation of the current generation of silicon-based technologies is that it is\r\nextraordinarily difficult to fabricate devices have a significant number (>4) of functional\r\nlayers. The number of potential applications of microdevices would expand geometrically\r\nif it were possible to fabricate microdevices that were not constricted by the present layer-by-\r\nlayer fabrication scheme, but instead were truly three-dimensional.\r\nWe are proposing to develop and utilize a completely new set of technologies for non-silicon-based microfabrication of true three-dimensional devices. Our scheme takes ad-vantage\r\nof multiphoton absorption (MPA) interactions that occur selectively at the tight fo-cus\r\nof a laser beam to attain high three-dimensional resolution. The proposed technology\r\nbegins with a nanoporous matrix that is solidified and etched selectively in different spatial\r\nareas, based on MPA, in order to create the three-dimensional template for a microdevice.\r\nLocalized MPA-driven photodeposition and other MPA-driven photoreactions, photo-chemical\r\nprocesses and photophysical processes are then used to create functional compo-nents\r\nwithin the matrix, with submicron feature sizes. Through these means, it will be pos-sible\r\nto incorporate a wide variety of functionalities in a single, monolithic three-dimensional\r\ndevice.\r\nOver the proposed three-year project period, we will develop MPA-based technologies\r\nto make a broad range of functional fluidic, electronic, optical and mechanical components.\r\nThese components will be combined to fabricate increasingly complex three-dimensional\r\nmicrodevices that will allow for the miniaturization of technologically important tasks in\r\nareas such as combinatorial synthesis and screening of drug candidates and low-temperature\r\ndevice physics. By the end of the project period we expect to be able to inte-grate\r\nsuch devices directly onto silicon-based microchips.\r\n",
