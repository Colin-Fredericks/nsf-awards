The primary goal of this project is to develop macroscopic-level and microscopic-level mathematical models of drying in polymer-impregnated composites.  An accurate drying model is necessary for predicting conditions which produce a specified residual solvent content.  In addition to predicting the residual solvent level, an accurate mathematical model of the drying process should also predict the onset or likelihood of defect formation within the material.\r\n\r\nMany composites are porous matrices impregnated with polymer solutions or resins which contain volatile materials that must be removed by drying.  In Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), a resin penetrates into a fiber matrix in a mold.  RTM is used to produce composites of varying shapes including layered composites such as laminated circuit boards (Prepreg).  This project focuses on drying in layered porous structures, and the techniques used can be applied to more general geometries.\r\n\r\nDrying of homogeneous (non-porous) layers of polymer-solvent mixtures is well studied, as is drying of pure solvents (normally water) from a porous body.  This project aims to combine theories of drying polymer-solvent coatings with theories of capillary drying of porous media.  The first phase of this project is to develop a macro-scale model of drying from a polymer-solvent film supported on, and penetrating into, a porous layer.  Penetration into the porous layer is treated by a generalization of Washburn's equations to include solvent evaporation and varying physical properties.  The solvent flux is a combination of Darcy flow into the porous substrate and diffusion (affected by turtuosity and volume exclusion).  A macro-sale model of drying can predict defects related to depth of polymer penetration into a porous substrate, excessive thinning of a polymer surface layer, bubble formation due to solvent boiling, and levels of retained solvent in the pores.\r\n\r\nMany defects depend on pore structure and cannot be predicted from the macroscopic-level approach.  The second phase of this project is to develop a microscopic-level model of drying of polymer solutions from simple porous structures.  Predicting drying from pore surfaces involves coupled solvent transport and fluid mechanics in a deforming domain.  Non-uniform solvent diffusion to the surface and surface-tension-induced flow compete to determine the flatness of the surface.  Eventually, rising viscosity (due to falling solvent content) will effectively shut-off the flow and freeze the evolution of surface shape.  Micro-scale models of these effects can be developed using the finite element method and large-scael numerical computation.  Then the micro-scale models will be solved for a series of porous geometiries which approximate RTM, Prepreg, and coatings, on porous substrates.  Micro-scale models of drying can predict defects related to pore-structure such as smoothness of a \r\n\r\npolymer surface layer, barespots where the substrate is exposed, pinholes, local pockets of high solvent retention in pores, and evolution of voids trapped during impregnation.\r\n\r\nThe predictions of the macro-scale and micro-scale models will be compared with experimental results from drying experiments at Drexel.  A predictive model of drying composites is a powerful tool for optimizing drying conditions, guiding design of drying systems, and accelerating the scale-up of industrial processes.\r\n",
