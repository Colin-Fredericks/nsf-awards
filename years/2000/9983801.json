The goal of the research component of the project is to develop and understand new oxide ion conductors designed around the interesting structural features of the Aurivillius family of oxide structures. Oxygen-deficient perovskite-like layers will be incorporated into the Aurivillius structural framework and then counter-doping between layers will be used to increase the unit cell volume and disorder the oxygen vacancies.  The untapped potential of the Aurivillius-derived phases holds great promise for intermediate-temperature ionic conduction, and requires a clear description of the structures and the effects of structure on the ionic conductivity. The experimental work will be complemented with atomistic computer simulation to predict the stability of phases and to describe the nature of the defects that facilitate ionic conductivity. In-situ diffraction, atomistic simulation, and remote access to national facilities will be incorporated into course curricula for undergraduate and graduate education and new outreach programs. The use of group learning approaches with highly visual, state-of-the-art research tools will be evaluated from the perspective of student enthusiasm and learning.  Likewise, the success of outreach programs that integrate hands-on demonstrations supported by live virtual tours of research laboratories will be evaluated. \r\n\r\nDirect conversion of fossil fuels to electrical energy using fuel cells is a high efficiency, pollution-free alternative to traditional combustion.  New materials that conduct oxygen ions at intermediate temperatures are critical, however, to improve existing fuel cells and allow mass commercialization of the devices.  A distinct group of ceramics, called Aurivillius phases, has great potential for use in electrochemical devices and are the subject of study.  An approach that combines experimental work and computational modeling of the materials will be used to develop and understand new ionic conductors based on the Aurivillius phases.  Some of the research tools that will be used to make advances in this area of research are highly visual, very fast, or include live remote control of experiments using the world wide web.  The research tools are therefore widely accessible and will be incorporated into classroom, distance learning, and outreach activities.  In addition to directly including undergraduates in the research, undergraduate group learning laboratories with state-of-the-art research tools will be established and evaluated from the perspective of student enthusiasm and learning.  The curricular experiments will provide the background required to prepare effective distance learning and on-campus short courses.  Outreach programs will integrate hands-on demonstrations, web-based demonstrations, and virtual visits to the PI's laboratory and national facilities. The outreach efforts are designed to include non-majors on campus and to reach underrepresented groups in western New York through contact with a large number of K-12 teachers and students. \r\n\r\n",
