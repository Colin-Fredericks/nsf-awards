 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tAn important problem in forecasting extratropical \"weather-producing\" disturbances involves understanding how these features propagate from one location to another.  For example, daily weather patterns over North America are influenced by synoptic-scale disturbances that originate over the North Pacific Ocean and subsequently propagate eastward.  Exactly how and under circumstances this rapid downstream spreading of disturbances affects the weather over North America is an open and important question.  Dr. Hakim will test his hypothesis for how this occurs, namely that the structural properties of the North Pacific jet stream, such as the horizontal and vertical profiles of wind and temperature, affect the downstream response to cyclogenesis events since the flow properties control how the waves grow and propagate.  The study will include diagnosing observations of the evolution of cyclogenesis events occurring over the western North Pacific ocean and identifying flow regimes conducive for downstream development, analyzing operational model error characteristics for such events, and modeling downstream development using idealized zonally varying jet streams.  The results may serve as a basis for future studies concerned with targeted and enhanced observations upstream from the North American continent.",
