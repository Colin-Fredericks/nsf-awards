 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will combine state-of-the-art techniques for automating the reduction of chemical kinetic mechanisms with advanced software tools for the creation of problem solving environments (PSE).  The result will be a user-friendly graphical interface for the automated development and testing of reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms.  The PSE will be demonstrated on the problem of development of reduced chemistry, and subsequently applied to computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, of selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR), used in the control of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in coal-fired utility boilers.  This research will use the Computer Assisted Reduction Method (CARM) software, an automated tool for generating reduced kinetic mechanisms based on steady state assumptions, and a newly developed scientific programming environment, named SCIRun, that allows the interactive construction, debugging and steering of scientific computations.  This new problem solving environment will equip the novice engineer with an extremely efficient tool for generating, testing, and validating reduced chemical mechanisms over a specified range of conditions.  The tool will have immediate use in any application requiring a reduced description of detailed chemical kinetics and provide important scientific insights into factors affecting the validity of reduce kinetic mechanisms under a variety of conditions.\r\n\r\nReduced chemical kinetic mechanisms are needed in a wide variety of combustion applications such as utility boilers and industrial process heaters, reciprocating and gas turbine engines, and fire, soot, explosive, and solid propellant modeling.  Many potential non-combustion applications exist also, e.g. chemical processing and surface and condensed phase reactions.  The target area in this phase I program is the examination of chemistry associated with the formation and destruction of nitrogen oxides in industrial boilers.\r\n",
