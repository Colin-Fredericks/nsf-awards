 "awd_abstract_narration": "Homeostasis in multicellular organisms is achieved through a complex process involving the integration of environmental signals for survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The genetic makeup of a cell, as well as the nature of other cells and factors in its environment, dictates how it will respond at any given moment in time. The complex regulation of these processes is perhaps most apparent from the observation that molecules functioning in pathways leading to one type of response may also play a role in generating completely different, and often opposing, outcomes. Moreover, pathways that become activated through distinct mechanisms may functionally merge to produce a common outcome. These fundamental issues of regulation and integration are at the core of this project. Specifically, the project focuses on a newly identified function of the SRC-CAS protein complex as a modulator of cell proliferation and survival. The research plan that is described in this project is designed to test the hypothesis that the activity of this complex has unique signaling functions that arise from a number of potential factors, including 1) altered temporal and/or potency of enzymatic activity; 2) substrate selection; 3) molecular targeting to distinct subcellular compartments; and 4) protein stabilization. Ultimately, the regulated activation of these functions within the proper setting of time (for example, within a particular phase of the cell cycle) and space (for example, within a specific cellular microenvironment) is proposed to play a critical role in pathways leading to proliferation and cell survival . In order to address this hypothesis, C3H10T-one half murine fibroblast cell lines will be generated that over-express various c-SRC and CAS molecules. Preliminary studies in this system have shown that constitutive association of wild-type CAS and c-SRC may circumvent the need for normal positive regulators of growth and survival. Based on these initial studies, it is clear that this model will serve as an excellent tool with which to probe the requisite molecular features of SRC-CAS complex, the specific functions of the complex that contribute to its activity, and its overall impact on cellular growth and survival. Once the mechanism and biological consequences of SRC-CAS activities are better understood, this knowledge will then be applied to more physiological conditions with the goal of understanding how the SRC-CAS complex may signal in space and time.",
