 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis grant supports theoretical research in the properties of coherent matter: superconductors, Bose condensates and Fermi liquids.  In superconductors, the PI chooses to ask a question, \"How much can we learn about superconductivity, without theoretical preconceptions, simply from a study of the experimentally observed normal-state behavior?\"  More specifically what can be learned from existing and planned experiments on electron-energy-loss spectroscopy and optics.  The project is expected to provide important clues as to the generic conditions necessary for the occurrence of superconductivity at high temperatures.  In the area of Bose condensed atomic alkali gases, the project focuses on relaxation following a sudden, hard perturbation, for example, relaxation of two uncoupled subsystems which have been suddenly coupled, relaxation from a metastable (current-carrying state in an annulus) state and other similar situations.  Finally, there will be first-principle calculations of an ultra-cold Fermi system, following intense local heating, with implications for an earlier analysis based on ideas developed in the context of early universe.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports the theoretical research of a distinguished PI, noted for his unique, innovative and insightful approach to fundamental problems in coherent matter.  Most of the projects attempt a deeper understanding of the problems involved.  In superconductors, the PI asks, \"What are the generic conditions for the occurrence of superconductivity at high temperatures?\"  He plans to attempt an answer based on a careful study of some special experiments.  In Bose-condensed atomic alkali gases (BEC) he wants to study relaxation processes, which strain the abilities of current theoretical approaches, thereby, building better theories.  Finally there are experiments on relaxation of ultra-cold systems, subjected to intense heating in a small region in space.  These experiments have been analyzed using the ideas developed in the context of early universe.  The last project concerns a careful, fundamental study of these experiments.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
