The idea \r\nis to use a bundle method to determine a so-called VU-space decomposition \r\nsuch that on V-space the cutting-plane aspect of bundling works fast and on \r\nU-space a quasi-Newton approximation of a Hessian of a U-Lagrangian can be \r\nemployed. Such methods can be used to solve large or complicated \r\noptimization models via separation of variables or constraints. For \r\nexample, a water pressure control problem of finding values for flow rates \r\nand pump pressure gaps to minimize pumping cost subject to maintaining \r\nwater pressures in allowable ranges at all points in a pipe network can be \r\nsolved via separation of the variables. If the flow rates are fixed then \r\nthe subproblem of finding optimal values for the pressure gaps is an \r\neasy-to-solve linear minimization problem. With this approach the outer \r\nproblem of finding optimal values for the flow variables is a nonsmooth \r\nproblem whose solution can be found efficiently via the techniques to be \r\ndeveloped. The theoretical research is concerned with properly defining a \r\nclass of functions which is special enough for the members to have \r\nU-Hessians and general enough to include functions from many \r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThe computational methods proposed for development are significant because \r\nthey can be applied in many practical decision-making situations. These \r\ninclude the determination of values of parameters for fitting models to \r\ndata such as in topographic or geophysical modeling. They also include \r\napplication of decomposition techniques to large or complicated models such \r\nas those occurring in allocation of scarce resources, traffic assignment, \r\nmanufacturing, structural engineering, logistics and strategic planning. \r\nThe pipe network problem in the first paragraph is an important example \r\noccurring in civil infrastructure design. It illustrates the need to make \r\ntrade-off decisions when considering conflicting design criteria such as \r\nsimultaneously having high reliability and low cost. Another area of \r\napplication is in power system planning subject to environmental protection \r\nconstraints. These decision  models will increase in importance as \r\nderegulation of the energy supply sector takes effect. These problems \r\nnaturally decompose into higher level problems of deciding which types and \r\nsizes of power generation plants to build and lower level problems of \r\ndeciding how best to operate the various units to meet daily energy demand. \r\nAdditionally, this research fits in well with on-going efforts in \r\nhigh-performance computing, because its methods will utilize parallel \r\nprocessing for solving very large and/or very complex decision-making\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
