A better understanding of the biology of this \r\nsurface has significance not only for plant growth and development but \r\nalso pertains directly to the effective use and application of man-made \r\nagents such as agricultural herbicides.  Arabidopsis thaliana, a member \r\nof the mustard family, has been chosen as the model organism for these \r\nstudies.  Significant progress toward elucidating biological features of \r\nthe plant surface have already been made using this plant.  The research \r\ndescribed here will expand upon this body of work.  The biology of the \r\nplant surface as it pertains specifically to its biochemical and \r\nmolecular properties will be studied using a collection of plants with \r\naltered surface properties.  Using these plants it will be possible to \r\nidentify additional components involved in the building and maintenance \r\nof the plant outer \"skin\".  By identifying the constituents that make up \r\nthis complex outer layer and developing a guide for how this surface is \r\nput together, a better understanding of how plants mediate responses and \r\nadaptations to their environment will be achieved.  Insight into these \r\nfundamental processes may possibly have far reaching economic \r\nconsequences by ultimately diminishing the cost of weed management and \r\nthe impact of weed-based losses in crop productivity.  A reduction in \r\nherbicide use would have the added benefit of decreasing the \r\nenvironmental impact of modern crop management practices.\r\n\r\n",
