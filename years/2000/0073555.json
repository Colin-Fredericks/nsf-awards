 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, algebraic techniques are in use two to tackle \r\ntwo classes of problems related to improving the throughput and/or\r\nreliability of a communication link are under study.  The first class\r\nof problems under study is the design of long and efficient\r\nerror-correcting codes.   Such codes are of interest as longer\r\nerror-correcting codes tend to ``average'' out the noise and hence\r\nprovide better performance.      The second class of problems relates\r\nto the design and analysis of families of signature sequences that are\r\nused to distinguish between the signals of different users in a\r\nmulti-user environment.  Examples of multi-user environments include\r\nCode Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular and personal\r\ncommunication systems.   More details on example problems drawn from\r\neach class are provided below.  \r\n\r\nSince the early 80's, the promise of algebraic geometric (AG) codes\r\nhas been the delivery of a sequence of error-correcting codes of\r\nincreasing length whose asymptotic performance exceeds the\r\nGilbert-Varshamov bound and for which efficient and practical  \r\nencoding and decoding algorithms are available.  Computationally\r\nefficient decoding algorithms for AG codes are now available and there\r\nnow exist explicit descriptions of algebraic curves of the type\r\nrequired to construct these long codes.  Construction of good codes on \r\nthese curves requires the determination of a basis for a certain type\r\nof vector space of functions defined on these curves.  The\r\ninvestigators study efficient methods of generating such bases.  The\r\nuse of novel algebraic geometry techniques to generate pseudo-random\r\nsequences is an example of the type of problem belonging to the second\r\nclass.  The investigators examine methods of generating sequences\r\nhaving pseudo-random properties such as low correlation and large\r\nlinear span.  Also under investigation are more efficient means of\r\nassessing the performance of pseudo-random sequences in a multi-user\r\nsetting, for example, more efficient means of determining the minimum\r\nEuclidean distance between adjacent multi-user signals.  The\r\nperformance in a multi-user setting, of a a specific sequence family,\r\nknown as family S(2) and previously co-designed by the PI is also\r\nunder study.",
