 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project targets high energy, short lived, reactive molecules for study.  The molecules of interest are generated in solution by photolysis of synthetic precursors and the stable products of their chemical reactions identified.  These reactive molecules will also be generated by short intense bursts of laser radiation and they will be detected by ultraviolet-visible or infrared spectroscopy.  In solid argon at 14K, the otherwise transient molecules are persistent and thus can be characterized by high resolution infrared spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the research of Professor Matthew S. Platz of Ohio State University.  Professor Platz creates and studies interesting highly reactive and short-lived molecules.  Although such molecules are of basic scientific interest, they have much practical value in making larger molecules.  They are also used by biochemists to attach small probe molecules to larger ones such as proteins, by materials scientists and in industry as photoresists and in lithography.  Students working on this project will be educated to become problem solvers who will eventually apply their skills to solving problems in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and in academe.\r\n\r\n",
