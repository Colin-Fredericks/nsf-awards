 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) This project works to revitalize and transform the chemistry curriculum through the implementation of a problem-solving, project-based laboratory program for Organic Chemistry. This program provides students with enriching \"hands on\" experiences, especially those using a Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer and a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). Students actively learn the concepts of organic chemistry using FT-NMR and GC-MS to solve problems adapted from published, successful laboratory experiments, largely from the Journal of Chemical Education.  Several student projects are planned that engage students in the acquisition and interpretation of NMR and GC-MS, such as the structural elucidation of alkanes by proton-decoupled and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) 13C NMR spectroscopy and the identification of the fragrant components of wine by GC-MS. In addition to Organic Chemistry, these instruments are being incorporated into other laboratory courses such as Advanced Organic Chemistry, wherein students characterize an organotin compound to explore heteronuclear spin coupling by NMR and isotope distribution patterns by GCMS, and Analytical Chemistry, wherein students analyze complex mixtures from Ginko extracts. Expected outcomes for students include the development of marketable skills in the operation of FT-NMR and GC-MS, improved ability in the interpretation of spectral data, increased awareness of the utility of chemistry in society, and heightened enthusiasm for chemistry. Incorporation of FT-NMR and GC-MS into the chemistry curriculum also encourages faculty development via training in order to design new student experiments and to conduct research with undergraduates. Proficient operation of the NMR and GC-MS computer workstations by students also serves to integrate technology into education.\r\n",
