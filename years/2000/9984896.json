 "awd_abstract_narration": "9984896\r\nCheville\r\n\r\nA research program using optoelectronically generated pulses for imaging\r\nand characterization in the far infrared (FIR) spectral region will be\r\nintegrated into a curriculum providing research opportunities for\r\nundergraduate students.  \r\n\r\nResearch Career Goals:   A technique for broad bandwidth imaging in the far\r\ninfrared spectral region will be developed based on phase coherent\r\ndetection of scattered radiation.   Applications include biomedical\r\nimaging, nondestructive evaluation, and noncontact semiconductor\r\ncharacterization.  This new approach will address spatial resolution,\r\nsample limitations, and chemical content mapping.  The proposed technique\r\nis based on the existing ability to generate well characterized pulses of\r\nTHz radiation.??  Specifically the research program will:\r\n\r\nIncrease the power available in a compact, reliable THz source by at\r\nleast two orders of magnitude through enhancement of existing technologies,\r\nand collaborative work on magnetically enhanced THz sources.\r\n\r\nDevelop new sources including dipole antenna arrays to be integrated with\r\na programmable phase modulator to generate optically steerable far infrared\r\nradiation. These array sources combined with electro-optic imaging systems\r\nwill generate free space electromagnetic waves with soliton-like properties\r\nand applied to applications inTHz tomographic imaging.\r\n\r\nExisting work utilizing a THz impulse range for direct scattering\r\nmeasurements will be extended to measure inverse scattering using multiple\r\nsources and detectors.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to open an underutilized region of the electromagnetic\r\nspectrum to practical engineering applications with profound impact across\r\na wide spectrum of disciplines.\r\n\t\r\nEducational Career Goals:  The thesis of the educational component of this\r\nproposal is that most students lack practical preparation for the demanding\r\nand cross-disciplinary tasks required in research.  A unique photonics\r\ncurriculum, based on a model implemented by the PI on a small scale for\r\nthree years, will be developed in which students will be given practical\r\ntechnical skills during the freshman or sophomore years.  This curriculum\r\nwill provide training in the  cross-disciplinary area of photonics and\r\nspecifically:\r\n\r\nMake use of practical, hands-on research training in an apprenticeship\r\nmodel, similar to the teaching hospital of medicine at the freshman and\r\nsophomore level.  \r\n  \r\nIntroduce students at the junior level to photonics research through a\r\nproblem based learning laboratory course. \r\n  \r\nProvide independent research opportunities for senior students. \r\n  \r\nUse effective pedagogies for education including scaffolding,\r\ncollaborative learning, and communities of research practice to target\r\nunder-represented students in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and\r\nTechnology (SMET) to improve retention. Particular efforts will be made to\r\nrecruit women for the program.\r\n  \r\nBe based on a structure that is easily exportable to other programs or\r\nsubject areas, involve the use of representatives from industry and\r\neducational consultants for assessment, and provide for the dissemination\r\nof the developed educational materials.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
