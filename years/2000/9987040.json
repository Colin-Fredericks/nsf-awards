 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (31), (35), (59), (21) The college is using $180,000 for a two-year Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) Program. Each year 36 talented, historically underserved students in the state who enter one of the college's campuses in 2000 and 2001 are being given these awards. Scholarship recipients are recruited from high schools in the state and the scholarships are awarded to low-income, academically talented students.  The overall CSEMS program accommodates applicants from diverse backgrounds who have diverse career goals. The CSEMS program is :(1) implementing a recruitment program throughout the state in cooperation with the college, local high schools and advocacy organizations; (2) meeting major costs of college attendance for 36 eligible students each year of the two-year grant; (3) bringing together college faculty and staff from academic and counseling departments to offer academic support and mentoring to the Scholars; (4) making use of the resources of college industry advisory boards to create internships for CSEMS scholars in technology industries related to CSEMS scholars fields of study; and (5) offering Scholars employment and educational placement assistance.\r\n\r\nThe college is the state's entry point for talented, low-income students. More than 80 percent of students enrolled in the college work while attending college -75% receive some form of financial aid. The college enrolls the largest number of low-income students of all state postsecondary educational institutions. The college emphasizes technological programs, offering academic programs directly related to the NSF CSEMS program such as mathematics, computer science, and a range of engineering technologies. Many of the low-income students take too long to complete their A.A.S. programs and the retention rate for these students is low. The CSEMS scholarships permits talented, low-income students to concentrate on their studies, to provide more time for study and acts to reduce their indebtedness as they progress toward advanced study or work. Scholars also need support from academic mentors, experience interning in industry and other enhancements if they are to graduate on time and in good standing. \r\n\r\nThe college is building on recruitment networks developed through long-standing Upward Bound projects in state high schools serving low-income, diverse student populations. The college's Human Resources, College Relations and Marketing Offices coordinate the recruitment effort with the Principal Investigator. Accepted students receive free tuition and other assistance with direct educational costs. A team of college mathematics and engineering technologies faculty serve as mentors to the CSEMS Scholars over the two-year period, sponsoring enhanced learning experiences and making referrals to available campus academic support services. The college works with its industry advisory boards in disciplines related to the grant to establish industry internships for the Scholars. Exit counseling and job placement is being accomplished by the college and these advisory boards for Scholars in their second year. The President sponsors periodic special events supporting the CSEMS Scholars. \r\n",
