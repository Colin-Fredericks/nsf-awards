This project strengthens the undergraduate coursework in the Health and Human Performance Department by integrating motion analysis equipment into student learning experiences.  Integration of motion analysis instrumentation into course work is being accomplished by adding interactive demonstrations to lectures, providing hands-on laboratory experiences, and encouraging student research projects that utilize motion analysis equipment.  The exercises students will perform are adapted from Carol Widule's manual, Biomechanical Foundations of Motor Skills with Computer Applications, which serves as a source of validated comprehensive electromyographic experiments.\r\n\r\n",
