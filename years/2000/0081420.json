 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will construct a Virtual Variorum Edition (VVE) of Cervantes' (1547-1616) influential \"Don Quixote de la Mancha\".  The VVE, based on available-quality microfilmed images of the original editions published during Cervantes' life, will contain the important editions of the work in image and text; annotation of the variances present among the editions to enable comparison; derivative editions, generated as the result of scholarly analysis of the variances and bearing supporting reasoning; and commentary by experts that illuminates elements of texts and of the comparisons among editions.  The project's focus is on the digital representation, interlinking, and dissemination of the many computer-based manifestations of the documents and commentary.  It will prototype an end-to-end effort; from front-end acquisition of materials through flexible back-end presentation to readers.  The VVE, even in prototype form, will be an important artifact, with potential to become the standard research tool used by Cervantes scholars.  It will, for the first time, make the resource of multiple rare editions of the \"Quixote\" easily available in primary-source form.  The project will have implications for Digital Library projects involving the humanities, both as an demonstration of what can be achieved today but also through development and validation of techniques.",
