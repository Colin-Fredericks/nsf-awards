The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Harper L. Simmons with support for twenty-four months to work with Dr. Andrew Weaver at the University of Victoria's School of Earth and Ocean Sciences in Victoria, Canada.\r\nThe PIs will work to determine the impact of increased ocean stratification on ocean thermohaline circulation and ultimately upon climate variability and stability. Specifically, they will implement a known analytical sub-model of small scale, but climatically relevant, oceanic overflow processes into a climate model that cannot directly simulate such processes.  The analytical model will be driven by variables that are resolvable within the context of a climate model, namely the large-scale exchange of both moisture and heat between the ocean and atmosphere.\r\nAn expected result is enhanced dependence of deep water formation climate upon Arctic processes, with a concomitant suppression of climate sensitivity to more southern open convective processes.  The theoretical understanding and modeling technology developed through the course of this project will benefit U.S. and international climate modeling activities and programs.\r\nThe University of Victoria's Climate Modeling Group has expertise in the role of the Arctic in climate.  They have a seasoned team of researchers and the equipment necessary to carry out this research.\r\n",
