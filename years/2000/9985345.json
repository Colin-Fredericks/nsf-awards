 "awd_abstract_narration": "9985345\r\nTorres\r\n\r\nSoil with highly non-linear water retention or conductivity functions may exhibit both rapid and slow soil-water advection processes.  I hypothesize that a near-zero threshold pressure head separates a non-linear unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function into regions where  constant and where  hydraulic conductivity and  soil-water content pressure head).  I propose that high intensity bursts of rainfall upon a soil at or near the threshold pressure head will produce a subtle but rapidly advancing pressure wave through the soil profile.  The pressure wave will cause a large increase in K, the release of stored soil-water, and the rapid development of high pore pressures.  Such a \"pressure wave-release mechanism\" may lead to water potential conditions favoring flow into non-capillary sized pores (macropores).  Hence, the \"pressure wave-release hypothesis\" may describe conditions that dictate when soil macropores \"switch on\".  The combined effects of water transported by pressure wave-release and  the initiation of macropore flow may lead to the rapid development of high pore pressures and slope instability.  I will conduct theoretical, laboratory and field experiments to investigate the pressure wave-release hypothesis and its effect on rates of water advection and pore pressure development.\r\n\r\nThe educational initiatives herein directly link experimentation with observation, and they create a unique opportunity for students to acquire \"hand on\" hydrology experience in a field laboratory. Easy to use instrumentation and analyses will facilitate undergraduate research on 1) rainfall-runoff processes and 2) subsurface path length effects on buffering capacity of an urbanized riparian corridor.  Approximately 20 faculty expressed their support for the proposed research-education facility; consequently, the field hydrology laboratory can become an integral part of thousands of students' education each year.\r\n",
