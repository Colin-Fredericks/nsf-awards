The emphasis in this initiative will be to recruit transfer students from the community colleges in Arkansas who have completed an associate's degree or who are very near completion. \r\n\r\nA new College of Information Science and Systems Engineering, recently established, will provide a strong recruiting and student support structure. Recruiting activities will be coordinated by the Assistant Dean for Recruitment and Minority Affairs and will include visiting the community colleges, developing print materials concerning the program and advertising in the school papers. \r\n\r\nThe project will develop a strong support structure for these students that will include faculty and industry mentoring, orientation, a \"Learning Community\" using linked courses, and other activities aimed at retention and graduation. \r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of support from industry and from the community colleges for this program as indicated by the support letters in the appendix.\r\n",
