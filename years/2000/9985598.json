 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nCTS-9985598\r\nVijay John, Tulane University\r\n\r\nThe research seeks to exploit the concept of clathrate hydrate formation in water-in CO2  for the design and enhanced operation of environmentally benign processes.  Clathrate hydrates are crystalline inclusion compounds of water and gas. Carbon dioxide is a hydrate forming gas and the thermodynamics of CO2  hydrate formation in bulk aqueous systems is well understood.  But the formation of clathrate hydrates in the water droplets of water-in-CO2 microemulsions is an entirely new concept and exploratory research will be conducted on the thermodynamics of the phenomenon.  The hypothesis is that hydrate formation in these systems will lead to a method of controlling the amount and properties of intramicellar solutes, with consequent applications in synthesis and separations processes.  The research will identify the phase behavior of clathrate hydrate formation in water-in-CO2 microemulsions and probe the microstructural environment through spectroscopy and scattering techniques.\r\n\r\nExploratory research on the applications of hydrate formation in the development of new and environmentally benign technologies will also be conducted as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The use of hydrate formation in water-in-CO2 microemulsions to synthesize catalytic, semiconductor, and magnetic nanoparticles that have a uniform size distribution.  The hypothesis is that hydrate formation subsequent to particle and prevent further growth.\r\n\r\n2. The development of separation technologies using molecular recognition agents such as the cyclodextrins solubilized in water-in-CO2 microemulsions and stabilized through hydrate formation.  These agents can then be used to enhance extraction into the gas phase.\r\n\r\n3. The preparation of nanoparticles hydrogels in water-in-CO2 microemulsions as aided by the formation of clathrate hydrates.  Again, the formation of clathrate hydrates can be exploited to control micelle size, thereby allowing the formation of extremely small hydrogel particles that may have applications in drug delivery technologies.  We will also use the hydrate technology to stabilize enzyme activity in water-in-CO2 microemulsions. \r\n",
