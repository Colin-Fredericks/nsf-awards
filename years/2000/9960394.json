 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Cytel Software will develop a web-based 'Urn Sampler' that allows students to solve problems via the familiar probability mechanisms of drawing balls from an urn, throwing dice, drawing numbers from a list, and shuffling a deck of cards.  The Urn Sampler will present a low learning hurdle by using familiar symbols and standard tools: icons for sampling operations and a spreadsheet interface for data entry and calculations.  It will be embedded in and serve as the key component of a web-based authoring environment in which statistics teachers create, share and deliver lab exercises based on the Urn Sampler, as well as hyperlinked text, short video clips, self-assessment exams and frequently asked questions (FAQ's).  The intent is to create a statistics curriculum development 'community' in much the same way that the open availability of the Linux operating system has created a community that contributes to further development of that system.  The Urn Sampler will address a diverse audience, including undergraduate and graduate students taking a required course in quantitative reasoning or statistics, students taking an undergraduate major or minor in statistics, graduate students studying statistics, and continuing education students.\r\n\r\nIntroductory statistics education has always been a problem area:  many students learn little from their required course and take a disliking to the subject.  By the same token, it is a commercial opportunity for a better product to target the market of statistics students-there are estimated 1,000,000 undergraduate statistics students per year with per student expenditures of $50 to $100 for books, software and other materials and thus a total market of over $50 million annually.  Cytel Software's resampling/simulation approach embodied in the Urn Sampler has a successful track record as a teaching strategy, and the web-based authoring and learning environment will allow sharing of the best and most innovative curricular materials.\r\n",
