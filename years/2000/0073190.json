The connection between migration and reproduction is being assessed by examining the role body condition plays as migrants arrive and begin to breed in northern Michigan.  Birds are captured on arrival, condition assessed, and then released and subsequently relocated in order to examine the influence of arrival condition on both behavior and reproductive performance.\r\n\r\nThe life history of many organisms is characterized by an annual cycle: breeding season, migration, nonbreeding season, migration and so on.  Although researchers acknowledge that events during one phase of this cycle influence survival and/or reproductive success during subsequent phases, seldom is the relationship between phases studied.  This work is unique in its explicit focus on this linkage.  Moreover, while both winter and breeding seasons are argued to be major periods of population limitation, the influence of migration remains unknown.  Results of this work have implications in understanding the relative importance of this period as a factor in limiting populations of migrating organisms.  Finally, these results will provide insight into what constitutes suitable stopover habitat and how a bird's ability to locate en route habitat impacts future reproductive performance.  This knowledge is critical given the recent declines in many populations of these birds.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
