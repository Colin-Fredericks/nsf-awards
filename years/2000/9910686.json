 "awd_abstract_narration": "This basis of this project is a machine-implemented algorithm that\r\nlearns the phonological and morphological rules governing inflectional\r\nparadigms. The algorithm, following exposure to a set of learning\r\ndata, can generate appropriately inflected forms for novel stems. The\r\nsystem has the capacity to generate multiple guesses for a given stem,\r\nand offers gradient \"well-formedness judgments\" for each, which\r\ncorrelate well with the well-formedness judgments of human speakers. \r\n\r\nThe project will involve two activities. First, the algorithm will be\r\nused in exploring areas of phonology and morphology that have hitherto\r\nbeen underinvestigated because they require the kind of detailed rule\r\nsystems that can best be discovered by machine. Pilot evidence,\r\nprimarily from Italian, indicates that people learn the phonological\r\ngeneralizations of paradigms in surprising detail, in a way that is\r\napproximated by the machine algorithm. The project will explore such\r\ndetailed systems further though large-scale \"Wug\"-testing experiments,\r\nin which subjects provide inflected forms for nonce stems.\r\n\r\nTests will be carried out in four areas.  *English past tenses* are\r\nimportant because they relate to a large body of work in computational\r\nmodeling and psycholinguistics. *Spanish diphthongization* \r\nexemplifies a process that is subject to irregularity, but is \r\nphonological rather than morphological. *Korean stem-final consonant \r\nalternations* are involved in a major diachronic restructuring, which \r\nthe algorithm will be used to model. *V ~ O alternations in Polish* \r\nbring evidence from the learning algorithm (and parallel judgments \r\nand productions of native speakers) to bear on theoretical issues of \r\nabstractness and opacity.\r\n\r\nThe learning algorithm will be developed further, incorporating\r\nresources from computational linguistics: richer phonological\r\nrepresentations, more sophisticated methods of finding phonological\r\nrules, and a morphological parser to serve as a front end. The revised\r\nalgorithm will also incorporate elements of phonological theory: a\r\nprojection-based theory of long-distance rules (permitting the\r\nalgorithm to discover vowel-to-vowel processes), and a conception of\r\nderived-environment processes that proceeds naturally from the\r\nalgorithm. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will (a) increase our knowledge of how phonology\r\nand morphology work at the level of detailed generalizations; (b)\r\nprovide a test for phonological theories; (c) contribute to the\r\neducation of linguistics students in developing lexical databases,\r\nprogramming, and carrying out experiments; (d) provide databases\r\nusable for testing learners developed by other researchers.",
