 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nNg, Ka Ming\r\n9908667\r\n\r\nSolids processing, which involves unit operations such as dissolution, crystallization, filtration, washing, dewatering, drying, crushing, blending, and compaction, is prevalent throughout the chemical process industries (CPI).  Examples include the manufacture of salts, fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, detergents, pigments, pharmaceuticals, and petrochemicals.\r\n\r\nA four-component research program is planned to study the design of plants containing solids processing steps.  First, systematic design procedures for integrated crystallization-filtration-washing-bulk solids processing systems will be developed.  These building blocks will be used to synthesize preliminary flowsheet alternatives for further investigation and optimization.  Second, the existing framework based on discretized population balance equations, which tracks the changes in particle size distribution from unit to unit in a complete plant, will be extended to account for shape.  The relationship of particle size and shape will be linked to process configurations and operating conditions through material properties and interparticle forces.  Third, this framework will be accompanied by the formulation of compatible solids processing equipment models.  Fourth, a Visual-Basic based programming platform will be used to demonstrate the use of these models and methods.  This code will be built upon an existing program SOLIDS, which contains subroutines for solving discretized population balance equations.  Case studies will be used to illustrate this multiscale approach, to identify heuristics, and to evaluate the impact of uncertainty.  Model parameter values for solids processing are often estimate; hence sensitivity analysis will be used to quantify the impact of uncertainty on process performance.  Design issues related to product formulation and unit operations such as solids blending, compaction, and granulation will be considered.\r\n",
