 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop higher energy storage electrode materials for rechargeable lithium ion batteries.  Tin-based oxide materials have attractive reversible charge storage capacities but high first-cycle losses.  In Phase I, new tin-based materials were demonstrated with superior capacity and significantly reduced first-cycle loss.  The volumetric charge storage capacity was three times better than commercially established carbon-based anode materials.  These proprietary materials are based on nanoscale tin domains highly dispersed and stabilized within a conductive ceramic matrix.  In Phase II, two ceramic hosts will be investigated.  Precursor chemistries, tin atomic fraction, and reactive conditions will be optimized with respect to capacity and cyclability.  The composition and microstructure of these materials will be determined and correlated with rate and cycle life.  Test cells will be prepared and evaluated to determine their capacity and cyclability.  Producibility issues such as precursor cost, process scale-up, and compatibility with established cell components (e.g. electrolyte, separator, binder, current collector) will be addressed.  The ultimate goal is to demonstrate that the capacities demonstrated in phase I can be realized while simultaneously meeting the cost and cycle life requirements for rechargeable batteries used in consumer electronics.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop advanced electrode materials that will increase the run tim or reduce the size and weight of rechargeable lithium ion batteries. There is a rapidly growing market for lithium ion batteries for consumer electronics (wireless communications, laptop PC's, camcorders), as well as for electric vehicle propulsion. \r\n",
