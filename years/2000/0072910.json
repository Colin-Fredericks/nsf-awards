 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project involves interdisciplinary research in which algorithmic\r\napproaches are developed to design and analyze adaptive experiments. An\r\nadaptive (sequential) design is one whose characteristics change in\r\naccordance with information arising from the ongoing experiment, as \r\nopposed to classical statistical designs where such characteristics are\r\nset in advance and remain fixed throughout. Adaptive designs have a wide\r\nrange of application in clinical trials, destructive testing, behavioral\r\necology, computer performance prediction, adaptive control, etc., where\r\nthey have the potential to reduce the expenditure of experimental \r\n``resources'' such as time, money, or quality of life. Unfortunately,\r\nadaptive designs are difficult to analyze and optimize. Exact analytic\r\nsolutions are rarely available, and thus, historically, such designs have\r\nbeen predominantly approached via asymptotic methods and ad hoc\r\napproximations. Computationally, adaptive designs require significant\r\ntime and space that has often made exact calculations infeasible.\r\n\r\nThis project will expand the size and scope of solvable problems by\r\ndeveloping new computational approaches for creating and evaluating\r\ndesigns and utilizing state of the art computational facilities.\r\nAttention is directed to problems that are important in applications,\r\nwith a major emphasis on supplying researchers greater flexibility in\r\nmodeling their statistical and cost objectives. For many of these\r\nproblems, exact optimality will be unattainable, and thus techniques for\r\nproducing near-optimal designs will also be pursued. Several of these\r\ntechniques are based on optimizing smaller or simpler problems and\r\nextrapolating their solution structure to larger or more complex\r\nproblems. This compliments analytical, asymptotic work and provides new\r\ninsights into the structure of solutions. In other cases, a shift from\r\nserial algorithms to parallel ones will be used to address the\r\nadditional complexity.",
