 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses a series of unresolved issues in hominid evolution using new and rapidly developing approaches to the quantitative analysis of bone form in the field of geometric morphometrics.  The researchers propose to analyze the comparative anatomy of the temporal bone of the early hominid cranium in order to arrive at fresh perspectives on the identification of key morphological characters used to attribute of fossil specimens to species, and, more generally, on methodological approaches to the study of primate skeletal variation in an evolutionary context.  Both are difficult, but critical areas of research, along the road to answering specific questions concerning early hominid evolution.\r\n\r\nThey chose to study the temporal bone of the early hominid cranium because: 1) several debates concerning early hominid evolution center on the temporal bone, which is anatomically complex and well differentiated in the various evolutionary lineages; 2) previous analyses have focused on qualitative comparisons of temporal bone form, which have not led to progress in resolving outstanding debates; 3) the temporal bone is well represented in the hominid fossil record; 4) their methods are well suited to the study of fragmentary fossils, which comprise a significant component of the total temporal bone sample.\r\n\r\nStudying the hominid temporal bone, they address such unresolved questions as: 1) What are the earliest documented representatives of the genus Homo? 2) How much, if any, taxonomic heterogeneity exists within conventionally recognized species such as Australopithecus afarensis, A. africanus, and others? 3) How should the morphological signs of unique affinity between \"robust\" Australopithecus species and Homo (homoplasy vs. synapomorphy) be interpreted? \r\n\r\nThe approach employs three-dimensional landmarks on the temporal bone to quantify the expression of morphological features that have thus far been examined only qualitatively and/or in a univariate context.  Specifically, they use \"relative warp analysis\" to quantify overall shape variation and \"thin-plate spline analysis\" to describe and graphically portray difference between taxa or specimens.  The goal is the identification of novel aspects of temporal bone morphology to distinguish hominid taxa.\r\n",
