 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clusters are becoming a predominant and cost-effective platform\r\nfor high performance parallel computing. These systems are gaining acceptance\r\nnot just for scientific applications, which have traditionally needed\r\nsupercomputers, but are also being deployed to meet the needs of\r\napplications in domains such as databases, web service, multimedia, and \r\ngraphics/visualization. Traditional parallel scheduling techniques\r\nsuch as simple space sharing or coscheduling, which are optimized more\r\nfor throughput, may not be able to handle the responsiveness needs of\r\nthese emerging applications. At the same time, leaving it entirely\r\nto the native operating system scheduler at each node to make independent\r\ndecisions can have a detrimental effect on the performance of communicating\r\napplications. Considering these different issues, this proposal will\r\nexplore techniques for efficient management and coordination of the \r\nCPU resources across the nodes of a cluster. This research will develop\r\na framework to design cluster scheduling mechanisms taking communication \r\ninto account together with working sets and I/O information, accomodate\r\nthe constraints and idiosyncrasies of an application, and adapt dynamically\r\nto the system load. The mechanisms will be evaluated with real workloads,\r\nusing simulation, analytical models and actual implementations.\r\nThe outcome of this research will take an important step towards making\r\nclusters more ubiquitous, multiprogrammed, manageable and user-friendly.\r\n",
