Spin electronics is viewed as one of the next strategic industries and may be able to meet much of the storage demands for information technology.  The advantages of magnetic devices would be increased data processing speed and decreased electric power consumption compared to semiconductor devices.  The market is large (over $50 billion annually) and breakthroughs are needed to create such magnetic devices.\r\n\r\nTo examine the area this workshop is organized to engage researchers and technologists from industry, academia, and national labs in a two-day, invited workshop to present results, discuss issues associated with the underpinnings of the current technology, their limits and challenges, and examine solutions.  The focus of the discussions will be on spin electronics as a solution for information storage.  The participants will be assessing technology to identify future directions of research, advance the rate of research, provide greater visibility, identify future application trends, establish short term needs and project long term goals, integrate research and education, and promote university/industry/government partnerships in this area of technology.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will identify technological challenges and opportunities and provide the NSF and the scientific community with a set of recommendations for future efforts and a vision of the future for spin electronics.  This document will be available to all participants, their organizations, the NSF, and other industry and government scientists and policymakers.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
