This proposal is a joint effort of the Institute for Tropical Ecosystems Studies and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research.. Funding will support eight undergraduate students each year to conduct independent research studies for ten weeks at the El Verde Field Station.  Student selection into the program will be based on GPAs, research interest and their potential for pursuing graduate studies (as evident in letters of research interests and letters of recommendation).  Selection preference will be given to students attending non-research institutions and universities with little access to research in Ecology and Evolution.  Selected students will work with one of several participating faculty in ongoing projects but will also develop their own mini-project under the supervision of their mentors.  During this intensive ten week program, students will become familiar with a wide variety of research techniques that will help them address ecological and evolutionary research problems. The research experience will be complemented by a number of ancillary activities including seminars, workshops, colloquia and social activities.  Through these activities students will be exposed to a variety of research topics, current issues within the scientific community and the social milieu of ecology.  Thorough annual evaluations of the REU program will ensure that it is effective and that the goals of this proposal are fulfilled. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
