 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines molecules in the retina that participate in sight.\r\nThe retina is a thin sheet of nerve cells at the back of the eye that is five\r\nlayers thick. It processes information about light and sends it to the brain.\r\nThe molecules studied in this research are special proteins in the retina\r\ninvolved in signaling the presence or absence of light at the first point at\r\nwhich light is detected in the photoreceptor cell.  The proteins make up a\r\nmicroscopic structure in the photoreceptor called the synaptic ribbon.\r\nSignals about the presence or absence of light are transmitted to the next\r\nlayer of cells by using  the synaptic ribbon in an unknown way. The proposed\r\nwork will investigate this mechanism.\r\nWe have made special markers for this family of proteins.  Each marker\r\nattaches to proteins with specific weights, which is one of the properties we\r\nuse to tell the proteins apart.  One of these markers, called the B16\r\nantibody, recognizes a rare protein found only in the retina that weighs 54kD.\r\nWe have recently succeeded in separating the 54kD protein from the rest of the\r\nretina.  We will now sequence its amino acids as a way of identifying it and\r\nunderstanding the function of this protein.\r\n\tThe second group of experiments will examine other proteins are related to\r\nthe one recognized by our B16 marker.  One of these, called a focal adhesion\r\nprotein, may be involved in keeping the synaptic ribbon attached to the\r\npresynaptic membrane.  This is the place where information is transmitted to\r\nthe next group of cells in the retina.\r\nIn the third group of experiments we will use the electron microscope to look\r\nat the position of these proteins within the synaptic ribbon.  It is critical\r\nthat we demonstrate that the proteins are part of the synaptic ribbon within\r\nthe presynaptic terminal not postsynaptic to the photoreceptor or in the\r\nextracellular space.  In addition, we will examine the other proteins\r\nassociated with the synaptic ribbon with other biochemical methods.\r\n\tWhen all the experiments are finished, we expect to have: 1) identified the\r\nprotein that our B16 marker recognizes, 2) learned the identity of the other,\r\nrelated proteins in this family, and 3) shown that the B16 marker attaches to\r\na protein that is integral to the synaptic ribbon.  This will advance our\r\nfundamental knowledge about what the synaptic ribbon is made of and how it\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n",
