 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, continues studies of the surface electrochemistry of fuel cell electrodes.  Professor Wieckowski and his coworkers at the University of Illinois are carrying out studies of the structure and reactivity of islands on platinum single crystal electrodes formed by the deposition of ruthenium and osmium co-adsorbates.  Ternary island structures are under investigation as well.  Scanning probe microscopy coupled with electrochemical methods and ultra-high vacuum sample preparation and characterization is used to investigate the electrooxidation of methanol on these electrode surfaces.  Island edge effects, and the effect of sulfur coadsorption on the dynamics of this important fuel cell reaction is studied.  The results of these studies are useful in the design of electrocatalysts and electrodes for fuel cell applications. \r\n\r\nThe structure of binary and ternary metallic islands on platinum electrodes used in fuel cell applications is the subject of this research project supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Wieckowski and coworkers at the University of Illinois are using scanning probe microscopy and electrochemical methods to examine methanol electrooxidation on these model electrode surfaces.  Information from this research is useful in the design of improved fuel cell electrodes.",
