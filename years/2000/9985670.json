 "awd_abstract_narration": "These experiments will investigate the conditions and processes by which an avian species, the pigeon, learns higher-order  (abstract) concepts.  Such concepts are overarching rules and are basic to standard laboratory tasks of matching to sample (MTS) and same/different (S/D). In MTS, pigeons learn to choose a comparison picture that matches the sample. In S/D, pigeons learn to choose a second picture (same response) when it matches the sample or a white rectangle (different response) when the two pictures do not match. Concept learning is shown by the ability to perform accurately with novel stimuli. \r\n\r\n     Pigeons are ideally suited for these investigations because concept learning and alternatives can be studied in detail not possible with most other species.   Evidence indicates that pigeons learn concepts when they respond 20 or more times to the first stimulus prior to making a choice.   Fewer responses result in either configural-pattern learning or a stimulus-response (chaining) learning. Neither leads to concept learning.  Special tests reveal which type of learning (concept, pattern, S-R chaining) has occurred. Understanding these different types of learning is one of the most important goals of the science of behavior.   The results from these studies may be applicable to other species and learning environments (e.g., education).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
