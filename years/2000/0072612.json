 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wang\r\n0072612\r\n     The investigator studies the structure, its robustness and\r\nstability, and the transitions of large scale geophysical fluid\r\nflows, to arrive at a better understanding of the prediction and\r\npredictability of these flows relevant to the typical sources of\r\nlow frequency variabilities in climate.  The work studies specific\r\ntopics in two areas: 1) theoretical issues of the primitive\r\nequations, and 2) the presence, sensitivity and robustness of\r\ninterannual variability characteristics to changes in model\r\nparameters in the underlying physical space.  In Area 1, the\r\ninvestigator studies the primitive equations of large scale\r\nocean/atmosphere flows.  Specific problems include stability and\r\nbifurcation issues of the primitive equations and related simpler\r\nmodels, especially in connection to climate low frequency\r\nvariabilities.  The main objectives in Area 2 are to classify\r\ntypical large scale atmosphere/ocean circulation flow patterns\r\nassociated with boundary layer phenomena, and to study their\r\nstructural bifurcations.  Part of the work in this area is based\r\non a new geometric theory developed recently by the investigator\r\nand T.  Ma.  The investigator uses a combination of physical\r\nmodelling, asymptotic methods, rigorous mathematical theory, and\r\nlarge scale computing to yield new insights into physical\r\nphenomena.  The work involves specific collaborations with\r\natmosphere/ocean scientists.\r\n     The primary goal of this project is to document, through\r\ncareful theoretical studies, the presence of regular interannual\r\nand interdecadal variability in the ocean basins adjacent to the\r\nNorth American continent, to verify the robustness of this\r\nvariability's characteristics to changes in model parameters, and\r\nto help explain its physical mechanisms.  The thorough\r\nunderstanding of this variability is of the essence in\r\ndetermining the climate system's predictability and prediction on\r\nsubcontinental and smaller spatial scales, for time scales that\r\nequal and exceed a few years.  The associated phenomena include\r\nthe double-gyre wind-driven ocean circulation and the El\r\nNino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which dominates\r\ninter-annual climate variability over much of the Pacific Ocean,\r\nand hence the world.  The studies could lead to improved\r\npredictions of weather, climate, and environmental phenomena.\r\n",
