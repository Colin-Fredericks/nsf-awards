 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses several fundamental questions in\r\nalgebraic geometry and number theory.\r\nThe first part concerns the geometry of solutions to\r\nalgebraic equations.\r\nLet X be a variety defined over a number field K.\r\nDoes there exist a finite extension L/K such that\r\nX(L) is dense?  One seeks criteria for when this\r\noccurs in terms of the geometry of X.\r\nIt is still not clear what form such criteria should take.  \r\nThe second part concerns the geometry of plane curves.\r\nWhen is an abstract curve a degeneration\r\nof smooth plane curves?  What geometric properties do\r\nsuch limiting plane curves have in common?\r\nThe third part involves the classification of surface\r\nsingularities.  Given a family of projective normal\r\nsurfaces, when are the invariants of such a family\r\nconstant?  Specifically, how does one tell whether\r\nthe self-intersection of the canonical divisor \r\nis constant?  The last part involves finding explicit\r\nparametrizations for the curves of a fixed small genus.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometers study the structure of solutions to\r\npolynomial equations.  From ancient times, geometric\r\nfigures like circles and ellipses have fascinated \r\narchitects, scientists, and artists.  The most compact\r\nway to represent such a figure is to describe it as the \r\nsolutions to an equation.  One basic question is \r\nto classify the abstract figures that may be represented\r\nby equations of a given form.  Another is to understand\r\nthe common geometric properties of the solutions to\r\nall the equations of a given form.  This project seeks\r\nto answer these questions for special types of curves \r\nand surfaces.",
