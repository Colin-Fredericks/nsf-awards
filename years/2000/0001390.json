 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Brazil award for a planning visit was submitted by Dr. Francis Otuonye of Michigan Technological University requesting support to go to the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) to plan a collaborative research with Professor Maria Jose Gazzi Salum.  The topic of this research would be the integrated approach to reducing the environmental impacts of mining through effective mine designs.  In addition, they wish to arrange a student exchange program.\r\n\r\nThis support will allow the PIs to gain an understanding of the research capabilities of the faculty and staff at UFMG; to evaluate the research infrastructure available; to evaluate the problems and opportunities related to environmental impacts of mining operations in Brazil; and to develop a collaborative research proposal.  The second objective is to finalize arrangements for a student exchange program between the two universities.  The problem of environmental damage from mining impacts both countries.  New methods for analyzing this damage, mitigating the damage and remediating it are needed.\r\n",
