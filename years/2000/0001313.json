Bang-Fen Zhu of Chinese Academy of Science and Shang-Yuan Ren of Beijing University.  This project will study low dimensional semiconductors and host 2-4 ISU Physics undergraduate students to carry out summer research at the collaborative institutes in Beijing each summer for three summers.  This is an excellent project.  INT provided a supplement in 1999 to Dr. Ren's DMR grant, allowing her to take two ISU students to Beijing University for a four-week research project.  The experience gained by the students was excellent.  This project is a continuation of the idea of combining research and education for training undergraduate students for a primary undergraduate institute in the United States.   This proposed research is important and has the potential to make a contribution to the theory of  quantum dots. The combination of research and education in undergraduate training is unique.  The Chinese Academy of Science, the Natural Science Foundation of China and the NSF jointly support this project.\r\n\r\n",
