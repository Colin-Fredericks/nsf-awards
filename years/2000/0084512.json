Here the PI proposes the investigation of carrier tunneling, with special, emphasis on hole tunneling, in such structures.\r\n\r\nThe in-plane energy dispersion for holes in these structures displays large non-parabolicities of the energy sub-bands. It has also been found that in-plane dispersion in such quantum heterostructures significantly influences the tunneling spectrum in the growth direction.  In the existing literature, these crucial aspects have not been included in (a) multi-band Schrodinger-Poisson self-consistent band bending calculations, (b) a tunneling theory including in-plane wavevector dependence, and (c) the full theory of the I-V characteristics of general layered systems including these effects.  The modeling aspects of the theory are best done in a highly accurate finite element approach that was investigated earlier by the PI.\r\n\r\nA number of puzzling features in the I-V characteristics in Type-11 RTDs observed by Magno, et al., at the Naval Research Laboratory will be addressed.  A proper understanding of the Type-II interband quantum cascade laser (proposed and later implemented by Meyer, Vurgaftman and the PI), under active device conditions also requires a detailed multi-band approach to tunneling.  These device applications should permit the realization of wavefunction engineering of optimized structures for superior performance.  In addition, nonequilibrium dissipative effects of phonon emission and phonon-assisted tunneling under active device conditions, will be investigated using a Numerical Green's Function approach proposed here.\r\n\r\nThese investigations will have direct relevance to device design, to device performance, and to the implementation of mid-IR lasers and Type-II RTDs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
