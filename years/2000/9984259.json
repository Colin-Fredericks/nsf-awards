 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work conducted in this project focuses on both research and education in computer security. The research effort is geared towards providing security on the Internet. In particular, the research focuses on providing security for web servers and wireless handheld devices. The education effort is aimed at increasing awareness of computer security and training computer security experts at both the undergraduate and Ph.D. levels. The research conducted in this project covers the following topics: \r\n\r\n     Security for handheld devices. Handheld devices (e.g. cell phones, PalmPilots, pagers, digital cameras, etc.) are a fast      growing market with clear security concerns. The project studies how security solutions apply in a low power, wireless, handheld environment. For example, the investigators are studying how to use a low power wireless handheld for E-commerce; how to perform encryption and authentication on a low power handheld; and other related questions.  New cryptographic techniques. New cryptographic techniques are required for new Internet applications. In this project the investigators are designing new cryptographic techniques for authenticating streamed audio and streamed video and techniques for preserving user anonymity. In addition, the investigators are studying new cryptographic  systems for providing improved security guarantees for digital signatures and encryption. The goal is to develop efficient  systems for both handhelds and smartcards. \r\n\r\n     Scalable web server security. Security operations, such as SSL, are typically a performance bottleneck when used on  a heavily loaded web server. As the web continues to grow it will become essential to improve SSL's performance on the server. The project studies methods for improving SSL's server performance using two techniques: batching and  offline preprocessing. The investigators are also developing mechanisms to protect a web site's content integrity. This work ensures that hackers cannot break into a web site and install their own content. \r\n",
