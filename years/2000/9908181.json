 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study the impregnation of metal complexes on high surface-area supports.  Modeling and experimental studies on the adsorption of selected metal complexes on several supports will be carried out.  In previous work the Revised Physical Adsorption (RPA) model was successfully applied to hexachloroplatinate on alumina.  In this project the generality of the model to other types of metal complexes and other common oxide supports will be tested.  A series of metals and supports will be tested to isolate the effects of pertinent parameters such as the oxide point of zero charge  and the dielectric constant.  The model will be tested for its applicability to catalysis.  Although a model of the adsorption step is useful, it must be determined to what degree the initial deposition of metal is maintained as a function of drying and catalyst pretreatment.  Predictions from the model indicate that platinum complexes are deposited as a monolayer on the oxide surface.  The extent to which platinum particles agglomerate or migrate as the hydration sheaths and ligands are removed by chemical and thermal treatments will be quantified.  This work is potentially applicable to catalysis and the removal of heavy metals from water streams.\r\n",
