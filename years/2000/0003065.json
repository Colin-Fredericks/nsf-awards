 "awd_abstract_narration": "The preparation of a workforce of scientifically and technologically competent technicians rests on a foundation of mathematical concepts and skills. Technical mathematics is an essential part of science, information, computer, and engineering technology programs offered by associate degree granting colleges; yet, there is a widening disparity between the mathematics used in industry and what is taught.\r\n\r\nThis project is analyzing the role and nature of technical mathematics in advanced technology programs, recognizing successful models, and developing a vision and recommendations for the future. Issues of transferability to four-year institutions are also being considered.\r\n\r\nThrough two regional workshops, mathematics and technical program faculty, together with representatives from business and industry, are addressing content and curriculum issues related to technical mathematics. These issues include the integration of mathematics content with science and technology content, relevance to business and industry needs, pedagogy, and the use of technology. Reports from these workshops are enabling the development of criteria for selecting up to 10 exemplary technical mathematics programs which are being highlighted at a national conference.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the national conference is substantive dialogue on technical mathematics issues and the development of a vision and recommendations for achieving that vision. In addition to representatives from the 10 exemplary programs chosen, participants include mathematics and technical program faculty, industry representatives, professional society representatives, and other national leaders.\r\n\r\nProject leadership is centered in the Technical Mathematics Committee of the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC). A national Advisory Group, consisting of leaders from all stakeholders in the continued examination and improvement of mathematics for technical mathematics, is serving to guide project development and implementation.\r\n",
