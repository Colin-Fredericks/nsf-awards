 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to provide students with gas chromatography/ quadrupole mass spectrometry instrumentation to carry out inquiry-based laboratory experiments in a series of undergraduate analytical and organic chemistry courses.  Quadrupole mass spectrometry techniques with gas chromatograph (GC/MS) offer a simple but powerful technique for the identification and quantitation of organic compounds.  A number of experiments described in chemical education literature are being adapted for local use starting with an introductory analytical course at the freshman/ sophomore level.  Target courses also include a recently developed environmental chemistry for chemistry majors with an environmental science emphasis, and an applied instrumental analysis course taken by those intending to teach at the secondary school level as well as by non-chemistry majors.  More advanced mass spectrometry theory and applications via laboratory experiments are being presented in an instrumental analysis course.  In addition to analytical courses, hands-on GC/MS experiences are being obtained by students enrolled in organic chemistry laboratories and undergraduate research projects, where GC/MS can be a valuable tool.  The use of GC/MS instruments is very common in industrial laboratories where analysis is required of complex samples.   It is essential that students have the opportunity for significant hands-on experiences with GC/MS techniques.\r\n",
