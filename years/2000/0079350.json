 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  addresses the need for customized learning tools in mathematics education for primary students with physical disabilities, in particular, those with significant hearing loss.  The Phase II study focuses on modifying and testing sections of existing multimedia so that they will be appropriate as instructional tools for PreK-K children with significant hearing loss.  The need is critical: 2 out of every 1,000 young children in the U.S. have hearing loss severe enough to adversely affect learning.  In addition, resources for these individuals are normally allocated to the development of language acquisition; thus, the development of mathematical computation and reasoning often is not addressed until a significant learning window has lapsed.  The National Action Plan for Mathematics Education Reform for the Deaf recommends that more resources address mathematics instruction for children with significant hearing loss.  Learning in Motion intends to modify a research-based, field-tested multimedia program for early learners of mathematics.  This program was the direct result of Phases I and II of a NSF SBIR project.  The multimedia program includes three-dimensional graphics and characters, completed game logic, and four interactive game areas that are suitable for modification.  The study's main objectives:  1) design, program, and test modifications to existing software games (4) with students with hearing loss, 2) conduct and use subjective observations from teachers and researchers to further refine the modifications, and 3) initiate a testing plan for the complete modified program.  Ultimate results include: salable multimedia for the under-represented group of students with significant hearing loss and publishable design guidelines for others electing to produce specialized software.\r\n\r\nLearning in Motion seeks to provide in a completely modified mathematics multimedia program for hearing-loss children.  Design guidelines informed by the WGBH guidelines will also be produced, encouraging commercial collaboration with other publishers looking to produce similar programs.\r\n",
