The Program builds upon major strengths in the University of Rochester' s programs in the Biological Sciences and it is intended not only to provide outstanding research experiences, but also to encourage participating undergraduates to pursue career paths in the biological sciences.  The Program seeks to acheive a goal of 50% participation by women and underrepresented minorities.           Students will be recruited from four-year colleges, including women's colleges and historically black colleges, with which the University of Rochester has working relationships. University of Rochester undergraduates who conduct academic year research will also be strongly encouraged to apply to the program, and these students will be supported, with Program sponsorship, in preparing their results for presentation at national scientific meetings during the academic year. The central research experience will take place during a 10-week, full-time work period each summer.  At this time, each REU student will pursue an independent research'project under the supervision of a specific faculty advisor, and with the \"hands-on\" guidance of a specific graduate student or postdoctoral mentor.  AR of the students will participate in REU seminars, which will include topics in scientific ethics, biological safety and chemical hygiene as well as research presentations by University faculty and graduate students, and discussions of careers and graduate work.  Students will report in writing at the conclusion of the summer program, and they will also present the results of their work at a mini-symposium. Each student will be strongly encouraged to continue part-time research work during the academic year, with the aim of completing a scientific publication.  Students will also be strongly encouraged to present the results of their research at a national research meeting, such as the National Conference on Undergraduate Research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
