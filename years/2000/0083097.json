 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: DMS-0083097\r\nPI: Walter D. Neumann\r\n\r\nDespite the venerable history of the algebraic geometry, many difficult\r\nproblems remain even in low dimensions. Methods of low dimensional\r\ntopology have proved very helpful here, and part of this project concerns\r\na continuation of the investigator's successful application of such\r\nmethods to the study of singularities of complex surfaces and the topology\r\nof plane affine curves. One issue to be addressed is explicit analytic\r\ndescription of singularities with given topology. The general question is\r\nnotoriously difficult, but the investigator and J. Wahl have recently made\r\na series of conjectures on realising rationally Gorenstein singularities\r\nwith rational homology sphere links as explicit quotients of complete\r\nintersections and are making significant progress towards their\r\nresolution. 3-manifold topology is also being applied to the study of the\r\nglobal topology and analytic classification issues for two-variable\r\npolynomials. These issues are of intrinsic interest as well as having\r\npotential to contribute to the resolution of the famous Jacobian\r\nConjecture.  In a rather different direction, the investigator will study\r\ninvariants of 3-dimensional manifolds that relate to number theory and\r\nalgebra, namely the so-called character and eigenvalue varieties and the\r\nBloch invariant.  Connections are emerging between these invariants that\r\nwill inform both topology and algebra/number theory.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic Geometry, which is essentially the study of the zero sets of\r\nfamilies of polynomials, has always been an important area of\r\nfundamental research, and is also important in such diverse\r\napplications as control theory and communications. The project will\r\napply topological methods to algebraic geometry, to obtain results on\r\nhow to realise and classify families of polynomials that lead to\r\nparticular topologies.  The methods of 3-dimensional topology are of\r\nparticular importance to this project, and there is also feedback from\r\nalgebra and number-theory to topology, as well as some interaction\r\nwith theoretical physics and cosmology. The project also studies\r\nnew insights that these connections bring to all these fields.\r\n",
