Lott\r\n\r\nRiemannian geometry is the study of curved spaces. \r\nExamples of such spaces are curves and surfaces in \r\nthree-dimensional flat space. Riemann showed how to\r\nmake precise the notion of curvature for a space of \r\narbitrary dimension.  Spectral analysis can be roughly \r\ncharacterized as the study of how a space vibrates.  \r\nMore precisely, to a curved space is associated a certain \r\npartial differential operator, the Laplacian.  Spectral \r\nanalysis is the study of how the eigenvalues of the \r\nLaplacian depend on the underlying geometry of the space.\r\n\r\nIn previous work, the principal investigator obtained \r\nrelationships between the spectrum of the differential \r\nform Laplacian and the geometry of the underlying space, \r\nthe latter being constrained by upper bounds on its diameter\r\nand upper and lower bounds on its curvature. In particular, \r\nhe characterized when there are uniform upper bounds on the \r\nj-th eigenvalue of the p-form Laplacian, and when there are \r\nsmall positive eigenvalues of the p-form Laplacian.  He \r\nproposes to extend this work in several directions.  One \r\ndirection is to just assume that there is a lower bound \r\non the curvature of the space.  New issues arise in this \r\ncase, as under the assumed geometric constraints, the space \r\ncan ``collapse'' to a highly singular space of lower \r\ndimension.  The principal investigator's previous work, \r\nin the case of upper and lower curvature bounds, also dealt \r\nwith the singular spaces that arise in a collapsing limit.  \r\nHowever, with just a lower curvature bound, the singular\r\nspaces that arise are of a different nature. He also proposes \r\nto extend the previous work in the direction of analyzing \r\nthe spectrum of the Dirac operator, under the geometric \r\nassumptions of an upper bound on the diameter of the space\r\nand upper and lower bounds on its curvature.\r\n",
