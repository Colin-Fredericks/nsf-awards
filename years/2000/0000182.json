This provides a unique opportunity to define sperm components required for sperm-egg interactions.  Worms with mutations in the spe-9 gene produce spermatozoa with wild type morphology and motility that cannot fertilize oocytes even after contact between gametes.  Therefore, disruption of spe-9 function affects either gamete recognition, adhesion, signaling and/or fusion.  The spe-9 gene encodes a sperm transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain that contains ten epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats.  A common feature of proteins that include EGF-like motifs is their involvement in extracellular functions such as adhesive and ligand-receptor interactions.  Additionally, the overall structure of the predicted SPE-9 protein is similar to that of ligands for the Notch/LIN-12/GLP-1 family of transmembrane receptors.  These results suggest that SPE-9 functions in the specialized cell-cell interactions required for fertilization.  In order to gain a better understanding of the role of SPE-9 during fertilization we will follow several lines of investigation.  Immunofluorescence will be used to localize the SPE-9 protein in sperm and reveal the cellular region important for gamete interactions.  Mutation analysis experiments will be conducted in order to determine important functional domains of the SPE-9 protein.  Finally, extragenic suppressors of spe-9 will be isolated in order to identify additional genes involved in worm sperm-egg interactions.  This work will provide new insights into conception and complement studies of fertilization in other organisms.\r\n\r\n",
