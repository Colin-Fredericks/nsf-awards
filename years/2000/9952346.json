 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nIn many morphological sciences too much emphasis is placed on uninspiring memorization of factual material with little direct application or problem solving.  The overall goal of this project is to develop a fully integrated digital video and microscopy laboratory that allows the implementation of student-designed investigative and exploratory activities in our morphologically oriented courses.  Several experiences from the educational literature are being adapted to provide appropriate experiences for undergraduates in a range of courses.  The equipment requested is allowing us to examine, document quantify and analyze all structures from organelle to organism in the context of a problem or investigative based format.  Several primary course are being served by this facility including Human Anatomy, Biomechanics, and Seed Plant Biology.  In addition, the laboratory is being used by students in our Biomicroscopy and Research courses, as well as students involved in K-12 outreach.  Each course is introducing curricular changes consistent with the existing department theme of investigative activities with special attention to current pedagogical reforms.  This facility is greatly enhancing and extending our students' investigative activities while fostering higher order thinking and integrative skills, improving our students' quantitative skills and assisting in our K-12 outreach activities.  \r\n",
