 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13)\r\n\r\nDespite the immense importance of computation in contemporary physics, systematic efforts to use computers in undergraduate instruction have focused on introductory courses.  Starting in the mid 1980's, this Department introduced sophisticated computational techniques throughout its upper-level courses.  Distinguishing features of the approach include a focus on flexible, general purpose computational packages; application to theory and experiment; extensive use for preparing reports on technical subjects; distribution throughout the curriculum; and most important, introduction of computation early enough so that, subsequently, students use computers confidently and independently on their own initiative. \r\n\r\nThis project is converting the experience acquired over many years, and the extensive library of instructional materials developed, into a flexible publication to support efforts to teach computation to undergraduate physics students at other institutions.  To achieve the desired flexibility, the project is creating numerous modules, some generic and others more specific to particular platforms and/or applications programs.  Working with commercial publishers, a convenient and effective mode of publication is being developed that will allow individual users to assemble particular selections from these modules into a text that is tailored to their specific circumstances.  Week-long faculty workshops and site testing are helping to refine the end product and contribute to its dissemination.\r\n",
