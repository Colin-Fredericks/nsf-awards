 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposes to develop advanced Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surface modeling techniques to solve four computer aided design (CAD) problems: (1) constrained surface design, (2) surface design using the streamline modeling methodology,  (3) automatic surface fairing, and (4) automatic joining of surfaces. The goal is aiming at developing new and efficient techniques that are capable of (1) creating smooth surfaces with continuous first derivative (or tangent direction) and prescribed shape properties (such as prescribed shape ranges, convexity, and bounded curvature), (2) performing real-time surface design by manipulating tangent vectors instead of control points, (3) detecting and removing surface irregularities on a fairness model of the given surface automatically, and (4) performing smooth, automatic n-sided indirect or direct joining with n bigger than or equal to 2.\r\n\r\n                    Results on the first topic will provide the broad design and modeling community a shape generation technique that can be controlled not only in shape ranges, but also convexity and curvature distribution and, hence, provide an opportunity to address the manufacturability issues in the surface development stage.  Results on the second topic will provide design engineers with an interactive surface design technique that allows direct manipulation of surface curvature and variation of curvature. Results on the third and forth topics will significantly shorten the surface fairing and joining processes and, consequently, make CAD more proactive and effective in the product development process. Overall, results of this research will help reduce both the cost and cycle time of the product development process.\r\n\r\n",
