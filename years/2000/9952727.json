 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) As part of our continuing effort to integrate new technology into our curriculum, the chemistry department is constructing six desk-top laser systems with computerized data acquisition for use at the beginning level, and is integrating use of a more sophisticated laser laboratory facility into the advanced courses and independent study projects. These systems are helping us to organize and enliven instruction of our students in optical spectroscopy by replacing the current haphazard introduction to the nature of light and to spectroscopy with a coordinated progression of learning throughout our curriculum.  Experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education and from laboratory texts are being adapted and modified in order to achieve this progression.  The desk-top systems allow us to introduce laser based spectroscopy at the freshman level, with absorption spectrophotometry and light scattering experiments as well as demonstrations of fluorescence, refraction, diffraction and polarization of light. One or more experiments using these systems is carried out by students in each course during the first two years.  To help our majors take advantage of the knowledge gained in lower-division courses, we are putting in place a laser laboratory centered initially on Raman spectroscopy, with the capacity to be extended to nanosecond time resolved kinetics studies.  In addition to enhancing our own students' understanding of optical spectroscopy, the project is allowing development of equipment and experiments, applicable to introductory and upper level laboratories, that are appropriate for dissemination to other institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
