The show would be based on the children's magazine, \"Dragonfly,\" and would present children doing science experiments that they developed and planned themselves.  From time to time, the children would be joined by adult scientists who tell of their own research, their discoveries, and their love of science.  The goals of the project are to foster in children a greater interest in science and the process of scientific inquiry; demonstrate the parallels between children's scientific explorations and the research conducted by professional scientists; and feature and promote science projects involving under-represented communities, particularly ethnic minorities and girls.\r\n\r\nOutreach for the project will include a monthly \"Young Investigator's Field Book,\" a Dragonfly TV teachers' companion multi-page insert that will be integrated into the NSTA grade school and middle school journals for teachers, and a Dragonfly TV website.  The project also will establish community outreach partnerships with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the 4-H National Science and Technology Network.",
