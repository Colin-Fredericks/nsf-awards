In particular, the proposed research will (1) document\r\nvariation in coat color of mice and environmental heterogeneity in soil\r\ncolor for six paired localities in New Mexico and Arizona where each pair\r\nconsists of one light and one dark locality, (2) conduct a screen to\r\nidentify genes contributing to the observed phenotypic differences, (3)\r\ncharacterize mutant alleles at the loci implicated in phenotypic\r\ndifferences, and (4) characterize genetic variation at coat-color loci in\r\npopulation samples from dark and light localities.  Together, these studies\r\nwill (1) identify the number and relative effects of different genes\r\ncontributing to coat color variation, (2) determine whether pigmentation\r\ndifferences are due primarily to structural changes, regulatory changes, or\r\nboth, (3) determine whether dark coat-color has evolved independently in\r\ndifferent populations, and if it has, determine whether the same or\r\ndifferent mutations are involved, and (4) determine the extent to which\r\nselection at one site in the genome has shaped patterns of genetic\r\nvariation at linked neutral sites.\r\n     A central goal in biology is to explicitly connect genotype with\r\nphenotype for traits that are ecologically important.  This has been an\r\nelusive goal because the genetic basis of most traits is not well\r\nunderstood.  Coat-color variation in rodents is a classic example of\r\nphenotypic variation in response to local adaptation: in many species,\r\ndorsal pelage color closely matches the color of the soil on which the\r\nanimals live.  A century of research on the genetics of coat color in house\r\nmice has produced a rich database of candidate genes and mutant effects.\r\nThe combination of striking phenotypic variation in coat-color of pocket\r\nmice (Chaetodipus intermedius) and candidate pigmentation loci cloned in\r\nthe laboratory mouse presents an unparalleled opportunity to investigate\r\nthe genetic variation underlying a key morphological trait in nature.\r\n\r\n",
