 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Institute in Mathematics for Undergraduates (SIMU) at the University of Puerto Rico -- Humacao is a six-week research program in the mathematical sciences.  The program is co-directed by Principal Investigator Professor Ivelisse Rubio, University of Puerto Rico - Humacao, and Co-Principal Investigator Professor Herbert A. Medina, Loyola Marymount University.  In addition, each summer two faculty members serve as seminar leaders and research directors for SIMU.  In summer 2000, these faculty are Reinhard Laubenbacher, New Mexico State University, and Victor Moll, Tulane University.  Twenty-four undergraduate students will participate each year in SIMU from 2000 - 2002.  Each year, half of the students will be women.\r\n\r\nThe program is designed for talented Latino and Native American---these are the populations served by the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), an organization with which the programs has close ties---undergraduates who want to engage in undergraduate mathematics research.  During SIMU students will complete an undergraduate research project in an active area of mathematics.  The mathematical areas in which students will work in summer 2000 are computational algebra and integration of rational functions.  Students will present their research at an end-of-program colloquium series and write a technical report on their work.  After SIMU, students will present their research in academic conferences such as the annual SACNAS Conference and the Joint Mathematics Meetings.\r\n\r\nThe goal of SIMU is to increase the number of Latinos and Native Americans earning graduate degrees and pursuing research careers in the mathematical sciences.  Professor's Rubio and Medina believe that providing SIMU participants a rich and intensive research experience in an active area of mathematics is an excellent method for motivating and preparing students for graduate programs and careers in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nThe SIMU web page has more information about the program: http://cuhwww.upr.clu.edu.",
