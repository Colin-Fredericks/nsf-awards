 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (35), (59) Horry-Georgetown and York Technical Colleges are comprehensive, two-year Associate Degree granting institutions in the sixteen-member South Carolina Technical and Comprehensive Education System. Each institution enrolls approximately 3,500 curricula students, with Horry-Georgetown enrolling over 325 students in the targeted curricula and York enrolling almost 250. At both institutions, over 50% of their enrollment receives PELL or other Federally subsidized support. \r\n\r\nEach institution has nationally recognized advanced computer and engineering technology curricula that have a specific need (1) to assist academically prepared students to complete their two-year degree in the prescribed time. All of the participating programs are academically strenuous and require a full summer semester between the freshman and sophomore years. However, as community colleges with predominantly local/regional enrollments, many students to need to work during the summer. Through the implementation of the CSEMS grant, the Colleges are identifying up to forty (40) students of academic merit who are at risk of not completing their degree requirements due to financial need, and to support and insure their graduation. \r\n\r\n(1) Computer, Electronic Engineering, and Civil Engineering Technologies at Horry-Georgetown, and Electrical Engineering, Engineering Graphics, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Engineering Technologies at York. \r\n",
