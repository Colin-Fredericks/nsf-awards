 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the impact that advanced combinatorial algorithm\r\ntechniques and data structures can have on the performance of\r\nheuristic search, both in theory and in the context of\r\nbuilding a general-purpose combinatorial optimization engine.\r\nThis engine will be applied to yield quality implementations of\r\nheuristics for twenty NP-complete problems which arise commonly in practice.\r\nThis approach focuses attention on identifying versatile high-performance\r\napproaches to local optimization.  Further, it suggests a variety of\r\nnew lines of theoretical research which will lead to improved optimization\r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this research revolves around (1) the development of new\r\ncombinatorial algorithms and data structures supporting powerful\r\ncrossover, mutation, and cycle-avoidance operations, and mapping energy\r\nlandscapes, as well as provably good approximations, (2) a systematic\r\nstudy of the performance of local search variants including simulated\r\nannealing, genetic algorithms, and tabu search, (3) the development of\r\nuseful software for research, industrial, and educational applications,\r\nand (4) the creation of a new competitive forum for assessing the state\r\nof the art in algorithm engineering.\r\n",
