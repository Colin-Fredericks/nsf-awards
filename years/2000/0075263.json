ICES is an intergovernmental organization designed to coordinate scientific research, fisheries assessment, environmental concerns, and oceanographic matters of common interest to countries bordering the North Atlantic.  The ICES/GLOBEC program is the North Atlantic regional component of the International GLOBEC Implementation Plan. GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) is an international research program intended to improve forecasts of the responses of the marine ecosystem to physical forcing and global change by developing our understanding of its structure and functioning under varying physical conditions. The project office is responsible for coordinating efforts to keep interested research communities informed about ongoing work, design means for data exchange, plan cooperative research, organize workshops for the collective appraisal and analysis of information, and publish results in a timely and adequate way. \r\n\r\n",
