 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a program in quantitative reasoning (QR) across the curriculum. This development involves the adaptation and implementation of ideas and materials from successful Mathematics across the Curriculum (MATC) programs at other institutions, notably Wellesley College, Dartmouth College, and DePauw University.  This project was inspired by the report of the Mathematics Association of America, \"Quantitative Reasoning for College Literacy\" (1997).  The participating faculty will read \"Why Numbers Count:  Quantitative Literacy for Tomorrow's America,\" edited by Lynn Steen.  \r\n\r\nThe development of this program presents a unique challenge. We have in place the foundational pieces of a QR program and are now pressing ahead with faculty professional development.  We believe that an important step in building a successful QR program is to increase awareness, understanding, enthusiasm, and applications of quantitative reasoning across campus. Our approach to supporting this goal is to bring four scholars to campus to lead interactive workshops for faculty as we adapt and modify their ideas to create QR courses across the academic disciplines. The visiting scholars have been chosen based on direct involvement with successful MATC programs, courses and/or workshops at University of Nevada (Reno), Trinity College, the University of Tennessee (Knoxville), and Dartmouth College.  We are offering follow-up workshops led by the principal investigators for the purpose of developing specific course materials to be included in QR courses at our college.  These workshops are engaging twenty faculty members with the goal of creating or modifying at least twenty courses to incorporate quantitative reasoning components. \r\n\r\nThis QR program will have an impact on all undergraduate students, beginning with those young women entering in fall 2000.  Additionally, we believe the QR program at our institution will provide a model to follow for other liberal arts colleges, especially those accredited by the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges (SACS).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
