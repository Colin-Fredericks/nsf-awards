 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the preservation, conservation, and improvement of the bat collection in the Department of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History.  The bat collection at the AMNH exceeds 60,000 specimens, and is one of the largest and most important components of the mammal collection.  The entire dry collection (skins, skulls, skeletons) is housed in old cabinets, specimens are overcrowded in both drawers and cases, and many osteological preparations are stored in vials that are too small to safely hold them.  The institution has provided a new centralized facility, including a large room and adjacent hallway; this support will provide new storage cases, drawers, vials, and conservation of the collection.  Verification of bat specimen records in the mammalogy collection database, which will take place at the time of recuration and movement of the collection, will contribute to database accuracy and help provide improved information services to the scientific research community.",
