 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from Instrumentation for Materials Research Program the University of California, Santa Barbara, will develop a Laser Driven Terahertz System which will provide new research instrumentation for high-resolution linear terahertz spectroscopy of materials, material structures, and devices. The instrument will deliver microwatts of tunable radiation up to ~1 terahertz (THz).  Above ~1 terahertz the power will be substantially less but more than adequate for linear, high-resolution spectroscopy of materials and material structures.  Up to 1 terahertz, with suitable methods of excitation and sampling, the system will also be used to test the performance of state-of-the-art electronics at frequencies that exceed the capability of existing network analyzers.  At the same time, the system will provide a test bed to explore new non-linear materials and devices for optical difference frequency generation of terahertz radiation by photoconductivity and non-linear susceptibility. The research and development of this new instrument will provide interdisciplinary education and training for postdoctoral researcher and to graduate and undergraduate students in physics, materials science and solid state electronics.\r\n%%%\r\nWith this award from Instrumentation for Materials Research program the University of California Santa Barbara will develop a Laser Driven Terahertz System which will provide new research instrumentation for high-resolution linear terahertz spectroscopy of materials, material structures, and devices. The terahertz part of electromagnetic spectrum, from 100 GHz to 10 THz, is science rich but relatively technology poor.  The Laser Driven Terahertz System will provide new research instrumentation for high-resolution linear terahertz spectroscopy of materials, material structures, and devices.  The research and development of this new instrument will provide interdisciplinary education and training for the post-doctoral researcher committed to the project and to graduate student and undergraduate researchers who will use the instrument in physics, materials science and solid state electronics.  The instrument will deliver microwatts of tunable radiation up to ~1 terahertz (THz).  Above ~1 terahertz the power will be substantially less but more than adequate for linear, high-resolution spectroscopy of materials and material structures. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
