This project assesses the effects of large-scale tectonic and climatic perturbations from 30 to 5 million years ago in the western United States on the distributions of fossil and extant mammalian taxa.  These effects are determined through the use of a GIS database of fossil taxa, Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity, and biogeographic information on extant taxa.  Three hypotheses are tested: 1. Large-scale tectonic changes between thirty and five million years ago restricted gene flow and increased endemism in mammals; 2. Modern biogeographic patterns are more deeply rooted in Earth history rather than being the result of recent climatic events such as Pleistocene glaciation; 3. Mammalian species behave individualistically during times of climate change as opposed to maintaining static species' associations.  This study will provide a better understanding of the role played by the physical environment on evolution as well as an increased understanding of how future climate and tectonic changes will affect biodiversity.\r\n\r\n",
