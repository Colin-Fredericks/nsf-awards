 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe goal of the research is to study potential theoretic problems\r\narising in the following areas. (1) Symmetric stable processes are\r\ndiscontinuous and nonlocal versions of Brownian motions.  The jumps of\r\nthe processes impose many technical complications, at the same time\r\nmaking the roughness of the boundary invisible; consequently they\r\nproduce many unexpected properties and interesting questions.\r\nHarmonic measures, Martin boundaries and a certain version of boundary\r\nHarnack principle will be investigated.  (2) On trees of nonregular\r\nbranching, or on a random Galton-Watson tree, problems on sizes of\r\nFatou sets of bounded p-harmonic functions will be studied. These\r\nare discrete analoge of the usual p-harmonic functions. (3) For\r\na quasiregular mapping on the unit ball, the relation between the\r\nvolume growth of the mapping and size of the set on the unit sphere\r\nwhere the function has asymptotic values will be analyzed.  This\r\nconstitutes a first step towards a very difficult problem of Fatou\r\nsets for bounded quasiregular mappings.\r\nBrownian motion has been studied at least since Norbert Wiener and has\r\nplayed a central role in probability and potential theory, which in\r\nturn are very important in the study of differential equations, heat\r\nconductivity, electrostatic potential and fluid dynamics.  Recently,\r\nthere are many problems in physics and mathematical finance and risk\r\nestimation which have been modelled and studied successfully with the\r\nuse of symmetric stable processes -- discontinuous counterpart of the\r\nBrownian motions.  A symmetric stable process has discontinuous\r\nsample paths and heavy tails, while Brownian motion has continuous\r\nsample paths and exponentially decaying tails.  Therefore many\r\ntechniques from Brownian motions can not be routinely adapted to these\r\nprocesses.  Wide range applications and challenging behaviors of the\r\nprocesses are the motivation behind the proposed research.  Wu hopes\r\nthat knowledge derived from a theoretical study of these processes\r\nfrom an analytical point of view, will give new tools for applications\r\nin physics and finance.\r\n\r\n",
