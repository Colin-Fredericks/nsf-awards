Matching of S-alleles\r\ncarried by the pollen and pistil results in inhibition of pollen tube\r\ngrowth in the style. A polymorphic gene at the S-locus, termed the S-RNase\r\ngene, that controls pistil function in SI has been identified. However, the\r\ngene that controls pollen function in SI interactions, termed the pollen\r\nS-gene, has not been identified.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposed project is to use a functional genomic approach\r\nto identify the pollen S-gene of P. inflata. Obj. I is to use 14 cDNA\r\nmarkers for the S-locus and the S-RNase gene as probes to isolate clones\r\nfrom an S2S2 BAC library already contsructed. Obj. II is to construct a BAC\r\nlibrary of the S1S1 genotype and use the same probes employed in Obj. I to\r\nisolate positive clones.  Obj. III is to characterize all the BAC clones\r\nisolated in Obj. I and II by pulse-field gel electrophoresis and\r\nfluorescence in situ hybridization to determine any overlap between them,\r\nto order them at the S-locus, and to estimate the size of the gaps between\r\nthem. Additional clones will be isolated from both BAC libraries to cover\r\nas extensively as possible the entire S-locus. Obj. IV is to introduce all\r\nthe BAC clones separately into P. inflata plants of S1S2 genotype to\r\ndetermine whether any of them contains the pollen S-gene. If a BAC clone\r\ncontains the pollen S2-gene, a quarter of the pollen grains produced by a\r\ntransgenic plant will carry the pollen S1-allele and the pollen\r\nS2-transgene, and they will be compatible with S1S2 pistils due to\r\ncompetitive interaction.  Transgenic plants that have become\r\nself-compatible will be studied to identify the transgene that is\r\nresponsible for the phenotype. The function of the candidate(s) for the\r\npollen S-gene will be further ascertained by loss-of-function experiments.\r\n\r\nAccomplishment of this proposed research will advance the understanding of\r\nan RNase-based self/non-self recognition mechanism. The BAC clones isolated\r\ncan be used for studying the functions of additional S-locus genes, and for\r\ncomparative study of the S-locus of two different S-haplotypes, S1 and S2.\r\nOn the practical side, one can explore the possibility of restoring the SI\r\ntrait to self-compatible cultivated species to facilitate hybrid seed\r\nproduction.  If successful, this will have a very important agronomic\r\nimpact.\r\n",
