 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) Biology students become highly motivated when they engage in mutual, cooperative group learning. Students learn from each other under these circumstances and pursue answers to questions more efficiently and persistently than when working individually.  We are using two courses, Histology and Systemic Physiology, as pilot programs for the adaptation of cooperative and inquiry based learning techniques based on the \"workshop biology\" program developed at the University of Oregon. In the Histology course we are greatly reducing traditional lectures by substituting formal small group interaction and the use of a self-paced study guide which allows the instructor to act as a director of learning.  In both courses students are engaging in semester-long group projects culminating in formal presentations. These courses were selected because we have already successfully implemented aspects of group learning in them and quality software is currently available. This approach to student centered learning requires that the students have free access to the computers and lab equipment. This model of teaching is also being introduced into other areas of the curriculum.",
