 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will characterize fundamental propagation regimes in frontal polymerization.  A weakly nonlinear analysis will capture the development of unstable modes normal to the reaction front.  The\r\ninvestigation will partition the parameter space into regions that correspond to steady, periodic, and non-periodic propagation.  Asymptotic results will guide numerical simulations.\r\n\r\nSuch pattern prediction is one of the most important keys to understanding a physical system.  The phenomenon under consideration occurs in a test tube initially filled with a well-mixed combination of a monomer and a thermally unstable initiator.  Increasing the temperature at one end of the tube causes chemical conversion to begin.  The released heat diffuses into the reactants, causing wave propagation via the usual thermal mechanism.  In free-radical polymerization, the reactions take place in a narrow zone that\r\nadvances into the monomer/initiator mix, leaving a polymer in its wake.  The behavior of the reaction front depends on the geometry of the system, properties of the material, and the reaction mechanisms.  In stable cases, the front flattens and settles into propagating at a uniform rate.  Exhaustive analytical techniques will reveal the conditions that produce the various forms of unstable propagation.  In particular, they will distinguish between regularly-repeating acceleration-deceleration cycles and erratic propagation.  The study\r\nwill also accurately describe the qualitative shapes of the interface between the polymerized and unreacted regions.  The details of various cases will be examined computationally.  The work, which makes one of the first forays into the nonlinear analysis of polymer processes, will lend insight into self-propagating free-radical polymerization fronts observed in experiments, paving the way for future manufacturing methods. \r\n\r\nThis POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).\r\n",
