 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nThe use of computer simulations as a means to examine structure/function relationships in neuroscience has grown dramatically in recent years.  A growing number of physiologists and even anatomists are turning to computer models to help understand the significance of the biological data they collect.  This project is intended to support and enhance the use of the neuronal simulation system, GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System) that has been developed and supported in the P.I.'s laboratory for the last 10 years.  GENESIS is now used by more than 400 laboratories around the world as a platform on which to construct neurobiological simulations at many different levels of scale.  This grant specifically provides resources to support this large number of users as well as to improve and expand access to system.  With respect to basic user support, funds are provided for further expansion of online-help, web-based documentation, the GENESIS users group BABEL, and for the continued constructions of educational tutorials.  Support is also provided to continue to expand the GENESIS simulation libraries, which provide both complete models as well as modeling components for reuse in constructing new models.  With respect to expanding access to the system, we will redesign the system to support and enhance use over the web, as well as use on PCs.  With respect to the web, we will start a major rewrite of the GENESIS interface will be maintained, however, browser support and java will allow much larger access to the system.  Similarly, we will undertake a major port of GENESIS to the Windows platform for PCs.  PCs have become ever more prevalent in academic computing, especially in classrooms and laboratories.  Because GENESIS has always included a large focus on the use of the system for neuroscience education, it is now necessary to complete the PC port.  We will of course continue to maintain our UNIX (Linux) support as well.  We anticipate that this effort will substantially add to the users of the system and specifically increase the use of GENESIS in undergraduate and graduate courses.  \r\n",
