We will create and sustain an ongoing cadre of undergraduate and graduate women mentors in science disciplines whose purpose is to encourage and support younger women in middle and high schools as they progress through their lives, studies, and careers in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology fields.\r\n     The mentor thrust will train the university women to be exemplary mentors integrating in this effort the development of viable research experiences.  This effort will offer middle and high school young women a year-long interaction with a committed mentor.  We offer a semester-long mentor training course, a two-week summer campus-based, research oriented experience in which mentors and mentees will bond and work, and monthly follow-up activities during the academic year.\r\n     Additionally, school-based advisors will be actively engaged with the young women, the mentors, and the science projects.  Parents of the young women will be active participants in the delivery of project goals.\r\n     \r\n",
