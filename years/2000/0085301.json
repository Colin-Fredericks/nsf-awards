Of secondary interest is a comparison between more conventional strength-based descriptors (such as spectral acceleration) and these energy-based descriptors.\r\n\r\nProbabilistic seismic hazard analyses will be performed using both of these frequency-dependent ground motion parameters.  Revised attenuation models including data from the recent earthquakes (with emphasis on recorded near-fault motions) will enhance the current database and reduce uncertainty in hazard estimates.  Whenever soil profile information is available, attempts will be made to include site effects in the hazard estimates.\r\n\r\nDamage data for short-period industrial structures and for residential and office buildings will be collected from various regions and will also be correlated spatially with input energy and spectral acceleration demands.\r\n\r\nProducts of this study will include new predictive attenuation models as well as an understanding of the importance of energy-based ground motion descriptors and of the role of site effects on seismic hazard and on damage to short- and long-period structures.\r\n\r\n",
