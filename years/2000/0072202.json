Ginzburg\r\n\r\nThe present proposal focuses on several long-term projects\r\nand continues principal investigator's previous work funded \r\nby an NSF grant. The first question addressed in the proposal\r\nis the Hamiltonian Seifert conjecture or, more specifically, \r\nthe existence problem for Hamiltonian dynamical systems without periodic orbits on a sequence of regular energy levels. The \r\nHamiltonian Seifert conjecture is closely related to the next \r\ngroup of questions considered in the proposal. These questions \r\nlie in the area of symplectic topology and concern the existence \r\nof periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems describing the motion \r\nof a charge in a magnetic field.  The second part of the proposal includes a series of problems in Poisson geometry. Among these \r\nproblems are, for example, the existence questions for equivariant Poisson moment maps and the construction of Poisson traces corresponding to the leaves of the symplectic foliation. A \r\ngeneral program relying on applications of equivariant cobordisms \r\nto the study of Hamiltonian actions of compact groups is the \r\nsubject of the concluding part of the proposal.\r\n\r\nHamiltonian dynamical systems describe many classes of \r\nphysical processes in which dissipation of energy can be \r\nneglected. For example, planetary motion in celestial \r\nmechanics and some electro- or magneto-dynamical processes \r\ncan be, and usually are, treated as Hamiltonian dynamical \r\nsystems. One of the classical subjects in the theory of \r\ndynamical systems is the study of periodic orbits \r\n(i.e. cyclic motions). Periodic motion is the simplest \r\nand most common type of motion after equilibrium.\r\nIt is believed that a vast majority of Hamiltonian systems \r\nhave periodic orbits. The first problem addressed in the\r\nproposal is the construction of Hamiltonian systems without \r\nperiodic orbits. This is a question of considerable \r\nimportance for the theory of Hamiltonian dynamical systems \r\nbecause examples of such systems would further advance our understanding of Hamiltonian dynamics. The next problem \r\nconcerns the existence of periodic orbits for Hamiltonian \r\nsystems describing the motion of a charge in a magnetic field. \r\nThis class of Hamiltonian systems naturally arises in \r\napplications in physics and mechanics. However, few of the \r\nextremely powerful general methods that have been recently \r\ndeveloped in symplectic geometry are applicable to this \r\nclass of systems. The investigation of these systems should \r\nextend the limits of existing methods and result in the \r\ndevelopment of novel ones. Other problems considered in \r\nthe proposal concern the study of connections between\r\ngeometrical properties of classical-mechanical systems \r\nand certain quantum-mechanical phenomena. \r\n",
