 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel computational tool that totally avoids the generation of a discretization mesh in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations.  CFD is currently in use by a large number of industries to study fluid flow and heat transfer issues of a diverse number of process equipment. As computers keep becoming cheaper and powerful, the general trend in design will increasingly be towards simulation and away from experiments. The most time consuming step in the use of computational fluid dynamics for complex geometries is the generation of the grid on which the governing equations are to be discretized and solved. The grid generation step requires considerable human time in order to produce grids of acceptable quality from the viewpoint of solution accuracy and convergence.  This effort, will develop a novel computational tool that totally avoids the generation of a discretization mesh. Instead, the governing equations are satisfied at a large number of scattered points whose positions are generated either by a random number generator or adaptively as the flow field evolves during the computation. The scattered points are not connected to each other as in the finite-element and finite-volume methods, but are organized as \"clouds.\" \r\nIf successful, the approach and software will considerably reduce the grid generation effort required for computation of industrial fluid flows. \r\n",
