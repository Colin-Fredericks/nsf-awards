 "awd_abstract_narration": "The validation of structural analytical models in practice is mainly based\r\non comparing both experimental static and dynamic data with model predictions.\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop an algorithmic framework suitable\r\nfor distributed processing which updates both the model structure (constitutive\r\nlaws, modeling idealizations, discretization) and model parameters (material\r\nparameters) to produce a test validated model capable of predicting the\r\nresponse/character of the structure when subjected to a wide range of inputs\r\nand design changes.\r\n\r\nThe algorithmic framework is based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization\r\nparadigm.  The GA paradigm loosely implements Darwin's \"survival of the fittest\"concepts and attempts to evolve better solutions to a given problem statement.\r\nThe GA paradigm is being used because it does not require sensitivity\r\ninformation (which doesn't exist for model structure changes) and can seamlesslyhandle both continuous and discrete design variables.  Several GA formulations\r\nare being developed which address the computational efficiency of the algorithm\r\nbased on what experimental data is available and the model structure and \r\nparameter changes that are allowed.\r\n\r\nEven with advances in computational power, model updating can be applied to\r\nrealistic problems only if a suitable approximation theory relating changes\r\nin vibration properties to changes in model structure and parameters is \r\ndeveloped.  An iterative structural dynamics modification theory is under\r\ndevelopment which provides accurate approximations in a computationally\r\nefficient manner.\r\n\r\nThe major impact of this project is that upon completion a framework for \r\ndeveloping test verified structural models which can be used with confidence\r\nin model-based simulations will be established.  The ability of engineers\r\nto rely on model-based simulations will have a profound impact in a wide\r\nrange of areas, including product design/development, product safety\r\nevaluation, national security and infrastructure assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
