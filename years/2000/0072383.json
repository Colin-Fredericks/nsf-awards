 "awd_abstract_narration": "0072383\r\nRosenthal\r\n\r\nMathematically, convolutional codes can be viewed as linear systems over \r\na finite field. The study of these codes requires a good understanding of \r\nthe algebraic representation of linear systems.  The proposed project \r\ntherefore addresses a number of issues in mathematical systems theory and \r\nin coding theory.  The main objectives of the proposal are: 1. New \r\nmethods for constructing convolutional codes with a large free distance \r\nand a relatively small degree. 2.  New techniques to tackle the decoding \r\nproblem of convolutional codes in an algebraic manner. 3. An \r\ninvestigation of the class of low density parity check convolutional codes \r\nwhich constitutes a natural generalization of the class of low density parity \r\ncheck codes. For this project it is the ultimate goal to algebraically \r\nconstruct low density parity check convolutional codes whose encoding \r\nand decoding complexity is `near linear' and whose performance is `near \r\ncapacity'.\r\n\r\nConvolutional codes are used in the data transmission of many \r\ncommunication systems. Applications range from airborne satellite \r\ntransmission systems to terrestrial telephone lines.  Most pictures \r\ntransmitted from deep space involve in one way or another some encoding \r\nwith a convolutional code. It is the goal of the proposed research to \r\nconstruct new powerful convolutional codes which can be efficiently \r\nencoded and decoded. Having such new codes would have several \r\nbenefits. First and for all it would allow the construction of smaller and \r\nmore energy efficient transmission devices which are still capable of doing \r\nreliable data communication. The research project will necessitate a \r\nmathematical investigation into the algebraic structure of convolutional \r\ncodes. As it was outlined in the proposal this mathematical research could \r\nalso lead to a new cryptographic protocol.\r\n",
