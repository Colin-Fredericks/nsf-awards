 "awd_abstract_narration": "9907440\r\nGodoy\r\nDamage due to buckling of thin-walled, steel circular tanks under severe wind conditions is investigated by means of numerical methods.  The tanks are representative of cylindrical tanks that failed during hurricanes in the last decade in the US Caribbean Islands and Puerto Rico, including hurricanes Hugo, and Luis, Marilyn and George.  The research will establish a catalogue of tanks found in the islands and of damage detected after major hurricanes.  Some of the tanks that failed are short, with radius to thickness ratio of 1,900 and height to radius ratio of 5.  Several models will be employed to simulate the shell response and instability, including bifurcation buckling from a linear fundamental equilibrium path; non-linear static analysis of imperfect tank; and nonlinear dynamic response.  Wind action will be modeled using several pressure distributions in the circumferential direction and vary gust durations.  Elastic and elastro-plastic constitutive modeling will be employed.  The project will identify the dominant buckling mechanics for each type of tank, so as to establish comparisons and validation with observed damage and failures found.  Tanks that did not fail will also be employed to calibrate the models.  It is expected that deficiencies in designs will be highlighted by the research, and ways to improve current designs will be proposed.\r\n",
