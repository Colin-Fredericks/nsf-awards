Phage display is a rapidly growing and expanding area of biotechnology used to identify peptide ligands.  Although there are 4-6 meetings on phage dABisplay per year, none of them address the fundamental biological or structural basis of the technology.  However as this technology matures, it is becoming clear that the biology of the phage-host cell system places intrinsic limitations on the technology.  Reducing these limitations will be critical for future advancement s in the field.  To catalyze research efforts in this area, and to make the community more aware of the biological limits of the technology, this conference will explore the biological basis of phage display technology, and will address strategies for expanding the utility of the system through manipulation of the biological system.  Each session will contain talks on the basis sciences of an aspect of phage biology pertinent to phage display as well as talks on its applications in structural biology, biochemistry, or other areas.  The plan is to lead the speakers and participants into discussions of biological and structural constraints of phage display and ideas on how to overcome or circumvent them.\r\n",
