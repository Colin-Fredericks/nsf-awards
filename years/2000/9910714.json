 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the linguistic properties and variation that occur\r\nin Tactile American Sign Language, a variety of ASL used primarily by\r\nDeaf-Blind adults having Ushers Syndrome  Type 1.  Ushers Syndrome Type\r\n1 is a hereditary genetic condition in which a person is born deaf and\r\nhas retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a condition that causes a slow loss of\r\nvision.  Many adults with Ushers grew up as members of the Deaf community\r\nand used 'visual' ASL as their primarily means of communication.   Only later,\r\nwhen their vision became so affected that they had difficulty seeing\r\nASL, did they switch to receiving  (American Sign Language) tactilely by putting their\r\nhand on top of the signer's hand.\r\n\r\n Studying the Tactile ASL used by these Deaf-Blind adults provides a\r\nunique sociolinguistic opportunity to examine linguistic changes that a\r\nvisual language (ASL) undergoes as the Deaf-Blind community adapts the\r\nlanguage to a tactile mode (Tactile ASL).  A large corpus of Tactile ASL data\r\nwill be created by videotaping interviews in which a Deaf-Blind adult, fluent\r\nin Tactile ASL, interviews other equally fluent Deaf-Blind adults. Targeted\r\nphonological, lexical, syntactic and discourse features will be examined for\r\nvariation and for correlations with internal and external constraints.",
