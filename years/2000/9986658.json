 "awd_abstract_narration": "9986658\r\nHoff\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to study various questions relating to the existence, \r\nstability, regularity, and large-time behavior of solutions of certain partial \r\ndifferential equations arising in the theory of viscous, compressible fluid \r\nflow. Previous work on the existence of discontinuous solutions of the \r\nNavier-Stokes equations in three space dimensions will be extended to \r\nfinite regions, requiring new insight into the production of compressible \r\nvorticity at boundaries. A rigorous analysis of the propagation of \r\nsingularities and the regularity of discontinuity surfaces in solutions of \r\nthese equations will be given. A continuous-dependence theory will be \r\ndeveloped, sufficient to provide a framework in which numerical \r\nprocedures for approximating solutions can be studied. The dimension of \r\nthe attractor for the Navier-Stokes equations in one space dimension will \r\nbe estimated in terms of the size of the applied force and scale-invariants \r\nof the system. Finally, previous work on the multidimensional stability of \r\nlarge-amplitude viscous shocks for scalar conservation laws will be \r\nextended to the more applicable case of systems.\r\n\r\nThe proposer will study various mathematical questions concerning \r\nimportant models of compressible fluids and materials.  These models \r\narise in a broad range of applications, including supersonic flight, dynamic \r\nmeteorology, semiconductor theory, and the design and use of viscoelastic \r\nmaterials.  While the main goal in constructing these models is to achieve \r\na predictive capability, they are far too complicated to be \"solved\" in any \r\nexplicit sense. On the other hand, adequate approximate solutions can \r\nfrequently be generated by computer methods.  The intelligent design of \r\nsuch methods depends crucially, however, on a rigorous understanding of \r\nwhy solutions do exist, in what sense, and in what ways they are sensitive \r\nto noise in the data. The primary goal of this project is therefore to provide \r\nsuch a rigorous mathematical analysis for these models.\r\n",
