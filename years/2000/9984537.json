 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe ability to change and control precisely material properties of\r\nsemiconductors by several orders of magnitude has revolutionized our\r\ninformation age. While the research in semiconductor devices in the last\r\n40 years has been concentrated on the optimization and control of the\r\nopto-electronic properties, there has only been a limited work on\r\nthermo-electric properties. In this research program, we propose to use\r\nsame techniques of bandgap engineering and thin film epitaxy to improve\r\nthe thermal characteristics and design novel high performance\r\noptoelectronic components. The core of proposed research is based on the\r\nfact that semiconductor heterostructures and superlattices can modify\r\nthe average transport energy of electrons beyond what can be achieved\r\nusing bulk material. Such modifications in conjunction with judicious\r\nchoice of device parameters can make the electron gas absorb thermal\r\nenergy from one area in the device and deposit it in another area near a\r\nheat sink. The integrated electrical, optical and thermal approach gives\r\nthe opportunity to improve the performance of existing devices. As\r\nspecific examples, we will study the design of light emitting diodes and\r\nhigh power semiconductor lasers in which the device performance is least\r\naffected by ambient temperature changes.  This research will be\r\nintegrated in an undergraduate class on Properties of Materials. In this\r\nclass, students will perform simple transport measurements such as heat\r\nconduction, Hall or Peltier effect. Through the graphical representation\r\nof the transport equation developed for the research part of this\r\nproposal, students will be able to see how the electron gas is moving\r\nthrough the semiconductor, why there is Wiedemann-Franz law, and how\r\npassage from one semiconductor to another one gives rise to Peltier\r\neffect.\r\n",
