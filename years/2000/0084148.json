 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for an effort to compile a manual of standard operational policies for biological field stations. There are approximately 170 field stations in the US that are member stations of the Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS) as well as a smaller number of foreign stations. OBFS members have pointed to the need for and utility of a manual that describes common procedures for field station planning activities, administrative structures and policies, facility provision and maintenance, program integration, data management and communication, fundraising, fiscal responsibility and financial management. As a major component of the effort, 10 participants selected from member stations of the OBFS will meet in a three day workshop to finalize an outline and develop an initial draft document  Prior to the workshop, survey efforts and preliminary discussions with a wider group at the OBFS annual meeting will result in the compilation of existing operating policies, and generation of a draft outline of the proposed manual. The final product will be available via the internet and also as hard copy.\r\n\r\nNew field stations are being established at a phenomenal rate, and older, established stations are reconfiguring to meet demands for integrating research and education programs. The OBFS, with support from NSF through several workshops and initiatives in the recent past, has identified the development of a standard operating procedures manual as a significant step in streamlining administrative and facility processes at stations.  This is expected to help the stations offer the best possible field research and educational opportunities to researchers and students across the nation. \r\n\r\n",
