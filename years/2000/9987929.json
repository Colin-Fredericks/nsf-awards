Boyd and other members of the Chemistry Department at Loyola University of Chicago in continuing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002, 30 undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting summer research in organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, and biological chemistry under the supervision of Chemistry faculty. Participants will be integrated into a research group with other undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty. In addition to weekly research meetings participants will take part in field trips to corporate and government laboratories such as Argonne National Laboratory, Fermilab, Abbott Labs and Amoco .  Students will present their research at a Symposium at the end of the summer and will be encouraged to submit papers at the two undergraduate research symposia held annually in the Chicago area.",
