Some time during 2000 we will have a large fraction of the human genome sequence, and the entire genome sequence of a flowering plant.  Heretofore, our understanding of function has come from experiments whose conclusions were largely framed in human language.  The advent of large amounts of sequence data and of \"functional genomic\" data types such as mRNA expression data, have changed this picture.  Such data is now being generated so rapidly that the amount of information contained in it will, before long, surpass the amount of biological information collected by traditional means.   Yet, we are very early in our understanding of how to \"compute\" using genomic information so as to extract biological knowledge from it.  We would like to achieve a quantitative and predictive understanding of biological functions, but building the bridge from knowledge of systems to the sets of abstractions that constitute computable entities is not easy.  The \"After the Genome\" meetings were started in 1995 to help the biological community think about and prepare for the inevitable changes in biological research in the face of the oncoming flood of genomic information.  Since then, many more biologists have become cognizant of the issues raised by this future, and, in response, the organizers of this meeting will bring together researchers and visionary thinkers from subject fields outside of conventional biology with the expectation that this will help focus, yet broaden thinking beyond the immediate future.  To this end, \"After the Genome 5\" will bring together industrial and academic researchers including physicists, chemists and engineers who are devising and using new data-gathering techniques, computer scientists who have experience moving from broad knowledge of systems to analysis that results in models and simulations, neurobiologists and computer scientists who combine physiological experimentation and computer modeling to understand single cells and small networks of cells, biologists who are trying to model genetic networks, and all around visionary thinkers.  The goal will be to suggest experimental and computational methods that will eventually lead to a quantitative and predictive understanding of biological function.\r\n",
