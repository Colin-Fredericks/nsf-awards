 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project covers a variety of methodological developments and foundational research.\r\nIn particular, the object of this research is to develop some new nonparametric model building\r\nand identication procedures for high-dimensional nonlinear time series data. The investiga-\r\ntor studies both the varying-coefficient regression models and nonlinear additive regression\r\nmodels for nonlinear time series data and makes the models practically applicable. The first\r\nobjectiveis to develop nonparametric estimation procedures for nonlinear time series. In\r\nparticular, for varying-coefficient regression models, local polynomial regression techniques\r\nare used to estimate the coefficient functions and the asymptotic properties of the resulting\r\nestimators are studied. This procedure differs from the classical local linear regression for\r\ncurve fitting where the response surface is of interest. Here, of interest is to estimate the\r\ncoefficient functions. For nonlinear additive regression models, the investigator uses partial\r\nresidual method to estimate unknown additive functions coupled with projection method\r\nand local polynomial fitting. The approach is divided into two steps. In the first step, the\r\ninitial estimated values for all components are obtained by using the projection method. In\r\nthe second step, a local polynomial technique is employed to estimate any one of compo-\r\nnents by using the initial estimated values of the rest of components. The second objective of\r\nthis research is concerned with the model identification. For both models, a new goodness-\r\nof-fit test technique is proposed, based on the comparison of the residual sum of squares\r\nunder the null and alternative models, to detect whether certain coefficient functions in the\r\nvarying-coefficient models are constant or whether certain components in the additive mod-\r\nels are linear or whether any covariates are significant in the models. The null distribution\r\nof the test is estimated by a nonparametric bootstrap method. Also, the investigator studies\r\nthe practical implementation of the methods, particularly the automatic bandwidth selection\r\nmethod based on a modified generalized cross-validation. A nonparametric version of Akaike\r\ninformation criterion is proposed for choosing the smoothing variable in varying-coefficient\r\nmodels and determining an appropriate model for given data.\r\nThis research is concerned with model estimation and identification procedures in non-\r\nlinear time series analysis. A time series is a set of data observed over a period of time. For\r\nexample, daily ozone and pollutant levels from environmental study, quarterly earnings for\r\na company or daily currency exchange rate from economical study, wild animals' popula-\r\ntion observed over years from ecological study, number of in uenza cases observed over time\r\nfrom epidemiology, and noisy telecommunication signals. The investigator has been active\r\nin this research area. Furthermore, the investigator has conducted preliminary work on the\r\ndescribed problem area which has led to encouraging results. There are sufficient reasons\r\nto believe that by pursuing the topics outlined in this proposal, the results of this research\r\nshould have significant contributions in nonlinear time series analysis, which has many impor-\r\ntant applications in the fields of economics, social science, medicine, epidemiology, biology,\r\nenvironment, physical sciences, engineering, and many others.",
