Ismail, Head, Materials Technology Division, the Industrial Technology Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka.  They plan to investigate the process of producing thin film solar devices, and the potential of reducing the costs for possible use as an economical energy source.  There is a significant market for renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, in developing countries, especially those with no fossil fuel resources.   In addition environmental considerations are increasing the demand for clean energy.  However, the high cost of silicon solar cell production and lack of knowledge in new thin film photovoltaic (PV) technologies are limiting solar renewable energy efforts to a handful of demonstration projects in most developing countries.  The two scientists plan to investigate the synthesis of photovoltaic cells using chemical processing methods, through optimization of spray pyrolysis processes for the deposition of the transparent conductors and active semiconductor components, and development of sintering processes for the growth of active semiconductors, all based on glass substrates.  In addition they plan to examine the process limitations and the potential markets for this technology in developing countries and to acquire production-cost data that may be useful for US companies interested in setting up overseas operations.\r\n\r\nScope:  Most of the research will be carried out in Sri Lanka, as the technology requires inexpensive equipment.  The research allows the US PI to extend his knowledge in vacuum-based solar cell thin film growth techniques into a new area of thin film growth by chemical processing.  Dr. Ismail heads the materials division in Sri Lanka's largest governmental research laboratory, and is expected to contribute to the project through his expertise in materials manufacture and characterization.  The proposed project is innovative and is exploratory in nature, and the investigators plan to address all relevant scientific and engineering issues in the field.  The benefits of the collaboration include potential advances that may facilitate the establishment of production facilities in Sri Lanka, the training of graduate students in both countries, and the promotion of an environmentally friendly technology.  The PI will benefit from his exposure to the requirements of solar cell technology in a developing country, and the collaborating scientist will benefit from having access to the experience in solar-cell fabrication technology available at the USF.  The proposal meets INT objectives for supporting mutually beneficial international collaboration.  This project is co-funded by the Division of International Programs and by the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.",
