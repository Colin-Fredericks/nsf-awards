 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWhat role do parties play in electoral competition?  Why would parties exert discipline on their\r\nmembers?  This investigation links these issues theoretically and empirically by modeling parties as\r\ninformative brands to voters.\r\nAs conventional wisdom suggests, most party labels carry fairly precise meanings. Democrats\r\nare generally liberal, Republicans are generally conservative, and Libertarians are basically conserva-\r\ntive but often socially liberal. The theoretical question is, how is this sustained as an equilibrium\r\nphenomenon?  In the basic model, the researchers assume there are a large number of constituencies, voters are risk averse and incompletely informed about candidate ideal policies, and candidates are unable to\r\ncommit to a declared policy platform. In this environment, parties can play a critical role by ag-\r\ngregating ideologically similar candidates. Importantly, party membership is endogenous. Certain\r\ntypes of candidates thereby have an incentive to affiliate themselves with a party to reduce voter\r\nuncertainty about their preferences.\r\nThe results of a pilot by the investigators are the following. (1) Parties can be effective screening devices for candidate preferences. Intuitively, this screening works because party membership imposes differential\r\ncosts across candidate ideological types, so that only candidates whose preferences are sufficiently\r\nclose to a party 's platform are willing to affiliate.  Even in a single party system, voter welfare\r\nis increased by the information party candidates are able to convey relative to unaffiliated candi-\r\ndates.  (2) In a two party system there is a direct link between the effectiveness of screening and\r\nplatform choices.  When the costs of joining parties is high-e.g., parties can effectively discipline\r\ntheir members or screen out certain type of candidates -party labels are very informative, and the\r\nparties' platforms converge in Downsian fashion.  When party labels are less informative, however,\r\nthe platforms diverge.This happens because taking an extreme position reduces a party's ideolog-\r\nical heterogeneity, thus making its label more meaningful to voters.  (3) Candidates do not always\r\naffiliate with the nearest party, since they also take the electoral benefits of party membership into\r\naccount.  These benefits may vary depending on constituency preferences.  Thus even candidates\r\nwith the same ideal policy may affiliate with different parties, depending on the preferences of their\r\ndistrict's median voter.\r\nExtensions of the basic model provide additional predictions. Of particular interest is the\r\npossibility of hot races in which voters learn much more about candidates than we assume in our\r\nbasic model.  This extension can account for the fact that party labels sometimes mean different\r\nthings in different places.  Another extension is to model parties as democratic institutions that must\r\nchoose platforms and screening mechanisms collectively, perhaps through a primary system. Others\r\ninclude endogenizing the number of parties, exploring alternate electoral systems, and determining\r\nthe optimal level of screening or discipline.\r\nBoth the initial results and the proposed extensions are amenable to empirical analysis.  Among\r\nthe topics we will pursue are the effectiveness of party branding, the relationship between party\r\nscreening and platform choices, retirement and defection patterns, and the evolution of platforms\r\nover time.\r\n",
