These activities will conclude in a \"white paper\" that will convey the overall vision of the Center.\r\n\r\nThe recent decision to integrate the Board on Testing and Assessment (BOTA), the Board on International Comparative Studies in Education (BICSE), and the Center creates a unique opportunity for leadership.  Financial support is necessary to enable the Center to articulate a research and action plan and to build the appropriate infrastructure to carry out this strategic plan.\r\n",
