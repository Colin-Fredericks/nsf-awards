 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates experimental physical organic chemistry and educational activities.  The research aspects of this project deal with the understanding of electron-transfer reactivity.  In particular, a unified and self-consistent model that can predict both absorption and emission processes has yet to be established.  These studies gain in importance since the formation of ion pairs for excited charge transfer complexes is considerably more complex than was initially thought.  Experiments to accurately determine association constants and absorption spectra for weakly bound complexes, together with time-resolved linear dichroism measurements, will be used to gain in understanding of the initial stages of photoinduced charge separation.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program supports the research and educational activities of Professor Bradley R. Arnold of the University of Maryland Baltimore County.  The research being pursued deals with the interaction of discrete chemical entities between which electrons are being induced by light to move from one molecule to another.  This is relevant to such studies as biological photochemistry such as photosynthesis and also to molecular devices.  The educational aspects of the proposal deal with improving students' understanding of how computers interface with laboratory equipment and is being pursued in a hands-on, discovery approach.\r\n",
