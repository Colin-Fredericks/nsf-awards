 "awd_abstract_narration": "9910174  Ball  The objective of this project is to obtain an improved understanding of the manner in which organic contaminants of surface and groundwater are absorbed and adsorbed on substances such as charcoal, shale and sand.  Processes used in water treatment practice frequently depend on adsorptive and absorptive characteristics of substances used or produced during the treatment process.  In related prior research supported by his Presidential Young Investigator award from the National Science Foundation (9196241) the investigator studied sorptive properties of soils toward two synthetic organic soil contaminants (triochlorobenzene and trichloroethene).  Soils studied emerged from a common parent rock but differed in their content of soil organic matter as influenced by differences in natural decomposition products and infiltration of water.  In this project the investigator plans to increase the number of soil contaminants to include chlorobenze, two dichlorobenzenes, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, lindane and diuron.  These compounds differ sufficiently significantly enough in their octanol-water distribution ratios and aqueous solubility for results of this work to be used in evaluating the Polanyi theory's potential usefulness in predicting sorptive behavior of soil.  Results of this research may be applied to calibration of mathematical models that predict the performance of processes affecting the dispersive properties of organic contaminants of soil as affected by natural decomposition processes and leaching.  This knowledge is expected to lead toward better engineering design and use of environmental technologies than is now possible for processes and systems to decontaminate soil to reduce or eliminate the pollutional influence of contaminants on the quality of grounewater and prevent movement of contaminants from contaminated sites. ***",
