 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, combining research expertise from University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and University of Southern Mississippi (USM), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), focuses on the synthesis, manufacture, processing, and characterization of network forming biodegradable oligomers and composites to produce bio-inert materials that mimic the natural environment and can be actively involved in growth and body repair.  Two different types of functional biodegradable oligomers will be synthesized for use in forming biocompatible matrices, incorporating carboxylic acid groups, and both carboxylic acid and olefinic functionalities.  This recommendation speaks to the current critical shortage of materials for bioengineering applications and implantable devices.  Because of the inherent liabilities associated with biomedical devices, major companies are no longer interested in supplying biomaterials, while others have been put out of business completely.  Recent advances in genetic and tissue engineering suggest the possibility of replacing or regenerating nerve tissue, blood vessels, skin, bone, cartilage, and even whole organs.  This technology requires the use of a biocompatible matrix or surface that can be seeded with cells, and \"signal\" molecules and growth factors that can support growth in or out of the body.  Unlike biomaterial applications that require bio-inert material, tissue-engineering materials must mimic the environment while being actively involved in the growth and repair process. Ideal matrix materials serve as a template for tissue regeneration and then disappear or actually become part of the tissue.  Consequently, biodegradable polymers such as polylactides and polygycolides are attractive precursors for these applications.  To overcome difficulties, this work will synthesize the two biodegradable oligomers that can be used to form biocompatible matrices under mild conditions.  In the collaboration, UMMC contributes expertise in biomaterial research, while UAB and USM contribute in synthetic polymer chemistry, and ORNL offers expertise in ceramic engineering. The project provides an ideal training environment, developing a broad perspective in biomaterial research.\r\n",
