 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF supported project involves a multi-disciplinary team who will develop new manufacturing methods to improve the functionality of dental implants.  The goal of this project is to produce dental implants through new powder processing technologies to create functionally graded materials that can be biologically bonded to the human bone.  Specifically, the objectives are two-fold:  (1) to develop net shape/near net shape Ti implants of dense core with surface porosity that are coated with biocompatible hydroxyapatite (HAp) coating and  (2) to characterize the implants in terms of mechanical properties and biocompatibility.  The hypothesis is that bone re-growth will be promoted by the pores in the Ti that support the penetration of the HAp coating deeply into the substrate.  The dense Ti core will maintain the overall strength.  An innovative processing technique will be used to create an inverted porosity in Ti.  Thick films of HAp will be deposited on Ti using an electrodeposition technique.  The coatings will be characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques.  Mechanical property evaluations such as hardness, fracture strength, and adhesion will be performed to examine the quality of the as-coated implants. In vitro testing in simulated body fluids will be carried out to evaluate its bioactivity. The surface characteristics of the implant in simulated fluid will be studied in situ by an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope.\r\n \r\nThe participation of  local high school students will be one of the outreach activities of this project that will introduce them to the Biomedical Engineering field.  The high school students will work with both undergraduates and graduate students on this project, creating an exciting learning environment at all levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
