The KOK is a 223 ft. vessel, constructed in 1979 and modified in 1993, and is owned and operated by the State of Hawaii.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 145 operational days during 2000, of which 55 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support NOAA, Navy, and NURP projects.  The projects scheduled on the KOK represent several oceanographic disciplines and programs such as HOT and and NOAA's MOBY program, involving ocean times series projects, process studies and assisting with mooring deployments/retrievals, thereby fully utilizing the vessel's capabilities.  The KOK will support use of the submersibles PISCES-IV and PISCES V.  Operations in 2000 will mainly take place locally within 60 NM of Hawaiian territorial waters.\r\n\r\nThe RV Ka'Imikai-O-Kanaloa is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
