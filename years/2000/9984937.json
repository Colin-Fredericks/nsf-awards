 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the integration of teaching and research activities.  The research aspects involve the synthesis and study of small, neutral, all-carbon molecules.  These play a key role in the formation of fullerenes from graphite vapor, but very little is known about the reactivity of these putative fullerene precursors.  Controlled production and isolation of the all-carbon compounds in the gas phase and in low-temperature matrices will provide detailed spectroscopic information about the structures and reactivity of both linear and cyclic all-carbon isomers.  The integration of research and educational activities involves the inclusion of current research topics in the undergraduate curriculum as well as the incorporation of molecular modeling into teaching and research.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Program provides support for the research of Professor Nancy S. Goroff of the State University of New York at Stony Brook.  Professor Goroff will study the behavior of novel small molecules that are theorized to be precursors to buckminsterfullerenes and related compounds, and will seek to integrate these research activities with her teaching responsibilities.  Current research topics will be brought into the classroom to enliven the curriculum and provide students with a better appreciation for modern chemistry.  In addition, a workshop series in molecular modeling is seen as an opportunity for the advancement of teaching for science majors, since it is a critical part of modern chemical research.\r\n",
