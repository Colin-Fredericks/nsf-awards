 "awd_abstract_narration": "9911934-Scharfen\r\n\r\nThe Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) have recognized the scientific and economic value of the data obtained from research activities in Antarctica and the need to make this information available to the greater scientific community.  Out of this recognition, an international effort to create a comprehensive electronic directory of Antarctic data set descriptions was begun.  As an Antarctic Treaty Party, the United States is participating in this effort through the operation of the U.S. Antarctic Data Coordination Center.  \r\n\r\nThis proposal continues the development and functioning of the U.S. Antarctic Data Coordination Center (USADCC).  The primary role of the USADCC is to facilitate the creation of data descriptions (metadata) and their submittal to the Antarctic Master Directory.  Internal to the U.S., the USADCC provides a national focal point for this activity, by assisting scientists with metadata directory tools, formats, and requirements, and by providing assistance to researchers with related data management issues.  Externally, the USADCC represents the U.S. in the international discussions related to the development of the Antarctic Master Directory.\r\n\r\nContinuation of this effort will ensure that the usefulness of the scientific data resulting from the U.S. Antarctic Program is maximized. This will be accomplished as a result of the data's being documented in a common format and by easy access to the descriptions through a widely available directory system.  Funding this proposal will continue the needed coordination with U.S. scientists and with our international counterparts in this effort. \r\n",
