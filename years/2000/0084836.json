This objective will be accomplished by implementing three driving goals, all resting on a standards-based curriculum and district wide reform agenda referencing the Malcolm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence guidelines.  Goal one of this initiative is to enhance the quality of teaching and learning for all students.  \r\n\r\nThis goal concentrates on professional development and will be accomplished through extensive teacher pre-service and in-service plan in collaboration with four partnering universities, Langston University, Oklahoma State University, University of Central Oklahoma, and University of Oklahoma. Goal two will refine and further develop the standards-based mathematics, science, and technology curriculum and improved curriculum alignment, both vertically and horizontally.  \r\n\r\nThis will be accomplished with ninety (90) school-based teams, each at a school site working with a cadre content coaches and professional consultants.  Goal three will use continuous instructional improvement strategies in classrooms to enable students, assisted by teachers, to research and measure their own progress and identify immediately areas of accomplishment and measures for continuous improvement.  Special measurement tools and techniques will assess individual student progress, strategies, and class performance.  All goals will aim arrows at the same target of closing gaps in student academic achievement.\r\n\r\nThe cost share for this project is $2,481,250\r\n\r\n\r\n",
