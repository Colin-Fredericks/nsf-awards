About 400 researchers and students participate each year, and the proceedings of the symposium are published in the Annals of the garden within a year or so of the meeting. This award will continue support for the annual symposia, with attention to a range of timely research topics, methodological advances in the field, and the interface between science and policy. Starting in fall 2000, the symposium will explore the topic of species concepts (morphological, biological, and phylogenetic) and their implications for biodiversity inventory and conservation policy. Speakers are chosen to represent current research contributions to the field, and to cover a full range of taxa and methodologies, and with consideration for workforce diversity (ca. 40% of past attendees and speakers have been women). Timely publication of the proceedings volumes increases the impact of the symposia, and several of these have become landmark reviews of research in evolutionary and systematic biology, of wide use in upper-level college and graduate classes. As well, participants, especially students, make use of the immense library and herbarium resources at the Garden in conjunction with the two-day symposium, thus increasing the opportunities for interaction and networking.\r\n\r\n",
