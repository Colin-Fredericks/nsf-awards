 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology for 2000.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is in the area of Microbial Genetics and is entitled \"Characterization of a Second Circadian Oscillator in Synechococcus sp. Strain PCC 7942\".  The single-celled cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. Strain PCC 7942 has a circadian pacemaker or \"clock\" consisting of at least three genes (kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC) that has an endogenous period of 25 hours.  A second, mutant clock with a 27.5-hour period has been shown in the sigC mutant of Synechococcus.  While experiments have shown kaiA in this mutant to oscillate with the 27.5 hour period, kaiB exhibits the wild-type 25 hour periodicity, leading to the hypothesis that there is an unforeseen oscillator (UFO) present that is overruled under wild-type (i.e. normal) conditions by the master Kai oscillator.  This research physiologically characterizes the 27.5-hour oscillation of strain PCC 7942 by examining its temperature compensation and ability to phase reset.  In addition, the molecular basis of the 27.5-hour UFO and its effects on synechococcal circadian gene expression is investigated.\r\n",
