 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project is to develop an optical sensor for high performance interferometric measurements which directly compensates for air turbulence and humidity effects on optical path length measurements. It also permits the rapid measurement of refractive index changes at multiple wavelengths for a wide range of materials. This miniaturizable device will provide high sensitivity, and stability, allowing for sub-nanometer precision distance measurements. This sensor will provide greatly enhanced performance and stability over typical nonlinear crystals and allow multiple nonlinear processes to be performed in the same crystal, while being of lower cost and much smaller size. it can even be assembled into two-dimensional arrays for monitoring the performance of high power optical systems, and optical fabrication measuremerts. The Phase I objective is to theoretically and experimentally investigate potential of this device concept for high precision (5ub-nanometer) interferometric measurements.\r\n\r\nHigh precision measurements in an air environment are of critical importance in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuits, large optics of high precision such as for the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), and high precision machining. If coupled with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) it can enable extremely precise distance measurements over long paths in air. An alternative application is in high power laser diagnostics, where real-time monitoring of pulsed laser optics can provide important information for enhancing stability and performance.\r\n\r\n",
