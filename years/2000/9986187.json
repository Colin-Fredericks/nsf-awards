 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference on \"Protons and Membrane Reactions\" is held every 3 years in February.  The conference was initiated with an emphasis on chemiosmotic theory and competing theories of proton transport across membranes.  It has evolved to not only emphasize proton transport in a variety of biological systems, but also the transport of other ions and issues of ion specificity.  It is a unique conference in the general area of bioenergetics, biomembranes and transport with emphasis at the interface between the physical chemistry of ion (proton) transport and the biochemistry of membrane transport proteins.  The exchange of ideas has helped to make the physical chemists more biological and vice versa.   In 2000 the meeting will integrate considerations of: the principles of membrane protein structure and protein-lipid interactions; the solved structures of channel proteins and new methods for kinetically tracing channels within proteins; the physical chemistry and theory of proton movement within proteins; the mechanisms of proton and sodium movement through the rotary membrane motor of ATP synthase; mechanistic comparisons of the rotary motors in ATP synthase and bacterial flagella; the mechanism of proton pumping in bacteriorhodopsin and related rhodopsins in the context of high resolution X-ray structures; the chemistry and physics of electron-coupled proton movement in reaction centers and bc1 complex; and pathways of proton, sodium, water and substrate movement in secondary carriers.  The program is broad to promote cross-fertilization. The meeting has historically attracted scientists from the US and abroad, and presents a unique opportunity for young investigators to meet and exchange ideas with these senior foreign and US scientists and has help reinforce the need for integration of physiochemical and biological approaches to research.  Funds will help support junior independent investigators, postdoctoral and graduate students to attend.\r\n\r\n",
