 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59) Engineering education is undergoing a fundamental transformation from the Industrial Age to the Information Age. This project is developing innovative programs to support student development and instruction in the first two years of an engineering program. Asynchronous Learning (ASL) courses covering an engineering core of calculus-based physics with laboratory experiences and statics and dynamics have been developed; these courses are now being enhanced to address students' preferred learning styles and to include training modules for developing students' self directed learning (SDL) capabilities. Collaboration with engineering science programs at two-year colleges is providing the first stage of dissemination, with eventual dissemination nationwide. Formative and summative evaluation will be built into the courses, with an emphasis on learner-centered evaluation tools for self, peer, and team evaluations. Commercial publication of the courses and self-directed learning modules is also being explored. \r\n",
