This project is an initiative towards investigating optimal dissemination of interdisciplinary science. The immediate goal of the project is to design an undergraduate computational biology curriculum as a model of interdisciplinary education. (1) We are drawing the attention of beginning undergraduates through an exploratory course with no prerequisites on computational molecular biology; (2) we are providing students of biology and chemistry a background in computer programming, and the students of computer science in the fundamentals of molecular biology; and (3) we are teaching the students the fundamentals as well as the current progress of computational biology through a multi-instructor course. The second concurrent goal is to establish a Web-based out-reach program for educational institutions that lack an equivalent concentration of instructors in computational biology.\r\n\r\nSince participation in research is an integral part of science education, we are encouraging undergraduate students in the program to work in \"independent research\" programs with participating faculty members during their senior year. This experiment in educational technology is providing a unique contribution towards enrichment of undergraduate education in cutting edge multidisciplinary fields. The project is adapting from the science education literature teaching methods that emphasize in class discussion and peer-led workshop formats.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the cost share the University has committed to supply LAN-connected PCs to facilitate the laboratory for the program. Donation of additional equipment is being negotiated from Microsoft Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
