However, this diversity is poorly quantified, and its relationship to ecosystem functioning is not well understood. In this project, the investigator proposes to examine the relationships between the diversity and activities of soil microorganisms and stability of soil biological systems. Stability of soil biosystems will be measured by assessing activities of two plant pathogenic fungi, Pythium ultimum and Rhizoctonia solani. Two major questions guide this research: 1) Do high activities and diversity of soil microorganisms reduce activities of root pathogens? 2) Does the increase of diversity and activities of soil microorganisms enhance the resistance of soil biosystems to introduced pathogens? This study will advance our understanding of the relationship between soil diversity and the stability of soil biosystems. Knowledge of the effects of soil microorganisms on plant pathogens will also help us design better practices that reduce crop damage caused by these pathogens in sustainable agricultural systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
