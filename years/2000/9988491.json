 "awd_abstract_narration": "CCR 9988491\r\nSmith, Scott\r\nJohns Hopkins University\r\nType Systems for Secure Programming\r\n\r\nSecurity in language design is a rising concern due to increased\r\nportability of code.  Most language-level security mechanisms have\r\nbeen afterthoughts to language designs.  One widely known language\r\nsecurity system is the Java Security Architecture, found in the JDK\r\n1.2.  There, access control mechanisms are written as code in the\r\nprogram itself, and it is difficult to determine what access controls\r\nare actually in place.  The goal of this research is to develop a\r\ndeclarative security architecture for programming languages.  In this\r\nproject, a novel static type system for guaranteeing safety with\r\nrespect to certain security properties at run-time will be developed.\r\nThe research consists of two main components,\r\n\r\n* a novel static type system in which security information decorates program\r\n  types (so-called security access types), and the type system properly \r\n  enforces propagation of this information;\r\n\r\n* a novel module system which includes security access types as part of the\r\n  interface, and for which program linking will entail validating security\r\n  properties.\r\n\r\nThe aim is an expressive, flexible security discipline which allows\r\nstatic verification that security checks are met, allowing run-time\r\nsecurity checks to be avoided.  The advantages of static over dynamic\r\nenforcement of properties forms one of the basic pillars of\r\nprogramming language design and software engineering: the types\r\nthemselves serve as concise readable specifications of program\r\nbehavior, and the lack of a class of run-time errors gives more\r\nreliable execution behavior.  In the context of secure programming,\r\n\"more reliable\" directly translates to \"more secure\".  The long-term\r\naim of this research is a more secure internet.\r\n",
