 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from 3GCOM proposes specific algorithms suitable for application in Third Generation Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Networks, which couple the technique of re-transmission RAKE with power control in order to achieve high performance gains.  The R-RAKE protocol (which gets its name from the fact that it rakes-in energy from previous failed packet transmissions in decoding the current one) provides an increased received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  3GCOM proposes specific methods for simulation, in order to optimize the algorithm's design and show the benefits of the proposed approach.  In addition, specific protocols are proposed to be studied, in order to provide a tradeoff analysis on the algorithm's implementation in the protocol layer of Third Generation systems, allowing for fast software product development during Phase II.  The firm will offer products that allow for optimized 3rd generation operation.  The products pertain to implementing algorithms in software to achieve this optimized system operation.\r\n\r\nIn the next so-called Third Generation of wireless cellular communications, high-speed, high-quality data services are dominant, but these services place very strong demands on the required power, and the network resources (capacity).  Therefore, protocols and algorithms to allow for more efficient high-speed data are necessary.  3GCOM proffers a technology with important potential to enhance data service quality in the US-based wireless industry.\r\n\r\n",
