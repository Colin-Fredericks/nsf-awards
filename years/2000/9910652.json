 "awd_abstract_narration": "In health care, social differences can affect how people perceive, speak with, listen to, and interpret one another. Specifically, studies report that Black and White patients with the same symptoms, gender and insurance may be treated differently as they communicate in a predominantly White health care system. Black and White people participate in common and separate speech communities, but whether their language use and inferences differ in health care settings has not been adequately investigated.\r\n\r\nThis study will examine ways of speaking and documented outcomes as White physicians speak with Black adolescents of the same gender and with the same health insurance. The AMC/CDC  Measuring Adolescent Preventive Services (MAPS) study provides a corpus of recorded untranscribed interviews which will be sampled and studied using conversation analytic methods. Using ethnography of communication, the analysis will compare language forms, discourse processes and linguistic strategies with meanings patients assigned after health encounters. This study investigates how language practices constitute or mediate symbolic racial identification, and whether these practices affect communication in health encounters.",
