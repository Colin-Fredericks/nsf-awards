 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this US-Brazil experimental project, John Malin of the American Chemical Society (ACS) will initiate a pilot program of traveling seminars in Chemistry.  In this project a group of first-rank U.S. scientists will visit several Brazilian institutions over a period of a month.  During this time the group will give colloquia in their specialty areas and interact with Brazilian colleagues and their students.  The mission to Brazil will be scheduled during the period June-August, 2001. In cooperation with the Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica and the Associacao Brasileira de Quimica, the American Chemical Society will coordinate visits at key research universities in some five locations. Participants will help develop a new climate of research interactions between the U.S. and Brazilian chemistry by establishing new personal contacts, assessing the chemical research environment of the institutions visited, and identifying special scientific opportunities.  The visit and the participants' report will establish a new basis for enhanced U.S.-Brazilian cooperation in the chemical sciences and also provide a model for interactions with other countries.\r\n",
