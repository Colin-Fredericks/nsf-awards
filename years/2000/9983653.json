The\r\nproposed controls will provide Independent Service Operators (ISOs) and\r\npresent-day utilities with tools necessary to achieve the cost reduction\r\ngoals of deregulation without sacrificing reliability.  The proposed\r\nresearch will investigate the selection of contingencies to simulate for\r\nthe training data, algorithms for converting simulation data into input-\r\noutput pairs that make up the training sets, and measures of performance\r\nused to evaluate the classifier operation.  The PI and graduate students\r\nwill collaborate with researchers at Cornell University and the Bonneville\r\nPower Administration and will test the proposed methods against other\r\nschemes reported in the literature for out-of-step relaying, generator\r\ntripping, active load modulation, HVDC fast power changes, and reactive\r\npower switching.  Students in EE 588, Advanced Topics in Power Systems,\r\nwill train and test NNs on data from the research.  Undergraduate students\r\nin EE 479, Automatic Control Systems Laboratory, will design feedback\r\ncontrols for the simple power system model that is analyzed in this\r\nproposal.  The PI will engage all students in active learning through\r\nfrequent and extensive exercises that lead students through the discovery\r\nprocess of problem solving instead of just rewarding the memorization of\r\ntechniques.  The PI will distribute detailed, annotated solutions to all\r\nhomework problems on the due date.  These teaching methods have been found\r\nby the PI to be successful with a broad spectrum of students, including\r\nwomen, minorities and people with disabilities.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
