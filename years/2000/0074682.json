 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to study physical and technological aspects of doping of a-C:H. The overall research goal of the project is to use the Saddle-Field Glow Discharge (SFGD) deposition method to produce a-C:H films with electrically efficient and controllable p- and n-type doping for subsequent use in microelectronic devices. The structural, optical and electrical properties of the samples will be characterized by a variety of techniques. Specific tasks include: (1) Obtain \"hands-on\" experience with a SFGD deposition system. (2) Optimize SFGD deposition parameters to provide controllable and electrically efficient p- and n-type type doping. (3) Study effects of substitution of hydrogen in an amorphous matrix by tritium. Understanding the effect of dangling bonds produced by tritium beta decay on the opto-electronic properties of materials will add to fundamental knowledge in the physics of amorphous semiconductors, and may lead to applications in opto-electronic devices. (4) Study possibilities of modifying film properties after deposition by annealing and free-electron laser irradiation. It will help her to overcome scientifically limited environment of a small teaching institution. The PI will acquire additional experimental skills in the area of thin film deposition. The anticipated outcomes from this project are a deeper understanding of (1) the growth and doping mechanisms of a-C:H, and (2) the physical properties of dangling bonds in tritiated amorphous semiconductors. Both outcomes will have fundamental and immediate practical impact. The long term benefits for the PI's research program will occur through both continued collaboration with University of Toronto researchers and the acquisition of the deposition equipment for her home institution. The expansion in the depth and scope of the PI's research will strengthen her position at UTC and in the larger research community, and make her an efficient role model for young women in science.\r\n%%% \r\nThis is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The project covers a sabbatical year and two consecutive summers, which the PI will spend doing full-time research at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Toronto, collaborating with Professor Stefan Zukotynski. The career-related goal of this proposal is to re-establish the PI, whose research career has been interrupted for three years, as an active researcher in the field of semiconductor physics/materials science. The POWRE award will provide the PI and her students with the opportunity to use world-class research facilities and to interact with leading researchers in the field of amorphous semiconductors. The research is expected to contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of special relevance to the behavior of electronic materials. The project also places emphasis on the integration of research and education through undergraduate student participation in research. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). \r\n***\r\n",
