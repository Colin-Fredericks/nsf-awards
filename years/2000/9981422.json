The project, supported under the joint program of the National Science Foundation and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), focuses on the synthesis, crystal growth and study of optical crystals for generation of high-power coherent light.  A portion of the effort will be directed to the development of a borate family of nonlinear optical and laser materials.  These compounds can function as two crystals in one, i.e., as self-frequency doubling lasers.  They will study the structure-properties relationship and further tune physical properties through synthesis and crystal growth of appropriate derivatives.  In addition, the investigators will explore new, complex aluminum borates and their potential for the realization of direct conversion of laser light to shorter wavelengths.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the U.S. investigator and U.S. graduate students.  The CNRS will support the French researchers' and students' visits to the United States.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in exploratory synthesis, flux-based crystal growth, structural characterization, and modeling studies.  This is complemented by the French team's expertise in laser spectroscopy, laser-material development, and theory.  Their collaboration will improve understanding of the structure-property relationships in nonlinear optical and laser materials, and may lead to new optical crystals for lasers.  The development of high-power laser and nonlinear optical materials is an important technology for the manufacture of microprocessors, for medical diagnostics and therapies, in flat-panel displays, food processing, and laser radar.\r\n",
