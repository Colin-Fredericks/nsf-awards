 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multicast is a network service for delivering the same data to multiple destinations. A wide range of emerging network applications - such as multi-participant video conferencing, multi-party interactive games, distance learning, group collaboration, and resource location - can greatly benefit from this service.\r\n     In this project, the researchers will develop congestion control protocols for IP multicast to support scalable and efficient dissemination of layered data to a large number of receivers in heterogeneous, dynamic networks. The researchers will investigate the use of an integrated set of three distinct mechanisms - per-group feedback-based transmission adjustment, selective participation, and menu adaptation - to solve the general multicast congestion control problem. These mechanisms will operate at different time-scales and distribute the responsibility of adaptation to different entities in the network. The researchers will experimentally evaluate the scalability and performance of protocols in a large-scale network environment where the multicast session shares network with other unicast and multicast sessions, receivers join and leave the network, and the bottleneck links and bandwidths fluctuate over time. The researchers will implement multicast congestion control protocol in the network testbed of programmable routers, based on the Internet eXchange Architecture (IXA). The outcome of the research will be a family of algorithms, protocols, and prototype implementations that will significantly advance the state of art in designing multicast congestion control protocols.",
