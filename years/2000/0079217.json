 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nAcquisition of a state-of-the-art, single-wafer cluster tool for\r\nsilicon-based heteroepitaxy is proposed.  The equipment is an Applied\r\nMaterials 'Epi Centura High Temperature' platform, configured with an\r\nepitaxial growth chamber capable of slip-free processing of wafers in the\r\ntemperature range of 550 to 1200C. The Applied Epi Centura tool enables\r\nchemical vapor deposition of blanket and selective epitaxial Si and Si1-xGex\r\nwith excellent layer thickness uniformity across the wafer.  The gas\r\nmanifold will be customized to allow a wide range of sources to be used,\r\nenabling research on new materials of rapidly increasing interest such as\r\nSi1-yCy and SiGeC.  The proposed instrument will have unique capabilities\r\nand will enable collaborations among researchers from industry and universities.\r\n\r\nThere is a significant and growing importance of silicon-based heteroepitaxy\r\nin basic and applied device research, particularly as researchers work\r\ntowards some of the fundamental barriers to continued transistor scaling and\r\nperformance improvements.  Research on the fabrication of new semiconductors\r\nand structures, and the development of novel device concepts is required to\r\novercome these limits and this will be permitted by this tool.\r\nAdditionally, the ability to synthesize new silicon-compatible materials in\r\nthis tool opens up new areas of research on photonic and\r\nmicroelectromechanical systems.  The proposed tool will be operated as a\r\ncentral facility within the Microsystems Technology Laboratory (MTL).  The\r\nlab has over 300 users per year, and the tool will be accessible to this\r\ncommunity",
