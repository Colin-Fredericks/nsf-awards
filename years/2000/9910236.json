 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project entitled \"Actively Controlled Transport with Molecular Assemblies\" is directed by Paul Bohn at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  This work focuses on the development and characterization of surfaces which, through controlled production, have microscale heterogeneity.  By controlling the geometry and surface free energy, molecular and supermolecular transport can be manipulated and studied.  The fundamental studies proposed here include (1) controlled adsorption of monolayer films that result in two-dimensional assemblies;  (2)  characterization of the structural heterogeneity; (3) improving the spatial control of molecular assembly; and (4) using controlled chemical potential gradients to direct surface motion.  Surface Plasmon Resonance, near-field scanning optical microscopy, and ac and dc resistivity measurements will be used to characterize the surfaces.  Dynamic manipulation of the chemical potential gradient will be used to affect motion of supermolecular species such as droplets on the surface.\r\n\r\nThis research will result in a deeper understanding of the controlled production of  two- dimensional surfaces  that exhibit both structural heterogeneity and chemical potential gradients.  The success of this research will have implications for understanding complex interfacial structures, which have applications in the studies of advanced materials, chemical sensing, and intercellular communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
