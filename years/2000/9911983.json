Collaborators Stanley Whittingham, State University of New York at Binghamton and Indian chemist Arunachalam Ramanan, Indian Institute of Technology will undertake research in solid state chemistry leading to an understanding of the parameters involved in hydrothermal synthesis of transition metal oxides and framework materials.  Structure control is critical for an intelligent design of battery and sensor materials.  The major emphasis of this project will be placed on vanadium and molybdenum oxides.  These host materials will be characterized for their ability to be intercalated by a variety of guest ions and molecules, and their chemical and physical properties will be determined using x-ray, electrochemical, and magnetic/electrical measurements as well as the standard analytical techniques.  \r\nScope:  This collaboration adds an international component to research currently supported by the Division of Materials Research (DMR-9810198).  Whittingham has made important contributions in the areas of hydrothermal synthesis, structural solid state chemistry, and battery materials; Ramanan has made major contributions in the areas of polyoxometalate chemistry, hydrothermal chemistry and chemistry involving intercalation compounds.  The PIs have established a record of high quality joint research.  This project will accelerate the research programs at both institutions and will impact graduate and undergraduate students.  This research has high potential to impact the development of batteries and sensors.  \r\n",
