 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nSolidification occurs in many traditional and advanced materials processes. The quality of the materials and their electrical, magnetic and optical properties are determined by microstructure formation. An iterative experiment-theory-modeling research will be conducted for crystal growth in Bridgman systems. A methodology will be developed that can effectively control the materials morphology and microstructure during eutectic solidification utilizing combined electric and magnetic fields. A virtual laboratory on crystal growth will be developed with direct involvement of undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis research will attempt to advance the fundamental understanding of the influence of electric and magnetic fields on solidification processes. It is anticipated that new methodologies will be discovered for semiconductor industries to achieve morphological control and micro-structural refinement and alignment as well as the optimization of physical properties through control of the process parameters. The availability of the virtual laboratory makes it possible to train students in utilizing advanced facilities, which is important in furthering education in engineering. \r\n\r\n",
