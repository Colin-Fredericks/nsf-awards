Miner Agricultural Research Institute will provide a 6-week summer research experience for 10 highly motivated undergraduate students interested in ecosystem research.  The PSU summer research program will involve an interdisciplinary investigation of ice-storm disturbance on ecosystem-level processes in the Altona Flat Rock jack pine barrens of northeastern New York.  The physical environment of the pine barrens strongly influences ecosystem processes such as runoff, organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling, and aquatic and terrestrial habitats.  The high level of damage to the pine barrens by the January, 1998 ice storm and subsequent \"restoration cutting\" provide a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to investigate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem processes.  This special ecosystem has been a focus of undergraduate research at PSU since 1972 and the REU program will build upon these ongoing efforts.  The principle objectives are to promote the professional development of undergraduate researchers and instill a better appreciation for ecosystem complexity, function and value.  The REU participants, individually and in small groups, will work closely with the program's eight faculty mentors on research projects ranging from surface and ground water hydrogeology, biogeochemistry, and terrestrial plant and invertebrate ecology.  The program will challenge its student researchers to expand their disciplinary focus and develop an interdisciplinary perspective.  Weekly project meetings will be used to evaluate progress, examine interdisciplinary linkages between individual research components, and develop new and expanded research plans.  Students will also participate in environmental seminars where they will have an opportunity to debate ethical, gender and minority, and environmental policy issues with the program staff and invited professionals.\r\n",
