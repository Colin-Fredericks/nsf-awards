Scott Carter, University of South Alabama\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nNew state-sum invariants for knots in 3-dimensional space and\r\nknotted surfaces in 4-dimensional space are defined by the\r\nprincipal investigator and collaborators as follows.\r\nA finite quandle is chosen. Its elements are assigned to arcs\r\nof knot diagrams (or regions of knotted surfaces) as colors,\r\nwhere the quandle condition holds at every crossing.\r\nWeights in the form of quandle cocycles, then, are assigned to\r\ncrossings (or triple points), the product of weights are taken\r\nover all crossings (or triple points), and the sum is taken over\r\nall possible colorings. The resulting expression is the state-sum\r\ninvariant. The state-sum invariant can detect non-invertibility\r\nof knotted surfaces. Similar state-sum invariants are defined for\r\ntriangulated 4-manifolds, using colors and weights from a cohomology\r\ntheory of quantum double of finite groups. Our project is to compute,\r\ninterprete, and apply these new invariants. Relations to other theories,\r\nsuch as Seiberg-Witten invariants, spin-foam models of quantum gravity,\r\nare expected. Higher categorical structures are also investigated in\r\nrelation to topological quantum field theories.\r\n\r\n\r\nA knot is a circle situated in space. Knot theory studies differences\r\namong such knotted circles, and has applications to DNA theory and\r\nphysics. When a knot is drawn on a piece of paper with self-crossing\r\npoints (called crossings), it is called a knot diagram.\r\nOne of the methods in knot theory is to assign numbers (called colors)\r\nto arcs in a knot diagram with certain rules imposed, assign weights\r\non crossings, and compute a number called the state-sum, by taking\r\nsum and product of weights with respect to all possible colorings.\r\nThe idea of state-sums came from statistical mechanics.\r\nInstead of numbers, abstract algebraic systems can be used as colors.\r\nThe principal investigator and collaborators discovered a new state-sum\r\nwhich can also be defined for higher dimensional knots --- knotted\r\nsurfaces in 4-dimensional space. They also discovered a similar state-sum\r\nfor 4-dimensional geometric objects, that are divided into small 4-dimensional\r\ntetrahedra. The project is to compute, interprete, and apply these\r\nnew state-sums. The investigation requires developing an intricate\r\nunderstanding of the algebraic structures that are used as colors,\r\nand the geometric study of properties of the state-sums. Relations to\r\nother physical theories are expected.\r\n",
