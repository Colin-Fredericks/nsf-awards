 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inverse problem of matrix construction arises in many\r\nareas of important applications. Matrices under construction\r\nare supposed to satisfy certain specific constraints. The\r\nconstraints could be inherited intrinsically from the physical\r\nfeasibility of a certain mechanical structure or could be\r\ndriven extrinsically by the desirable property of a certain\r\ndesign parameter. This proposal intends to extend the\r\ninvestigation that the PI has been conducting in the past\r\nyears with emphasis on the the development of numerical\r\nalgorithms for application to challenging inverse problems.\r\nFour specific inverse problems of matrix construction will\r\nbe studied via three possible numerical approaches. Techniques\r\nto be used involves computer experiments, high resolution\r\ngraphics and symbolic manipulation, in conjunction with\r\nmathematical analysis.  This project is expected to find\r\nimportant applications ranging from new development of\r\nnumerical algorithms to theoretic solution of difficult\r\nproblems. Since matrix reconstruction with specified\r\nproperties arises from a remarkably wide area of disciplines,\r\nthe resulting technology would have substantial impact on the\r\nprogress in scientific and engineering fields.\r\n\r\nIn the era of information and digital technologies,\r\nmassive data processing becomes an imperative task\r\nat almost every level of applications.  In many situations\r\nthe digitized information is gathered and stored as a data\r\nmatrix. Nonetheless, because most of the information\r\ngathering devices or methods have only finite bandwidth, one\r\ncannot avoid the fact that the data collected often are not\r\nexact. Signals received by antenna arrays often are\r\ncontaminated by instrumental noises; astronomical images\r\nacquired by telescopes often are blurred by atmospheric\r\nturbulence; and even empirical data obtained in laboratories\r\noften do not satisfy intrinsic physical constraints. Before\r\nany forward analysis technique can be applied, it is important\r\nto first reconstruct the data matrices so that the inexactness\r\nis reduced while certain feasibility conditions are satisfied.\r\nThe general objective of this proposal is to develop numerical\r\nalgorithms to carry out this kind of data reconstruction task.\r\nThe work in this proposal concerns the mathematical theory and\r\nthe numerical implementation of three algorithms for four\r\nspecific inverse construction problems. This investigation\r\ncould lead to improved techniques for use in several national\r\nstrategic areas, including ground-based astro-imaging\r\nprocessing, medicine, communications, and laser technology.\r\n",
