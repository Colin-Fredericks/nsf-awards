 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPI: James B. Rawlings \r\nInstitution: University of Wisconsin\r\nProposal Number: 0084707\r\n\r\n\"Chemical Process Control (CPC) VI\" will bring together engineers and scientists from universities and industry.  It will provide a forum for assessing the current status and the future needs and challenges in the field of process control.  The first five CPC conferences were successful in establishing a constructive dialogue between control theoreticians and industrial practitioners.  Common research goals were defined and steps were taken to narrow the gap between the theory and practice of process control.  As a continuation of these efforts, CPC VI will examine recent advances in process control vis a vis the current trends in the chemical and allied industries, and attempt to define the needs and intellectual research challenges for the next decade.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this CPC will explore the evolving \"Researcher - Manufacturer - Vendor\" tripartite relationship that is emerging as a viable paradigm for the efficient development and deployment of novel process control technologies for broad application in the manufacturing industries.  The theme of the conference is: \"Future Needs and Challenges in Process Control.\"  Specific goals of CPC IV are:\r\n \t\r\n            -\tTo gain an appreciation of the state of process operations and control practice in industries                               currently or potentially employing, and supported by, process control engineers and chemical                         engineers with systems backgrounds.\r\n            - Present tutorial overviews for nonspecialists in each of the important areas of   \r\n               systems and control theory, particularly emerging and new areas.\r\n           - Provide a forum for in-depth discussions between university researchers,    \r\n                industrial practitioners and commercial control technology vendors.\r\n           - Provide practitioners and vendors with a current understanding of the new   \r\n              and significant tools emerging from the research community in order to \r\n              stimulate wider implementation.\r\n              Provide a forum for assessing promising research directions for the next    \r\n              decade.\r\n          - Assess needs and challenges in the process industries, as well as evaluate   \r\n             opportunities for increased activity and application in non-traditional   \r\n              industries.\r\n",
