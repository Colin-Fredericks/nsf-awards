 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the connection between fundamental \r\nproblems in number theory, zeros of arithmetic L-functions,\r\nand random matrix theory.  Recent developments have placed \r\nthe confluence of these fields at the center of a great \r\ndeal of important work that combines activity and interest \r\nfrom researchers previously working in completely \r\ndifferent areas. The study of zeros of arithmetic \r\nDirichlet series, or L-functions, occupies a central \r\nposition in number theory and includes within its realm \r\nboth the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and \r\nSwinnerton-Dyer conjecture. The theory of eigenvalues of \r\nrandom matrices is a subject begun nearly 50 years ago by \r\nphysicists interested in the statistics of energy \r\nlevels of excited particles. The connection between these \r\ntwo fields was revealed for the first time in 1974 in the \r\npaper ``The pair correlation of the zeros of the \r\nzeta-function'' by H. L. Montgomery. This project will \r\ninvolve both number theorists and mathematical \r\nphysicists to develop a comprehensive new model \r\nfor families of L-functions in \r\norder to gain insights into a number of fundamental open \r\nproblems about L-functions. For example, by combining \r\nrandom matrix theory and number theory appropriately, \r\nthe principal investigator and his colleagues intend to \r\n(i) find all of the terms in asymptotic formulae for \r\nmoments of families of L-functions, (ii) determine \r\nprecisely how large the extreme-most values of \r\nL-functions can be, and (iii) analyze the vanishing \r\nat the central critical point for \r\nfamilies of L-functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Bernhard Riemann made a conjecture about an important\r\nfunction known as the zeta-function.   \r\nRiemann's hypothesis is still unproven and is widely \r\nregarded as the most important unsolved problem in\r\nmathematics. It has long been known that the solution of\r\nthis problem would have significant applications to \r\ncryptography, coding theory, and the study of \r\nprime numbers. Recently, it has also been realized that \r\nthe zeta-function and the closely related L-functions \r\nprovide models for the behavior of fundamental particles in \r\nphysics.  The project `L-functions: symmetry and zeros' \r\nwill bring mathematicians and physicists together to \r\nexplore this amazing connection more deeply through the \r\nuse of a statistical tool called `random matrix theory.' \r\n",
