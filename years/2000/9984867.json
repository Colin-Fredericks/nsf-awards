 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-range goal of this research is the development of a low-cost, robust, automated on-line monitoring system that controls the automotive painting process based, in part, upon perceived surface appearance.  As a significant first step, this CAREER research plan will:   (1) develop a vision system hardware and software design which has reflectance models as a rational basis;  (2) determine the best image attributes and processing techniques to exploit the link between this design and perceived surface appearance; and (3) construct a prototype classification scheme to assess surface quality based on captured images.  The four-prong approach, which employs small-scale experiments, simulation, prototype testing and on-site testing in parallel with existing methods, is expected to yield an illumination design and sensing protocol which also yields improved results for current evaluation methods, captured images (and derived attributes) which are readily interpreted by both system software and line operators and a low-cost, flexible design which can be built with commercially available components.  Performance demands for automotive coatings are considerable.  In addition to providing protection and enhancing durability, coatings also have to be visually appealing.  It is well established that the appearance of a painted surface greatly affects a customer's perception of that product's quality and automotive manufacturers spend considerable sums each year to repair paint-related problems.  Therefore, robust methods to monitor surface quality on-line are critical.\r\n\r\nSince there is a widespread fascination with automobiles and students intuitively understand how the quality of the paint job fuels that excitement, this research plan is very easily integrated into a variety of educational activities.  Specific educational and outreach objectives projected as part of this effort include (1) a diverse research group that provides outreach and mentoring to undergraduates, K-12 students and their teachers; (2) capstone design projects; and (3) the analysis of research data (and subsequent dissemination of research results) in existing undergraduate courses.  Expected benefits of the educational plan include collaborative, hands-on research experiences and mentoring for a diverse population, and enhancement of the principal investigator's ability to build and maintain a competitive research program which attracts a well-prepared, diverse group of students.\r\n",
