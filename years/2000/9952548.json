 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) This project involves incorporation of hands-on activities that encourage creativity and exploration throughout the undergraduate computer science curriculum. It includes the development of the Senior Seminar and Project course into a capstone that emphasizes independent exploration of computing. It creates a laboratory dedicated to computer science students that is equipped with heterogeneous computing platforms and includes design of course assessment that requires creative thinking.\r\n\r\nThe project adapts material from previous NSF ILI grants to Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College and Hope College. It will also adapt operating systems courses to build open-exploration projects into the core courses taken by computer science majors, thus encouraging independent exploration culminating in a successful Senior Seminar.\r\n\r\nThe project will increase skill in abstract thinking and abstract expression of computer science concepts, increase ability to work independently on course projects, and produce interesting senior projects that demonstrate intellectual curiosity and creativity. This project serves as an example of the integration of technology into education. In this project the technology simultaneously serves as a tool for learning abstract concepts, a platform for developing concrete applications of abstract concepts, and a source for exploration of new concepts.\r\n\r\n",
