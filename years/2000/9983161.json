 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nt haplotypes are variant forms of the t complex, a 20 cM stretch of DNA on the proximal end of mouse chromosome 17. Although most t haplotypes contain a recessive developmental lethal mutation, and males heterozygous for two complementing t haplotypes are sterile, these variant chromosomes propagate to high frequencies in wild mouse populations due to transmission ratio distortion (TRD): male mice heterozygous for a t haplotype and a wild-type form of the t complex (t/+) transmit the t chromosome to nearly all of their offspring. TRD involves at least three t haplotype-encoded \"distorter\" loci (Tcd1-Tcd3) acting in concert with a t complex responder (Tcr). The distorter genes act as quantitative trait loci in that they boost transmission of the Tcr-containing chromosome in an additive fashion. T haplotypes contain 4 inversions relative to wild type forms of the t complex, thereby inhibiting recombination between + and t chromosomes and allowing propagation of the TRD loci as an intact unit. Genetic evidence suggests that the distorter genes are identical to the t complex sterility (tcs) genes, which cause male infertility when in the homozygous state. An alternative to standard recombinational mapping was provided by the observation that one of the distortion/sterility loci, Tcd1/tcs1 behaves as a loss-of-function allele, in that a deletion in the syntenic region of a wild-type chromosome mimics the distortion and sterility activities of this gene. A special resource of chromosomal deletions near the Tcd1 locus will be exploited to functionally establish its genomic interval and identify the gene(s) underlying the phenotypes. In preliminary studies, a panel of mice bearing deletions induced in ES cells has been used to map Tcd1/stcs1 to a small region of under 1 cM. This interval will be further defined by analysis of key deletion breakpoints, and transgenic rescue of the sterility/TRD phenotypes will be performed with YAC and BAC clones. Candidate genes within rescuing clones will be individually validated in transgenic experiments.\r\n\r\nThe intriguing process of meiotic drive has implications for chromosome evolution, population genetics and sperm development. Ultimately, the identification of these genes will contribute to an understanding of t haplotype meiotic drive, an understanding that will have important practical ramifications.\r\n",
