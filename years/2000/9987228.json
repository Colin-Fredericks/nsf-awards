 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59), Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\nThe Mississippi State University (MSU) program, \"Increasing Participation in Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics (CSEM) Through Scholarships\" is providing increased CSEM educational opportunities for underrepresented students to help meet the demand for scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians and contribute to the growth of the economy of Mississippi, the surrounding region and the nation. Encouraging students to pursue degrees in CSEM and to provide financial support to CSEM majors are two of the major goals of the program. Specific project objectives include: 1) increasing participation and retention of academically-talented, low income students and underrepresented groups in CSEM; 2) improving the educational experiences of CSEM students through connections of academic content to the work environment; 3) increasing awareness of employment opportunities through strengthening existing and building new industry partnerships; 4) increasing enrollment of academically-gifted students from community colleges in CSEM at Mississippi State University; and 5) encouraging scholarship recipients to pursue advanced degrees in CSEM. Forty CSEM Undergraduate and Graduate Fellows are expected to be recruited from state and regional community colleges, Historically Black Institutions, and four-year institutions. The majority of the scholarships support undergraduates, with graduate student awards limited to those who provide evidence of economic hardship. The eight operating departments and two centers in the College of Engineering and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in the College of Arts and Sciences are participating in the program. Each department has identified a representative to the CSEM program who is coordinating activities within the department. CSEM Fellows are mentored one-on-one by faculty and by their peers. In addition, they take part in research and design projects, present results of their research professionally, and interact with industry representatives. Departments are maintaining the following data on their Fellows: progress toward degree, research experiences, design projects, and industry involvement. Mentoring activities, professional development opportunities, job interviews, graduate school applications, and the change in the number of underrepresented students and transfer students in CSEM are also being documented for the purposes of program evaluation. \r\n",
