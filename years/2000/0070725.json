 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n    The classical Phragmen-Lindelof theorem extends the maximum principle\r\nto unbounded analytic functions by showing that an analytic function that\r\nsatisfies an asymptotic exponential bound in the upper half plane and a\r\nuniform bound on the real axis in fact satisfies a uniform exponential\r\nbound in the upper half plane. Research of the past three decades has\r\nshown that the validity of estimates of a similar character for analytic\r\nfunctions on algebraic varieties in n-dimensional complex Euclidean space\r\nare in fact equivalent to certain properties of linear constant\r\ncoefficient partial differential operators.  Some such properties of the\r\noperators are surjectivity on the space of real analytic functions or\r\nGevrey classes, the existence of lacuna in fundamental solutions, the\r\nexistence of linear solution operators, and continuation properties of\r\nsolutions of the homogeneous equation(s).  While there are different sets\r\nof these estimates associated to the different properties of the operator,\r\nthey all are similar in spirit.  The aim of this work is to develop\r\nmethods that give a geometric characterization of the algebraic varieties\r\nfor which a given Phragmen-Lindelof condition is satisfied.  If\r\nsuccessful, the work should also give insight into questions about the\r\npartial differential equations such as the existence of fundamental\r\nsolutions with cone-shaped lacuna. \r\n\r\nThis work is focused on developing tools in complex analysis that\r\ncan be used to answer basic questions about linear partial differential\r\nequations.  In the 1950's, Laurent Schwartz formulated such fundamental\r\nproblems for general linear partial differential equations.  Are they\r\nalways solvable?  If so, can the solution be chosen as smooth as the data\r\nin the problem?  Do fundamental solutions exist?  Can the equations be\r\nsolved with a \"formula\", so that the answer depends linearly on the data\r\nof the problem?  Most of these questions were answered in the 1950's by\r\nEhrenpreis and Malgrange.  However, the question of whether the solution\r\ncould be chosen to be real analytic when the data is real analytic was\r\nopen until the late 1960's when the first counter examples were given.  In\r\n1973, Hormander gave a characterization of the equations with this\r\nproperty in terms of the validity of certain inequalities for analytic\r\nfunctions on the zero set of the polynomial giving the differential\r\nequation.  In 1990, Taylor, Meise, and Vogt answered the question about\r\nthe existence of \"formulas\" for the solution and showed they were also\r\ncharacterized in terms of some similar inequalities.  The aim of this\r\nproject is to develop tools that allow one to decide whether or not the\r\nrequired estimates are valid for a given partial differential equation. We\r\nbelieve that it is possible to develop an algorithm that will make the\r\nverification, and further, will explain the geometry of the zero set of\r\nthe associated polynomial that is necessary for the inequalities to be\r\nsatisfied. \r\n\r\n",
