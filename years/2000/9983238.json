The defining characteristic of these partnerships is the voluntary combination of separate organizations into a coherent service delivery system supported by advanced information technologies.  The extremely rapid evolution of these technologies has created important new opportunities for governments to redesign services through partnerships with other organizations elsewhere in government, in business, or in the non-profit sector.  This research seeks to analyze and document how these new partnerships develop and perform.\r\n",
