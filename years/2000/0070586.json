 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\t\r\nThis proposal concerns several interrelated areas of mathematics: \r\nself-affine tiles and reptiles, refinable functions and wavelets, spectral\r\nsets, and mathematical quasicrystals. Although the subjects may appear to be\r\nrather distant from each other, the proposal actually has a very coherent\r\ncentral theme, which is self-similarity and tiling, and using analytical\r\ntechniques to study them.  The theme occurs naturally in self-affine tiles and reptiles, and in the branch of quasicrystal questions the PI proposes here. It occurs, although\r\nless obviously, in refinable functions and in spectral sets. \r\nThe refinement equation satisfied by a refinable function is a generalized self-similarity,\r\nand it is closely related to self-affine tiles and self-similar measures.\r\nSpectral sets, on the other hand, are closely tied with tiling, as it is\r\nconjectured that a set is a spectral set if and only if it tiles by\r\ntranslation.\r\n \r\n       A self-similar tile is one that can be disected into several pieces\r\nsuch that all pieces are identical in shape and are similar to the original\r\ntile. The simplest example of such a tile is the square, which can be\r\ndisected into 4 identical squares half in dimension of the original square.\r\nBy repeated inflation and disecting of a self-similar tile we can cover\r\na larger and larger area, and this results a self-similar tiling. Self-similar\r\ntilings are fascinating, and many of the aperiodic tiles discovered\r\nin recent years, such as the Penrose aperiodic tiles, can be viewed\r\nas generalized self-similar tiles. Furthermore, self-similar tilings\r\nhave been linked to quasicrystals, materials whose atomic structures\r\nare aperiodic rather than the usual periodic structures. It is not\r\nclear how these types of atomic structure are formed, but models have\r\nbeen conceived by physicists using aperiodic tiles. \r\n\r\n",
