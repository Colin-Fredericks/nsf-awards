Motivated by questions in \r\ngeometry and algebra, the study of harmonic maps to singular \r\ntargets, particularly metric spaces of curvature bounded \r\nfrom above, has attracted the attention of many mathematicians.  \r\nIn particular, many remarkable results have been obtained by Gromov-Schoen, Korevaar-Schoen, and Jost. The PI proposes to \r\ndevelop the minimal surface theory as a continuation of the \r\nstudy of the harmonic map theory.  The PI has shown that minimal\r\nsurfaces in metric spaces of curvature bounded from above \r\ngeneralize several important properties of the classical minimal surfaces.  We are interested in the development of a higher\r\ndimensional analogue of the theory advanced thus far.  The PI \r\nwill also investigate harmonic maps between surfaces when the\r\ntarget is given a metric of curvature bounded from above. \r\nWe are particularly interested in understanding the behavior of harmonic maps when the target metric has singularities associated \r\nwith curvature concentrations.  Furthermore, we hope to gain an understanding of the behavior of harmonic maps when we vary the \r\ntarget metrics in a certain class.  This in turn will be used\r\nto study Teichmuller spaces.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical study of harmonic maps is natural and \r\nphysically significant.  This is because physics dictates \r\nthat most natural actions occur in a way to minimize certain quantities.  For instance, it is well known that the path\r\nof light in space is affected by gravity, and this path can \r\nbe realized by a curve which minimizes arclength with respect \r\nto a certain metric.  A thin film (such as a soap film formed on \r\na closed wire frame) will come to a configuration which \r\nminimizes the surface area.  Both these configurations can also\r\nbe represented by energy minimizing maps.  As critical points \r\nof the energy functional, harmonic maps are mathematical models \r\nof natural phenomena and provide an interesting mathematical study.\r\n\r\n",
