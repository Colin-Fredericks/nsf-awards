 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposal is to study certain integrals of automorphic\r\nforms on a reductive group G.  The integrals are over a subgroup H of G\r\nwhich is large in G, in the sense that over the algebraic closure of the\r\nground-field, the group H has an open orbit in the flag variety of G.  \r\nThe integrals may be thought of being periods attached to automorphic\r\nforms and turn out to be, in all cases, interesting numbers. In\r\nparticular, in many cases, the square of the periods are conjectured to be\r\nthe central values of automorphic L-functions. Examples of such a\r\nphenomenon are results of Waldspurger and others and conjectures of\r\nGross-Prasad. In other cases, the forms for which the integrals are\r\nnon-zero are interesting in their own right. The investigator studies\r\ntheses periods and their properties by using a variant of the trace\r\nformula, called the relative trace formula.\r\n\r\nThe proposal focuses on one aspect of the so called Langlands program. The\r\ngoal of the program is to study the automorphic objects (called\r\nautomorphic representations); they can be described in terms of the\r\nspectrum of certain operators (generalized Fourier analysis). The data\r\nattached to those objects is encoded in a family of functions of one\r\ncomplex variable, the automorphic L-functions. The conjectured properties\r\nof these functions contain all possible information on the automorphic\r\nrepresentations.  Moreover, other L-functions coming from geometry or\r\nDiophantine problems should be automorphic L-functions. The value of the\r\nautomorphic L-functions at a particular point (central value) is a\r\nespecially interesting number which is difficult to compute. In many\r\ncases, it is conjectured that this number is non-negative and yet this is\r\ncannot be established directly.  The investigator is using a new method\r\n(the relative trace formula) to obtain information about some of these\r\nnumbers by representing them as square of integrals. This a novel way to\r\nconnect the automorphic L-functions and the automorphic representations.",
