 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project aims to develop an instrument to accurately characterize the thermal (T) and/or temporal (t) response of a material's specific volume (Vsp). Presently, no commercially available device exists for the characterization of Vsp (T, t) at ambient pressures. The proposer's involvement in the design, development and validation of a stage I prototype device is what has led to the identification of gaps within the existing technology. The proposed development of this next generation instrumentation was made possible through the implementation of a fiber-optic displacement sensor system developed by the proposer. This is due in part, to a constant influx of new engineering materials to the market place (i.e. thermoplastics, thermosets, metal alloys, polymorphs of existing materials, etc.) and the emergence and/or growth of new and exciting fields (i.e. microelectronics, composite manufacturing, etc.). Ultimately, this need is driven by the fact that there are a variety of physical phenomena which result in dimensional change (i.e. crystallization, curing, melting, glass formation, secondary transitions and physical aging).\r\n\r\nSpecific applications for the fully developed and commercialized instrumentation include atmospheric pressure high-resolution volumetric dilatometry; and non-contact, nano-displacement metrology; as well as, linear dilatometry, non-contact, micro-displacement metrology and thin-film metrology.",
