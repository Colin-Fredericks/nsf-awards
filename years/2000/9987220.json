 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Lubman\r\n\tAn instrument will be developed for rapid detailed sequence\r\nconfirmation of protein spots from 2-D SDS PAGE gel electrophoresis. The\r\nbasis for this work is that an important goal in the field of proteomics\r\ninvolves the ability to rapidly identify and analyze the protein content\r\nof cells. Proteins perform many of the functions in cells and small\r\nchanges in their structure may result in large changes in processes in\r\ncells. The general method for monitoring the protein content in cells is\r\n2-D gel electrophoresis;however, the determination of the protein\r\nstructure requires other methodologies, such as mass spectrometry. The\r\ninstrument to be developed for such sequence analysis will involve using\r\nhigh resolution capillary electrophoresis (CE) for separation of tryptic\r\ndigests of selected protein spots from 2-D gels with analysis of the\r\npeptide map by time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry. The method will be\r\nunique in its capabilities in terms of providing information on the\r\nchanges in the detailed sequence of proteins at femtomole levels from 2-D\r\ngels, including the presence of phosphorylations, glycosylations,\r\ndeamidations, etc. Further the method will be developed to provide rapid\r\nanalysis (5 min) for each protein spot and will be automated to perform\r\nanalysis for up to 100 selected spots from a gel.\r\n\r\n\tThe unique instrumentation to be developed involves capillary\r\nelectrophoresis/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). The peptides\r\ngenerated from enzymatic digestion of a protein will be separated using CE\r\nto provide the resolution to resolve the large number of peaks that result\r\nfor proteins up to 100 kDa. The narrow bands (1-3 s) produced by these\r\nseparations, require the use of a nonscanning TOFMS to respond to the\r\nspeed of the method. The TOFMS provides analysis of the mass of the\r\neluting peptide peaks so that a detailed peptide map can be obtained. In\r\naddition, an ion trap will be used as a prestorage device before the\r\nTOFMS, so that ions can be stored and integrated before analysis. The ion\r\ntrap provides capabilities for selective isolation of ions and tandem mass\r\nspectrometry (MS/MS) so that detailed structural analysis can be performed\r\non the peptides by collision induced dissociation (CID). This methodology\r\nis being developed on-line for full structural analysis of tryptic\r\npeptides for proteins up to 100 kDa. An initial identification of the\r\nselected protein spots from a 2-D gel can be performed by MALDI-mass\r\nspectrometry and database search. The peptide map obtained by the CE-TOFMS\r\ncan be automatically compared to the known sequence from the database and\r\npeptides that do not match the expected sequence can be analyzed for\r\nmodifications by the MS/MS data. Using this method, up to 100 selected\r\nspots from a 2-D gel can be analyzed to identify posttranslational\r\nsequence modifications.\r\n\r\n\tThe problem to be studied by this method will involve monitoring\r\nchanges in protein expression in 2-D.  The focus will be on various proteins \r\nthat have been over-\r\nor underexpressed or where the presence of modifications has resulted in a\r\nchange of migration of the gel spot. The methodology being developed will\r\nprovide the ability to rapidly monitor detailed changes in protein\r\nstructure that are possibly related to various changes in the cell cycle.\r\nThe instrument to be developed will provide unique\r\ncapabilities for rapid detailed studies of these proteins for structural\r\nchanges and critical modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
