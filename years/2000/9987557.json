 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program provides continued support for a site at the University of Miami (Ohio).  The site will be directed by Drs. Michael W. Crowder and Christopher A. Makaroff.  Research opportunities will be provided for 10 students each summer in areas of analytical and organic chemistry and biochemistry.  All of the students will be from institutions other than Miami University.  The core of the experience will be an independent research project and will begin with a presentation by each student of the plans for the summer's work developed through consultation with a faculty member.  Stress will be placed on experimental design and inquiry-based thinking.  Close student-mentor interactions and weekly group and discussion meetings will guide student progress.  In addition to the 10-week research experience, programs in career counseling, ethics, a weekly research meeting, and oral and written communication will be offered.  Students will present their work in a research symposium.  Effort will be made to include students from groups that are underrepresented in chemistry.  \r\n\r\n",
