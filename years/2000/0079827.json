The equipment to be acquired includes (1) a multianvil apparatus, (2) a rotational Drickamer apparatus and (3) modifications to our existing Paterson apparatus including a pore fluid module, a torsion module and a physical properties module. The new facility will enable experiments over a greatly expanded array of temperatures, pressures, deformation conditions, and fluid pressures for research on dynamic processes in the upper mantle, lower mantle and core.  A central theme of the research will be determining materials properties related to the dynamics and evolution of the Earth.  Key research areas will include (1) rheological properties under deep Earth conditions, including the study of plastic deformation and deformation-fabrics.  These parameters are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the interior of the Earth, and experimental investigations require a multianvil apparatus for reproducing deep Earth conditions.  (2) Microstructural evolution during deformation, which is critical for the interpretation of seismic anisotropy, requires a deformation apparatus that can create a range of deformation geometries including torsion.  (3) Transport of fluids including melt, molten iron and water, which must be investigated to understand the chemical evolution of the Earth, require an apparatus with controlled pore pressure.  (4) Phase equilibria properties of mineral-silicate liquid equilibria are needed for the understanding partial melting in deep portions of magma source regions and for calibrating high pressure thermodynamic models of magmatic processes.   Another component of activities in the facility will be collaborations with Materials Scientists from within the university and from industry for investigations of synthesis and properties of technological materials.  Finally, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained using these state-of-the art experimental techniques and the new facilities will also allow expanded education and outreach activities including undergraduate research experiences, workshop courses on experimental methods, and the development of CD-ROM modules distributed nationally with undergraduate textbooks and modules for teaching petrology using thermodynamic models of magmatic processes refined from projected experiments.\r\n***\r\n",
