 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a standard grant to support two years of research at the Integrated Media Systems Center, and Engineering Research Center, at the University of Southern California for use of immersive audio and video for education of both engineers and students in cinema.  The goal is to create a paradigm for immersive technology-enabled engineering education that shifts the emphasis form passive lectures to student-centered learning through cross-disciplinary peer interaction.  The research team has expertise in immersive audio signal processing, psychoacoustics, high-bandwidth networks, systems integration, human-computer interaction, and learning and cognitive science.  The collaborative team includes Integrated Media Systems Center, University of Southern California School of Cinema and Television, and the SRI Center for Technology.  The program focuses on learning research and the ways that innovative uses of technologies can help address issues and teaching.",
