 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from Immersion Corporation takes advantage of an opportunity to turn an emerging mainstream computer technology into a universal accessibility tool.  During Phase I, researchers at Immersion Corporation and at Oregon State developed enabling software technologies for Web-based force feedback and put them to use by designing a physics computer laboratory module.  The module allowed students to actually FEEL forces while holding a simulated charged particle in an electric field, take data points, and then feel a plotted curve using prototypes of a force feedback mouse.  Such mice have received excellent reviews from mainstream users who enjoy the ease-of-use and excitement of feeling GUI objects and computer feel effects and have met with enthusiasm from blind users, who require the best touch interfaces at the lowest cost.  Phase II will expand the enabling technology, curriculum, and evaluation work begun in Phase I, and it will add interaction with accessibility software developers.  Enormous potential exists for accessibility research to push the cutting edge of force feedback technology and for accessibility applications to take advantage of mass market economies of scale, creating a true universal accessibility success story.\r\n\r\nOver 110 million computer mice are sold each year.   Web-based applications will substantially drive the adoption of force-feedback mice.  The proposed Internet force feedback innovations will accelerate market penetration.  Development of educational applications will boost the market for accessible science education.  The technology could also give a competitive advantage to screen reader companies.\r\n",
