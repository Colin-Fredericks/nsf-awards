They will accomplish this by sending reporters from their award-winning daily radio show Science Update to 14 of the 23 NSF STCs, plus selected Collaboratives to Integrate Research and Education (CIRE) sites. Over a period of 16 months, Science Update will produce and broadcast 48 radio features, heard by a weekly audience of over two million, as well as 24 short classroom lessons disseminated via AAAS's award-winning Science NetLinks web site for science teachers. NSF will also have access to stories and interview transcripts for other educational purposes.",
