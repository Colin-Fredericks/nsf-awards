 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to complete an empirical assessment of the specific effect of Statewide, Urban, and Rural Systemic Initiative Programs on improving the pedagogical practices and student achievement in science and mathematics  Using the six reform drivers as a guide, a study has been designed to assess the types of data produced and reported by SI programs, methodological procedures to assess the procedural (process drivers) and empirical (outcome drivers) effects of these programs, to identify innovative techniques and approaches to enhance the analysis of SI data, and improve methods for dissemination and use of results on the impact of SI programs.\r\n\r\nFour objectives have been identified to ensure the purpose of the proposed study are met. The first\r\nobjective of this study will be to investigate and collect all available data on SI programs.  The second objective is to standardize a mechanism for interpreting data reported from the SI programs.  The third objective is to model additional strategies for conducting educational research on SI programs using data from Arkansas and three school districts within Arkansas. The final objective is to develop a practitioner's guide on measurement and statistics and will be designed to enhance the dissemination of results from SI programs and educational research. \r\n\r\nThe identified outcomes from this study include: (a) A NSF SI database that could be used by other\r\nresearchers interested in investigating the impact of SI programs, (b) An empirical assessment of specific effects from past and current SI programs, focusing on all six reform drivers to identify the most successful elements of each program, (c) A comprehensive review of current practices toward analyzing data and demonstrations of procedures that may enhance the interpretation of results and can be easily employed, and (d) A model that may be employed to enhance the quality of data developed or collected, the analyses that can be completed in future assessments to identify specific program or classroom effects using this data, and a practitioner's guide on measurement and statistics to improve dissemination of results obtained from SI or educational programs.",
