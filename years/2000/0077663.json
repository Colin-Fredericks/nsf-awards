The investigator and his colleagues have\r\ndeveloped a deterministic spatial model of Mountain Pine Beetle\r\n(MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) dispersal and mass-attack of pine\r\nhosts.  The model is validated and descriptive on spatial scales\r\nof hectares and time scales of days.  In this project they use\r\ntechniques of homogenization on the MPB/host system to construct\r\na forest scale (> 100 hectare/years) model reflecting the\r\nlarge-scale emergent consequences of current small-scale spatial\r\nand temporal models of insect development, dispersal, and\r\nresponse to climate.  Direct computation on such large scales\r\nwould be prohibitive; similar difficulties face most ecological\r\nsimulations involving spatio-temporal heterogeneity at realistic\r\nscales and life-system/dispersal interactions.  The investigators\r\ndevelop homogenization procedures that make this type of\r\necological simulation generally tractable, and implement and test\r\nthese procedures in the MPB/host system.  The homogenization\r\nprocedure generates an integro-difference equation (IDE),\r\noperating with year-long clock `ticks' on landscape scales.  In a\r\nvalidation phase, the IDE model is used to classify landscapes.\r\nStatistically analyzing misclassifications in comparison to\r\naerial imagery makes the simulation methodology self-correcting.\r\nFinally, scenario studies are used to examine consequences of\r\nhypothetical climate and management trajectories on host/insect\r\ndynamics.  This illustrates the power of homogenization\r\napproaches in an ecological context, and provides needed examples\r\nto make these techniques accessible to biological and\r\nenvironmental researchers.\r\n     The method of homogenization is a mathematical technique\r\nthat allows deduction of large-scale properties from\r\ndeterministic small-scale models.  To the best of our knowledge\r\nthe method of homogenization has never been applied to ecological\r\nproblems, where issues of scale are the focus of much debate.  One\r\npossible angle of attack is joint use of models and simulation,\r\nfollowed by validation with spatially explicit data.  Direct\r\ncomputational approaches to ecological problems with full\r\ndescription of spatial heterogeneity and climatic variation are\r\nextremely difficult due to interaction of scales in time and\r\nspace.  The difficulty is exacerbated on the one hand by the\r\npaucity of validated, deterministic spatial models at any\r\necological scale, and by the difficulty of extended spatial\r\nobservations on the other.  In this project the investigators and\r\nhis colleagues apply the technique of homogenization to the\r\nMountain Pine Beetle/Lodgepole Pine ecosystem to resolve the\r\nscale issue and simulate climate and human impacts on population\r\noutbreaks of insect species.\r\n\r\n",
