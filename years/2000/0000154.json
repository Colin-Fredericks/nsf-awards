 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis grant provides funding for the development of a numerical tool for determining optimal process parameters in bulk forming processes,\r\nsuch as rolling, extrusion, and forging. The developed numerical tool will determine the optimal process geometry; temperature and speed\r\nthat satisfy specified design criteria for a given two-dimensional forming process. An optimization algorithm based on an adaptive arbitrary\r\nLagrangian-Eulerian finite element formulation for modeling large deformation thermo-elasto-viscoplastic contact problems will be used.\r\nThe algorithm will be implemented in the context of an existing advanced computational framework that has tools for mesh generation,\r\nadaptivity, and parallel computing. Experiments involving the extrusion process will also be performed to validate the algorithms\r\ndeveloped. Experimental dies will be manufactured according to the optimal die shapes predicted in this work and tested at the predicted\r\noptimal die speeds. A model press, which can extrude plasticine material marked with a grid, will be used in these experiments to observe\r\nthe material flow behavior. \r\n \r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of bulk forming processes and new developments in\r\noptimization methods for handling complex nonlinear problems. The primary goal of this work is to determine optimal process geometry,\r\nthermal conditions, and process speed in bulk forming processes that will satisfy typically prescribed design criteria. These design criteria\r\nmay include generating a uniform flow of the material, generating a specified material property distribution in the formed product,\r\nminimizing the production time, or minimizing the energy required for the process. Determining the process parameters to achieve these\r\nobjectives will help to reduce the cost and improve the quality of the final product in processes such as extrusion and forging. The\r\nproposed work will also contribute to the computational tools and methodologies available for nonlinear optimization problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
