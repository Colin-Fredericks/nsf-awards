The\r\nanticipated outcome of NECC attendance is the formation of a network of\r\neducators in K-12 and higher education that would share ideas and knowledge\r\nregarding the use of learning technologies in their classrooms.  Through\r\ncoordinated, structured activities, this project will demonstrate increased\r\nminority participation in NECC, increased use of technologies in targeted\r\nK-16 schools, and increased benefits (e.g. panels, papers, programmatic\r\ninitiatives) from partnerships between K-12 schools and the selected higher\r\neducation institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
