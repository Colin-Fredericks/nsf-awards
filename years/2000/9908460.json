This cell has the ability to generate clean electrical energy and simultaneously convert a toxic gas into a useful raw material.  Many different electrolyte materials have been previously studied to determine suitable materials for use with hydrogen sulfide.  Proton-conducting electrolyte materials studied to date were all found to be unstable in the fuel cell, but success was found with oxy-anion conducting materials.  Yttria-stabilized zirconia and samaria-doped ceria have both been found to be good anion-conducting electrolytes in the presence of hydrogen sulfide.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to carry out a fundamental investigation of the electrode-eletrolyte interface in the hydrogen sulfide-fueled solid oxide fuel cell.  In doing so, the PI would like to significantly improve the performance of this device, so that it can become both a non-greenhouse gas power generation source, as well as a supply of a needed commodity chemical.  Improvements in electrode materials, cell design, and in the processing of the cell components are all goals of this project.  By using better electrode materials, the potential losses observed in the present apparatus will be lowered.  In addition, a more advanced cell design will eliminate air leakage, thus improving cell performance.  Lowering the potential losses with better materials and a more advanced cell design is expected.  Yttria-stabilized zirconia, samaria-doped ceria, and newly developed proton conductors will be studies as possible electrolyte materials.\r\n",
