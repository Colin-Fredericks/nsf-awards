 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (31), (59), (21) The university offers a variety of associate, baccalaureate, and masters degrees in computer science, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. These disciplines are housed in four independent departments, each having unique, well-defined, and academically challenging programs of study. The departments are: Computer Science and Information Systems; Physics and Engineering Physics; Industrial and Engineering Technology; and Mathematics and Statistics. Each department is successful in producing well-educated graduates and placement trends are exceptional. However, each department desires to increase the number of incoming students into their programs, and to retain those students until they have earned their respective degrees. The vast majority of departmental and institutional scholarship monies are used as recruiting incentives and are earmarked for incoming freshmen in the baccalaureate programs. Scholarship support is lacking and desperately needed for students pursuing associate degrees, graduate degrees, and upper level students who are deserving but find themselves in financial hardship in finishing their programs of study. All the departments listed above report a high percentage of upper-level students who enroll in full-time study, yet work a significant number of hours at off-campus employment in order to pay for their education. This financial pressure leads to more time away from study, which often causes poor academic performance, subsequently leading to frustration, discouragement, and often the abandonment of the student's academic pursuits. \r\n\r\nThis project establishes a scholarship program for deserving students who have a demonstrated financial need. Using an innovative approach to publicizing the availability of these funds, faculty \"Road Scholar\" teams visit regional high schools and community colleges in order to increase the visibility of the university's technical degree programs. Thus the project addresses both the recruitment and the retention issues which are prominent in science, math, and engineering curricula. The economic conditions extant in the region make this program particularly beneficial to regional students. The resulting increases in the number of graduates with technical degrees promotes a well-educated, technically-prepared workforce which supports ongoing state efforts in economic development. \r\n",
