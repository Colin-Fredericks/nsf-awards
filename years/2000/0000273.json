 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe expanded Washington Baltimore Hampton Roads Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR-AMP) includes Howard University as the lead institution with Hampton University, Morgan State University, the University of the District of Columbia, Bowie State University, Norfolk State university and Virginia Sate University as partners.  For Phase II, the administration has been completely restructured to ensure the involvement at the highest academic levels at all of the partner institutions.  In addition, we intend to implement strategies that will emphasize retention, recruitment and tutoring throughout the undergraduate SEM programs rather than just at the initial year.\r\n\r\n\tThe goals and objectives established for the expanded WBHR-AMP in Phase II are:\r\n\r\nTo work closely with staff of existing programs such as EXCEL, HBCU initiatives, TRAGG, ONR, McNair Scholarship Program and institution-wide counseling and tutorial programs for freshmen/sophomore students in SEM areas to ensure that students are receiving good introductory course work and individualized counseling to successfully complete majors in SMET fields;\r\n\r\nTo provide junior/senior level students at all of the participating institutions an opportunity to integrate research into their SEM curriculum by providing academic credit for their underrate research and ensure that they have an opportunity to work in a research environment through a semester/summer exchange during the academic semester at a level one research university, in industry and/or at national or governmental laboratories;\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the transfer of SMET students from community colleges that have articulation agreements with institutions within the WBHR Alliance for summer/transfer enrichment programs, and ensure their successful completion of B.S. degrees in an SMET field;\r\n\r\nTo provide mentoring workshops to SEM faculty and introduce all members to new pedagogy for teaching and mentoring students in SEM field by working closely with existing program sand implementing new initiatives; and\r\n\r\nTo prepare prospective SEM graduates for graduate training in SEM fields by providing assistance and tutorials for Graduate Record Examinations, senior comprehensive examinations and seminars in research methodologies and instrumentation.\r\n\r\n\tThe expected impact on SEM students is to graduate approximately 1600 B.S. level students per year in the next five years; actively recruit and retain at least 200 community college transfer students in undergraduate degree programs in SEM fields; and enroll approximately 300 SEM students per year in doctoral degree programs in SEM fields.\r\n",
