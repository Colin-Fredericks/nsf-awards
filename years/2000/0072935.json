This phenomenon is at the heart of liquid crystal display devices.  The research objective of this grant is to explore the physical conditions necessary for a specific orientation of the adsorbed liquid crystal molecule.  Atomistic molecular dynamics simulation will be used to study the anchoring of a liquid crystal (initially nematogen 5 CB) at various polymer surfaces.  The outcome of these simulations will be compared with some analytical theories of the dynamics of tethered molecules.  In particular, the studies will try to answer: (1) What is the relative importance of the microscopic chain orientation of the polymer molecules in the substrate surface, in comparison to the macroscopic surface morphology? (2) What role do the thermal vibrations of the substrate play ion the anchoring? (3) What is the effect of the electric dipoles in determining the molecular orientation at the surface, and, finally (4) What role does the flexible part of the mesogen play in anchoring.\r\n%%%\r\nIn the liquid crystal display devices, an important physical phenomenon is anchoring.  This refers to the tendency of the liquid crystal molecule, while adsorbed on a surface, to select a specific orientation depending on its physical environment.  This grant supports research to study the factors which influence the selection of this orientation.  The work in carried out using molecular dynamics simulations using high-speed computers.\r\n*** \r\n",
