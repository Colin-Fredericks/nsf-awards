Regression testing is an expensive process performed on modified software to provide confidence that modifications have not impaired its quality.  To help with this process, previous research has considered various test-suite reuse techniques.  Despite progress with these techniques, they remain limited along several dimensions.  For example, they typically assume that test cases have equivalent costs, faults have equivalent severities, and fault likelihood is constant across portions of a program.  These assumptions are unrealistic in practice, and limit the applicability and effectiveness of techniques.  The proposed research will address these limitations.  The research will provide: (1) comprehensive regression testing cost models that capture the necessary factors; (2) regression testing techniques that account for these factors; (3) more precise understanding of the effects these factors have on regression testability, program and test design, and software engineering practice; and(4) guidelines that help software engineers select and create cost-effective regression testing tools and processes.  In addition to providing models, algorithms, and processes, the research includes a substantial empirical component, and will provide a publicly available base of empirical data about techniques and factors.  Together, these contributions will support more efficient and effective regression testing, and improve the quality of software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
