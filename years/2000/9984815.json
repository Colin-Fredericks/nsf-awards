 "awd_abstract_narration": "Farb will continue his joint work with L. Mosher on understanding the asymptotic geometry of groups. Every finitely-generated group can be viewed as a metric space in a way which is unique up to maps of bounded distortion.  It was recently discovered that many finitely-generated groups are actually determined uniquely by their asymptotic geometry.  Farb plans to continue his work on this\r\nphenomenon and how it relates to the Mostow Rigidity Theorem, Gromov's Polynomial Growth Theorem, and the theory of dynamical systems.  Farb will also develop and teach a geometry component in Chicago's SESAME program.  This program teaches mathematics and science to elementary\r\nteachers from the Chicago public school system, and provides them with curriculum tools they can take back to their schools for use in their classrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroups are the formal mathematical way to describe symmetry.  What symmetries can a space exhibit?  How do the symmetries of a space relate to its geometry, and to the way that geodesics (light-rays) travel in that space?  These are fundamental issues that occur throughout nature.  The mathematical underpinnings of the theory of symmetry are important not only in understanding known phenomena, but in discovering new ones.  One example is the recently discovered phenomenon that the coarse, large-scale geometric structure of a space can often determine the symmetries it can have.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
