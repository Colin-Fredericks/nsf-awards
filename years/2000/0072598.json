The three \r\nclasses are under three main headings: the \r\ngeneralized problem of Bolza, the continuous-time \r\noptimal control, and the discrete-time optimal \r\ncontrol.  The first class, the generalized problem of\r\nBolza, falls in the heart of nonsmooth analysis where \r\nthe regularity of the integrand is lacking but \r\ncompensated for by the relative regularity of its\r\nHamiltonian.  Despite the fact that under certain \r\nhypotheses the second class can be viewed as a \r\nsubclass of the first, it is quite beneficial to\r\nstudy this class directly on its own to obtain results \r\nthat take into account the special and rich structure \r\nof the problem.  This direction of research produces \r\nfor the optimal control problems, results that are, in\r\ngeneral, distinct from those obtained by applying the \r\nresults of the generalized problem of Bolza.  Furthermore, \r\nthese two sets of results hold for the optimal control \r\nsetting under  different sets of hypotheses.  The third \r\nclass of problems is important for numerically solving the\r\ncontinuous-time optimal control problem via discretization.\r\nFor the three classes, second-order necessary and \r\nsufficient conditions would be derived in terms of a \r\nquadratical functional, conjugate point theory, and  \r\na Riccati equation.  Furthermore, results on the stability \r\nand sensitivity of solutions to perturbations would be \r\ninvestigated.  The Hamilton-Jacobi theory would be \r\nemployed, as well as the latest techniques from \r\nvariational and nonsmooth analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptimization problems with dynamical structure have become \r\nprominent in a variety of disciplines as mathematical \r\nmodels of systems with time evolution. In particular, \r\noptimal control theory is a subject that was developed in \r\nthe 1950's mainly to deal with applications arising from \r\nseveral disciplines. This includes engineering, operations\r\nmanagement and economics. Most problem formulation were \r\ninitially derived from engineering considerations which \r\nlead to the presence of control and state constraints. This \r\nis the case  with the \"soft moon landing problem\" and \r\nthe \"rocket car problem\". Most recently, the formulation \r\nof the optimal control problem has been adapted to include \r\nconsiderations from other areas like management and \r\neconomics. This accounts for the increased interest in \r\noptimal control problems with constraints containing both \r\nthe state and the control variable. Therefore, providing \r\nnew tools and better techniques to tackle these problems \r\nand to help in computing their solutions would have an \r\nimportant impact on the applications emanating from \r\nthose disciplines. This is exactly the goal of the present \r\nproposal. In fact, the intent is to derive optimality \r\ncriteria for control problems with different types of \r\nconstraints. Furthermore, the stability of these criteria \r\nunder small perturbations is analysed. This latter is \r\ncrucial for applications, due to the error in measurements.                          \r\n\r\n",
