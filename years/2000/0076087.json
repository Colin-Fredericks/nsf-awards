 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for the 2000 Complex Fluids Gordon Conference to be held at Salve Regina College in Newport, RI. The conference will deal with structures in which external forces exert stress on a soft interface to create new structures. For example, sickle cells are red blood cells distorted by abnormal aggregation of proteins within the cells which in turn exert distorting forces on the cell membrane. The conference will address the ongoing need for cross-fertilization amongst soft matter physicists, biophysicists, chemists and chemical engineers. International participation will be encouraged. Particular efforts are being made to engage the mechanical engineering community in the discussion of force transduction in complex media. The award will provide specific support for junior participants, both domestic and foreign.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award will provide partial support for the 2000 Complex Fluids Gordon Conference to be held at Salve Regina College in Newport, RI.
