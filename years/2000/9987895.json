 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to take selected undergraduate students, who have had limited or no opportunities for research, and provide them with a significant research experience that will stimulate their interest in mathematical and computational sciences to the point that they will react positively to the possibility of attending graduate school for further education and research in mathematics realted areas.  The project is selected to illustrate methods of research that will take the students progressively from the definition of the problem, though the statement of objectives, literature search, and the actual research, to the point of writing up their results and conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn this project, students will be given an opportunity to do research in the area of numerical algorithms for problems arising from different areas in science and engineering.  In particular, students will be involved in the design, analysis, and implementation of parallel numerical algorithms for the solution of large sparse linear systems, eigenvalue, least squares, optimization problems.  This research will involve investigating the current literature in these areas as well as the parallel architecturs that can be utilized for this project.  In the instructional phase of the project, students will also learn mathematical concepts in numerical linear algebra, message-passing interface (MPI) and C/C++ programming language with appropriate language extensions to provide a means of implementing the parallel numerical algorithms on parallel processors.",
