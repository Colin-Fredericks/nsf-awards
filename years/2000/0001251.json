In addition, their physical properties (especially their sorption capacity and catalytic behavior) has lead to their extensive industrial and environmental use as sorbants.  The physiochemical transformation of palygorskite-sepiolite to smectite has been identified in samples from the Meigs-Attapulgas-Quincy district, an important source of these clays.  Because this transformation can considerably affect the use of the palygorskite-sepiolite as industrial sorbants, the proposed project investigates the palygorskite-sepiolite to smectite transformation and its influence on the type and distribution of reactive surface sites and changes in micro-fabrics.  The micro-fabric, morphology, and surface micro-topography of a natural palygorskite-sepiolite-smectite assemblage from the Meigs-Attapulgas-Quincy district will be studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the bulk structure of palygorskite-sepiolite will be studied using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and TEM data. Atomic models of the bulk and surface structures of palygorskite, sepiolite, and especially transitional forms will be developed from the TEM, X-ray, and AFM data. The purpose of this study is to obtain a step-by-step understanding of the transformation and to model the variation in sorption behavior.  The results are important for environmental (e.g., heavy-metal adsorption) and commercial applications (e.g., bleaching and clarifying agents of oils) as well as the potential ability to use altered lithofacies to indicate paleoenvironmental information.\r\n\r\n",
