 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a five-level hierarchical architecture for intelligent control of internal combustion (IC) engines. IC engine control problems are highly challenging due to nonlinear, time-varying and stochastic nature of the processes and widely varying operating conditions. Current IC engine control systems have evolved gradually from fully mechanical to computerized electronic systems, but a comprehensive unified control architecture is lacking. Basic\r\nobjectives of the system to be developed are emissions reduction, improvements in fuel efficiency, driveability, reliability and safety. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach based on both physical and Neural Network (NN) models will be employed. During Phase I, a complete five-level control architecture will be developed using the a state-of-the-art survey. The problem of air-fuel ratio control using predictive models and feedback from oxygen sensors will be solved using the MPC approach. University of California, Berkeley (Professor Karl Hedrick) will participate as a sub-contractor, and provide use of experimental facilities. General Motors Research and Development Center (Warren, MI) will provide evaluation and guidance for development and commercialization efforts.\r\n\r\nThe market for IC engine power includes the global automobile industry.  Significant improvements in emission control, fuel savings, driveability, and reliability are anticipated through use of this intelligent control approach.  Direct commercial benefits could be enormous, given the size and importance of the IC engine in the global transportation market.  Indirect benefits include improved air quality and conservation of resources used in the production and operation of IC-powered vehicles.",
