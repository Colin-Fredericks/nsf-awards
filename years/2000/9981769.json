 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to make quantitative connections between UHV surface studies and applied chemical catalysis.  Two related research projects are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the laboratory of Professor Weinberg at the University of California-Santa Barbara. Studies of the mechanism of energy transfer during chemisorption are pursued using Schottky barrier sensors.  Chemisorption of H, O, H2, O2,  CO and N2O on transition metal surfaces is examined.  The influence of condensed multilayers on surface reactions is also being considered.  In particular, possible enhanced reactivity of alkanes in the presence of condensed multilayers is examined on clean and potassium promoted single crystal surfaces of ruthenium, iridium, and platinum.  The results of this work will further our understanding of the detailed dynamics of heterogeneous catalysis. \r\n\r\nThe understanding of the catalysis of hydrocarbon and small molecule reactions on transition metal surfaces is the focus of this research project supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Weinberg and coworkers at UCSB are investigating the mechanisms of energy transfer in chemisorption and the effect of condensed multilayers on the reactivity of hydrocarbon molecules at well characterized catalytic surfaces.   The information from this research will be useful in designing improved systems for heterogeneous catalysis.",
