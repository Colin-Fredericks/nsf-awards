It is estimated that an average of more than 30,000 homes or dwelling units are destroyed or made uninhabitable each year as a result of extreme wind events.  Over the last twenty years, from hurricanes alone, the losses in the United States are $100 billion in 1999 dollars.\r\n\r\nA symposium will be held in Washington, DC, during the winter of 1999.   The purpose of the symposium is two-fold: 1) to identify scientific and technical programs as well as public policy issues from architects, engineers, building code officials, builders, lenders and others involved in the construction industry, as well as decision-makers, and 2) to take steps toward innovative system-oriented developments of research thrusts in technologies for immediate and long-term approach for mitigating the impact of windstorms.  The venue for the symposium is chosen to permit easy access by all stakeholders in the connection industry and decision-makers.  The symposium will be open to the public.\r\n\r\nThe format for the symposium will be four keynote speakers in the mornings and afternoons of the two days and six panel discussions.  This format is designed to solicit participation by all attendees of the symposium.  The symposium is sponsored by the American Association for Wind Engineering and co-sponsored by several organizations including the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), and others.\r\n\r\n",
