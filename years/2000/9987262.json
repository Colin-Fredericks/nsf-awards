 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (31), (59), (21) The university offers a NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) program as a collaborative effort between the College of Engineering and Computer Science, and the College of Science and Mathematics. The program is increasing the number of students who successfully graduate with higher education degrees in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics.  One of the primary problems affecting the retention and achievement of financially disadvantaged students is lack of financial resources. A lack of resources causes students to work excessive hours adversely affecting their study time, and contributes to a phenomenon of \"stopping out\" in which students leave campus for semesters at a time. The NSF CSEMS program is providing significant financial assistance to help address these problems. Coupled with comprehensive support services and monitoring by programs within the two Colleges, CSEMS fosters student success.  The principal goals of CSEMS are: 1) increasing the number of financially disadvantaged students, including under-represented minorities and women, who graduate in the fields of Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics; 2) enhancing the educational achievements and professional development of participating students. \r\n\r\nOver a two year period, 40 promising newly matriculated community college transfer students and/or continuing juniors each year who are majoring in Computer Sciences, Engineering, or Mathematics are selected. These students receive a full range of services throughout their academic career through a coordinated effort with existing support services provided by institutionally administered programs in each College--the Engineering & Computer Science Student Development and Equity Center (SDEC) and the Science and Math Advisement Center (SMAC). The CSEMS program in conjunction with SDEC and SMAC utilizes a variety of strategies and activities of proven effectiveness in the recruiting and retaining disadvantaged, underrepresented minority students and women.  CSEMS services include academic advisement, close monitoring of student progress, tutorial services, workshops, career advisement, graduate school information, mentoring, financial aid and scholarship assistance, recognition awards and linkage to appropriate student organizations. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of CSEMS are: \r\n*to retain CSEMS students in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at a rate that is 20% greater than a comparable community college transfer cohort. \r\n*to retain CSEMS continuing students at a rate that is 20% greater than a comparable cohort of students. \r\n*after two years of participation, the GPA of CSEMS students will be 0.5 higher than those of a comparable student cohort. \r\n*to facilitate the personal and professional development of CSEMS participants by establishing partnerships with industry, co-op programs, and the Career Center. \r\n* to realize placement of students in scientific/technical careers or graduate school at a rate of 90%. \r\n",
