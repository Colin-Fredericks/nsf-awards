The goal of the collaboration is to obtain quantitative biochemical information on myosins purified from plants, specifically soy beans, to increase our understanding of these critical cellular proteins.\r\n\r\nThe movement of cytoplasmic components plays a significant role in the physiology of both plant and animal cells.  This movement is likely to be mediated in all cells by cellular proteins, myosins, which are the only known action-based motors.  While at least 13 different family members of myosins have been identified in animal cells, there is only minimal information about myosins in plants.  This collaboration will bring together an expert in plant biology from Mexico, who has been successful in obtaining plant myosins, with the U.S. scientist who is an expert in the study of these important proteins.\r\n***\r\n",
