The center continues to offer a regular schedule of workshops for teams from schools and school districts interested in upgrading their mathematics program.  The center also continues to support and disseminate the materials already developed and to develop additional materials that support the implementation of the supported instructional materials.  The purpose of the seminars and the workshops is to assist schools and school districts in becoming familiar with the 13 sets of comprehensive instructional materials in mathematics developed with NSF support and to understand the issues related to the implementation of these materials.   Specifically, the goals of the center are to:\r\n\r\nIncrease awareness of NSF-funded comprehensive instructional materials among school districts interested in improving their mathematics program.\r\n\r\nIncrease understanding of the challenges involved in the selection and implementation of mathematics curricula developed in response to the NCTM Standards.\r\n\r\nProvide assistance to schools and districts reviewing and using standards-based curricula, paying special attention to issues of transition and articulation across grades K-12.\r\n\r\nProvide needed resources for school systems, including a seminar series and related publications focused on standards-based curriculum selection and implementation.\r\n\r\nBuild capacity within districts for making informed choices and decisions regarding selection and use of standards-based mathematics materials.\r\n\r\n",
