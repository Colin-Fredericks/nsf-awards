 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, sponsored by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, develops materials and methods for chemically selective extraction without the need for volatile solvents.  The research, conducted by Dr.Stephen G. Weber and his students at the University of Pittsburgh, develops novel fluorous membranes and films on which a fluoropolymer supports a fluorous nonvolatile solvent. Membranes are prepared from Teflon (TM) AF2400, and five plasticizers to form the supported fluorous phases. These supported phases are doped with molecular recognition receptors that allow the fluorous phases to be highly selective for extraction of  various target species. Partitioning experiments and infrared spectroscopic measurements are used to quantitate the influence of a particular functional group on partitioning into the fluorous phase.  The results of these experiments are used to guide the design of artificial receptors and to develop libraries of receptors.  \r\n\r\nThe results from this project could have far ranging effects when fully utilized. Potential applications include improved chemical analysis for pharmaceuticals, reduced energy comsumption in some industries, and a reduction in waste from sample processing in analytical laboratories.",
