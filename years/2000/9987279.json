 "awd_abstract_narration": "College of the Canyons, the second fastest growing community college in the State of California, is awarding Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEMS) scholarships to low income, academically talented students majoring in computer science, computer technology, mathematics, engineering, and engineering technology. The one and two year scholarships are providing an opportunity for College of the Canyons (COC) to financially support students while providing them with a quality education. Fifteen $750 scholarships are being awarded annually through a competitive selection process. \r\n\r\nAs the sole community college serving the fast-growing Santa Clarita Valley, COC is reaching out to individuals interested in obtaining a college education. Scholarships are essential for low-income families who simply cannot afford to send their children to college. A $750 scholarship is covering the cost of tuition, assessed fees, and some books for an entire year, and is providing an opportunity for a low income student to complete the first two years of undergraduate education at nearly no cost. \r\n\r\nAwarding scholarships is assisting the College in fulfilling its mission of providing programs and services to those who can benefit from quality and accessible learning opportunities. Through the NSF Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarships program, the College plans to increase the number of low-income students enrolled in math and science programs, retain these students, and successfully transfer them to four year institutions or into the job market. COC ranks 19th in full time transfers to the University of California and California State University systems. \r\n\r\nThe College is providing various resources and services to NSF scholarship recipients, including tutoring, mentoring, career services, counseling, and internship experience. NSF Scholarships will provide the financial aid many disadvantaged students need to pursue their education. \r\n",
