 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is on the synthetic use of oligopeptides assembled on the surface of glass particles through a spacer that can be cleaved by light.  The resulting polyamides will be modified by the introduction of functionality into the polymer, N-terminus modification with a group that projects back towards the origin of the peptide and incorporation of amino acids predisposed towards specialized reactivity.Further alterations brought about by the use of radical chain transfer chemistry and soluble transition-metal catalyzed carbon-heteroatom bond formation will lead to compounds with potentially interesting biological properties.  Release of the compounds into aqueous medium can be accomplished with light.  A new graduate curriculum providing a strong foundation of organic chemistry and involving a balance of interdisciplinary and specialized courses will be developed. \r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Patrick G. Harran of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Texas Southwest Texas Medical Center.  Professor Harran will focus his research on the  development of methods for the synthesis of complex, natural product-like materials beginning with arrays of linear peptides.  The project affords a novel approach for the production of pharmacophores.  Dr. Harran will focus his educational efforts on developing a new graduate curriculum for students working at the interface of modern biology and chemistry.",
