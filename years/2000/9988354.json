 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frankl, Phyllis G.\r\nPolytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY\r\n\r\nTechniques for Testing Database Applications\r\n\r\nDatabases play in important role in almost every modern\r\norganization.  Although considerable research effort has been devoted\r\nto assuring correctness and efficiency of database management\r\nsystems, little attention has been paid to assuring the correctness\r\nof the application programs that run on these systems.  Failure of\r\ndatabase application programs can have severe economic impact, so\r\ndevelopment of techniques for testing them is of obvious importance.\r\nThis research project involves development of software testing\r\ntechniques targeted specifically to database application programs. It\r\nincludes development of techniques for generating database states\r\nthat are useful for testing the given application and techniques for\r\nchecking the database state after running a test. The techniques\r\nstudied are partially automated, relying on the user to supply some\r\ninformation and deriving other information automatically. They use\r\nthe integrity constraints described in the database schema as a\r\nsource of information to aid in test generation and checking. A\r\nprototype testing tool is being developed.  Preliminary evaluations\r\nof the effectiveness and usability of the techniques will be\r\nperformed with the aid of the tool prototype.\r\n",
