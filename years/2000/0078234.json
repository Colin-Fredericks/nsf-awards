 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from 3DGeo Development Incorporated will develop a software package which utilizes primary and converted-wave energy to accurately and efficiently image gas and oil reservoirs, and to determine rock properties for reservoir evaluation and management.  In the recently completed Phase I project, 3DGeo demonstrated the feasibility of imaging with converted waves by analyzing the nature and occurrence of converted waves in synthetic seismic data.  Full wavefield modeling and ray tracing in realistic models was used to simulate both towed-cable and ocean-bottom-cable marine data.  Both acquisition geometries show important converted-wave events that will be used in Phase II to accurately image reservoirs and estimate rock properties.  In addition to the mode converted energy, this project will incorporate two other significant propagation phenomena that commonly occur in geological settings which give rise to converted waves, namely: (1) multiply reflected events [multiples], and (2) transmitted and reflected energy propagating along multiple paths in the subsurface [multi-valued traveltimes].  These two phenomena, coupled with the mode conversions, which are the main focus of this research effort, comprise the greatest challenge to seismic prospecting for oil and gas. This Phase II project develops a comprehensive and synergistic subsalt imaging solution that exploits the full potential of the seismic wavefield for reservoir imaging and rock property estimation in complex areas.\r\n\r\nCommercial potential of the proposed technology is directly applicable to subsalt oil and gas exploration in complex areas such as the Gulf of Mexico.  US companies will spend $50 billion drilling deep subsalt prospects over the next 5 years, and this project could have a direct and significant impact by developing an accurate and economical reservoir monitoring and imaging technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
