 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of Internet, it is now anticipated that wireless data services will within a few years surpass the demand for voice services.  The explosive demand for wireless data services is forcing the telecom and networking research communities to rethink some of the well-known solutions to the limited capacity problem which is fundamental in such networks.\r\n     In this proposal, a new concept for solving the limited capacity problem in current wireless systems is formulated, and a cost-effective approach to implement the concept is described.  The researchers main concept is to circumvent congestions in cellular networks by \"hopping\" to frequencies in the unlicensed band, such as the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical Band (ISM) band (2.4 - 2.5 GHZ) and by diverting traffic to noncongested areas.  The researchers propose to integrate cellular and mobile relaying technologies by deploying new devices called mobile relaying stations (MRS's).  With MRS's, a mobile host can communicate with the base transceiver stations (BTS's) located in a different cell by switching (or \"hopping\") to the unlicensed frequency band.  In this way, a mobile host moving into a congested cell can continue its call that would otherwise be dropped; likewise, a new call that would normally be blocked in a congested cell could be served by borrowing channels from a nearby cell via relaying.  As a result, handoff-dropping probability and new call blocking probability of existing cellular systems can be substantially improved.  This, in turn, leads to an unprecedented increase in the number of users (i.e., capacity) of these systems if one utilizes the proposed new concept in conjunction with cell splitting.  While the hardware complexity of the proposed next-generation wireless systems will be slightly higher than that of the conventional systems, the anticipated benefits in terms of improved network performance, capacity, and connectivity at all times will far outweigh this slight increase in hardware complexity.\r\n     The success of this project could lead to a major paradigm shift in the next-generation wireless network standards.  It is also anticipated that this project will enhance the telecommunications and networking education and research programs at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and could pave the way for a Center for Advanced Telecommunications and Networking that houses faculty and graduate students from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, as well as other departments.\r\n",
