 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program enables low income, scholastically well-suited students to pursue undergraduate degrees in computer science, engineering or mathematics. It also serves to establish support systems that will maximize the students' ability to achieve and maintain a 2.5- 3.0 minimum grade point average during their undergraduate years. In addition, this program provides a mechanism that involves the students with the concepts of cooperative work education and research experiences for undergraduates. This results in increased numbers of engineering and science students who will consider science, engineering or technology as potential professional career choices and motivates them to pursue advanced study and research, leadership and academic careers in engineering, science, or technology-related pedagogy. There also exists an opportunity for students to participate in an \"incentive\" program that offers them a semester at a partnering Diversity in Engineering (DEP)/Heartland's Alliance for Minority Participation (HAMP) institution through the National Student Exchange (NSE). \r\n\r\nThe principal goal of this program is to increase the pool of highly qualified engineering and science students from economically disadvantaged (underserved) and underrepresented group backgrounds. Then to address the growing, critical national concern for the quality of engineering and computer science education and the demand for a diversified workforce in the fields of computer science, engineering and mathematics. Moreover, the program will help ensure an adequate, well-prepared workforce of scientists and engineers that can maintain U.S. leadership in science and technology, both now and in the future. In addition, the project will help all students to acquire the mathematics and science skills needed to thrive in an increasingly technological society. The University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) is in an ideal and unique position to increase significantly the utilization of an untapped source of American talent, that being the economically disadvantaged and historically underrepresented student. \r\n\r\nThis opportunity allows MU to build a more dynamic relationship with two-and four- year colleges. Additionally, it helps to ensure the successful transition of transfer students from underserved and underrepresented groups into the engineering computer science and mathematics undergraduate programs at MU. This pool of students has been under-recruited in the past and need to be in the current and future SEM pipeline. This recruitment effort will be enhanced through coordination with the Heartland Alliance for Minority Participation transfer scholarships programs. \r\n",
