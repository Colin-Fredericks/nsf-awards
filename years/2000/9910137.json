The project, supported under a joint program of the National Science Foundation and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), will facilitate collaboration on the application of photon echoes to wide band signal processing.  The investigators will explore optical architectures that utilize temporal processing capabilities of photon-echoes in combination with the spatial transformations produced by spatial-spectral holograms. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in optical architectures and systems.  This is complemented by the French investigator's research in device physics.  The researchers have developed this combined approach of photon-echo holograms with spatial holography.  The project will advance understanding of this approach and its potential to provide wider bandwidth, larger capacity, and higher resolution solutions to real-time signal processing.  The award will support the incremental costs of the international collaboration; that is, the travel to Paris, France and subsistence expenses of the U.S. investigators.  The CNRS will support visits to the U.S. by the French investigators.\r\n",
