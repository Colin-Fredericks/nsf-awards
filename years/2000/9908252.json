 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to develop competent and efficient genetic algorithms--search or optimization procedures based on the mechanics of natural selection and genetics.  In this context, the word \"competent\" is used to denote algorithms that solve a large class of hard problems, quickly, reliably, and accurately.  The word \"efficient\" is used to denote a variety of means by which such competent algorithms may be further speeded.  To achieve these goals, this project will:   (1) advance the state of building-block theory, (2) develop new methods of mixing and probabilistic model building, and (3) advance the state of generic algorithms efficiency theory and practice in the areas of parallelization, time utilization, evaluation relaxation, and algorithm hybridization.\r\n\r\n      If successful, the results of this project will immediately lead to more cost-effective genetic and evolutionary algorithms.  The current generation of techniques is increasingly being used across the\r\nspectrum of human endeavor in diverse areas such as electronic design and testing, manufacturing scheduling and facility layout, structural optimization and design, aircraft/spacecraft design and manufacture, drug and biomolecular design, and even in such disparate areas as the composition of music and poetry.  Despite this broad usage, the current generation of techniques has been shown to be limited in the range of problems that can be successfully tackled.  The next generation of techniques delivered by this research promises to vastly reduce the amount of computation required to reach a given quality of solution, and this computational leverage will greatly increase the incentive for using these techniques in the above-named and many other fields of inquiry.  As a result, this technology could become a critical component in the development of many other fields.  Moreover, the techniques being investigated have been likened to the processes of human innovation and creativity, and this research may also shed scientific light on these important mechanisms.\r\n",
