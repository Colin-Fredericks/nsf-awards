 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Drs. Tom Livinghouse, Paul A. Grieco and other members of the Chemistry  Department at Montana State University in establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002 30 undergraduate students will spend 10 weeks each conducting summer research in organic synthesis, bioinorganic, natural product and structural chemistry. In addition to work on individual research problems participants will hear weekly seminars by the faculty and attend a series of talks by industrial chemists from pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms. There will be short courses in applied nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. At the conclusion of the summer program there will be two half day symposia at which participants will present posters of their results. Students will participate as a member of a team composed of the faculty mentor, a graduate student and the REU participant. Participants will be encouraged to present their work at meetings of professional societies. Coordinators have been identified at two year Tribal Colleges in Montana and they will assist in recruiting Native American students for the program.",
