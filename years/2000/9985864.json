 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project entitled \"Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry of Polymers\" will be carried out by Dr. David Hercules of Vanderbilt University and is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  The project is  a GOALI collaboration with Dr. James Edman of Dupont as a co-PI.  The research focuses on complex copolymer systems.  There are three specific goals to the research: (1) to improve the technique of limited chemical reaction.  The goal of limited chemical reaction is to partially break the polymer chain by chemically degrading the polymer in a controlled fashion.   The products obtained will be used for structural characterization of the polymer. (2) This research will study the surface segregation which occurs in block co-polymers using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).  (3) The research will utilize limited chemical reaction and the mass spectrometric techniques of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), SIMS and electrospray for the characterization of polyimide polymers which are an insoluble and complex polymer system.\r\n\r\nThis work is of fundamental importance both to analytical and polymer chemistry.  The polyimide class selected is a particularly difficult polymer system because it is both complex and insoluble.  The scope of the project is large and  there is considerable risk associated with the work. The success of this research will provide a template for the analysis of broader classes of polymers.  It will provide important information on branching and structure of polymers.\r\n\r\n",
