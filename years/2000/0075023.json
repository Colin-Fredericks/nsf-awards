 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development of the vertebrate neural retina, multiple neuronal cell\r\ntypes are born and differentiate under the control of a complex set of\r\nfactors that are poorly understood. To gain a complete understanding of the\r\nmolecular mechanisms regulating retinal neurogenesis, it is essential to\r\ndefine the hierarchy of genes involved in this process. The goal of this\r\nproject is to use recently developed transgenic methods in the model\r\norganism Xenopus laevis to define which factors control expression of the\r\ntranscription factor Xath5, a key regulator of retinal neurogenesis. The\r\nXenopus transgenic method provides a unique opportunity to rapidly and\r\ninexpensively map the regulatory control regions of developmentally\r\nimportant genes, thus making it possible to define how genes come to be\r\nexpressed in precise spatial and temporal patterns during development.\r\n\r\nThese experiments will provide a more complete understanding of the steps\r\nleading to normal retinal development. In addition, this work will advance\r\nour understanding of nervous system development in general, since the\r\nretina has proven to be a reliable model tissue for studying nervous system\r\ndevelopment and function. Finally, the development and application of the\r\nnew transgenic method in Xenopus laevis will open up many possibilities for\r\nfuture investigation and discovery in the field of developmental biology.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that this POWRE award will allow the principal investigator to \r\ntravel to learn a novel Xenopus transgenic method and to then establish it in her \r\nlaboratory.\r\n",
