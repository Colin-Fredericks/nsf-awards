 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF/DOE collaborative research project between researchers at Michigan State University and Northeastern University will investigate and establish the scientific basis and engineering principles for the design and operation of small microwave plasma sources with discharge dimensions ranging from 0.3-10 mm. Small microwave discharges operate with low input power, while having very high power densities and highly reactive species outputs.  The availability of physically compact microwave power sources built for mobile communication systems combined with small microwave plasma sources opens the possibility of many unique microwave plasma applications.  The research project will experimentally evaluate and theoretically model the behavior of very small microwave discharges, i.e. millimeter and submillimeter size discharges.  Two microwave plasma systems will be used including a highly flexible and adjustable testbed plasma source and a micromachined, microstrip line-based plasma source.  The research methodology is to study, using experimental diagnostics and electromagnetic/plasma simulation models, discharges with diameters ranging from 10 mm to 0.3 mm in the testbed plasma source.  Then, this testbed source knowledge will be used to design, build and test micromachined, microstrip line based plasma sources. \r\n\r\nSome of the possible applications include plasma sources for MEMS-scale chemical analysis, micro-thrusters for spacecraft, miniature electrodeless light sources, and miniature sources for spatially focused, plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. This project will demonstrate two applications including diamond deposition on small substrate areas and micro-plasmas for portable, low temperature sterilization.",
