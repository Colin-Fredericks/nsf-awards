 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this program is scholarship support for low-income students to enable them to pursue baccalaureate and graduate degrees in computer science, engineering, and mathematics majors. The program components -- recruitment, selection, mentoring, and professional development of the scholarship recipients -- build on the existing infrastructure for student support and industry support within the College of Engineering, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the University, as well as existing articulation agreements with local community colleges. \r\n\r\nThere is a growing industry base in the region, and graduates in computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) are highly recruited for their excellent preparation and strong work ethic. Many students are financially disadvantaged, and two thirds of all students receive some form of financial aid.\r\n\r\nRecruitment will focus on existing students, transfer students from community colleges that serve the region, and prospective graduate students at universities that have a significant enrollment of members of groups underrepresented in SMET. A web page with application materials and program information will be developed. Brochures and posters will also be utilized to recruit applicants. In addition, a Community College CSEM Day will be held for key community college faculty in mathematics and the sciences to communicate the need for and opportunities available to CSEM graduates. This approach will strengthen partnerships with community colleges. \r\n\r\nThe selection criteria and process for awarding CSEM scholarships have been designed to encourage applications from students from diverse backgrounds and with diverse career goals. The selection process will ensure that scholarship recipients are academically talented, demonstrate financial need, and meet the citizenship and full-time enrollment requirements. Criteria to be used for evaluating qualified applicants include grade point average, an essay, work history, leadership activities, and references. The CSEM Scholarship Selection Committee will consist of CSEM faculty and/or industry representatives. \r\n\r\nA Student-Support Program will be provided to CSEM scholarship recipients. The Program is designed to encourage retention and career awareness and will include faculty, student, and external (employment-sector) mentors. After an orientation, the mentors will work to provide on-campus assistance, academic and career information, and career-related opportunities for the scholarship recipients. Web-based communications will be utilized for all participants. Monthly meetings or activities will be scheduled for the scholarship recipients. Participation in an annual leadership seminar will be encouraged. A feedback system has been designed to identify problems as they occur. \r\n\r\nProgram evaluation will be conducted with the help of evaluation specialists in the College of Education. A series of surveys will be utilized to gather quantitative and qualitative information. Dissemination will be both internal and external through presentations at conferences related to CSEM education. \r\n\r\nThis program addresses the integration of research and education. Some of the scholarship recipients will have the opportunity to participate on research projects with their faculty mentors. The goal of broadening the representation of underrepresented groups is also addressed through recruiting efforts targeted at universities that have a large number of students in these groups. The Program outcomes are expected to be improved educational experiences, increased retention to degree, improved career awareness and choices, and strengthened partnerships with CSEM employment sectors and community colleges.\r\n",
