 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal award to a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will fund studies of the physics of vortex motion and novel nonlinear dynamical states in the classical and quantum regimes using discrete arrays of superconducting Josephson junctions. The study of classical nonlinear modes such as discrete\r\nbreathers and ratchets will lead to a better understanding of both vortex motion in superconductors as well as novel types of nonlinear states in condensed matter systems which are defined on a lattice.  As the junctions in the array are made smaller, the superconducting circuit becomes quantum mechanical and will be studied as new types of electronic applications (such as single electronics) and for circuits to perform quantum computation. The students will be able to combine a range of educational experiences covering experimental physics, nonlinear dynamics, and quantum coherence.  They will also gain experience in interdisciplinary training and international collaborations.\r\n%%%\r\nAs the superconducting devices are miniaturized at the limits of today's technology, the circuit becomes quantum mechanical. This renewal award to a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will fund studies of these devices for new types of electronic applications and for use in circuits to perform a novel type of computation, known as quantum computation.  This project will also study how the current and voltage can be organized into spatial and temporal patterns known as dynamical states, and how these dynamical states are effected by the quantum nature of the circuit.  The students will gain experience in interdisciplinary training and international collaborations, which will prepare them well for today's increasingly global and interdisciplinary approach to research and development in science and engineering.\r\n***\r\n",
