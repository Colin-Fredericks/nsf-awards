 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charts, diagrams, graphs and other types of graphically displayed information are currently not usable by people with severe print disabilities without assistance.  This project is developing and testing methods for enhancing bit-map web graphics so they can be universally accessible.  Images are enhanced by including a data structure that indicates each important object and provides a label and/or other information about these objects.  People with print impairments can access the information and \"read\" the picture through a choice of any combination of visual, auditory, tactile, and/or haptic modes.  These methods should be relatively inexpensive for both authors and users with print impairments.  they could become widely useful by the end of the project period.\r\n     The activities are being done in two phases:  (1) Web page design and tactile picture production; and (2) Haptic access development and audio/haptic display of web x-y graphs.  Evaluation will occur in three distinct phases relative to production.  Data will be collected in a variety of ways (i.e., questionnaires, checklists and interviews) from the beta testers.  Beta test subjects will be volunteers who respond to e-mail list invitations or who are recruited by university officials from the Student Disability Support Office.\r\n     This project should provide universities and federal agencies with an inexpensive, high-quality method for making web graphical information accessible to people with disabilities.  This research will not result in all graphical information being automatically accessible, since deliberate human input is required to add the annotations that enhance the figures.  The project staff plans to produce software for authoring and/or editing annotations for web graphics and will sell it at a cost sufficient to provide support.\r\n     The staff plan to disseminate their research progress by giving talks at major meetings including the CSUN (California State University at Northridge) International Conference on Technology and Persons with Disabilities, and will seek invitations to present the information at major conferences that have a focus in disabilities-related areas.\r\n",
