 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Birmingham Public School District has established a strong infrastructure in support of its thrust to improve the science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) education for all of its K-12 students.  The goals and objectives of the Birmingham Urban Systemic Program (BUSP) are to enhance the system's capacity to provide a rich and challenging curriculum in that regard.  To accomplish these goals and objectives, the District intends to incorporate the activities proposed in the USP into those that are outlined in its new Strategic Plan.  This design strategy will provide further assurance that the state's higher requirements for science and mathematics will come to fruition.   \r\n\r\nEfforts will be purposefully focused at the classroom level as prescribed by the Alabama State Course of Study.  A plan is operable in the District to acquire standards-based instructional materials for all grades.  Extensive professional development will be provided for all teachers and all schools via embedded-day activities.  Special sessions, task-specific workshops, and academic-year and summer institutes will be offered through the new McWane Professional Development Center.  Longstanding partnerships with local colleges and universities will assist the District in delivering SMT content as prescribed in the Alabama State Course of Study.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
