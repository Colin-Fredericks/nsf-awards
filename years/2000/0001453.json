 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Tom Plummer and colleagues \r\nwill conduct two field seasons of excavation at Kanjera South, southwestern \r\nKenya.  The team brings together specialists in archaeology, paleontology, \r\npaleoecology and geology to conduct an interdisciplinary investigation of \r\nthe behavior and paleoecology of hominids forming early archeological \r\n(Oldowan) sites.  The appearance of Oldowan archeological sites at c. 2.5 \r\nmillion years ago (Ma) reflects a profound adaptive shift in human \r\nevolution, the incorporation of large mammal tissue into the diet.  The \r\nproposed project will be the first to carry out a detailed study of site \r\nformation processes at Oldowan sites older than 2.0 Ma, using a wide range \r\nof traditional and innovative methodologies.\r\nExcavations in 1996 and 1997 located rich concentrations of artifacts and \r\nfossils in c. 2.2 Ma deposits in the Southern Exposures at Kanjera.  Over \r\n1,000 stone tools and thousands of fossils were collected in carefully \r\ncontrolled taphonomic excavations.  Documentation of relatively high \r\narcheological densities in three beds at two of five sites along a 70m \r\ntransect suggests that hominid activity was spatially focused for a \r\nconsiderable length of time.  Preliminary lab analysis has identified \r\nhominid marrow processing and carnivore damage to bone, as well as several \r\nartifact refits.  Stable isotopic chemistry of paleosol carbonates and high \r\nequid frequencies indicate Oldowan hominid activities in a novel (open) \r\npaleohabitat.  A high proportion of small, immature mammals is suggestive of \r\nsmall mammal hunting while medium to very large mammal remains (including a \r\npotentially butchered hippopotamus) may have been scavenged.  Hominid \r\ntransport of artifacts and raw material selectivity is suggested by lithic \r\nanalysis.\r\nExpanding the samples of excavated material will allow reconstruction of \r\nhominid activities within their paleoecological context at Kanjera and \r\nfacilitate meaningful comparisons with other large Oldowan site assemblages, \r\nparticularly those from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania and the Lake Turkana basin, \r\nKenya and Ethiopia.  Faunal analysis will provide information on hominid \r\nprocurement and processing of animals as well as the role of carnivore \r\nactivity in assemblage formation.  Lithic analysis will document local \r\ntechnological characteristics and hominid transport behavior as well as the \r\ntasks chert artifacts were used for.  Paleoenvironmental information will be \r\nobtained using multiple methodologies.  Limb element ecomorphic analyses and \r\nisotopic analysis of carbonates will provide information on habitat \r\nstructure.  Ecomorphic analysis of mandibles and analysis of carbon isotopes \r\nfrom enamel will provide paleodietary information.  Oxygen isotopes in tooth \r\nenamel will constrain paleotemperatures and the degree of seasonality during \r\nKanjera Fm (S) deposition.  Cementum analysis will be used to assess \r\nantelope season of death.\r\nDocumentation of hominid utilization of open habitats at Kanjera may \r\ninfluence views of early hominid capabilities, including their ability to \r\ncompete with large carnivores.  This project should also contribute to the \r\non-going debate over faunal acquisition strategies, by providing a test of \r\nwhether small mammals were hunted.  As the sample of medium and larger sized \r\nmammals increases, it may be possible to assess the timing of access to \r\nlarger carcasses and thus whether hominids were passively or actively \r\nscavenging them.  Our attempts to measure the intensity of seasonality \r\nthrough the sequence, as well as the influence of seasonality on hominid \r\nforaging for animal tissue, have not been conducted on this scale before and \r\nmay provide valuable information on the motivation and frequency of Oldowan \r\ncarnivory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
