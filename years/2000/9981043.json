 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) This project is integrating computer technology into an introductory physics laboratory that reinforces quantitative problem solving and preparing the work for national dissemination. The primary goals are to: (1) optimize laboratory problems to address students' robust problem-solving difficulties: and (2) prepare these problem-solving laboratories for national dissemination. Secondary goals are to investigate: (1) modes of faculty development necessary for implementation and (2) the applicability of this approach to introductory chemistry laboratories. To accomplish these goals, the project is carrying out four primary activities: (1) technical development, primarily refining software interfaces using National Instruments' LabVIEW; (2) research and instructional development centering on student difficulties in physics problem solving; (3) evaluation focused primarily on guiding the development; and (4) faculty development preparing for national dissemination. Particular attention will paid to the effect on underrepresented minorities in the introductory physics class, especially women.\r\n\tThe entire project will be under the guidance of part of the University of Minnesota Physics Education Group with the collaboration of University of Minnesota faculty members in Physics and Chemistry, together with physics faculty from Hamline University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the University of St. Thomas.\r\n\tThis project builds on work showing the technical and pedagogical feasibility of merging computer-based laboratories with cooperative group problem solving pedagogy under grant NSF DUE9651339. At its conclusion the project will result in: (1) software tools for a computer based problem solving laboratory that can be readily modified by adapters; (2) student laboratory manuals that can be modified by adapters; (3) an adapter's guide; (4) an evaluation of the effectiveness of the problem solving laboratory at three sites; and (5) national dissemination.\r\n\r\n",
