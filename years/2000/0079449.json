 "awd_abstract_narration": "0079449\r\nCarey\r\n\tThe MuLan Project will develop the instrumentation  needed to\r\nmeasure the lifetime of the positive muon to  unprecedented\r\nprecision, namely, a factor of 20 better than the current world\r\naverage.  The muon lifetime fixes the value of the Fermi constant,\r\nwhich governs the strength of all weak-interaction processes, just\r\nas the fine structure constant governs the strength of all\r\nelectromagnetic-interaction processes.   The Fermi constant is one\r\nof the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model of particle\r\nphysics.  A low-energy, continuous-wave muon beam at the Paul \r\nScherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland will be modified by a new\r\nbeam chopper system in order to create intense, short bursts of\r\nmuons, which will stop in thin targets.  A positive muon stopped in\r\nappropriate materials decays as if it were in vacuum.  Such targets\r\nwill be surrounded by a nearly hermetic set of 180 fast-scintillator\r\ntiming detectors, each coupled to a state-of-the-art  waveform\r\ndigitizer, and all readout by a high-speed data acquisition system. \r\nOnline analysis of the nearly 100 terabytes of data will take place\r\nwith a small array of fast microprocessors.  \r\n\tA second use of the instrumentation is in conjunction with an\r\nongoing effort at PSI to measure the negative muon lifetime in\r\nhydrogen gas.  The negative muon can decay exactly in the same\r\nmanner as the positive muon, or in hydrogen it can interact with a\r\nproton by the weak-interaction process known as  \"capture.\"  The\r\ncapture rate is predicted very accurately by theory; however,\r\ncurrent experiments, which have various interpretation problems, are\r\nin disagreement with theory by a very significant amount.  If this\r\ndisagreement is confirmed, this difference raises the exciting\r\npossibility of pointing to new and unaccounted-for physics.  By\r\nmeasuring the difference between the positive and negative muon\r\nlifetimes, we will determine the muon capture rate reliably and at a\r\nprecision more than four times better than current measurements. \r\nThe MuLan timing detectors, beamline and custom electronics are\r\nexpected to play a major role in this effort.\r\n",
