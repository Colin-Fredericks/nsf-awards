 "awd_abstract_narration": "TERC, Mass Networks Education Partnership, and Massachusetts Department of Education Youth Tech Entrepreneurs are hosting a first annual \"Students as Technology Leaders\" national conference in October 2000. The goal of the conference is to promote national awareness and sharing of diverse models and best practices for information technology (IT) teaching and learning. The weekend format includes keynote speakers from industry, panel discussions, industry exhibits, and the showcasing of exemplary IT programs.\r\n\r\nThe project's goal is to identify and encourage national awareness and to accelerate the implementation of exemplary IT student leadership and service learning models that meet the following needs: engaging and motivating students, providing school technical support, promoting civic good, and ensuring the development of the IT workforce. Applications to attend the conference are being solicited from exemplary community college and high school IT programs throughout the nation. From these applications, a database of IT programs that can provide models and resources for others is being developed, and a diverse and gender-balanced group of 15 high school and 10 community college teams are being selected to showcase their programs at the conference.\r\n\r\nOutcomes include developing a database of exemplary IT program nominees and applicants, highlighting invited programs for national attention, and recognizing and inspiring approximately 250 students and teachers. Post-conference deliverables include published and videotaped proceedings, a compilation of best practices, and IT program start-up and public relations kits.\r\n\r\nNSF funds are being matched by support from IT companies.\r\n",
