 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division and Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research jointly supports Professor Lee Park of Williams College, an undergraduate liberal arts college, and is to study the use of liquid crystalline materials as molecular conductors. The preparation of one-dimensional liquid crystalline materials of metallomesogens with order and anisotrophy, and with a variety of physical properties are being studied under this award. Liquid crystalline derivatives of known one-directional structures of rigid aromatic core fragments with polar substituents are also being synthesized. Teaching and training of undergraduate students in materials science are parts of the award. \r\n\r\nUnder the award, metallomesogens with rigid aromatic core fragments and polar substituents are synthesized. These structures are robust and oriented in one direction, and their structural integrity and shape are reinforced by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.  The broader impact of the project is the potential applications of these materials with enhanced material properties in high performance electrical and magnetic devices, and they are likely to be fabricated at a lower processing cost.  In addition, the research program will provide a rich multidisciplinary education and training opportunity in materials chemistry to undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n",
