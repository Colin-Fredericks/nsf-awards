Measurements\r\nwill be made using the very precise, intense, and energetic electron\r\nbeam produced by the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.\r\nMost of the experiments will study atoms whose nucleus has no more\r\nthan two protons and two neutrons. When electrons are used to probe\r\nsuch relatively simple systems one can compare the results to very\r\naccurate theoretical predictions. Experiments will be performed on helium\r\nnuclei to investigate the structure of these systems under extreme conditions\r\nincluding those in which the protons and neutrons are very close to each other.\r\nOther experiments will bombard the hydrogen nucleus, which consists of a\r\nsingle proton, to study particular features of the proton structure. One\r\nexperiment will study the structure of a the complex lead nucleus.\r\n\tIn support of these measurements we will continue our work in developing and building the target devices used to contain the materials that are being bombarded by the electron beam. This work involves building structures that can\r\ncontain high pressure gases at temperatures a few degrees above absolute zero.\r\nWe will also build a cooled lead target that will allow us to use the high\r\npower electron beam without melting the lead. In all these efforts we will\r\ncontinue to place particular emphasis on working with students, particularly\r\nundergraduate students and selected high school students and teachers. This\r\neffort is being coordinated with an outreach program that we are leading directed\r\ntowards high schools in the local area that have large populations of minority students.\r\n\r\n",
