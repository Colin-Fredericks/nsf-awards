 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  To accomplish the goals of teaching non-science majors not only what we know from science (i.e., content), but more importantly how that knowledge is acquired (the process of science) and its relevance to real-world problems, we are adapting the inquiry-based approach to laboratory investigation for use in our general biology course for non-science majors at the University of New England (approximately 150 students a year).  In stark contrast to most \"cookbook\" lab exercises, in which the answers to research questions are known in advance and student performance is judged by the ability to follow instructions and how closely students approximate the anticipated results, inquiry-based activities engage students in open-ended investigations with uncertain outcomes, thus mimicking how scientific research is actually conducted.  Although the value of open-ended, inquiry-based labs is widely recognized, particularly in upper division courses, such labs are infrequently used in introductory science courses.  Nonetheless we are confident in the potential success of using inquiry-based labs in our non-majors biology course because of previous efforts to infuse inquiry into the secondary school biology curriculum (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study), and the subsequent export of this approach to introductory college biology labs (e.g., Leonard 1982, 1983, 1989).  We are implementing a series of new, inquiry-based explorations, in which students conduct experimental research on the response of terrestrial and aquatic carbon cycles to anthropogenic change, because these issues (e.g., the effects of global warming on carbon flux from forests or oceans) place biology in a real-world context and illustrate the importance of multiple levels of study in biology (i.e., from cells to ecosystems).  Given that these new laboratory exercises require students to work through the majors steps of the scientific method, including designing and conducting experiments utilizing modern analytical equipment, our students obtain first-hand experience with the methods and process of scientific inquiry, as well as an appreciation for the role of technology in science.  We are evaluating the effectiveness of this reform effort on improving students attitudes towards science, comprehension of biological principles, and the development of basic laboratory and critical thinking skills, by administering several self-designed and externally available assessment instruments to students enrolled in the new laboratories, and in labs taught in a more traditional, \"cookbook\" manner.  In order to insure the broadest dissemination possible of the results of our laboratory reform project, we will share our experiences with colleagues at local, regional and national levels through a series of seminars, workshops, conference presentations and publications.\r\n\r\n",
