Specifically, two types of stability properties will be \r\nexamined: input-to-output stability and incremental stability. Roughly \r\nspeaking, input-to-output stability requires that the output signals \r\neventually become small if the external input signals are small, and in \r\nparticular, the output signals should converge to zero when there is no \r\ninput acting on the system.  Incremental stability properties require nearby \r\ntrajectories with nearby inputs stay nearby, and eventually converge to \r\neach other.  These properties are nonlinear generalizations of some \r\nfrequently used ones in the study of linear systems.  To understand the \r\nproperties in the nonlinear case well, it is crucial to explore their \r\nequivalent characterizations, among which the Lyapunov-like functions \r\nprovide the most intrinsic insight.  The main objective of the project is to \r\ninvestigate the equivalent characterizations and to develop the theory of \r\nLyapunov-like functions for the nonlinear stability properties.\r\n\r\nOne of the main issues in systems and control theory concerns with the \r\nstudy of system sensitivity to disturbances, and more generally, of the \r\ndependence of outputs on actuator and measurement errors, magnitudes of \r\ntracking signals, and the like.  For linear systems, the frequency domain \r\napproach has led great success in the study of such problems. Yet for \r\nnonlinear systems, the situation is much more complicated.  A key issue in \r\nthe nonlinear case is to identify the most desired features and to formulate \r\nthem into suitable mathematical notions.  During the last 10 years or so, \r\nthe notion of input-to-state stability was formulated and it quickly became \r\na fundamental concept upon which much of modern nonlinear feedback \r\nanalysis and design rest.  In this project it is proposed to investigate a wide \r\nvariety of extensions of the notion of input-to-state stability. The goal is to \r\nbuild a theoretical foundation for the study of stability-like properties for \r\nnonlinear systems, thereby providing a set of sound theoretical tools for \r\nnonlinear systems design.\r\n",
