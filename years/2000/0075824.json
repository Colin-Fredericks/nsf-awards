The SPM will be capable of acquiring scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and contact and non-contact scanning force microscopy (SFM) images at rates exceeding one image per second at temperatures between 100 and 1000 Kelvin. In addition, atom-tracking techniques will be implemented to enable diffusion measurements at hopping rates up to 104 per second, and to lock onto individual surface sites to allow catalytic processes occurring on the time scale of microseconds to be studied on a local level. The SPM system will be linked to two existing surface analysis systems and thus the complete system will enable the electronic and chemical properties of the same surface to be characterized by a wide range of techniques that probe different length and energy scales. This new system will be used to study problems in film growth, interface formation and dynamics, the electronic properties of interfaces, and heterogeneous catalysis. Both the construction of the new SPM system and the projects that will use the new equipment closely integrate research and education.\r\n***\r\nThe Departments of Chemical Engineering and Applied Physics at Yale University will acquire a variable-temperature ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) scanning probe microscope (SPM). By incorporating both scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning force microscopy (SFM) in a multi-chamber UHV system equipped with an array of surface preparation and analytical techniques, Professor Altman and co-workers will be able to investigate on the atomic-scale the full range of technically important and scientifically interesting surfaces and interfaces including insulators, semiconductors and metals. Further, varying the temperature between 100-1000 Kelvin will allow them to control the rate of surface kinetics enabling the characterization of the mechanisms and kinetics of surface phenomena such as catalysis by direct observation on the atomic scale. The results obtained with this equipment will impact our fundamental understanding of film growth and interface formation as well as heterogeneous catalysis. Both the construction of the new SPM system and the projects that will use the new equipment closely integrate research and education. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all phases of the design, assembly and testing of the new system, providing them a unique educational opportunity to learn first-hand about the design of complex scientific equipment.\r\n\r\n",
