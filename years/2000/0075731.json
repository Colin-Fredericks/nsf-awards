 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n   Optimization of linear or nonlinear parabolic differential equations\r\nin the context of optimal control, optimal design, or parameter estimation \r\nplays an important role in science and engineering. Algorithms for the\r\nsolution of parabolic equations often involve marching in time, starting\r\nfrom an initial condition. In optimization, however, the values of the\r\nsolution of the parabolic equation at later times feed into the\r\noptimization at early times. This coupling in time makes the practical\r\nsolution of these very large-scale optimization problems challenging.\r\nTo cope with storage and computer time demands required by an exact\r\noptimization of parabolic systems, so-called suboptimal control techniques, \r\nsuch as reduced bases techniques and instantaneous control have recently \r\nbeen proposed. The analysis of these techniques is still incomplete and \r\nthe limits of their applicability are not clearly described. This\r\nresearch integrates selected suboptimal control techniques into an\r\noptimization framework, where they are interpreted as truncated \r\niterative methods or are used as preconditioners in optimization methods.\r\nThis improves our theoretical understanding of these techniques and broadens \r\ntheir applicability. The resulting methods are applied to specific optimal \r\ncontrol problems in or related to fluid mechanics.  \r\n\r\n   Optimal control attempts to determine system parameters or inputs \r\nto increase the performance of the system. For example, micro electromechanical\r\nsystems may be used to alter the flow characteristics on an aircraft wing \r\nto reduce drag, or heaters may be adjusted to achieve a desired temperature\r\nprofile in a furnace while minimizing energy consumption. Many systems\r\ncan be modeled by mathematical equations. In this case mathematical \r\ntechniques can be used, at least in principle, to determine the optimal\r\nsystem inputs. For systems that can be adequately modeled by moderately\r\ncomplex mathematical equations this is done routinely and successfully.\r\nDetailed mathematical descriptions of other systems, including flow \r\nover an aircraft wing or the temperature distribution in a furnace, however,\r\nare so complex that present mathematical techniques for the determination\r\nof optimal control strategies require such large computer resources that\r\nrender them impractical. The goal of this research is to develop and analyze\r\ncomputational mathematics tools for the determination of optimal control \r\nstrategies for a class of complex systems and the demonstration of\r\nthe practicability of these tools using selected applications in fluid \r\nmechanics.\r\n",
