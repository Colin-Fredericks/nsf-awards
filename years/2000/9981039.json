It also develops and delivers the course content for two cornerstone courses in a recently initiated technology education program. The technology education program is targeted to students transferring from two year institutions. This project focuses on providing the technology, methodology and course content for two courses that cover the theoretical background and practical programming background for students entering the technology education program. The architecture features the use of a database of related material, which differs in difficulty, assumed background and delivery modes. It also features the use of a knowledge base in which the instructional material is organized as a dependency graph between the instructional topics, management of student progress through the material, and navigational tools which allow students to bridge gaps in their background and explore topics that catch their interest. The adaptive learning architecture supports students with diverse backgrounds and has the potential to address problems common to many institutions of higher learning.\r\n\r\n",
