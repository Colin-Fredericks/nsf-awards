 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Gordon Research Conference(GRC) on the Chemistry and Physics of Nanostructure Fabrication will be held July 23-28, 2000. The science and engineering of nanostructure fabrication is of particular interest to electronics/photonics and related areas since future progress in the field may be paced by advances in the science and technology of nanofabrication. The general conference topic is highly multidisciplinary, and will include: proximal probe fabrication, manipulation, and measurement; single electron phenomena; beyond ULSI to QLSI; quantum devices; novel devices and fabrication; chemical and biological nanostructures.\r\nThe conference format - a week of continuous interaction with experts in interrelated fields in a casual setting -provides special opportunities for scientists and students to exchange ideas. All participants will have the opportunity to hear first hand high quality scientific work and novel ideas emerging in the field, and the opportunity to establish relationships and interact with other attendees. Such opportunities are particularly beneficial to students and young scientists.\r\n%%%\r\nAn evaluation of the progress and status of Chemistry and Physics of Nanostructure Fabrication along with current assessments of the most important developments in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of electronic/photonic materials in computing, data processing, and communications. The Conference is co-supported by the CTS/FPH and ECS/EPDT programs.\t \r\n***\r\n",
