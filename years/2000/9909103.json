 "awd_abstract_narration": "9909103  Noguera  The objective of research being conducted with support by this award is to investigate the microbiology and biochemistry of phosphate removal in full-scale wastewater treatment plants as steps toward improvement in operation of biotreatment processes for enhanced removal of phosphates from wastewater.  Laboratory work involves application of a technique based on differences of buoyant densities between cells of microorganisms that accumulate phosphates from those that do not accumulate them as a physical method for their separation and isolation.  In this work, a procedure will be used for visualization of polyphosphate staining in combination with fluorescent hybridization to allow simultaneous identification of microorganisms and determination of their accumulations of polyphosphates.  Results of laboratory-scale research will be correlated with knowledge obtained from studies of the microbial phosphorus accumulating communities of wastewater treatment plants located in Madison, Stoughton and Racine, Wisconsin.  the wastewater treatment plant in Madison uses a modified UCT (University of Cape Town) biotreatment process, the Stoughton plant operates an advanced oxidation process and the Racine wastewater treatment plant uses a conventional suspended microbial growth, non-enhanced biological phosphate removal process.  Results of this research are expect to relate knowledge obtained to improvement in the engineering design and operation of treatment plants and systems that utilize metabolic activities of microorganisms to remove plant nutrients from wastewater.  This work is complementary to research being conducted with support from NSF Grant No. 9875642, the objective of which is to investigate the microbial ecology of nitrogen removal from wastewater by aerated-anoxic processes.  ***",
