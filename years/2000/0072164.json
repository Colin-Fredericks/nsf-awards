Escobar\r\n\r\nProfessor Escobar proposes to work in three different variational\r\nproblems: The first one is on conformal deformation of\r\nmetrics. He proposes to work on the scalar curvature problem on\r\nscalar flat manifolds of dimension five or more.  In addition, he\r\nwill study the prescribed scalar curvature and prescribed mean\r\ncurvature problem on manifolds with boundary; particular\r\nattention will be given to this problem when the manifold is the\r\nEuclidean ball and the dimension is three.  Earlier\r\ninvestigations indicate that the problem in three dimensions is\r\nspecial. The second topic he proposes to study is estimates for\r\nthe first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue on compact manifolds with\r\nboundary. Escobar proposes to study relations between the\r\ngeometry of the space and the first non-zero eigenvalue and apply\r\nthis information to problems in conformal geometry, heat flow\r\nproblems, and to the study of eigenvalues of minimal\r\nsurfaces. The third topic is to study Einstein metrics on\r\nmanifolds with boundary. There are three different kinds of\r\nequations that arise naturally as a variational problem of a\r\nfunctional introduced by the proposer; they are Einstein metrics\r\nsatisfying that the boundary is totally geodesic or, more\r\ngenerally, that the boundary is umbilic, and Ricci flat metrics\r\nwith umbilic boundary.\r\n\r\nThe three problems above have their roots in Riemannian geometry\r\nas well as in physics. The Steklov problem initially appeared in\r\nphysics, then in harmonic analysis, partial differential\r\nequations, conformal geometry, and minimal surfaces.  In physics,\r\nit describes the temperature of a body where the flux through out\r\nthe boundary is proportional to the temperature. We will\r\ninvestigate how the geometry of the space influence the first\r\nnon-zero eigenvalue, that is, the smallest nonzero constant of\r\nproportionality. The Einstein equation proposed in this project\r\nis the generalization of the Einstein's equation in boundaryless\r\nspaces studied by Hilbert and Einstein in general relativity to\r\nthe case of spaces with boundary.  The boundary conditions we\r\nwill imposed are the natural ones if one studies this problem\r\nfrom the point of view of the calculus of variations. The scalar\r\ncurvature equations that we will investigate are the average\r\nversion of the Einstein equation on manifolds with boundary.\r\nNowadays they are known as the Yamabe type equations. These\r\nequations appear in relativity and in other branches of physics.\r\n",
