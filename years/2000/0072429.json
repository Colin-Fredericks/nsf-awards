It has been shaped by the\r\ngeometrization and virtual bundle conjectures of Thurston\r\nand the compactification conjectures of Simon and of Marden.\r\nThese imply certain consequences for covering spaces of such\r\n3-manifolds. Closed, orientable, irreducible 3-manifolds with\r\ninfinite fundamental group ought to have universal covering\r\nspace homeomorphic to Euclidean 3-space. Professor Myers will\r\ncontinue his work on this problem by ruling out classes of\r\npossible counterexamples through an analysis of group actions\r\non Whitehead manifolds; he will use a new result which promises\r\nto extend his work on Whitehead manifolds which contain\r\nnon-trivial planes to those which do not. More generally,\r\ncovering spaces with finitely generated fundamental group ought\r\nto be homeomorphic to interiors of compact 3-manifolds. He will\r\ncontinue his work on this problem and on the closely related\r\nproblem of showing that the same conclusion holds for hyperbolic\r\n3-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group. Freedman\r\nhas reduced the latter problem to a purely topological problem\r\nwhich seems accessible. Hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume\r\nought to be finitely covered by surface bundles over the circle,\r\nalthough very few non-trivial examples of this phenomenon are known.\r\nMyers will attempt to construct more such examples and will explore\r\nthe extent to which the desired conclusion is implied by the failure\r\nof the finitely generated intersection property in the fundamental\r\ngroup. 3-manifolds with cubings of negative curvature ought to\r\nbe hyperbolic; Myers will investigate a method for trying to build\r\nhyperbolic structures, trying to determine both its scope and\r\nlimitations. Finally, he will attempt to construct small knots in\r\nnon-Haken 3-manifolds.\r\n\r\nManifolds are spaces which generalize the familiar curves and\r\nsurfaces that live in ordinary 3-dimensional space. An n-manifold\r\nlocally looks like n-dimensional space; thus a curve is a 1-manifold,\r\nand a surface is a 2-manifold. 3-manifolds are difficult to\r\nvisualize but can be described mathematically. Such spaces arise\r\nas models of the universe in general relativity; in this role\r\nthey come equipped with geometries, i.e. ways of measuring distances,\r\nangles, and curvature. Conjectures of Thurston, Simon, and Marden\r\nsuggest that the members of a large class of 3-manifolds have\r\nparticularly nice geometries and can be constructed from the\r\nmembers of a small set of standard 3-manifolds by identifying\r\ntheir points in certain ways. Professor Myers will attempt to\r\nverify various important special cases of this conjectural picture.\r\n",
