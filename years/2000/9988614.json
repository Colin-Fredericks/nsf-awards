 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to investigate the fundamental problem of pattern formation: how organized structures can spontaneously arise in a structureless environment.  Experiments are planned on a rich model system for  studying pattern formation: electrohydrodynamic instabilities that arise in nematic liquid crystals.  Specifically, the following three areas will be investigated: energy transport measurements and their use as quantitative tests of competing models of electroconvection; b) the origin of a crucial length scale only partially selected in dendritic growth; and c) the competition between equilibrium and non-equilibrium transitions.\r\n%%%\r\nThe study of spatio-temporal flow instabilities in nematic liquid crystals is crucial to optimizing this class of liquid crystal materials in various device applications.    This project, in cooperation with predictions based on the latest theoretical modeling from our collaborators, will significantly enhance our understanding of patter formation outside equilibrium in intrinsically anisotropic systems.  Not only are these studies of fundamental scientific and technological importance, they are also represent invaluable opportunities for training graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in a diverse array of useful techniques and skills.\r\n",
