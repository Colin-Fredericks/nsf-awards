 "awd_abstract_narration": "In step with each technological breakthrough, increasingly more of what we\r\nlearn about the world is measured indirectly. Extending and complementing\r\nour sensory faculties, we rely on technology to probe across long distances\r\nand through natural barriers. Astronomy, nondestructive testing, medical\r\nimaging, and geophysical prospecting are all important examples of our\r\nability to make indirect measurements of a physical effect and from these\r\nlearn about the causes of such effects. At the heart of this ability are\r\ninverse methods: practical computational techniques for processing the\r\nmeasured data and distilling the information of interest from the data.\r\nThese techniques bring together tools from multidimensional signal\r\nprocessing, statistics, and applied mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this CAREER grant proposal is the development of a long term\r\nresearch and educational program in multidimensional signal processing that\r\nwill integrate engineering, statistical, and numerical techniques for the\r\nsolution of inverse problems in imaging. The educational component of the\r\nproposed program will design, from the ground level, a comprehensive\r\ngraduate and undergraduate curriculum in statistical signal and image\r\nprocessing at the newly established department of Electrical Engineering at\r\nthe University of California, Santa Cruz. In addition, an introductory\r\nundergraduate seminar course, and an in-depth graduate course on the\r\nsubject of in- verse problems in imaging will be developed. The research\r\ncomponent of the proposed program will address problems in image\r\nreconstruction from indirectly measured information that may be in-\r\ncomplete and noisy. These data can convey information that, depending upon\r\nthe application, may be geometric in nature (2-D silhouettes of a 3-D\r\nobject), tomographic (projections of a function), local (blurred and\r\ndownsampled images of a detailed scene), or global (moments of an object.)\r\nOur program of research will entail the development of statistical and\r\nnumerical methods for solving problems in each of the said categories.",
