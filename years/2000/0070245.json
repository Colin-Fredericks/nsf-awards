 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe purpose of this work is to demonstrate and evaluate two device concepts incorporating\r\nferroelectric polymer Langmuir-Blodgett films: high-performance capacitors and\r\nnonvolatile data storage elements. Both device concepts take advantage of unique\r\ndielectric and ferroelectric properties of Langmuir-Blodgett films of polyvinylidene\r\nfluoride and its copolymers. The high-performance capacitors benefit from the record\r\ndielectric strength of over 3 GV/m in the highly uniform films as thin as 1 nm. The energy\r\nstorage density of multilayer capacitors made from the ferroelectric polymer LB films is\r\nexpected to reach 200 to 1000 Joules per cubic centimeter. The fast switch speed of 2\r\nmicroseconds and the ability to deposit the films on a variety of substrates permits the\r\nfabrication of inexpensive of hybrid nonvolatile data storage devices composed of a\r\nferroelectric polymer LB film deposited directly on an array of planar field-effect\r\ntransistor. Though each device concept may independently prove suitable for practical\r\napplication, they may prove particularly useful together in combination with conventional\r\nintegrated circuits for the production of nonvolatile random-access memories, caches, and\r\narchival storage. This project is a natural spin-off of five years of study and\r\ndevelopment of the only reported two-dimensional ferroelectrics, research conducted\r\njointly by the PI's group in collaboration with two groups at the Institute of\r\nCrystallography in Moscow.\r\n",
