The objectives of the conference are to bring together senior researchers, young researchers, and advanced doctoral students to focus on several current research areas in Statistics, as well as to discuss some current and future issues in statistical education and training, in a relaxed and informal setting.  The conference is intended to be small, with approximately 50-60 participants mostly from the fourteen-state SRCOS region.  This size allows for maximum participant interactions for the 3 1/2 days duration.  Standard sessions consist of invited one hour talks with all speakers urged to give detailed background and review at the beginning of the talks, leading up to current results, problems, and issues on their topics.  This format provides an entry point into the research topic for participants interested in beginning to investigate new areas, especially young researchers.\r\n\r\nThe SRCS in year 2000 is a special conference with the emphasis on topics in \"Industrial Statistics\" in honor of the well-known statistician, Professor Stuart Hunter.  A poster session by advanced doctoral students and young researchers also reflect this theme.  A special four-hour session on day one will feature Dr. Hunter and four to five other well-known researchers and is designated as  \"Stu Hunter Day.\"  The special emphasis provides the doctoral students and young researchers with a unique opportunity to become acquainted with, and interact with these senior researchers over the entire conference.  The students would most likely not have such an opportunity otherwise. and the NSF is funding support for eight doctoral students to participate.\r\n\r\n",
