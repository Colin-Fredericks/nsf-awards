 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fully 55% of Northern Arizona University (NAU) engineering students are eligible for financial assistance under federal guidelines.  Additionally, underrepresented groups comprise 37% of the engineering college's student body of 900, including approximately 100 Native American students. Most of these students struggle under the burden of inadequate financial support and/or poor K-12 academic preparation for college.  This project at provides 40 scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students in the College of Engineering and Technology.  Scholarship recipients receive $2500 per academic year for up to two years and  have additional paid tutoring/teaching assistantship opportunities. \r\n\r\nRecipients of the NSF scholarships are undergraduate and graduate students who, in addition to the many institutional support programs, are supported through the following activities in the College of Engineering and Technology.  The Engineering Scholars Seminar and Pizza series enhances the scholars' professional development, develops peer support, and offers an informal environment in which to interact with college faculty and administrators.  The Engineering Scholars participate in workshops dedicated to internship and career placement, including training in resume writing and interview skills.  All undergraduate Engineering Scholars participate in the Multicultural Engineering Program, and upper-division NSF Engineering Scholars receive work-study positions as tutors with the MEP program.  Graduate students receiving scholarships also receive a paid quarter-time teaching assistantship to partner with full-time engineering faculty members in teaching undergraduate courses.  Engineering Scholars are eligible for summer internship opportunities at Raytheon Defense Systems Segment in Tucson, AZ as part of a proposed Raytheon/NAU scholarship/internship partnership. \r\n\r\nThe program will be administered by the Principal Investigators (the Master of Engineering Director and the Dean of the College), and coordinated by the College's Director of Internships and Cooperative Education/Scholarship Coordinator. A Scholarship Administrative Board, consisting of the engineering dean, relevant department chairs, and the Multicultural Engineering Program Director, will provide leadership and guidance for the program. \r\n",
