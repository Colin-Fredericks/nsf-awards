 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) This curriculum reform effort is creating an active, student-centered learning environment in which all students take responsibility for their own learning and develop the ability to work collaboratively and in which investigation and research are emphasized.   Lower-division courses are adapting an active, workshop-style format and in upper-division laboratories there is a reduction in reliance on standard exercises centered on laboratory manuals and a concomitant adaption of inquiry based learning exercises. This project follows a successful pilot and adapts ideas developed by Amy Mulnix (DUE 9559773).  In general, students are taught several flexible approaches for investigating the importance of tissue interactions on developmental gene regulation in early avian embryos. This system weaves together the disciplines of developmental biology, cell biology, molecular biology and immunology while addressing fundamental principles of development: fate, potency, commitment, differentiation and developmentally regulated gene expression. Students design and carry out experiments involving microsurgical manipulation of early embryos followed by techniques to reveal changes in mRNA and protein expression in the affected tissues. They present their results to one another orally and in written reports.  The inquiry-based approach adapted in this upper-division laboratory is being adapted in other upper-division courses as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
