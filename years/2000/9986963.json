 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (31), (59) The United States is currently facing a shortage of engineers and computer scientists, a shortage which is growing worse as colleges and universities continue to graduate an insufficient number of these professionals each year. Even more disturbing is the severe underrepresentation of women and minorities in engineering and computer science. In order to maintain the United States' role as a technological leader, it is essential that we strive to include more diverse perspectives in these fields. To this end, the university is increasing the number of women and minorities who complete degree programs in engineering and computer science at community colleges as well as at the bachelor's and master's levels.  Scholarships are offered to exceptional students with financial need, targeting recruitment strategies to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in these fields. These students are being provided with a strong support infrastructure which ensures that they have the resources they need to graduate and to find rewarding careers in engineering and computer science.  This program provides immediate benefits to students at the university and at partnering community colleges and also benefits underrepresented students nationwide because, through dissemination efforts, U.S. in Engineering and Computer Science serves as a model for colleges and universities across the country. \r\n",
