 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Brazil award will support a symposium-workshop on Frugivory and Seed Dispersal in August 6-12, 2000 in Pousada do Rio Quente, Brazil. The award includes funding for travel and subsistence for 15 US delegates from 14 different US institutions to the symposium-workshop. \r\n\r\nThis is the third in a series of workshops on this topic, the previous two held in 1985 and 1991 in Mexico, resulted in a number of publications that shaped the development of the relatively new field. Additionally, Dr. Douglas J. Levey will conduct a planned visit to meet with Drs. Wesley Silva and Mauro Galetti to finalize logistics for the symposium-workshop.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the role of seed dispersers in plant demography and the role of fruit in vertebrate population dynamics is an important component of conservation strategies. In parts of the world, most woody plants produce fruit and depend upon vertebrates to disperse their seeds. Estimates of vertebrate biomass supported by fruit resources are as high as 80%.  Aside from its practical importance, fruit-frugivore interactions represent one of the two major plant-animal mutualisms (the other being pollution). Its theoretical development has been influential in shaping views of co evolution, partially because its previous theoretical framework proved incorrect. Its current theoretical framework is in a state of uncertain transition. Thus now is a critical time for people in the field to meet, share ideas, establish collaborations, and settle upon a future course of action. The proceedings of the symposium-workshop will be published.\r\n\r\nThe selected site is known for its biological diversity, and will attract a broad international participation, including a large number of Latin American students.\r\n***\r\n",
