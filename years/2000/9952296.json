 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  Physics (13)  This project involves a new two-semester laboratory course for undergraduates in the chemistry and physics of materials, developed and taught jointly by the Departments of Chemistry and Physics.  Neither the solid state nor materials in general were well covered in the existing offerings of either department, so it makes sense to mount a joint effort to educate students in this area of immense and growing importance in science and technology, one that cuts across traditional disciplinary boundaries.  The project focuses on laboratory work in a course suitable for majors in chemistry, physics, or chemical physics, and blends the approaches of both chemists and physicists.  Special attention is paid to the synthesis of materials; both inorganic and organic substances are considered together and used as examples in laboratory work, and emphasis is placed on useful properties and technical applications.\r\n\r\nExperiments are being developed in synthesis (e.g. high Tc superconductors; V204; MoS2); purification (e.g. zone refining); crystal growth; structure description and analysis; identification and structure determination of substances by X-ray powder diffraction; surface imaging (e.g. scanning tunneling microscopy); the mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of solids (e.g. cleavage; piezoelectricity; semi-conduction; organic conductors; ferroelectricity; magnetic susceptibility; anti-ferromagnetism; superconductivity; birefringence; nonlinear optical properties); and various properties of soft condensed matter (e.g. liquid crystals).  A number of experiments are being adapted from ones which have been published in the chemical or physics education literature, and some new experiments are being developed, in order to create an appropriate overall introduction to materials science.  Students perform short individual and/or group research projects, and present talks on selected topics.  Chemistry and Physics faculty members at Barnard College are combining and sharing their expertise, and the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center of Columbia University also is providing assistance.\r\n\r\n",
