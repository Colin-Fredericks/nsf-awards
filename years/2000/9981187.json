 "awd_abstract_narration": "Packet switching has been extensively studied for traffic problems but there has been very little work,\r\nif any, on the complexity and methodical design of packet switching networks.  Indeed, in a recent\r\nNSF workshop report, it was stressed that a wide variety of switching system architectures have been\r\nproposed, but little definitive evaluation or comparisons of these architectures have been made under criteria that factor in both performance and cost measures, where technology-dependent and technology-independent factors are clearly separated.\"\r\n     A buffered network model was recently introduced to examine the design and complexity problems in\r\npacket switching networks.  Building on this model, the notion of transparency is introduced in the\r\nproposed research as a measure of a buffered network's ability to deliver its packets at a specified set\r\nof traffic rates between its inputs and outputs.  The notion of transparency quantifies the ability of\r\na buffered network to deliver its packets much like the nonblocking property of a circuit switching\r\nnetwork quantifies its ability to provide paths between its idle inputs and idle outputs.  The main goal\r\nof the proposed research is to use the notion of transparency to investigate the basic bounds of packet\r\ntransmission in packet switching networks, and construct packet switching networks which come close\r\nto meeting these bounds.  Such bounds are often imposed on a packet switching network by its topology,\r\nbuffer space, and crosspoint and routing complexity.  In constrast to circuit switching networks, the\r\ncomplexity of packet switching networks has escaped the scrutiny of packet switching research so far,\r\nbut without any information on their complexity, the performance of packet switching networks cannot\r\nbe quantified.\r\n     Along with the investigation of the complexity problems, the proposed research will attempt to identify\r\nthe types of traffic and assignments for which efficient buffered networks can potentially be obtained,\r\nand actually construct such networks.  Informally speaking an \"efficient buffered network\" is one which\r\nutilizes its crosspoints and buffer space as fully as possible subject to meeting a set of traffic constraints. Both unicast and multicast buffered networks will be investigated.  The main tools of the proposed research will be Hall-type theorems, Pinsker's inexplicit combinatorial constructions, and explicit recursive network construction techniques.  Inexplicit constructions will be used to establish the optimality and quantify the performance of explicit recursive buffered networks.  The researchers anticipate that\r\nthe complexity bounds on packet switching and recursive buffered network construction techniques to\r\nbe obtained in the proposed research will have a strong impact on the way that packet switches are\r\ndesigned, and can pave the way for a methodical design of efficient and practical packet switching\r\nnetworks.\r\n",
