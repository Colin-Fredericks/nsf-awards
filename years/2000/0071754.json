 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project requests funds for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER). In the wake of the recent conflict and vote for independence from Indonesia by the people of East Timor, East Timorese refugees have been relocated to various parts of Indonesia. This project will analyze the case of one group of refugees to Flores Island, assessing the impact of conflicts over land and other resources on resource allocation patterns and social organization. This initial project will generate an ethnographic base for further, long-term research. It specifically addresses the consequences of population displacements resulting from ethnic conflict and warfare, and thus has relevance to many other parts of the world. It also addresses issues of minority populations' interactions with state/military governments in the developing world. The researcher will be able to capture these processes as they unfold. Methods include community surveys and detailed interviewing with villagers, leaders, church officials, and government/military officials.\r\n\r\n",
