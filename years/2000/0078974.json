 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the photochemically induced skeletal reorganization of pyrones and pyridones to afford intermediates that can be trapped to form one or more carbon-carbon bonds and thus furnish polycyclic products with greatly increased molecular complexity.  The reactions of 4-pyrones, 2-pyrones, 4-pyridones will be studied as will the application of 2-pyrone [4+4]-photocycloaddition chemistry leading to a 5-8-5 natural product target. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Frederick G. West of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah.  Professor West will focus his work on developing novel photochemical rearrangements and the application of the methodology towards organic synthesis.  The research has broader impacts for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and serves as an excellent training ground for graduate students.",
