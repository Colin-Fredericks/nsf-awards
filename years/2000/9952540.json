 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Engineering (32)\r\n\r\nSkills in hardware-software co-design are quickly becoming critical to product development in high-technology computer industries. To satisfy growing demand in industry, students in electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science should be introduced to concepts of hardware-software co-design at the undergraduate level. The goal of this Educational Materials Development project is to improve educational practices and student learning through development of materials that introduce hardware-software co-design in an undergraduate microcontrollers course. This goal is being accomplished by the following activities:  \r\n1) development of a fully-functional hardware-software simulation model of the 8051 microcontroller; 2) development of student laboratories that demonstrate concepts of hardware-software codesign; and 3) development of lecture materials to introduce concepts of hardware-software co-design.\r\n\r\nThis project integrates cutting-edge technology with the latest educational practices to provide a low-cost, innovative addition to the undergraduate engineering curriculum.  Materials are being developed and evaluated in an undergraduate course that draws a mix of students from electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science. \r\n\r\nFormative evaluations of student learning using a pilot system are being used to refine the overall quality of the materials. The materials are being tested at five other institutions with a common evaluation protocol to demonstrate the adaptability of the materials across diverse student populations.  \r\n\r\nResults of the evaluation and the materials themselves are being disseminated through appropriate conferences and journals and through the world-wide web.  A faculty workshop and teaching tutorial is being developed to be presented at two professional meetings as well as available on-line to assist other faculty members in adapting the materials at their institutions.  A commercially published laboratory manual is being developed to be used with the web site.\r\n",
