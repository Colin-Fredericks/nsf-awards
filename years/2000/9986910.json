 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), in partnership with J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC), is conducting a National Science Foundation CSEM Scholars Program. Forty NSF CSEM (Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics) Scholars are selected based on need (Pell Grant eligible) and their potential to complete their undergraduate degree within two years through full-time enrollment. As urban institutions both VCU and JSRCC, its primary feeder community college, serve a large population of part-time students including large percentages of racial minorities and women. During the 1998-99 academic year, over 295 students who were enrolled in CSEM degree programs at VCU received Pell grants. Due to work constraints, two-thirds of these students were unable to carry a 30 hour annual load which would lead to graduation in the normal four year period; 29% were unable to carry 25 credit loads annually; and 19% could not carry 20 credits. \r\n\r\nThrough the support of the NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholars program, the project goal is to significantly increase the number of students in this pool who can complete their undergraduate degree programs in a normal time frame for full-time students. Successful applicants are recognized as NSF Scholars at an awards ceremony and receive $2500 scholarships. The NSF CSEM Scholars prepare an Individualized Contract under the guidance of a specially designated advisor who works with the Scholars to maximize the effectiveness of the existing university support programs in the following areas: (1) financial aid planning, including securing additional scholarships and aid, (2) academic program planning, academic achievement progress and supplemental tutoring and assistance, and (3) career planning through a selected in-field experience such as co-op or internship programs augmented by career day interactions with working professionals.\r\n\r\n The success of this project is monitored by an evaluator working through the Metropolitan Educational Research Consortium (MERC). The evaluation program provides the formative guidance needed to maximize on-going effectiveness as well as the summative conclusions necessary to validate the program model. \r\n",
