 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP's), specifically volatile organic compounds\r\n(VOC's), are an increasing concern because they are major contributors to the predominant \r\nenvironmental problems facing us today such as: global warming, ozone depletion, and\r\nphotochemical smog.1-3 With the passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA),\r\nwhich require increased levels of control for specific organic compounds, the\r\nunderstanding and significant development of technologies for controlling these waste\r\nstreams have been mandated. Responding to the need to decrease VOC emission from\r\ndifferent technological processes, we propose the development of an innovative method for\r\nan effective, low cost destruction and removal of VOC's. Unlike other conventional\r\nmethods which burn VOC by raising the temperature of the contaminated gases, the proposed\r\nmethod uses properties of non-thermal plasma to generate free radicals to oxidize the VOC\r\ndirectly in the exhaust gas. The potential of the approach for VOC oxidation presented\r\nhere stems from the fact that free radicals react with VOC molecules in a way normally\r\nassociated with a very high temperature. The free radicals will be generated in the\r\ncontaminated gas. The proposed device will cause a minimal, if any, pressure drop in the\r\nexhaust stream; moreover, its only energy requirement is the relatively low average power \r\nsupply to its magnetron. It is expected that this device will operate in a wide range of \r\ntemperatures, and will be maintenance free.   The proposed project is expected to result \r\nin the development of a new technology for removing undesirable VOC's from exhaust gases. \r\nThe proposed method can be conveniently combined with virtually any other pollution-control \r\nmeasure. Due to the 'end-of-pipe' approach, only minor, if any, modifications in the operation \r\nof the existing exhaust system and in the system itself will be required to accommodate the \r\nnew technique.\r\n",
