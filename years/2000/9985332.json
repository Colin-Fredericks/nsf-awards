Most current language-based systems have insufficient resource controls for aggregate use of memory, CPU, network bandwidth, and so\r\nforth.  This research aims to implement resource management support within language-based systems, allowing for widespread use of a promising new technology.  This research will design and implement language runtime mechanisms within a commercial Java system to accurately and efficiently account for memory and CPU use, and to allow for safe termination of a computation.  These mechanisms will be\r\nsupported by rigorous mathematical models allowing their security and efficiency to be formally studied, and their applicability to extend to a wide class of language-based systems.  Educational activities at Rice University will be integrated with this research, building on topics across the traditional computer science curriculum.  Course developments will teach techniques for building secure systems, emphasizing both formal methods and practical software engineering techniques with an understanding of how hackers work in practice.  Additionally, community outreach will work to dispel common misconceptions about computer security through the popular press and various speaking engagements.\r\n",
