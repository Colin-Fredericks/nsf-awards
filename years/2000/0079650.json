 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis MRI proposal enhances and expands upon the active MEMS and Micro/Nanotechnology research program at the University of Louisville through the acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) System. The proposal builds upon (a) existing competitive research facilities in micro/nanotechnology, (b) an interdisciplinary collection of research-oriented faculty from engineering and science departments across the campus, and (c) a significant commitment by the University.  The requested DRIE System will provide the enabling technology needed to realize the promise of MEMS and micro/nantechnology over the next decade and to train the engineers and scientists who will use this technology. The specific research activities addresses in this proposal can be grouped into the following concentration areas and are consistent with the expertise of the PIs: 1) Novel DRIE Processing Methodologies, 2) RF MEMS, 3) DRIE-fabricated Sensors and Detectors, 4) Optical MEMS (MOEMS), 5) Microfluidics and Lab-on-a-Chip Systems, 6) Diamond MEMS, 7) CVD Processing of High Aspect Ratio DRIE-fabricated Micromolds, and 8) Application of ICP RIE to Nanolithography. While the heart of this proposal is the development and application of exciting new research opportunities, an education and outreach program will be developed with both updated and new courses that implement DRIE technology, MEMS, and micro/nanofabrication and an associated new Certificate Program. Involved students and industrial professionals will graduate after immersion in an environment with sound science, state-of-the-art technical expertise, and applications to real world problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
