 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop physical modeling and model-based sensing and control techniques for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) systems.  CMP is rapidly emerging as a global planarization technology for microelectronics fabrication.  Phase I found feasible modeling and real-time control techniques using actual experimental data from a commercial CMP system.  Three-dimensional (3D) results of contact mechanical models correlate closely with experimental results for removal rate distribution across a wafer.  Reduced input-output models relating the within wafer nonuniformity (WIWNU) to the pressure ratio and pad conditioning, obtained from detailed 3D models, were used as a basis for real-time and run-to-run control.  Phase II will extend these models and control methods and develop a model-based embedded controller for within-wafer and within-die uniformity control.  Phase II will culminate in tests of advanced process modeling and control software and an embedded controller for CMP systems.\r\n\r\nCommercial applications in the semiconductor industry are expected to result in improved and repeatable performance, increased throughput, and improved yields.  An embedded controller product promises significant improvements in uniformity and throughput by allowing real-time control of uniformity for various CMP applications.  Process modeling software and control software have potential for significant improvements in the 'trial and error' approach currently employed in CMP.\r\n",
