 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project explores two areas that utilize ranked data. The first aims to \r\ndevelop statistical procedures that are robust to violations of assumptions \r\nwhile still working close to optimally when the assumption holds. There is \r\na long history of such robust procedures based on ranking the data, that \r\nis, replacing the observed values in the data with the values' ranks. This \r\nprocess helps to ameliorate the effects of unusually wild observations that \r\ncan ruin an analysis. A number of multivariate situations in which there \r\nhas previously been little work using rank procedures will be the main \r\nfocus of this project. These include certain structural models defining the \r\nrelationship of variables, testing for runs in multivariate data observed \r\nover time, estimating variances and covariances, and testing whether \r\ncertain variables are conditionally independent given some other variables. \r\nA proposed method for defining multivariate ranks (\"iterated ranks\") so \r\nthat their distribution is independent of the distribution of the \r\nunderlying observations will be explored.\r\n\r\nThe second area looks at modeling rank data directly, where the data arise \r\nfrom judges ranking particular objects based on their preferences. One \r\npopular model posits that judges and objects can be arrayed along a line, \r\nwhere a judge is located nearest the judge's most preferred object, next \r\nclosest to the second most preferred object, etc. A new model that also \r\nallows judges to locate themselves nearest the objects they prefer least \r\nwill be considered. An extension of these models in which there is \r\nprovision for a small percentage of judges to act not at all according to \r\nthe model will also be considered. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
