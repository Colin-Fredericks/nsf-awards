Unfortunately, current\r\napproaches to security often yield ad hoc patchworks of inconsistent policies\r\nand incompatible mechanisms.  The problem is two-fold: Techniques and tools are\r\nlimited, and educational programs are sparse.\r\n    The research activities embed configurable security services within\r\nprogramming languages for developing distributed applications.  Denotational\r\nsemantics for these languages map high-level access control structures into a\r\nticket-based model that captures heterogeneous security policies and supports\r\nthe formal verification of secure behavior.  Specialized algorithms implement\r\nsecurity proofs for applications at compile-time and runtime.\r\n    A secure information enclave, a proof-of-concept application, is built\r\naround a glue language with programmable security policy coordination services.\r\nMediators gather metadata from remote sites, engaging cooperative policy\r\nmanagement methods to negotiate secure interoperability.  Static and dynamic\r\nanalyses guarantee global policy consistency for the enclave.\r\n    The educational activities have three major thrusts: The development of a\r\nCenter of Excellence for Information Assurance Education, the expansion of the\r\nTulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge --a nationally recognized program of\r\nacademics, research and service designed for computer science majors, and the\r\nsystematic incorporation of minorities, especially Native Americans (the PI is a\r\nnative Cherokee), in computer science and engineering programs in the state of\r\nOklahoma.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
