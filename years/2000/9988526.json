There are many computational problems known where there seems to be a  tradeoff between these resources: by increasingthe memory used one can significantly reduce the time needed.  However, we don't know whether these apparent tradeoffs are inherent properties of the  computational problems, or are just due to our lack of understanding. The first part of the project aims at analyzing the mathematical structure of some specific computational problems in order to establish that these tradeoffs are indeed inherent. There is a large class of problems, the so-called NP-complete problems, whose solution on large inputs seems to require a very large amount of time. One of the most basic of these is the satisfiability problem for boolean formulas, which asks whether for a given boolean formula it is possible to set its variables in such a way that the formula evaluates to 1. In the second part of this investigation, we seek to find the faster algorithms for this problem, and to investigate the limits to speed of the algorithms, as well as for related computational problems. The third part is based on a problem that arises in trying to maintain the privacy of users who request information from a large database.  In some such situations, the users do not want it known what information they are requesting. Various methods for maintaining user privacy have been proposed.  In some versions of this problem, maintaining privacy seems to require a large amount of communication between the user and the database.  In this investigation, we seek to determine whether such a large amount of communication is really necessary, and if so, whether small relaxations in the privacy requirements can significantly reduce the communication cost. In the fourth part, we look at the problem of a web server that is providing documents from a large library to users on the web.  The requests for documents arrive over time, and the server wants to satisfy the requests so that no requester ever waits too long.  Because a set of requests to the same page can be served faster than the same number of requests to different pages, it may be advantageous to delay some requests in order to group together requests of the same type. We seek to develop and analyze different algorithmic strategies for this problem.\r\n",
