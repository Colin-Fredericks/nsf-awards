 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThe project primarily deals with rigidity phenomena in dynamical systems.\r\nOne aspect  of rigidity  concerns situations when a weaker structure\r\n(i.e. measurable) determines a stronger one (i.e. differentiable)\r\nwithin certain classes of systems.  Another aspect deals with\r\npreservation of the  differentiable orbit structure or some of its\r\nimportant elements under small perturbations (local differentiable\r\nrigidity) or within certain classes of systems (global  differentiable\r\nrigidity). Yet another type of rigidity appears when  a certain\r\nproperty (such as a relation between invariants, or a regularity of an\r\ninvariant structure) forces the system to belong to a specialized\r\nnarrow class.  A part of the research program deals with the\r\nidentification of various  rigidity phenomena  in classical dynamical\r\nsystems. An essential characteristic of proposed work is  a synthetic\r\napproach which looks simultaneously into all three principal classes of\r\nbehavior which appear in dynamics: elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic\r\nexploring  both  similarities and contrasts among these three\r\nparadigms. Among the major goals is the identification of  new\r\nsituations where measurable  orbit structure determines differentiable\r\norbit structure.  Another part of the program builds upon PI's earler\r\nsuccesses in identifying and classifying rigidity phenomena for actions\r\nof higher--rank abelian groups, i.e. dynamical systems with\r\nmultidimensional ``time'' which displays behavior essentially different\r\nfrom the classical case.  Among other goals of the program is the\r\ndevelopment of new techniques for construction of real--analytic\r\ndynamical systems with uniform ergodic behavior including solution of\r\nthe  long--standing problems of existence of such systems near elements\r\nof periodic flows on some simple low--dimensional manifolds  based on\r\nrecent  advances in that direction .\r\n Mathematical concept of  \"rigidity\" has many facets. Its simplest and\r\nmost basic manifestations can be seen at the level just above\r\nhigh school algebra:  a small number of equations or inequalities of a\r\nspecial type may imply much larger number of equation. For example, if\r\nthe arithmetic mean on  n numbers coincides with the geometric mean\r\n(one equation) than the numbers are all equal ( n-1 equations).  \r\nAn example from the PI's earlier research  is conceptually\r\nsimilar albeit technically  much more sophisticated:  a compact\r\nsurface of negative curvature, i.e. a  bounded geometric shape where any\r\ngeodesic triangle has the sum of its angles less than 180 degrees, for\r\nwhich two numbers characterizing global and statistical volume growth\r\n(topological and metric entropy) coincide has constant negative\r\ncurvature, i.e. the sum of the angles of a geodesic triangle is\r\nuniquely determined by the area. Various aspects of rigidity appear at\r\nthe junction of several major mathematical disciplines, including\r\ndifferential geometry, the theory of Lie groups and the  theory of\r\ndynamical systems. The research program under the present grant aims at\r\nidentifying  various rigidity phenomena  both in classical dynamics\r\nwhen time is one--dimensional and for dynamical systems with\r\nmultidimensional time where such phenomena are more pronounced and\r\nprevalent.  Another central theme of the proposed research is a general\r\nclassification of dynamical phenomena into hyperbolic and partially\r\nhyperbolic (roughly \"chaotic\" in lay parlance) elliptic (stable\r\nbehavior) and parabolic (intermediate complexity accompanied  by\r\npeculiar special features).\r\n",
