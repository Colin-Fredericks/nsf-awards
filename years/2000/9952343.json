 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) In order to enhance the undergraduate curriculum, the Department of Chemistry and Physics at the university is acquiring a high field NMR. The instrument is widely used in a number of courses in the department. The acquisition of a high field NMR allows a number of the current laboratories to be more educational and informative for the students, as well as making possible the introduction of a number of new experiments. The NMR spectrometer is used in organic chemistry, instrumental analysis, inorganic chemistry, honors general chemistry, and in several upper level chemistry courses (physical chemistry, biochemistry, and advanced organic chemistry). Undergraduate research students also benefit from having access to a high field NMR on campus. The laboratory experiments being implemented have been adapted from a variety of sources, but primarily from the Journal of Chemical Education. Many of these published experiments have been generated from NSF supported projects. Additional sources of the adapted materials include laboratory texts (modifications and enhancements), and research articles in journals. The NMR is also used by students at nearby Coastal Georgia Community College as part of an existing program in which they visit the university and make use of instrumentation not available on their campus. An additional use of the instrument is in the university's Community Outreach Program in which high school students visit the university and carry out laboratory experiments. Excercises have been developed to introduce high school advanced placement chemistry classes to NMR, one of the most widely used pieces of scientific instrumentation.",
