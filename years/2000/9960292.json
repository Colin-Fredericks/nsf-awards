 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) sensors, specially designed and optimized for a sensitive magnetic microscope.  These miniaturized sensors, by exhibiting giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and working at ambient conditions, will enable construction of a magnetic microscope for imaging, characterizing, and investigating samples that generate minute magnetic fields at microscopic levels.  The microscope will \"see\" local field images resulting from the electrical current distribution of a Pentium chip, revealing any operational abnormality.  It will map magnetic domain structures of submicron particles.  Researchers can also use the microscope to investigate basic material properties such as superconductor flux-line structures and dynamics, biomagnetism, etc.  MTJ sensors are expected to have properties superior to spin-valves and Hall sensors.  Phase I will tackle issues critical to the microscopes development: 1) magnetic noise; 2) magnetic couplings; and 3) micromagnetics.  Phase II of this project will build a prototype of a new generation of magnetic microscope.\r\n\r\nMTJ sensors have applications in magnetic microscopy for non-invasive characterization of semiconductor chips and magnetic films and media.  They can also be applied to read/write heads in data storage, remote-sensing, automotive control, electronic navigation and compassing, and non-destuctive evaluation.",
