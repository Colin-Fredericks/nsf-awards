 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to help in construction of a multi-user experimental research facility (pole barn) at the Cornell Biological Field Station (CBFS) on Oneida Lake.  The facility will be outfitted with access to low pressure aeration, drains, ground fault electrical service, controlled temperature, natural and artificial light, natural diurnal light and temperature, experimental tanks (differing in size and volume), and walk-in environmental chambers. The new tanks will permit a range of experiments in biogeochemistry, fish bioenergetics, nutrient dynamics, and land-water interactions.\r\n\r\nThe CBFS research program includes long-term studies of Oneida Lake, a focus on large lake limnology, and the training of graduate and undergraduate students in field research.  Understanding the mechanisms driving the long-term patterns documented for Oneida Lake can frequently be approached in experiments conducted in relatively small-scale facilities, where controls and suitable replicates can be employed. Historically, CBFS has had a strong field orientation and this award will provide the station with the capability to adequately test mechanisms hypothesized from field observations.\r\n\r\n",
