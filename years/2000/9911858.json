The researchers will be undertaking a study of ion molecule/surface scattering with emphasis on orientation effects.   The understanding of inelastic effects in the scattering of ions against surfaces represent a challenging interdisciplinary problem of importance both in scientific and technological applications.   The objective of the research is to increase the understanding of the collision dynamics of ions/atoms/molecules with surfaces in the energy range 100 eV to 10 keV.  This represents a complex problem where it is essential to employ an accurate description of the scattered molecules, the microscopic properties of surfaces, the physics and chemistry of chemisorption as well as the physics of collisions. \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  The U.S. researchers' expertise is in the area of surface physics and molecular chemistry and the Japanese have expertise in ion-atom scattering in the gas phase.  The results of the research will be of considerable importance for a large number of experimental groups that use ion-surface scattering as an experimental probe of surface electronic and geometric structure.  The theory developed can directly be used to interpret experimental data and to deduce microscopic information of surfaces.  Also, these scattering phenomena have applications in fusion plasma interaction with the walls of confinement, surface property measurement technology, and the microelectronic industry.  The project advances international human resources through the participation of a postdoc.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.   Results of the research will be published in scientific journals and also on their Web site (http://juktan.rice.edu).\r\n9911858\r\nNordlander\r\n\r\nThis award supports a three year collaborative research project between Professor Peter Nordlander of Rice University in Texas and Professor Mineo Kimura of Yamaguchi  University in Japan.
