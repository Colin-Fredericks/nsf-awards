The co-organizers are Professors Theofanis Theofanous at the University of California, Santa Barbara and Professor Yochiro Matsumoto at the University of Tokyo in Japan.  Multiphase flows are ubiquitous in science, engineering and the environment.  Yet, the practice of the subject has remained largely empirical, hindering predictive capability, and hence the discovering of new applications of the enhancing of existing industrial processes.  Some strides have been made in the past five years that demonstrate the potential of the field, both as a scientific discipline, as well as in significantly impacting practice.  The goal of the seminar is to expand, refine and coordinate efforts in this area.  The topics to be discussed are:  1) survey of research subjects in multiphase flow, with emphasis on emerging applications;  2) approach for, and field equations;  3) turbulence in multiphase flows;  4) multiscale treatment of complex interactions, computational fluid dynamics (CFD);  5) integrated strategies for research;  and  6) specific future research directions and multiphase flow education.\r\n\r\nRecently realized capabilities in experimental techniques and computational power are making possible more comprehensive approaches, with modeling anchored strongly on basic physics, which for multiphase flows often occur at the microscopic, detailed level.  Such approaches being more fundamentally based are expected to allow a much wider scope in modeling, eventually becoming truly predictive.  The key is integration across the different scales to the macroscopic level needed in practice.  The Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  It is expected that information on proceedings of the meeting will be available in then \"International Journal of Nuclear Engineering and D\r\n",
