 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Collaborative Research Activities in Environmental Molecular Science (CRAEMS) Award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is supported by the Special Projects Office in the Chemistry Division.  This award supports the studies Timothy Eglinton, John Hayes, and Christopher Reddy at the Institute to determine natural and introduced isotopic labels carried by specific contaminants such as hydrocarbons and chlorinated organics, and to trace their passage into macromolecular environmental organic matrices, such as humic and fulvic substances.  In addition, they examine the bioavailability of organically bound contaminants and determine the long-term fate of these compounds compared with their free, unbound counterparts. Carbon-14 measurements, in tandem with 13C-, 2H-, and 15N- labeling techniques, are used to detect pollutants and their metabolites in impacted sediments and soils and to follow the carbon into biological pools. Isotopic labels are tracked by both NMR and mass spectrometric techniques in both laboratory incubation and field studies of contaminated sites. In addition to providing new insights into molecular-level processes, this work aims  to develop new molecular-isotopic tools to study environmental problems. Support is also provided for Michael Freitas at Ohio State University through a subaward.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the mechanisms that control binding and release of contaminants into the environment is of critical importance to human health. These studies are designed to develop a quantitative understanding of the fate of a range of semi-volatile pollutants sequestered in complex environmental matrices. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
