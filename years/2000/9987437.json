This theory takes place within the context of descriptive set\r\ntheory, which provides the basic underlying concepts and methods. On the\r\nother hand, in view of the broad scope of this theory, there are natural\r\ninteractions with other areas of logic and mathematics, such as model\r\ntheory, recursion theory, the theory of topological and transformation\r\ngroups, topological dynamics, ergodic theory, and operator algebras.\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental questions that arises in many areas of mathematics is\r\nthat of classifying a given collection of objects that is being studied in\r\nsome particular field. This amounts to providing a \"catalog\" or \"listing\" of\r\nthese objects, in principle not unlike that of cataloging species in biology\r\nor stars and galaxies in astronomy. If such a classification is possible,\r\none has a \"complete\" understanding of the mathematical structures involved.\r\nOtherwise a more or less \"chaotic\" behavior is expected. It is thus very\r\nimportant to understand under what circumstances a classification is\r\npossible. This difficult foundational question is further complicated by the\r\nfact that what constitutes an acceptable classification is very much\r\ndependent on the particular field of mathematics studied, so the criteria\r\nfor a \"good\" classification in one area might not be appropriate in another.\r\nAt its basic level, this project aims to develop a general quantitative\r\ntheory, which in many situations can precisely measure the complexity of a\r\nclassification problem and thus provide objective means by which one can\r\ndecide, in any given field, whether a satisfactory classification of the\r\nobjects in question is possible. This is achieved by associating with each\r\ncollection of objects to be classified an appropriate concept of \"magnitude\"\r\nor \"size\", which in a precise sense measures the difficulty of its\r\nclassification problem. This new theory of \"magnitude\" is investigated in\r\nthis project.\r\n",
