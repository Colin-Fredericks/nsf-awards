 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for Granville's proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award will support the research of the investigator and several\r\ngraduate students on various topics in number theory.  In the last few years \r\nthe investigator, in collaboration with Soundararajan, has been revisiting \r\nthe central topic of mean values of multiplicative functions, and strengthening known results as well as adding several new perspectives. In particular they \r\nhave shown that such questions are in some sense equivalent to problems about \r\nintegral delay equations. Granville proposes continuing this work, particularly looking at the range of values taken and to solve some thorny optimization \r\nproblems.  This, in turn, should give new results on known problems about \r\nvalues of (Dirichlet and Hasse-Weil) L-functions at 1, bounds on least\r\nmth power residues, and perhaps even distribution of zeros of L-functions.\r\nThe investigator also proposes continuing his work, with Stark, on the \r\nconnection between the abc-conjecture and Siegel zeros: On the one hand, \r\nlooking further at Diophantine equations satisfied by modular functions;\r\non the other hand, with Tucker, looking at whether the unproved abc-conjecture \r\ncan be replaced by a weaker but feasibly provable hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigator, with collaborators, is looking at the finer aspects of the\r\ndistribution of multiplicative functions. The functions turn up in many \r\ndifferent areas in mathematics, physics and cryptography.\r\nThe investigator recently showed how an understanding of such questions\r\nis closely related to the seemingly unrelated area of `integral delay \r\nequations'' which are analyzed extensively in understanding how\r\nvarious biological mechanisms work. Thus results and conjectures \r\nabout mean values of multiplicative functions can be ``translated'' into\r\nresults and conjectures about integral delay equations, so that the \r\nperspectives of one field can be brought to bear on the other, and vice-versa.\r\nThis has already led to some new results and fresh questions in integral-delay\r\nequations, and the investigator has been asked to present his ideas in a \r\nseries of lectures at a major conference in that area, to stimulate further\r\ninteraction. In addition the investigator has been working with students, \r\nparticularly from the Deep South, to get their PhDs, and obtain good positions \r\nin research, education, industry and government, with a training that will help \r\nthem bring a fresh perspective to their future professions. This group was\r\nrecently ranked tenth in the US.\r\n\r\n",
