In-situ techniques for analyzing polymer degradation will have applications in polymer storage systems for chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and bioproducts, as well as the development of advanced energy storage systems such as polymer batteries and fuel cells. The techniques will be based on the development of a new class of polymers that have both electrochemical and electromechanical coupling.  The polymers will be fabricated with a Selective Laser Sintering technique that allows us to manufacture polymer membranes with alternating layers of electrochemically active and electromechanically active material.  The hypothesis of this research is that electrochemical properties of polymer materials can be inferred from measurements of critical electromechanical parameters, such as the glass transition temperature.  The work plans include (1) Developing electromechanical and electrochemical models of the polymer membranes, (2) Empirically correlating the time-temperature dependence of polymers to critical electrochemical properties such as proton conduction,(3) Developing an in-situ dynamic mechanical analysis technique using stress-strain measurements of the polymer material, and (4) Manufacturing electroactive polymer membranes using a modified Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technique.  We will apply this technique to the development of a fuel cell proton exchange membrane that incorporates electromechanical coupling.  The diagnostic technique will be tested in a 1 kWe fuel cell test system.  The significance of this research is the development of new materials and techniques for nondestructive, in-situ diagnostics of polymer systems.  This development of safe and reliable polymer storage systems will have impact in chemical, pharmaceutical, and bioproducts industry.  Advanced transportation systems that utilize efficient and low emission fuel cells will also benefit.  This research will be a collaborative effort between the Mechanical Engineering Department and the Materials Science Engineering Department at Virginia Tech. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
