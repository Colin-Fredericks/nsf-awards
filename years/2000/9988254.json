By executing\r\na software process, the quality, cost, and timeliness of software products\r\nshould improve.  While process programming languages can describe processes\r\naccurately, organizations do not execute process programs to guide process\r\nexecution.  One impediment to the adoption of process program execution is\r\nthat little attention has been paid to user interface issues.  The research\r\ninvolves developing extensions to process programming languages, developing\r\na style for more usable processes, and addressing issues of how to make a\r\nprocess program usable to both novice and experienced users.  Extensions\r\nallow re-execution of parts of a process to try alternative approaches,\r\ndynamic error handling, and customized user interfaces.  The extensions\r\nprovide more flexibility to process users.  This flexibility is balanced\r\nagainst the demands of the process to guarantee that the quality, cost, and\r\ntimeliness goals of the process are not compromised.  The research\r\ninvestigates this tradeoff, balancing the programmability of the process\r\nlanguage against the usability of the resulting processes, striving to\r\nmaintain the benefits of process programming while making their execution\r\nmore acceptable to the user community.\r\n\r\n",
