 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThe specific work described in this proposal consists of three\r\nprojects. Part I is a joint project with Juha Heinonen: A\r\ncelebrated result by Hayman and Wu says that the level sets of any\r\nRiemann mapping can not be arbitrarily long. The PI and Heinonen\r\nare analyzing the exact conditions under which this result extends\r\nto the more general case of covering maps from the unit disk onto\r\nmultiply connected domains. To this end, we explore the uniform\r\nthickness of boundaries of domains in the complex plane, a\r\ncondition that is measurably stronger than uniform perfectness.\r\nPart II is a project that consists of generalizing Jorgensen's\r\ninequality to discrete quasiconformal groups acting on the\r\nn-dimensional unit sphere. Such a generalized Jorgensen inequality\r\nwould make it possible to extend fundamental aspects of the rich\r\ntheory known in the Kleinian case to the setting of quasiconformal\r\ngroups. A natural question (with Gaven Martin) for example is:\r\nUnder what assumptions is a discrete quasiconformal group\r\nisomorphic to a Kleinian group? In part III, the PI is working on\r\nquestions concerning the dynamical action of a discrete\r\nquasiconformal group acting on the n-dimensional unit ball. A\r\nportion of this project is joint with Edward Taylor. We are\r\nexploring local properties of the Hausdorff dimension of limit\r\nsets of discrete quasiconformal groups. One of our questions is,\r\nfor example, to find the relation between the local Hausdorff\r\ndimension of the limit set and the local Poincare exponent of the\r\ngroup. Another question involves limit sets of infinite index\r\nsubgroups of discrete groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of discrete groups of Mobius transformations is\r\nespecially beautiful as it intertwines geometry, analysis, and\r\ntopology. This proposal is part of an ongoing program to study the\r\ninteraction of geometry and analysis in the setting of discrete\r\nquasiconformal groups and more generally, in geometric function\r\ntheory. The study of Kleinian groups (discrete groups of Mobius\r\ntransformations) goes back to the 18th century, when it was\r\ndeveloped by such mathematicians as Gauss, Lobachevsky, Klein, and\r\nPoincare. One of our goals is to analyze the thickness of the set\r\nof chaotic behavior of a Kleinian group (and more general sets)\r\nand to investigate under what assumptions such sets are uniformly\r\nthick. Another goal is to explore how certain analytically and\r\ngeometrically defined properties change as one enlarges the class\r\nof Kleinian groups. The enlarged class of groups that we are\r\nmainly interested in is the class of discrete quasiconformal\r\ngroups. One objective is to analyze how one can quantify the\r\nconcept of discreteness in the class of quasiconformal groups.\r\nAnother goal is to relate the conformal action of a quasiconformal\r\ngroup on the boundary of hyperbolic space to its action on\r\nhyperbolic space. Much of our work is inspired by analogous\r\nconjectures and developments in the field of hyperbolic geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
