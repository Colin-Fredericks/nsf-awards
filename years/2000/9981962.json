 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to support the activities of the Natural Disasters Roundtable of the National Research Council, National Academies.  The initial request was for $50,000 out of a total of $165,000 for the 12-month period from October 1, 1999 through September 30, 2000.  The proposal was reviewed by the panel convened by Dr. Shih Chi Liu for proposals received under the infrastructure and information Systems program in the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems.  The panel did not recommend the proposal for support, primarily because the reviewers wanted additional details on the proposed activities of the roundtable.  Subsequent to the panel review, Dr. Nelson attend the Natural Disasters Roundtable planning meeting, and Dr. Wallace me with Dr. Parker, PI for the proposal and Dr. Hamilton, Executive Director, Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources, whic will oversee the Roundtable.  Based upon those discussions, a revised proposal with a new budget of $25,000 out of a total of $165,000 for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 was submitted by the National Academies.  The revised workplan includes more specificity as to the participants in the Roundtable.  In particular, prominent engineers will be asked to serve, and the Roundtable will involve the Board on Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment of the Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems, National Research Council. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
