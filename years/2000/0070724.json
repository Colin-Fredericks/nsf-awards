 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipshitz and Robinson propose to continue their collaborative investigation\r\ninto the model theory of valued fields with analytic structure.  Classical \r\nrigid analytic geometry is based on rings of strictly convergent power series,\r\ni.e., power series convergent on products of \"closed\" discs. The proposers have \r\nintroduced new rings of power series convergent on products of \"closed\" and \r\n\"open\" discs.  These rings of separated power series share many of the \r\ndesirable algebraic properties of the smaller rings of strictly convergent \r\npower series.  In addition they are particularly well suited for model \r\ntheoretic applications. Lipshitz and Robinson propose to continue to develop \r\nthe commutative algebra of rings of separated power series and the corresponding \r\nrigid geometry in analogy to the classical case.  On the model theory side they \r\npropose to broaden their investigation to consider the model theory of \r\nnon-algebraically-closed valued fields with analytic structure and also to \r\nconsider questions of uniformity over different fields in the theory of rigid \r\nsubanalytic sets.  The methods to be employed come from model theory, \r\ncommutative algebra and algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nThe sets of points in Euclidean space over the field of real numbers defined\r\nby systems of equations and inequalities among analytic functions are called\r\nsemi-analytic sets. This class of sets is basic to analytic geometry. The\r\nprojection (i.e. the shadow) of a semi-analytic set on a lower dimensional\r\nsubspace is called subanalytic. There are more subanalytic sets than \r\nsemi-analytic sets, and their behavior is more complicated. There is a \r\nnatural interest in subanalytic sets. These are exactly the sets that can be\r\nmathematically defined from the semi-analytic sets, in the sense of formal\r\nlogic. Furthermore, real subanalytic sets arise in several branches of\r\nmathematics such as differential equations and geometry. Similar classes of \r\nsets arise naturally, for example in number theory, over fields different from \r\nthe real numbers, where the notion of distance has rather different properties. \r\nSuch fields are called non-Archimedean. The corresponding subanalytic sets, \r\nhowever, share many of the nice properties of their real cousins. Lipshitz and \r\nRobinson will continue their investigation of the properties of these non-Archimedean \r\nsubanalytic sets, using methods from mathematical logic, commutative algebra and\r\nalgebraic geometry. Having developed key elements of theory in the Non-Archimedean \r\ncase, they propose to apply their ideas to extend the classes of fields to which\r\nthese results apply.  In particular, they plan to apply ideas developed in\r\nthe non-Archimedean setting to the real case, thereby enlarging the class of\r\nreal sets whose nice geometric properties can be established by these means.\r\nSince many of the procedures used to extract geometric information about\r\nthese sets do not vary from field to field, the also plan a careful study of the\r\nnature of this uniformity.\r\n",
