The students will collaborate with faculty, postdoctoral and predoctoral research staff at TUNL, which is located on the campus of Duke University.  Founded in 1965 as a joint venture between Duke University, North Carolina State University, and The University of North Carolina at Chael Hill, TUNL is one of the largest, university based nuclear physics facility in the U.S.  Undergraduates, preferably sophomores or juniors, who have completed an introductory physics course and have completed or are taking an advanced physics course, are encouraged to apply.  Dates for the 2000 program are from Monday, June 5 until Friday, August 11th.\r\n",
