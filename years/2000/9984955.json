The future success or failure of these technologies hinges on gaining a new understanding of cells and their molecules, developing the abilities of scientists and engineers to synthesize knowledge gained through diverse perspectives and approaches, and advancing the general public's understanding of cell biology and biotechnology.  This project addresses these issues in an integrated way that incorporates new approaches to research and education.  The research component of this project will focus on the molecular mechanisms of microtubule severing, important for cell division, axonal outgrowth, and flagellar resorption.  Using state-of-the-art videomicroscopy techniques, the dynamics of individual microtubules and individual severing enzymes will be tracked for the first time.  The behavior will be compared quantitatively to computer simulation models of the fundamental biophysical mechanisms underlying microtubule severing.  In addition, optical forces will be used to mechanically deform microtubules to determine the effect of deformation on severing.  The educational component of this project will focus on providing hands-on and interactive learning experiences in cellular and molecular bioengineering.  An integrated research/educational \"Future Faculty\" program for advanced engineering undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be developed.  The development of an interactive. hands-on \"Laser Guidance of Bacteria\" experiment for the Science Museum of Minnesota will bring the results of this research project to the public.  The development of videoconferencing as a means to promote direct interaction between faculty, students, and guest experts without regard to geographical location will improve distance education.\r\n\r\n",
