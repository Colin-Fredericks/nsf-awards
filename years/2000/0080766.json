 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this focussed research group (FRG) grant is to create an integrated model for all of the steps associated with the metal alloy design process.  The approach is an integrated combination of computational and experimental materials science among six universities and four national laboratories. The selection of Ni-base alloys and alpha/beta Ti alloys as focal points for the alloy design is based on the availability of a well developed Ni-base alloy data bank that places nickel alloys on a much firmer footing than alpha/beta Ti-base alloys.  This allows a useful comparison between the ability to model the two alloy systems. The funds requested go almost entirely to student support at the participating universities, thereby providing superb educational value.  Industry has endorsed the effort with additional support from eight companies at $30K/year (and more participation is expected).  The State of Ohio will add $500,000 for the first year's funding based on the NSF support.  NSF funding is primarily from the Division of Materials Research with participation from the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems in the Engineering Directorate. \r\n%%%\r\nThe ultimate goal of this research effort is to produce an integrated set of computational tools for the development and optimization of new and existing materials to such a degree that its application will replace the need for costly experimental testing schedules.  This will permit the introduction of new materials that are characterized by an appropriate degree of maturity within a framework of reduced cost and time.\r\n",
