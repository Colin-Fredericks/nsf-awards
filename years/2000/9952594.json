 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) This project is developing a prototype robotic observatory designed for use in undergraduate astronomy laboratories. The goal is to develop an integrated system complete with software and curriculum that can be purchased 'turn-key' at reasonable cost for use in undergraduate teaching laboratories. Torus Technologies, a manufacturer of research telescopes, is participating in the development and is marketing the telescope. The educational advantage of this approach is that it allows large numbers of students to design and analyze their own astronomical observations of a wide variety of celestial objects in a scientifically meaningful manner. This is crucial in conveying the excitement and sense of discovery central to all scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe Observatory hardware consists of a 37 cm reflecting telescope, imaging camera, filters, and spectrometer housed in a compact fiberglass dome with fail-safe closure in case of power failure or weather emergency. All hardware is controlled by a central computer that can be accessed through Web browser-based software. The data analysis software and curriculum descriptions are also largely Web-based, with some native binaries built for specific platforms. The software design is optimized for speed, ease of use, and compatibility with a variety of operating systems. Curriculum materials are based on the existing astronomy laboratory curriculum at the University of Iowa, at which the pioneering Automated Telescope Facility has been used successfully for over five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
