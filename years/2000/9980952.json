 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) Large numbers of science students enroll in general physics that is taught in a conventional lecture/recitation format with high attrition, lukewarm evaluations, and faculty dissatisfaction with student learning. In contrast Rutgers' nationally recognized 120-student Extended General Physics, using cooperative learning workshops and other techniques, has shown remarkable success in reducing attrition, promoting enthusiasm, and raising the performance of at-risk students to levels comparable to that of the regular course. This project is adapting a number of cooperative learning techniques to general physics in a cost effective, sustainable fashion.\r\n\r\nThe project is making multiple changes. Topics covered are reduced; lectures are more interactive, emphasizing important concepts. Internet-based homework assignment and grading are used for a \"Just in Time\" quiz due prior to lecture (to encourage textbook reading) and pre-workshop homework. Recitations are replaced with workshops that utilize cooperative solution of more complex problems requiring synthesis of concepts and advanced problem solving skills. Labs are closely integrated with the course and shifted from a \"recipe\" format to a blend of explicit instructions and more generalized questions requiring students to make reasonable assumptions and design their own procedure. Section size is smaller. The project is adapting existing workshop and lab courseware to this new mode of instruction. Results will be disseminated in a regional conference on introductory physics.\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes are enhanced, long-term learning and improved morale. Rutgers students are highly diverse, racially and ethnically. In the current project, material are treated in a coordinated fashion from several different points of view in order to reach students with different learning styles. This approach is expected particularly to enhance the performance of minority students and women and to encourage their entry into and persistence in science-based careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
