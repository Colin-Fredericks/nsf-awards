Nanostructures are a novel family of materials that allow customized structural, electrochemical, electrical, electronic, optical, magnetic, and chemical properties.  The development of nanomaterials into useful devices and products depends in large part on the ability to characterize these materials during synthesis, processing, and device  production.  Current characterization techniques are off-line, slow, expensive, and unreliable. Synergetic Technologies, Inc. (STI) will develop an innovative on-line, reliable, information-rich and real-time device.  A precursor of the proposed system has been successfully used to characterize agglomerates of nano-sized soot monomers from combustion processes.  Tasks include accuracy assessment and characterizing a variety of individual nanopowders and their agglomerates.   STI has consulted with two leading commercial innovators in the nanomaterials area: Triton Systems and Nanomaterials Research Corporation.  These companies have great interest in STI's technology and are eager to assist them in developing a system for on-line commercial use.\r\n\r\nPhase I efforts will focus on proof-of-concept, with special emphasis directed at\r\ncharacterizing the structure of nano-powder agglomerates.\r\n\r\nPhase II will involve building and integrating a prototype unit\r\nfor on-line testing at a production facility.\r\n",
