This can be a detriment to attracting science-oriented students into the teaching profession.  The lack of opportunity to follow research also means that the science teacher is not able keep abreast of developments in the Earth Sciences.  This program will bring science teachers and research scientists together as partners to address this issue.  The program, Science Teacher and Research Scientist (StaRS), will provide the opportunity during summer break for science teachers to work in a research setting for six to eight weeks with AGU members and then to share their experiences with colleagues and students in their schools and at professional meetings.  This award is for a workshop to bring together selected teachers, scientists, teacher educators, and funders to develop an implementation plan.  The workshop will be held at AGU headquarters in Washington, D.C. to design a program with community input.  The workshop will include a plan of action for implementing a scientific research program for teachers and a report from the participants on the merits of research experiences for teachers and benefits for their students.\r\n",
