 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory meeting on the Cell Cycle is held bi-annually and is widely considered to be the most comprehensive ongoing meeting devoted exclusively to developments in the field of cell cycle control. The Cold Spring Harbor series of cell cycle meetings have been uniformly successful and have become one of the most important international forums for the discussion and criticism of progress in the cell cycle field. The 2000 meeting will highlights progress in understanding the controls of initiation of DNA replication, as well as initiation of and exit from mitosis into the succeeding cell cycle or resting state. The conference will also highlight the impact that cell cycle research has on understanding mechanisms that control cellular differentiation, programmed cell death, senescence, tumorigenesis, and transcription. The nexus between cell cycle control and these other biological processes continues to be a focus of these meetings. Platform presentations will be selected entirely from submitted abstracts, and strong emphasis will be placed upon participation by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.\r\n\r\n",
