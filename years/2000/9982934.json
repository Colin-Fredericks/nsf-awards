 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary changes in the nervous system offer a tremendous\r\nopportunity to understand the relationship between the nervous system and\r\nbehavior. When new brain structures are created, what does this do to an\r\norganism's behavior? How do these new structures interact with other\r\nportions of the nervous system? We are using\r\nthe vertebrate olfactory system (the system responsible for the sense of\r\nsmell) as a model for examining evolutionary changes in the nervous system.\r\nTo this end, we are exploring the organization of the olfactory system in\r\na variety of vertebrate animals.\r\n\tRecently, scientists have learned that receptor cells in the nose\r\nof some fishes and amphibians are connected to the a region in the base of\r\nthe forebrain, instead of to the olfactory bulbs, as is usual for these\r\ncells. The structure of this newly-discovered subsystem, the \"extra-bulbar\r\npathway,\" is poorly understood, and its function has not been investigated.\r\nIn the proposed experiments, the location of the receptor cells of the\r\nextra-bulbar pathway within the nose will be examined in adult axolotls\r\n(Ambystoma mexicanum), a salamander species that lives in water throughout\r\nits life. Single-cell electrophysiological recording methods will be used\r\nto study the odorant response properties of the receptor cells of the\r\nextra-bulbar pathway in axolotls. These experiments will allow us to\r\nexamine the function of the extra-bulbar pathway, and\r\nto test an interesting hypothesis that suggests that the extra-bulbar\r\npathway functions in detection of pheromones. Pheromones are chemicals\r\nproduced by animals that carry information to other members of the same\r\nspecies to tell them about the producer's sex or reproductive status. \r\n\tThese experiments will provide the first clear description of the\r\norganization and function of the extra-bulbar pathway. This research has\r\nimportant implications for our understanding of the ways in which odorant\r\ninformation is converted into electrical signals in olfactory receptor\r\ncells, as well as the way odorant information is processed in the olfactory\r\nbulbs, potentially shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying odor\r\nperception.\r\n\r\n",
