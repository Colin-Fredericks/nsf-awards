This work will contribute to an understanding of the drop formation mechanism in these flows by obtaining new data that can be used to test theoretical models.  The PI will perform an analysis of the data through a linear stability analysis.  The mechanism of the rate of entrainment from the liquid film plays a central role in the prediction of gas-liquid annular flow.  Currently, empirical correlations are used for these purposes.  Available data are limited primarily to air-water experiments.  In this project the PI will make a systematic experimental study of the effects of liquid viscosity on entrainment rate.  The data will be used to extend existing semi-empirical correlations; a theoretical study will also be carried out to improve the current understanding of entrainment rate.  The liquid phase will be a glycerin-water mixture so that viscosity values ranging from 1 cp to 100 cp can be obtained.  Entrainment measurements will be made with extraction and tracer techniques.  A linear stability model will be used to develop an entrainment rate expression, useful for correlating the data. This work has important practical implications for transport in two-phase flow, especially in the petrochemical industry.     \r\n",
