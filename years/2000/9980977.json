 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  This project involves the first of three phases to design and evaluate a unique non-majors general biology textbook, which integrates innovative multimedia materials and teaching strategies.  Specifically, this first stage of the project is focused on the development of the text-based material, which consists of a ten-chapter textbook including content material, critical thinking questions, and investigative activities.  Additionally, a Web page is being developed that focuses on the creation of a \"virtual course community,\" encouraging students to interact outside of class.  In correlation with the text material, faculty development materials are being collected and created.  This material includes a collection of teaching strategy suggestions for each chapter and video vignettes of these teaching strategies when feasible.  A multidisciplinary team of on-campus faculty and students will be organized to develop a full CCLI-EMD grant proposal, which will seek funds for the development and production of these and other multimedia materials.  The material is being subjected to faculty and student formative and summative review to assess the pedagogical effectiveness of the following textual configuration:  (a) first person presentation of content; (b) parallel reading (first person story-telling paralleled with traditional telling, interactive graphics and integrated critical thinking questions); (c) icon reading cues (small graphics embedded in the text); (d) \"take-home\" investigations; and (e) integrated web-based community.  Additional science education and biology colleagues are also reviewing chapters as they are developed to enhance receptivity and effectiveness. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
