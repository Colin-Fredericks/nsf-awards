 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Systems Science (40)\r\nThis project uses the hydrologic boundaries of Cape Cod to adapt and implement the strategies and lessons learned from the NSF ILI project at Truckee Meadows Community College in which a Groundwater Simulator III (GSIII) was a key element.  The students are adapting the GSIII to monitor the sensitivities associated with the Cape's sole source aquifer now threatened by the pollution discovered at the Massachusetts Military Reservation, (MMR), a SuperFund site located on Cape Cod.  Cape Cod Community College and two neighboring Massachusetts institutions have developed an education program which includes degree options, certificate programs and internships to prepare students for jobs at the MMR and other Cape locations. The GSIII gives small teams of students a rigorous, hands-on experience in science related to the impact of the Superfund site on the Cape's aquifer.\r\nScience, math and technology concepts have been introduced by examining current issues for which students have some personal context as recommended in the NSF publication, Shaping the Future, New Expectations for Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology. The equipment implemented enhances the laboratory experience for students in three courses at CCCC and complements the instrumentation acquired through a 1997 NSF ILI grant.  The plan to have small teams of students using the GSIII enables them to have frequent experience with active learning and peer group collaboration in the laboratory.  This method has been strongly encouraged by the Massachusetts Department of Education to improve students' communication and cognitive skills. The addition of the Ion Chromatograph (IC) allows upper level students to train on three different pieces of state-of- the-art instrumentation, including the Spec 20 and UV/VIS and compare the results from these different instruments.  The implementation of EPA Method 300 for the IC exposes students to relevant and accepted workplace practices.  Most laboratories on Cape Cod use the IC for groundwater and other analysis.  These powerful hands-on instrumentation experiences stimulate interest among current and prospective students and generate increased enrollment. The program has gained a reputation for state-of-the-art instrumentation training and problem solving techniques.  Assessment of student response and success with these exercises is being carefully measured.  Questionnaires assess how well the students have been prepared.  Advisory committee members review the relevance of the laboratory exercises and teaching techniques from the industry point of view.  Evaluation  activities follow the implementation guidelines described in the publication Executive Guide: Effectively Implementing the Government Performance and Results Act.  Dissemination occurs within the network of Massachusetts community colleges and nationally through the Partners in Environmental Technology Education (PETE) conferences, publications and Internet database.",
