Effects of quenched disorder and strong interactions, when present either separately or simultaneously, dominate many of the most interesting phenomena currently of interest in solid state physics.  The behavior of such systems is typically very rich, and is often not captured by standard approximations based on various \"free particle\" non-interacting models, such as Fermi-liquid theory and its perturbations.  On the other hand, there has been a tremendous development in non-perturbative techniques, which have been successfully used to solve strongly interacting systems observed in experiments.  In this grant non-perturbative techniques from conformal field theory and Bethe ansatz integrability, and in part supersymmetry, will be used to investigate electronic systems with strong interactions and strong disorder.  Topics include quantum impurity problems such as quantum dots, and localization transitions of non-interacting particles.  In addition, effects resulting from the simultaneous presence of disorder and interactions on transport and thermodynamic  properties of electronic systems will be studied using novel methods.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports theoretical research in condensed matter physics.

The behavior of such systems is typically very rich, and is often not captured by standard approximations.  This research will investigate a number of new methods to deal with these types of physical systems.  The work is of fundamental interest and, if successful, will have broad ramifications.\r\n***\r\n",
