 "awd_abstract_narration": "This career advancement award is to enable the PI to study stochastic differential systems with memory, stochastic partial differential equations under geometric constraints, and their numerical aspects. Such models arise in engineering and physical applications. \r\n\r\nThe award has several objectives:\r\n\r\nThe first objective is to offer the PI the opportunity to acquire new expertise  in differential geometry and numerical analysis. This activity will take the form of a study of the current literature on (stochastic) differential geometry, stochastic partial differential equations and stochastic numerics. The PI will consult \r\nwith leading experts in these rapidly-developing areas.  \r\n\r\nThe second objective is to introduce new techniques from  differential geometry and numerics in order to  develop a theory of stochastic systems with memory and geometric constraints. In addition to its great relevance to physical applications, it is expected that the study of infinite-dimensional stochastic systems with constraints would  lead to very interesting connections with current and fast-growing research in stochastic differential geometry. \r\n\r\nThe third objective is introduce a dynamical and differential geometric component into the existing and fast-growing theory of stochastic partial differential equations. The PI will study the ergodic theory of stochastic flows generated by  such systems.  \r\n \r\nThe fourth objective is to develop efficient algorithms  for the numerical simulation of stochastic  models with memory that arise in mechanical, control and electrical engineering, finance and economics, e.g. the \r\noption-pricing of financial securities whose evolution is governed by their past  history.\r\n\r\nThe fifth objective is to compile the results of the investigations into a graduate course targeting students majoring in mathematics, engineering and/or finance.",
