 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Stotler-Henke Associates, Inc. seeks to improve Computer Science education by developing an innovative Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) to teach computer data structures and algorithms.  Increasing class sizes and decreasing funding have led to a decline in the amount of personalized instruction available to undergraduate students.  Lack of confidence among students, especially women and minorities, deprives students of the opportunity to seek individual attention in a classroom setting.  This project seeks to address this problem by developing ILEAD, an intelligent interactive learning environment for abstract data types and algorithms, an ITS to provide students with individualized instruction in a risk-free environment.  The Phase I research objective is to design an ITS for teaching abstract data types and algorithms, and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness.  Phase I research will develop innovative techniques for representing knowledge about data structures and algorithms, for student modeling, for diagnosing a student's knowledge deficiencies, for customizing instruction based on this information, and for automatically generating remedial material.  Stotler-Henke will evaluate the effectiveness of the ITS by conducting controlled experiments with students a freshman-level course on Abstract Data Types and Algorithms.  Dr. Nell Dale, a renowned Computer Science educator, who has published a number of computer science textbooks, will serve as a consultant on the proposed effort.\r\n\r\nThe Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) proffered by Stotler-Henke has substantial commercial potential.  Colleges, high schools, and the students enrolled in introductory Computer Science classes at these institutions form a substantial market.  The system can also be used by distance learning programs and by individuals for self-education.\r\n\r\n",
