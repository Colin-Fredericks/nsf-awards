 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will establish a scholarship program that will enhance the ability of students to obtain baccalaureate degrees in computer science within four years. More specifically, the project will:\r\n\r\nEstablish a scholarship recruitment and selection process that identifies academically talented computer science majors in need of financial assistance.\r\n\r\nProvide the infrastructure support to handle 25 scholarship recipients per year. \r\n\r\nDefine academic support and mentoring activities that will foster the retention of scholarship recipients.\r\n\r\nForm alliances between the University and information technology employers and graduate schools to facilitate the placement of students.\r\n\r\nPrepare a financial plan that demonstrates how program activities will be supported when grant funds are terminated.\r\n\r\nDevelop a comprehensive assessment plan to evaluate the effectiveness of planned activities.\r\n\r\nThe University is proud to be one of the largest predominantly black institutions in the nation and is recognized for the high quality of many of its academic programs. The institution has established a 'well-defined, current, and intellectually rigorous' course of study that has produced successful computer science graduates who compete favorably with their piers from other institutions in the job-market and graduate school. The University is confident that these efforts can be enhanced considerably if additional funding is provided to implement the proposed project.\r\n",
