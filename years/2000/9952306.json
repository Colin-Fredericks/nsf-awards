 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences  (21)The view of the mathematics classroom is changing due to the availability of technological innovations such as computational and graphical software, graphing calculators, and the Internet. Much of the instructional materials development that has been done to address technology issues has focused on making the classroom more student-centered, and presenting information in a manner that fosters an intuitive understanding of concepts is a great challenge of mathematics instruction.  Good demonstrations to accompany mathematical concepts are a requirement for effective instruction\r\n\r\nThis proof-of-concept project is collecting and disseminating instructional demonstrations that colleagues and peers can use to make a positive impact on learning. Activities in which the project is engaging, and learning to coordinate, include: encouraging colleagues and peers to submit demos and ideas for demos that have made a difference in learning; processing those ideas into an attractive web-accessible format; disseminating information to the mathematics community about the availability of the collection; and evaluating the content, presentation style, and usefulness of the collection.  The target audience is both experienced and inexperienced instructors of mathematics courses across the undergraduate curriculum.  The primary theme of the project is the effective integration of technology into instruction.  In addition, the project is providing faculty development by enhancing the abilities of faculty members to adapt and introduce pedagogical methods into the learning environment. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
