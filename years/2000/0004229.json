The project addresses the use of information technology to enable new forms of student learning assessment tools and new forms of delivery of those tools. The work will be performed by a team of undergraduate students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, working at the NSF offices following a course in research methods and proposal writing at their home institution. At the conclusion of the project, the students will defend their work in a formal oral presentation to NSF personnel, WPI faculty and other representatives of the university. In addition, the students will deliver a completed final report to NSF, containing a literature review and methodology, a presentation of data with data analysis, conclusions, and recommendations.",
