 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well known that storage systems are becoming one of the biggest obstacles for many high-performance applications, due to the ever-widening speed gap between CPU and disks.  The goal of this research is to overcome the performance limitation of traditional storage systems by developing and studying novel high performance, scalable, distributed storage systems. The research in this project will develop architectures of high-performance distributed storage systems that are scalable with a number of disks, with easy-to-use Application Programming Interfaces and high resource utilization. Moreover, data placing algorithms, which can perform dynamical load balancing and performance optimization, will be studied.  To further improve the I/O performance, the project will design distributed I/O cache architectures that can significantly reduce I/O read and write cost and benefit a wide range of workloads.  Educational activities will include: developing new graduate-level courses that emphasize specially on the close interaction between computer architectures and operating systems; teaching paper reading, critical analysis and presentation skills for students; and integrating research and education.\r\n\r\n",
