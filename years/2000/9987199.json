 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project initiates the Academic Diversity in Computer Science Program at the University of Connecticut. The program provides financial and academic support to a group of talented low-income students working towards a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The students in this program also gain a significant background in a secondary discipline, either as a major or minor concentration. The program is designed to appeal to students with broad interests and works with organizations on campus to help recruit students from populations generally under-represented in Computer Science. Students are in this program for the final three years as undergraduates, and receive this scholarship support for the first two years. The program admits twenty students per year who have access to additional academic support in the form of student tutors and participation in a mentoring relationship. The Teaching and Learning Institute on campus interacts with the project to examine pedagogical issues that may arise in having a more diverse student population in the Computer Science Department.",
