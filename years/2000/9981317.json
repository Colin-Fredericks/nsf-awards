The project will investigate the advantages and difficulties of introducing non-deterministic functions into a new type of computer language known as a functional logic language.  The U.S. and German groups, both with recognized expertise in this area, have been working in parallel on different aspects of the same problem and will now have the opportunity to combine their efforts.  They expect to develop a new compiler for the language that will be robust enough for use in industry.  They also intend to develop a set of didactic examples of functional logic programming that will be used in graduate courses in this new area.  Both groups have produced results in the past that are widely recognized to be of fundamental importance in functional logic programming languages.  There remain many interesting problems to be explored in this area of research, and this collaboration will produce new solutions to some of them.\r\n",
