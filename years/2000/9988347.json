 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel Algorithms and Software for Steepest Descent Fast Multipole Method\r\n\r\nSrinivas Aluru & Shanker Balasubramaniam \r\nIowa State\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop theoretically rigorous and practically efficient parallel algorithms for the steepest descent fast multipole method (SDFMM) and to build a parallel software library for the solution of a wide variety of complex problems related to electromagnetic scattering and radiation by quasi-planar surfaces. Several important applications that can be studied with the use of this software include soil and ocean modeling, remote sensing, long range communications, applications in radio astronomy, full-wave analysis of electrical circuits and the design and analysis of antennas, diffractive optical gratings, solar cells and quantum well infrared detectors. Classical iterative integral techniques for solving such applications require quadratic work per iteration. SDFMM drastically reduces this computational complexity, to linear time, in the case of uniform distributions, by exploiting the redundancy in the classical representation of fields and the geometric structure of quasi-planar surfaces. Efficient sequential and parallel algorithms will be developed for solving non-uniform problems and for solving problems involving multiple, mutually interacting quasi-planar regions. Particular emphasis will be placed on developing distribution-independent algorithms, i.e., provably efficient algorithms for which the run-time is independent of the distribution without making any assumptions on either the range of distributions or the limited precision of computer arithmetic. Research will also be carried out in developing numerical methods that have a demonstrable order of accuracy. The software library will be written using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Validation of the software will be carried out via comparisons against experimental data as well as numerical results obtained from slower, established solvers. This is an interdisciplinary research project involving the knowledge of algorithm development, computational electromagnetics, numerical methods and parallel computing. The research will be carried out by a group of three PI's (two from Iowa State University and one from the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign), representing a mix of expertise and research interests that is vital to the success of this project. All the PIs have access to high-performance parallel computers and clusters, required for the software development and experimental validation of its practical efficiency.",
