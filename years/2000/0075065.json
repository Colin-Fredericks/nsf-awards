All of the professional development is focused on helping teachers learn to use children's mathematical thinking as a framework for engaging in inquiry.  Data sources include teachers' journal writing, formal interviews and audiotapes of both researcher-teacher interactions and teacher-teacher interactions (when the researcher is not present).  The PI and the teacher participants will all be actively engaged in gathering data about teachers' learning.  Data analysis will (a) increase understanding of differences in teacher learning across settings and (b) help identify issues related to the emergence of teachers as professional development providers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
