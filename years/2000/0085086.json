 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minneapolis Public Schools' Urban Systemic Program mission is to accelerate learning and expand opportunities so that all MPS children can achieve high standards in mathematics, science, and technology.  The Minneapolis/Minnesota Mathematics and Science-Technology Education Reform (MinnMASTER) will expand district-wide, standards-based, integrated instruction to all students in grades K-12 in mathematics, science, and technology resulting in improved student achievement in K-12 mathematics and science by all students. MPS defines high standards in terms of students meeting the requirements of the NCTM Mathematics Standards 2000, National Research Council Science Standards, Minnesota Profile of Learning, and the Minneapolis Public Schools' content grade level expectations.\r\n\r\nThe MPS-USP proposes to focus on the following:\r\n1) Staff development for teachers in:\r\n- Mathematics and science content;\r\n- Meaningful integration of mathematics, science, and technology concepts and instruction;\r\n- Pedagogy regarding mathematics, science, and technology instruction;\r\n- Understanding how children think and learn mathematics and science;\r\n- Assessment and examining student work; and\r\n- Equity issues impacting learning in mathematics, science, and technology (including an emphasis on techniques for content teachers working with English Language Learners [ELL] to increase student's academic language base and deepen their cognitive thinking skills);\r\n2) Staff development for administrators (referring to the above)\r\n3) Alignment of assessments (both classroom and district-wide) to standards-based, best practices in mathematics, science, and technology; and\r\n4) Community outreach regarding standards-based instruction in mathematics, science and technology.\r\n\r\nMPS will utilize Teachers On Special Assignment (TOSA) as well as school-based lead teachers as a first-line mechanism for sustaining classroom teachers in their support of all students engaging and succeeding in a standards-based learning environment that will lead to improved student achievement on a number of student progress indices.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
