 "awd_abstract_narration": "Space-Time Coding for Wireless Communications\r\nMichael P. Fitz and Urbashi Mitra\r\nProposal 9980616,\r\nThe Ohio State University\r\n\r\n\tThis research will extend the state of the art in channel coding for\r\nmulti-antenna communication systems.  It has recently been shown that\r\nthe capacity of a wireless communications system can be greatly\r\nincreased if multiple antennae are used both at the transmitter and the\r\nreceiver.  Furthermore, a method for achieving such gains is to\r\nintroduce controlled redundancy (coding) in the transmitted data\r\nsequence spatially as well as temporally,  which is the conventional\r\nscheme.  This area of research is still quite new and several key\r\nproblem areas need to be addressed.  For example, computationally\r\nefficient methods for finding space-time codes are necessary. \r\nTypically, the wireless channel is time-varying and it is not always\r\npossible to achieve good estimates of the channel conditions; thus\r\nevaluating the robustness of space-time codes is of value.  A related\r\nproject is to consider the interplay of space-time coding and decoding\r\nmethods with algorithms designed to estimate the channel and other key\r\ncommunication parameters.  Turbo codes have recently emerged as\r\npowerful codes for achieving near Shannon capacity, thus space-time\r\ngeneralizations of such codes will be studied.  Finally, much of the\r\ncurrent work on space-time coding is for narrowband time division\r\nmultiple access systems, thus we shall consider space-time code design\r\nand decoder design for wideband code-division multiple-access systems\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\tThe first research thrust will focus on the development and analysis\r\nof improved search techniques for space-time trellis codes.  Current \r\nmethods for searching the distance spectrum of space-time trellis codes \r\ncan be computationally expensive.  Methods for reducing the size of the \r\nerror state trellis coupled with reduced complexity trellis search schemes\r\nwill be explored. The next focus is on evaluating the robustness of space-time\r\ncodes under realistic channel conditions.  In addition, space-time coding \r\nfor parametric channels will be considered.  Thus, constrained channel \r\nuncertainty will exist and code designs for such scenarios will be developed.\r\nThe third research focus will be on space-time turbo codes as one method to \r\nachieve robustness to a variety of channel conditions.  The random--like \r\nstructure of turbo coded schemes hold some promise of mitigating the possible \r\ninteractions between the code structure and the channel characteristics.\r\nSpace-time code designs for CDMA channels will be investigated in the \r\nfourth research thrust.  CDMA signals have a larger dimensionality and\r\nthus the space-time code design is different from that for single-user \r\nsystems.  In addition, CDMA signals in a multipath channel will result \r\nin different optimal code designs. The final research topic will consider \r\nreceiver designs in the context of space-time coding.  That is, channel \r\nestimation and synchronization for space-time coding and modulation will\r\nbe investigated.  Algorithms which exploit the properties of space-time\r\ncodes will be designed.  In addition, the performance dependence on accurate\r\nchannel estimates and synchronization will be analyzed.\r\n",
