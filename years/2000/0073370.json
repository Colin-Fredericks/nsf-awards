The Conference will feature topics covering many fields in nonlinear dynamics, ranging from fluid and geotrophic flows, to chemical patterns, to biophysics, fracture, and dynamics of granular media. Speakers will discuss both theoretical and experimental aspects of their research, and provide an overview of the profound changes in understanding the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems that have taken place as a result of research pursued by Professsor Harry L. Swinney and his associates, beginning in the 1970's. \r\n%%%\r\nThis award provides partial support for the Nonlinear Dynamics and Pattern Formation Conference in Austin, Texas, June 4-6, 2000. The Conference will discuss research related to the work of Professor Harry L. Swinney, who has recently celebrated his 60th birthday. Dr. Swinney pioneered the study of complex dynamics and chaos in physical and chemical systems far from equilibrium in the early 70's and has been director of the award-winning, internationally-recognized Center for Nonlinear Dynamics at the University of Texas for more than 20 years.  Invited speakers at the conference are leading researchers from the many fields of physics that Dr. Swinney has influenced.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
