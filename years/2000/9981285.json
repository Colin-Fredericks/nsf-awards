An LDV probe will be developed to measure one component of the time- and space-resolved vorticity vector in a classical or quantum fluid.  The project will build a compact and robust fiber-optic probe consisting of four sets of optical fibers and couplers, which can simultaneously measure different velocity components of four closely spaced locations in the flow. The vorticity probe will be very much like commercial fiber-optic LDV probe and has all their advantages. The new scheme will have the important additional advantages of high spatial resolution, fast temporal response, and ease of use. The probe will be non intrusive and should be capable of measuring the flow vorticity with a spatial resolution down to 5 mm. The project, if successful, might be commercialized and could have a significant impact on the study of turbulence phenomena. The high-risk, high-payoff project offers excellent training opportunities for students and involves state-of-the-art instrumentation in the area of the physics of turbulence.\r\n%%%\r\nThis SGER project from an EPSCoR state will develop a new fiber optic technique to measure the vorticity, or whirlpools, that arise in fluids because of turbulent motion.
