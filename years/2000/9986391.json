 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the process of cell-fate determination is fundamental to understanding the ontogeny of an organism.  The long term goal of this project is to understand how cell-fate decisions are made and coordinated on the developing plant epidermis.  During the process of Arabidopsis leaf development, plant protodermal cells must pass through a limited number of switch points on the way to a mature tissue system.  One of those switches determines whether a cell will become a trichome (hair) cell.  In Arabidopsis thaliana, genetic studies indicate important roles for TTG1, GL1 and GL3 in regulating this cell-fate decision.\r\n\tRecent preliminary work has determined that GL3 encodes a basic-Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) myc-type protein with homology to the anthocyanin regulator, R, from maize.  Much like R overexpression, GL3 overexpression leads to supernumerary trichome production in wild type plants and it will suppress mutations in TTG1, a WD40 repeat containing protein.  However, unlike R, GL3 is a weak suppressor of the trichome defect indicating that GL3 normally requires TTG1 for full functionality.  Also like R, GL3 will interact with GL1, a myb-type protein, in transgenic plants overexpressing both.  Yeast 2-hybrid studies indicate that GL3 interacts with GL1 through its amino region outside of the bHLH domain and that GL3 interacts with TTG1 through a separate amino region domain. However, GL1 does not interact with TTG1.  GL3 can also homodimerize and heterodimerize with other bHLH proteins through the bHLH region.\r\n\tIn order to test hypotheses about how protein-protein interactions uncovered in the 2-hybrid analysis may mediate the regulation of GL3 by TTG1, further work will focus on defining the expression patterns and subcellular locations of TTG1 and GL3 in wild type and mutant plants.\r\n\tWhile the ttg1-1 and gl1-1 mutations are almost completely devoid of trichomes, the gl3 mutations make fewer trichomes than wild type that are less well developed.  In addition to GL3, there is at least one other highly homologous bHLH gene in Arabidopsis that is able to suppress ttg1 when overexpressed and make the same interactions as GL3.  Genetic experiments will be employed to try to determine whether GL3 is a partially redundant locus or that the gl3 mutations are not null.\r\n\tThe understanding of how cell-fate decisions are regulated is fundamental to the understanding of development in general and the present studies will add to the rapidly expanding knowledge-base in this area.\r\n",
