 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (31), (21), (59), (35) The college is located in an area which has seen an influx of minority immigration over the last decade. In addition, the area's technology-driven manufacturing base and the need for a well-educated workforce are on the increase. To enable and expand the participation of the area population in higher education, the college is initiating a scholarship project for low-income, academically talented students seeking the high-tech skills for today's workplace. Recruitment efforts concentrate on students from the twenty-five school districts in Western Arkansas and two Oklahoma counties that make up the college's service area. Efforts target those demographic groups currently under-represented on campus as well as students currently enrolled in selected disciplines.\r\n\r\nFull-time students intent on completing associate degrees in engineering, mathematics, computer science, and computer technology receive up to $2500 per year in financial aid. Recipients also benefit from a project design that seeks to increase retention from recruitment to graduation or placement by providing dedicated services that focus on mastering skills and features customized advising, mentoring, and work based experiences.\r\n\r\nThis project is designed to improve education for students by teaching critical thinking, time management, note taking, teamwork, listening and speaking skills, as well as technical writing and other academic skills. Recipients also strengthen relationships with area businesses by participating in various workplace experiences designed to increase their insight into the world of work and promote professional development.\r\n\r\n",
