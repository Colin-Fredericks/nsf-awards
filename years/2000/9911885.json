Each of these teachers will mentor at least four of their peers for a minimum of 60 hours.  The summer experience includes 3-weeks in an industrial internship at Peavey Electronics.  A fourth week will be spent at Mississippi State where the teachers receive heop with the transfer to the classroom component.  A 3-day work experience in a local industry (local to the teacher's place of employment), and academic year follow-up sessions follow this. The content sessions are concurrent with and interspersed with the the internship at Peavey Electronics.  The sessions include work with the SCANS report.  They are delivered using the industrial model of just-in-time-learning.  The workplace mentors are engineers, scientists and workers at Peavey Electronics as well as university faculty, scientists, and highly qualified teachers.  Teachers will ideally participate as teams from the same school.  The ideal team has a science, mathematics and a technology education teacher. To ensure participation from districts with limited resources and a high minority enrollment, a commitment has been made by two such school districts to participate in the project.  Five teachers from each district will participate.\r\n",
