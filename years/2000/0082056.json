 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of numerical robustness and geometric consistency is well known\r\nin many areas of computational science. The issue is that inexact computer arith-\r\nmetic leads to incorrect and inconsistent geometric conclusions (for example, is a\r\npoint inside or outside a triangle). While computers are getting faster, software\r\nis not getting more robust. Indeed, the trend is towards more nonrobustness. We\r\npropose a new computational paradigm to reverse this trend.\r\n\r\nRobustness is often seen as an all-or-nothing proposition. Our new paradigm\r\nconsists in viewing robustness as a computational resource, to be traded off against\r\nother resources such as speed. Each program defines a certain robustness-speed\r\ntrade-off curve; we want to be able to run the program at any point along this\r\ncurve. This proposal will develop the technology to make this capability effcient\r\nand easily accessible to all programmers. As a result, any programmer can produce\r\nnearly ordinary C/C++ code which can be run robustly. The implications of this\r\nparadigm are wide ranging, and will bring the fruits of robustness research into\r\nmainstream computing.\r\nWe propose to (1) conduct basic research to support this new computing\r\nparadigm, (2) to create the technology and software tools to achieve this paradigm,\r\nand (3) to explore the applications of fast and usually robust algorithms in algo-\r\nrithm design. For (1), we will focus on effciency issues such as novel root bounds,\r\nincremental computation, guaranteed absolute precision for elementary functions.\r\nFor (2), we expect to significantly extend the power, efficiency and usability of our\r\nCore Library and include capabilities such as symbolic perturbation. Finally an\r\nexample of (3) concerns the general problem of checking of geometric structures and\r\ntheir applications in new efficient geometric algorithms.\r\nWe propose to apply our robustness techniques and software to two significant\r\napplications in which nonrobustness problems are well-known:\r\n\r\n* Mesh Generation: we will construct the first fully robust mesh generator which\r\nwill be deployed in a major ow solver system, Cart3d.\r\n\r\n* Geometric Modeling: we will build a robust geometric modeler which will be\r\nthe first such system that is precision-sensitive.\r\n\r\nThis proposal involves international collaboration with Professor Mehlhorn's\r\nAlgorithms and Complexity Group at the Max-Planck Institute of Computer Sci-\r\nence in Germany. Our domestic collaborator are Michael Aftosmis from NASA\r\nAmes Research Center (on mesh generation) and Shankar Krishnan from AT&T\r\nResearch Laboratories (on geometric modeling).",
