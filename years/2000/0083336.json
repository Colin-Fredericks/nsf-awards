The Center joins research faculty in scientific disciplines with research faculty in education to address the critical issues of teaching and learning in science in grades 7-12.  Typically discrete strands of scientific research, educational research, and information technology are woven into a more seamless and aligned infrastructure with a national mission.  The partnership includes universities, community colleges, research centers, museums, state education agencies, and the mathematics and science teachers in NSF-funded systemic initiatives in Texas. \r\n\r\nThe Center provides research-rich professional development experiences for 700 grades 7-12 teachers and the education of approximately 60 professional development specialists with the capacity for national leadership.  The research objectives focus on the impact of information technologies on (1) how science is done, (2) how science is taught and learned, (3) how the processes and products of learning science can be assessed and (4) how a network can involve 7-12 teachers and their students in a community of scholarship.  The activities and outreach efforts of the Center are conducted through interdisciplinary research teams, consisting of university faculty, doctoral and master's students, and master teachers working with Texas districts involved in systemic reform.  These teams work on research and development that introduce modern science methods and integrate information technologies into the teaching of science.  The outcomes of the project include science education/technology specialists, increased district capacity for and delivery of teacher enhancement, and research on the effective uses of information technologies in science education.\r\n\r\n",
