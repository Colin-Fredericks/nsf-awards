 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor David Crich, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for his studies of free radical chain reactions.  Development of selenol catalyzed stannane mediated chain reactions allows the trapping, before opening, of cyclopropylcarbinyl radicals.  In order to facilitate purification following this type of catalysis, Professor Crich is preparing and testing new selenols for use in fluorous phases.  The efficient trapping of cyclohexadienyl radicals by catalytic quantities of selenols provides entry to illustrative target molecules, while the introduction of stereochemical probes is leading to both a mechanistic understanding and synthetic applications of the vicinal nucleophilic substitution reaction.  In the course of these studies, Professor Crich is developing new low-temperature initiators for free radical chain reactions.\r\n\r\nAlthough molecular species with an unpaired electron (\"free radicals\") have long been known, it is only comparatively recently that these intrinsically reactive species have been found to be sufficiently controllable to allow their use in the selective synthesis of desired organic molecules.  With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor David Crich, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is developing new methods for the generation of free radicals and for their use in organic synthesis.  His studies are also extending the potential of free radical chemistry to lower temperature processes and to newly-developed \"fluorous phase\" solvents, offering promise for simple and environmentally benign separation and processing steps.",
