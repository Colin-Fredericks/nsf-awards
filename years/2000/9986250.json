 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to discover how chemical\r\nsimilarities and differences among plants have influenced associations\r\nbetween plants and the insects that feed on them.  Most plant-feeding\r\ninsects are specialists, feeding and laying their eggs on only a few plant\r\nspecies.  They find and identify their particular food plants largely by\r\nsmelling characteristic odors produced by the plants or by tasting\r\ncharacteristic mixtures of chemical compounds in the plant tissues or on\r\nthe plant surfaces.  Indeed, plant species that are attacked by a\r\nparticular species of insect typically share one or more kinds of unusual\r\nchemical compounds.  This suggests that the ability of insects to add new\r\nplant species to their diet is facilitated by the shared occurrence of\r\nparticular compounds.\r\n\tThe swallowtail butterflies (family Papilionidae) are used as a\r\nmodel system in this research because their classification and larval food\r\nplants are especially well known.  During the next three years, the PIs plan to\r\nconcentrate on the black swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes) and to determine\r\nwhy females of this species almost never lay their eggs on plants outside\r\nthe carrot family (Apiaceae) and yet accept a wide range of different\r\nspecies within this family.  At least in part, females identify plants on\r\nwhich to lay their eggs by detecting stimulant compounds with taste\r\nreceptors on their feet and by odor receptors in their antennae.  Several\r\nof these stimulant compounds have already been identified.  The PIs will\r\ncomplete the identification of these stimulants for the black swallowtail\r\nin three common host species, namely carrot, wild parsnip, and poison\r\nhemlock.  The PIs will then determine whether the mixtures of stimulants share\r\ncompounds in common or whether each plant is recognized by a different set\r\nof stimulant compounds.  Preferences of individual black swallowtail\r\nfemales among the three food-plant species will be compared with\r\npreferences for stimulant extracts to determine whether these are primarily\r\nresponsible for host preference among different species.  The PIs will measure\r\nvariation in the preferences of individual females and raise their progeny\r\nso that the PIs can compare the corresponding preferences of their female\r\noffspring.  These experiments will tell us whether variation among females\r\nresults, at least in part, from inherited differences in responses to\r\nchemical cues.\r\n\tDespite recent progress, mostly in Europe and Japan, remarkably\r\nlittle is known of the chemical mixtures by which insects recognize their\r\nhost plants, let alone of the genetics underlying the relevant sensory\r\nmechanisms.  This research should contribute to the basic knowledge\r\nrequired for the wise deployment of new crop varieties whose chemistry has\r\nbeen modified by genetic engineering.",
