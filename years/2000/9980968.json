 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) Undergraduate education in FT NMR theory and operation, from lower to upper level courses, presents a challenge to many institutions. This challenge is addressed in this project by adapting and implementing a consortium model previously used in an NSF supported project.  Six area colleges and universities are involved. At present, the principal investigators' site (lead institution) is the only institution in the region with ready access to this technology. This project is resulting in the first-time integration of FT NMR technology throughout five regional undergraduate chemistry programs. The FT NMR technology is distributed from a principal site via a remote access network to these five institutions with no current access to FT NMR .  This project is improving the quality and quantity of NMR activities (teaching and research) at all of the above campuses and includes improvrments in a variety of classes at all of the schools.  It is also  making undergraduate research opportunities available at a  number of sites where it was not previously possible.   Enhanced access to this technology is occuring, in part, through increased NMR sample throughput via automation using an automated sample changer. The initially available 200 MHz instrument was upgraded, at the start of the project, to one with broadband (multinuclear) and variable temperature capabilities.  New high quality, discovery-based experiments of less common NMR nuclei, and experiments of longer duration are now being adapted from other projects. Examples include the number average molecular weight of polymers, two dimensional spectra, the resolution of stereoisomers using chirotropic reagents, the determination of the molecular origins of organics using deuterium NMR, gas phase equilibria, probes of both molecular structure and dynamics, as well as organometal complexes.  Many of these experiments are derived from the chemical education literature (J. Chemical Education), while some come from the research literature.  The principal investigator serves in a managerial role, which is crucial to the effective implementation of this distributed technology. This project employs on-site training to help faculty at the remote sites receive the appropriate level of support to succeed. New courses on NMR training are being developed. A collaborative paper will be published in the undergraduate chemistry education literature as part of an evaluative report of this partnership. It will include the successes, the problems and their solutions.   The evaluation and assessment phase of this project is being facilitated by the use of two faculty from outside the chemistry departments and who have expertise in the design and measurement of student learning activities.",
