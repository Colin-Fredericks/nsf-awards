Wells       DBI# 9912036\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            This three year REU project will support undergraduates conducting research projects in molecular biosciences at the University of Arizona. Ten students per year will participate in a twelve week summer experience. A significant number of the participants will be women and/\r\nor minority students. Students from Tucson (i.e. Pima Community College ) will have the option of working year round and those from out of town will be encouraged to return to campus to work during winter and spring breaks and for multiple summers. Faculty members have a strong commitment to undergraduate research.\r\n             Students apply to the program and once selected by a faculty/alumni committee, they interview prospective faculty sponsor to determine where they will work. This insures that students work on projects of interest to them and fosters a productive working relationship among students, faculty members, and lab groups. An orientation covers laboratory and radiation safety training, and animal care and use. They participate in lab meetings, seminars, and field trips, as well as in a two-day Ethics retreat held at Biosphere II. A monthly newsletter\r\nfeaturing articles contributed by students is distributed to all participants, program alumni, and\r\nprogram faculty. Students present their experimental results at an annual poster conference. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
