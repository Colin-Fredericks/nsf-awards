 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project's objective is to provide oxide coatings that resist deterioration in a high-temperature oxidizing environment. A new, innovative process is will be developed that should form strongly-adherent, high-temperature, oxidation resistant coatings on steel alloys, iron and nickel superalloys, aluminides, and superalloy matrix composites. Using this process in Phase I, Alger Stirling Company (ASC) alpha-Al2O3 as well as ASC alpha-Al2O3/Ti2O3 protective coatings, whose coating-to-substrate bond strength was measured to be in excess of 10,000 psi, were formed on six different aluminum-containing and aluminum-and-titanium-containing alloy substrates.  Phase II testing (1) will optimize oxide thickness to provide maximum oxide/substrate bond strength, and (2) perform lifetime testing of the oxidized specimens in a high-temperature oxidizing environment. \r\n\r\nThese coatings have broad application in industry throughout the nation. Products that utilize the ASC coatings can achieve longer lifetimes because of the surface protection provided by the coatings. Such longer lifetime translate directly to user dollar savings that are, first of all, a benefit to the entire nation and, second, make the products more competitive in foreign markets. \r\n",
