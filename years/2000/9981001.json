 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary  (99)\r\nA hands-on technology-based approach to teaching epidemiology and statistics to undergraduates is made possible by the use of large national data sets, research data bases, the Internet, and appropriate software packages. Successful efforts from other institutions in the teaching of statistics using large, real-world data sets have been applied to a variety of disciplines and have been published in a variety of journals on statistical education.  These approaches are being adapted and applied to the teaching of epidemiology. An  update of the curricula and facilities enhances our largely minority students' learning and computer skills and contributes to the achievement of their goals and potential. Student interaction with meaningful, real data helps develop the facility to understand and interpret quantitative data. Real health data is obtained and analyzed using the Internet/World Wide Web and PC-based statistical software. Collaborative and active learning are integral components of the approach used in teaching.  These strategies promote greater quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills, information retention, and the development of computer skills essential for minority graduates to be competitive in the job market.  The goals of the project are 1) to develop faculty computer skills necessary to teach the new statistics and epidemiology courses; 2) to integrate computer technology into the statistics and epidemiology curricula; 3) to construct a computer laboratory for undergraduate instruction in the newly developed courses; 4) to evaluate the impact of the new curriculum and disseminate the project findings.  DUE themes of integrating technology into undergraduate education, faculty development, and diversity are key components of this project.\r\n",
