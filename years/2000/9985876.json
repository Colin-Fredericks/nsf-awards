 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary functions of the nervous system are to sense, interpret, and\r\nintegrate external and internal stimuli and to generate appropriate\r\nbehavioral responses.  The influence of external and internal stimuli on\r\nthe nervous system and behavior changes across the life span.  In\r\nparticular, puberty is a period of development during which significant\r\nneural and physiological changes result in the emergence of adult\r\nbehaviors.  Maturation of the nervous system during pubertal development\r\nresults in different responses to external and internal stimuli in\r\nadulthood.  The overall objective of this research is to understand\r\ndevelopmental events during puberty that alter the integration of external\r\nand internal stimuli within behavioral neural circuits.  \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on pubertal maturation of the neural circuit that\r\nmediates male mating behavior in the hamster.  The perception of olfactory\r\ncues from a female and the presence of circulating steroid hormones are\r\nboth obligatory for mating behavior in this species.  These sensory and\r\nhormonal stimuli activate neurons within a well-characterized neural\r\ncircuit in the adult, and the neural integration of these external and\r\ninternal cues leads to expression of mating behavior.  Previous research\r\nhas determined that olfactory stimuli and steroid hormones do not impact\r\nthe nervous system of juvenile males in the same way, and therefore mating\r\nbehavior is not expressed.  This project will investigate pubertal change\r\nin the interactions among steroid receptors and neurochemical responses to\r\nolfactory cues.  The working hypothesis is that in the adult nervous\r\nsystem, the cellular basis for the integration of sensory and hormonal\r\ninformation involves activation of progesterone receptors by\r\nneurotransmitters or neuropeptides released in response to female olfactory\r\ncues.  We hypothesize that such sensory/hormonal integration is not\r\naccomplished prior to puberty for two reasons: 1) estrogen does not induce\r\nprogesterone receptors in neurons of the hypothalamus of juvenile males;\r\nand 2) female olfactory cues do not elicit the neurotransmitter or\r\nneuropeptide responses needed for activation of the progesterone receptor\r\nin prepubertal males.  Experiments are designed to test both aspects of\r\nthis hypothesis, which is proposed to account for the inability of juvenile\r\nmales to express mating behavior.  This project will contribute to our\r\nunderstanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying pubertal maturation of\r\nthe neural integration of sensory and hormonal stimuli required for\r\nexpression of adult-typical behaviors.  \r\n",
