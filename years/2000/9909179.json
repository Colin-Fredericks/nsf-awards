Drilling near Bethany Beach, DE will provide: 1) the first detailed record of upper Miocene-Pliocene \r\n(10 - 2) Ma sequences in this region; 2)  downdip late Eocene to Pliocene sequences needed for eustatic estimates;  3) a stratigraphic reference section for the late Eocene Chesapeake Bay impact.  \r\n\r\nThis project will take advantage of an opportunity for joint funding and collaboration with the USGS by drilling a borehole on the coast near Bethany Beach, DE that will not only yield a late Eocene-Pliocene record of marine sequences, but also will provide a critical test of tectonic changes in subsidence on the Atlantic margin.  The USGS Eastern Regional Mapping Team (ERMT) drillers will continuously core a 1500-1600 ft. borehole as part of a developing cooperative project with Rutgers, NSF, and allied partners (New Jersey Geological Survey, LDEO, USGS Water Resources, CNRS (France), WHOI, Delaware and Maryland Geological Surveys).  Most direct drilling costs are already secured (USGS/NJGS/DGS);  this award only provides science support costs and minimal drilling costs to deepen the hole for the P.I.s purposes. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
