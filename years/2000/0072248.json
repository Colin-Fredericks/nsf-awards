Issues under study include graph \r\nmodels for mesoscopic band-gap materials and circuits of quantum wires, unusual spectral \r\nproperties of such materials discovered previously, effects of localized impurities in a periodic \r\nmedium, waveguiding properties of linear defects, and spectral properties of periodic materials.\r\n\r\nBAND-GAP MATERIALS have attracted considerable attention since the idea was suggested\r\nin 1987.  A photonic crystal is a low-loss dielectric material, consisting of a periodic structure of \r\nregions with different values of the dielectric constant (for example, air bubbles placed \r\nperiodically into an optically dense dielectric).  Under appropriate conditions such a material can \r\nexhibit band gaps, that is, ranges of frequencies in which electromagnetic waves cannot \r\npropagate through the material.  Acoustic, elastic, metallic, and magnetic analogs of photonic \r\ncrystals are also important, although much less studied.  Band-gap materials have impressive \r\napplications to high efficiency light sources, antennas, low threshold lasers, mirrors, optical \r\ninformation transmission lines, quantum computers, sound attenuation, heat insulation, and in \r\nmany other areas.  MESOSCOPIC SYSTEMS are extremely thin (as narrow as 2nm) surfaces \r\n(quantum walls), wires (quantum wires) or dots (quantum dots) carved out of semi-conductors or \r\nsuper-conductors. These objects enjoy a wealth of applications even more striking than the ones \r\nof band-gap materials.  This project is an investigation of the intricate mathematical problems, in \r\nmany cases similar for the two types of media, that arise in modeling the creation of these \r\nmaterials and in studying their properties.\r\n",
