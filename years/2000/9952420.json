 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nFourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (FT-NMR) is a powerful instrumental method that chemists and biochemists now use routinely for elucidating the structures of various small and large macromolecules.  This technique is not always adequately addressed in small colleges because of the expensive instrumentation required.  Traditional undergraduate textbooks have been slow to introduce this topic into the sophomore level organic chemistry course.  In order to provide students with a more adequate background and understanding of FT-NMR, the following objectives have been identified for this proposal:  (1) Introduce FT-NMR theory and offer hands-on instrumental analysis to students in the courses of sophomore organic chemistry, first semester biochemistry laboratory, instrumental analysis laboratory, and forensic science laboratory.  (2) Introduce FT-NMR concepts to talented high school students in a two-week summer lecture and lab-minicourse. (3) Increase the interest and enthusiasm of students for FT-NMR as a valuable tool for structure analysis.  To help meet these objectives the college has purchased an FT-NMR conversion package which provides a low-cost alternative FT-NMR unit in the laboratory and utilizes the magnet for an already owned Varian EM-390 NMR system.  This unit does not require an expensive maintenance contract or the ongoing cost of liquid helium and liquid nitrogen to maintain a supercooled magnet.  Both students and faculty are able to obtain their own spectra with a minimum amount of time and training.  One-step experimental setup guides allow the FT-NMR system to be up and running in a short period of time.  A variety of laboratory experiments and applications from literature are being adapted and introduced into the above courses.  As a result, students are able to understand the basic theory of FT-NMR, to collect and process their own spectra, and to interpret the spectra, thereby identifying the partial or complete structure of a given organic molecule.",
