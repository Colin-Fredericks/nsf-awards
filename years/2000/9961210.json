 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel procedure for controlling the nanostructure and orientation of carbon nanotubes within a composite fiber matrix.  This technology lends itself well to high volume production of a versatile and usable fiber form for fabricating and molding large composites with enhanced strength to weight ratios, optical and electronic properties.  Specifically, this SBIR Phase I project will investigate the ability to achieve alignment of nanotubes in polymer fibers and their contribution to the overall fiber strength.  A variety of polymers, including electrically conducting, can be used in this procedure.  This combination of achieving small composite fiber diameters (down to 1 micron), as well as the highly aligned nature of the nanotubes within the micro-fiber, has an added benefit allowing greater characterization of the average optical, electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes.  Despite the significant potential for using carbon nanotubes, successful strategies for utilizing them in composites have yet to be achieved.  This SBIR Phase I project represents an important step towards the production and commercial utilization of carbon nanotubes in composite materials and their ensuing applications.\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF THE RESEARCH\r\nThis proposal lays the foundation for fabricating carbon nanotube composite fibers that can easily be used in forming structures with significant physical and electronic properties.  These ultra strong, lightweight composite fibers can be used to revolutionize aircraft and other structures and in the process provide the U.S. with significant military and economic advantages.\r\n\r\nKEY WORDS\r\ncarbon nanotube polymer fibers composites, versatile nanostructure",
