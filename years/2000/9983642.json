 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year funding of a four year continuing award.  This proposal describes an integrated career development plan with research and educational activities centered on methods for mobile robot systems to display a basic competence in manipulation.  The approach advanced by this proposal is to equip nonholonomic mobile robots with very simple manipulators and use nonprehensile manipulation techniques to accomplish a variety of manipulation tasks.\r\n\r\nWe will initially focus on two types of manipulators:  a \"plan\" manipulator and a \"finger\" manipulator.  A single robot with one of these manipulators can push or roll an object along the ground.  Although this seems limited, a wide variety of objects can be manipulated in this manner.  With two or more such robots, a much greater variety of manipulation is possible:  objects can be lifted, reoriented, carried, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research has three main components:  generalizing existing nonprehensile manipulation strategies and developing new ones for mobile manipulators with nonholonomic motion constraints; creating a unified framework for manipulation planning that can reason about different nonprehensile manipulation strategies; and the distribution of intelligence among multiple robots in order to achieve robust cooperative manipulation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed educational activities complement the research plan.  The research will require custom-built mobile manipulators and the development of nonprehensile skills.  These activities are excellent opportunities for hands-on education, and they are well within the scope of class projects and independent studies.  There are three parts to the proposed educational activities:  engagement of undergraduates in research; development of a hands-on course covering manipulation, mobile robotics, and robot-design; and writing a text to serve as a reference for robot design and programming.\r\n",
