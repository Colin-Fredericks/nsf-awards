 "awd_abstract_narration": "Christian Collberg\r\n\r\nThis research investigates four techniques for \r\nthe intellectual property protection of software:\r\nwatermarking, fingerprinting, obfuscation, and \r\ntamper-proofing.\r\n\r\nWatermarking and fingerprinting defend against \r\nsoftware piracy by embedding a copyright notice \r\nor identification number into a program. This \r\nasserts ownership and allows tracking of copyright violators. \r\nEffective watermarks are unobtrusive, have high \r\ndata-rates, and are resilient to de-watermarking attacks.\r\n\r\nObfuscation defends against malicious\r\nreverse engineering by transforming a program into \r\nan equivalent one that is harder to analyze. \r\nEffective obfuscating transformations are\r\nsemantics-preserving, have low computational\r\noverhead, and are based on intractable problems\r\nthat prevent them from being undone.\r\n\r\nTamper-proofing causes a program to malfunction when it \r\ndetects that it has been modified. Tamper-proofing code\r\ncan be added to an application to protect a watermark\r\nfrom being removed, to prevent a virus from being added, \r\nor to ensure that the security-sensitive code of an\r\ne-commerce application has not been altered.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to implement many of \r\nthe currently known algorithms for software \r\nprotection and to construct benchmarks against \r\nwhich these techniques can be evaluated. An additional\r\nobjective is to build theoretical models that help to gain\r\na deeper understanding of the limits of intellectual \r\nproperty protection of software.\r\n",
