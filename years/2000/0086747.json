 "awd_abstract_narration": "0086747  Anderson   The objective of this research is to establish the potential for enhanced aquifer bioremediation under anaerobic conditions by means of electochemically mediated electron transfer. The research will evaluate electrochemically-based mechanisms of 1) hydrocarbon oxidation by continuous electron acceptor supply via oxidation of an added electron shuttling compound in an electrochemical cell, 2) hydrocarbon oxidation via electrochemical oxidation of naturally-occurring electron shuttling compounds within aquifer sediments and 3) hydrocarbon oxidation via direct electrode reduction by contaminant-degrading microorganisms found in contaminated aquifer sediments.  Contaminated aquifers contain naturally-occurring electron shuttling compounds suggesting that the anaerobic subsurface could function as the working compartment of an electrochemical cell.  Direct microbial reduction of the working electrode is also possible in poised electrochemical cells with an externally applied voltage.  Electrochemical cells small enough to be placed into existing wells or into aquifers directly could provide a continual source of electron acceptors for organic contaminate oxidation.  Such devices would stimulate natural attenuation processes occurring within the subsurface, while requiring low power input and minimal maintenance, and they could be configured to provide a record of current production in order to monitor degradation processes in situ. This grant is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF 00-49, New Technologies for the Environment. ***",
