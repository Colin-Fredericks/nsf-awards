 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a National Virtual Teacher Resource Center (NVTRC) that focuses on a collection of resources for two-year and four-year Colleges of Arts and Sciences and Colleges of Education faculty members who teach science and mathematics undergraduate courses. The NVTRC is a collaboration between the Ohio State University and the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse, and it expects to serve as a hub and focal point for mathematics, science, and technology undergraduate teacher education and professional development. The collection of the NVTRC focuses primarily on electronic resources including web-based text or data resources, software or video that can be downloaded via the web or other electronic means, or other emerging technology applications. A review process is being established to ensure that the resources are accurate, pedagogically effective, and that the NVTRC operates as an efficient source of quality materials. Additionally, the NVTRC staff identifies electronic materials at a level of specificity or \"granularity\" not often supported by other web searching mechanisms. Finally, a range of digital and human services are offered to users of the NVTRC including ready discovery and retrieval of materials and information about materials through effective indexing and linking, user or third-party reviews/awards linked to items in the collection, user registration for additional services such as email notification of new resources, and real and virtual reference desk services.",
