 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) By adding undergraduate research studies throughout the astronomy curriculum, this project is improving both student learning and interest. With introductory classes of 180 students, however, this addition would not be practical without automating the observing process itself. The project is therefore constructing a powerful, completely automated, imaging telescope (the URSA observing system) using off-the-shelf hardware and by modifying existing telescope control software. The low cost and simplicity of the design make it attractive to smaller undergraduate institutions, and some high schools, since both the hardware and software are totally transferable. Students in the revised classes are able to learn the nature of research by doing it themselves. Student beneficiaries include about 400 students per year, of which approximately 50% are women and 20% are minorities. The project is adapting and implementing the successful results of existing robotic telescopes used with undergraduate classes at other institutions. The results of the study will be made available to others through several avenues, including presentations at conferences, publications, and a web site. Excess observing time on the telescope is being made available to students at other universities and high schools, and the general public, via the Internet. It is anticipated that graduates who become teachers will use the URSA telescope to introduce their students to astronomical observing.\r\n",
