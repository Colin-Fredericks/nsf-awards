 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Los Rios Community College District, which consists of the three colleges of American River, Cosumnes River, and Sacramento City, is awarding at least 38 scholarships, of up to $2,500 per year, to academically talented, eligible students.\r\n\r\nThe scholarships awarded through the NSF Scholars Program is allowing students to reduce their required work hours and loan package and allowing them time to pursue the rigorous curriculum with sufficient study/tutor time and time to participate in applications oriented experiences. Some of those who are part-time students can now enroll full-time. Those who are full-time are advancing more quickly by increasing their load and/or by enhancing their performance. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Scholars Program is linked to the student support infrastructure of the Math, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) Program, which is located at each of the three Los Rios colleges. This national model provides students pursuing majors in computer science, math, engineering, or engineering technology with the student support infrastructure necessary to enhance their transferability to four-year schools and their continuance in the major. This infrastructure includes the components of recruitment, academic support and mentoring, applications oriented experiences, retention, and transfer support. Activities within these components include tutoring, faculty and student mentoring, counseling, internships, field trips and job shadowing, leadership training, technology and math/science bootcamps, enrichment programs and the opportunity to provide community service to enhance the profession. All this is done under the umbrella of the Los Rios District and the MESA Industry/Education Advisory Council. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Scholars Coordinating Committee, a 13-member committee consisting of Los Rios faculty, managers, and staff is monitoring and evaluating the program. The administrative plan includes close monitoring of a well-defined selection process and clearly defined and measurable outcomes. Reporting, as required by NSF, is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator in coordination with five other instructional deans, each having responsibility for one or more of the specified majors. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Scholars Selection Committee, a 12-member committee, with representatives from the three colleges, the three MESA programs, industry professionals and local K-12 and four-year institutions, is screening and selecting the NSF Scholars. \r\n",
