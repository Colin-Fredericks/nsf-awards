The project will create a series of five (5) guidebooks with activities that bring adults and children together in the garden to learn the mathematics inherent in the nature of gardening.  The materials and activities will teach mathematical concepts and skills, feature plants, flowers, and fruits as math manipulatives, promote active learning, and support NCTM and National Science Standards.\r\n\r\nThe guides will organize activities into clusters for various times of the year and contain appropriate activities for elementary through middle school-aged youth.  Partner organizations will coordinate a trial test.  Afterwards, the  formative evaluation will guide the revision and finally, national distribution of the guides will be in conjunction with Dale Seymour Publishers.  A national Advisory Committee of mathematicians, botanists, science educators, math educators, botanical garden staff, and leaders working in community gardens has been established.  The entire project will be evaluated at every stage of development for its ability to increase math skills, garden knowledge, and to encourage young people to engage in active, inquiry learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
