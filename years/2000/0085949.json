 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates techniques and tools for assuring software\r\nquality: finding and removing defects in software systems, as well as\r\nimproving current methodology for designing high-quality software\r\nsystems at the outset.  The project consists of both experimental\r\nand theoretical components.\r\n\r\nThe experimental effort is focused on designing and building tools to\r\nimprove the quality of Open Source software.  Open Source is\r\nattractive as a research vehicle in software quality because of the\r\ncritical role it plays in the nation's economy and precisely because\r\nit has the unique feature that it is a real-world system that is\r\ncompletely open and available for study.  Because of the Open Source\r\ntradition of incorporating useful new techniques and tools into the\r\nOpen Source environment, there is also an opportunity for direct and\r\nwidespread impact.\r\n\r\nThe foundational work in this project combines expertise in the three\r\nbranches of the discipline of the analysis of software: formal\r\nverification and theorem proving, model checking, and large-scale\r\nsoftware analysis.  These three areas have developed rapidly in recent years, seeing both significant theoretical and practical advances.  A central thesis of this project is that significant further advances are possible by bringing together these areas to work on a common set of problems.\r\n",
