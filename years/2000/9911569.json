The modules are accessible through the world-wide web, but also via CD-ROM.  Topics are Principles of Engineering; Product Development and Automation; Energy and the Environment; Communication and Information Technology; Transportation; and System Integration and Society.  The modules allow computer-assisted simulation, and are meant to supplement the more typical hands-on activities of technology teachers.  The primary pedagogic strategy is case-based learning, each case involving a real-world technology situation, such as retro-fitting the lighting system of a house to make it more energy efficient.  Manuals are prepared to guide teachers through cases.  National pilot field test sites are integral to the evaluation. \r\n\r\nThe project draws upon materials previously developed in the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program in areas such as information systems, and semi-conductor manufacturing.  The materials resonate with the emerging national Standards for Technology Education now being finalized by the International Technology Education Association (ITEA); and relate directly to technology education content and learning standards of New York's Mathematics, Science and Technology (MST) curriculum, and to Project 2061 benchmarks. \r\n",
