 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will carry out LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) research\r\nactivities related to the analysis of data from the NSF-funded Laser\r\nInterferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO).  This includes\r\nthe development and testing of algorithms and data analysis techniques\r\nto search for gravitational waves from known astrophysical\r\nsources. Since these will produce extremely weak signals, the data\r\nanalysis problem is to find these signals in a noisy data stream,\r\nwhere the statistical properties of the noise are not straightforward\r\nto characterize.  The UWM group is developing and testing data\r\nanalysis strategies and algorithms which are not adversely affected by\r\ninstrumental anomalies.  This work includes the writing of both\r\nprototype and production codes, which are then tested and compared\r\nwith other techniques. The best methods are then migrated into the\r\nLIGO Data Analysis System where they can be run on very large data\r\nsets.\r\n\r\nThis work is crucial to the success of LIGO, which is an NSF-funded\r\nproject to detect gravitational waves of astrophysical origin.  Such\r\nwaves are emitted by astrophysical sources such as coalescing pairs of\r\nbinary neutron stars, supernovae, and pulsars, but are very weak and\r\nhave never been directly observed.  This is why new and specialized\r\ntypes of data analysis methods are needed.  Direct observation would\r\nconfirm a fundamental prediction of physics -- the existence of\r\ngravitational waves -- and provide a unique tool for observing exotic\r\nastrophysical phenomena.  The two LIGO observatories are located in\r\nHanford, WA and Livingston, LA, and have been under construction since\r\n1995; they will be completed and operating sometime during 2001.",
