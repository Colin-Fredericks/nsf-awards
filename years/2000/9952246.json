 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) Linking education and research is an important national goal for the improvement of undergraduate student education in science, mathematics, engineering and technology, and this project contributes to the implementation of that goal through radio astronomy. Radio astronomy is a multidisciplinary field that combines physics with engineering, and offers exciting practical applications of concepts in physics and chemistry in the interpretation of observations of radio emission in our galaxy. This program utilizes the instrumentation resources of the MIT Haystack Observatory, which include a world-class 37-m radio telescope, a small radio telescope kit, and a web-based set of instructional materials.\r\n\r\nPilot projects, conducted and tested successfully by undergraduates using the Haystack Observatory resources, have demonstrated the educational benefits of inquiry-based, observational experiences using radio astronomy. Advances in information technology have allowed the project to offer these resources to undergraduates at all levels from non-science majors to senior physical science majors interested in challenging independent research projects. This program is also being applied to pre-college students. The project is assisting faculty at colleges to access the 37-m telescope, and use it in their classrooms and laboratory exercises as well as for special research projects. Up to 2000 telescope hours are being allocated annually to this effort. In addition, the project is providing design details and support for the construction of small radio telescopes as hands-on engineering projects, and as an introduction to radio astronomy techniques and science. Also being develop are projects and instructional materials for use at all levels of undergraduate education, and which are being disseminate through the world wide web.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
