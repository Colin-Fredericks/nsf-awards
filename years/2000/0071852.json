In\r\npart, because a 3-manifold is (roughly speaking) a mathematical object\r\nmodeled on our familiar 3-dimensional environment.  A 3-manifold has the\r\nproperty that sufficiently small subsets can be parametrized by 3\r\ncoordinates.\r\n\r\nThe problem of characterizing the geometry and topology of surfaces, i.e.,\r\nmanifolds of dimension 2, was completely answered nearly a century ago.  It\r\nwas determined that the only closed orientable connected surfaces are the\r\nsphere, torus, and the multi-holed tori.    Furthermore, such surfaces can\r\nbe given geometries of constant curvature, +1 for the sphere, 0 for the\r\ntorus, and -1 for the other surfaces.\r\n\r\nAlthough great progress has been made during the last century, the\r\nsituation for dimension-3 is not nearly so well understood.  Nevertheless a\r\nconjectural picture for the structure of 3-manifolds emerged almost 25\r\nyears ago (by Thurston) and there has been much theoretical and\r\nexperimental evidence supporting his conjecture.   The hyperbolic\r\n3-manifolds, i.e. the manifolds of constant -1 curvature, play a central\r\nrole in this picture.  In this proposal the PI in collaboration with\r\nvarious other mathematicians, plan to investigate the structure of\r\nhyperbolic manifolds and the structure of manifolds which are conjecturally\r\nhyperbolic.  In particular they will study the structure of the\r\ndiffeomorphism group of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the structure of\r\nhyperbolic 3-manifolds of low volume. They will also address whether or not\r\na closed aspherical, atoroidal, 3-manifold has a Gromov negatively curved\r\nfundamental group.  A positive resolution would imply that a 3-manifold\r\nwhich is conjecturally hyperbolic, has at least the coarse algebraic\r\nstructure of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.\r\n",
