 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is continuing support for the work of Dr. Angel E. Kaifer at the University of Miami.   Dr. Kaifer and his group carry out fundamental investigations on the interplay of electron transfer reactions and host-guest molecular recognition.   Inserting a host molecule into a guest can change the electrochemical potential of the complex; conversely, forming a host-guest complex can change the ease with which electrons can be added or removed.   The systems studied resemble redox proteins, and the proposed work may provide insights into biological electron transfer reactions.   Dr. Kaifer has been very successful in attracting minority students to work in his group.\r\n\r\nResearch during the coming period will focus on the synthesis and characterization of novel dendrimers with unsymmetrically positioned redox centers, and of cavitand building blocks for self-assembling supramolecular structures, including hexameric cavitands with large central cavities.   Cavitands are bowl-shaped macrocycles obtained from the condensation of resorcinols and aldehydes.   A combination of characterization techniques will be used including voltammetry, electrospray mass spectroscopy, dynamic laser scattering, and size-exclusion chromatography.",
