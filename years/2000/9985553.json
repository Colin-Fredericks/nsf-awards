 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the 1,2-heteroatom functionalization, in water,  of olefins, primarily with osmium and tungsten catalysts.  The resulting products of olefin oxidation will be converted to \"spring-loaded\" electrophiles that can react with a wide variety of nucleophiles, but not with water, and without the need for direction from harsh reagents or complex catalysts.  Mechanistic considerations reveal that using water as solvent should improve these processes.  \r\n\r\nWith this award in the Technology for Sustainable Environment component of the EPA/NSF Partnership for Environmental Research, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities are supporting the research of Dr. K. Barry Sharpless of the Department of Chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute. Professor Sharpless will focus his work on developing methodology for olefin oxidation reactions in water and on aqueous-phase methods for the use of oxidized products to construct useful molecules.  The work has potential impact on the pharmaceutical industry wherein highly reliable, aqueous-phase reactions should be available for the preparation of complex structures bearing biologically relevant functionality.",
