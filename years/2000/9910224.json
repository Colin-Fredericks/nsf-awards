 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the dynamics of dialect maintenance, \r\naccommodation, and change in three contrastive insular settings \r\nwhich vary in geographical location, contact dynamics, and \r\nsociohistorical circumstances.  Mainland Hyde County in coastal \r\nNorth Carolina represents a longstanding, isolated bi-racial \r\ncommunity situated within a unique dialect area--the Outer Banks. \r\n African Americans and European Americans have now lived \r\ntogether in relative isolation for almost three centuries, thus \r\nproviding an opportunity to examine the role of local dialect in the \r\nhistorical development of African American English.  Cherokee \r\nSound, located on a remote peninsula of the Abaco region of the \r\nBahamas, presents a mirror image of Hyde County--a small \r\ncommunity of  transplanted Anglo Americans who fled the United \r\nStates in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War and have lived in \r\nrelative isolation for two centuries surrounded by a majority Black \r\npopulation speaking a distinctive Bahamian English variety.  \r\nTristan da Cunha is the world's \"loneliest island,\" located in the \r\nSouth Atlantic 1500 miles from the nearest settlement.  It was \r\nsettled by a small group (75-200) of British and American whalers \r\nin early 1800s who then had virtually no contact with outside \r\ngroups for almost 150 years.  Thus, it offers a perspective on the \r\ndevelopment of language in a small community relatively free \r\nfrom external language influence.\r\n\r\nSociolinguistic data in these different settings provide an ideal \r\nempirical base for comparing the relative role of dialect \r\naccommodation and innovation in contrastive insular language \r\nsettings and for examining the dynamics of ethnolinguistic \r\naccommodation in contrastive situations.  This study will further \r\nour understanding of the fundamental principles that underlie \r\nlanguage contact, language innovation, and language maintenance.",
