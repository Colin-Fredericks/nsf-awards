 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mogilner\r\n0073828\r\n     Three mechanisms - protrusion of the lamellipodial actin\r\nnetwork, graded adhesion of the cytoskeleton to the surface, and\r\ncytoskeletal contraction - acting in concert are both necessary\r\nand sufficient to produce highly effective cell movement.  Actual\r\nrates and forces of protrusion depend on local concentrations of\r\nactin monomers and polymers and a host of actin capping,\r\nnucleation, polymerization and adhesion proteins near the cell's\r\nleading edge.  The investigator derives partial differential\r\nequations that couple the chemical kinetics of all these protein\r\nconcentrations to the model of cytoskeletal mechanics.  These\r\nequations are solved analytically and quantify molecular\r\nmechanisms of protrusion localization at the cell's leading edge\r\nand regulation of protrusion rates and forces.  Experiments\r\nsuggest that the force of the cytoskeletal contraction is myosin\r\npowered.  The investigator models the dynamics of actin filaments\r\nand myosin clusters in physical and angular space and describes\r\nthe actomyosin dynamic contraction mechanism quantitatively.\r\nUsing this description, the investigator analyzes mechanochemical\r\nfeedback loops between systems of traction, protrusion and graded\r\nadhesion within the frameworks of interactive computer models\r\nvarying in complexity.  These models are applied to migration of\r\nfish keratocyte and nematode amoeboid sperm.  Comparison of\r\ntheoretical results with experiment clarify the roles of\r\ncytoskeletal, adhesion and membrane systems in cellular movements\r\nand concepts of motility, polarizability and directionality.  The\r\nmodels allow testing of plausible scenarios of cell movements.\r\n     Migration of animal cells is a fundamentally important\r\nprocess underlying the phenomena of wound healing, morphogenesis\r\nand cancer.  Current experimental research is aimed at dissecting\r\nthe complex processes of migration into simpler phenomena that\r\ncan be more easily analyzed.  The investigator models these\r\nmotility phenomena theoretically, which will allow biologists to\r\ntest quantitatively the existing qualitative ideas.  Specifically,\r\nthe investigator examines mathematically the molecular basis and\r\nthe principles of self-organization of cell mechanics and\r\ndevelops computer models that reproduce the observed patterns of\r\ncell locomotion.  Results of the modelling will provide a new\r\ninterdisciplinary level of understanding cell movements and new\r\nmethods of predicting cell behavior in important medical and\r\ntechnological situations.\r\n",
