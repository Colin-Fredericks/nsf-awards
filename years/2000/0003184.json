The course will be held in Sao Paulo, Brazil in the early months of 2002 and will involve approximately 40 graduate students in a two-week presentation of introductory material and current research results in this rapidly developing field.  It will also include approximately 10 primary lecturers to present the basic material with additional researchers giving seminars on specialized research results. The main goal is to allow advanced graduate students to specialize in this interdisciplinary activity, which brings together physicists from previously separated subfields of high-energy particle physics and nuclear physics.  Publication of the proceedings containing the lectures and seminars will produce a useful reference work for the research community, and serve as a resource tool for the students as they advance in their careers. The interactions among students and researchers should be also helpful in laying the groundwork for future collaborations.\r\n",
