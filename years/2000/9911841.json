Each set will contain a book, a hyper-linked text CD of the \"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics\" published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) related to number sense, and three interactive CDs for use in inservice activities with accompanying activity manuals for instructors.  For grades PK-2 the focus is early number sense and addition/subtraction, for grades 3-5 the focus is multiplication and division, and for grades 6-8 the focus is fractions/decimals.  The project builds on existing, successful, face-to-face inservice with teachers; the materials will translate this inservice into a format that can be widely disseminated.  The materials are intended to be useful for both inservice and preservice education.  The materials will be field tested in university courses, LSC projects, Exxon Education Project sites, several \"virgin\" sites (where reform mathematics instruction is not already well entrenched), and an Internet site (funded by Heinemann Publishers).  It is expected the materials will be published by Heinemann, possibly in cooperation with NCTM.  Long-term use of the materials will be supported in teacher institutes through CUNY, with possible additional arrangements with Heinemann and NCTM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
