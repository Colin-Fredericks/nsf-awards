 "awd_abstract_narration": "\t\t\r\nRecent changes in the global business environment dictate the need for engineering technicians to obtain new skills in design-for-manufacturability, computer-aided design, teamwork, and communication. In addition, there is a significant workforce shortage of engineering technicians across the U.S. and particularly within the areas of Iowa and South Dakota served by this project. This project focuses on improving the way that the above topics are taught in community college manufacturing education programs. It also focuses on increasing the pool of qualified applicants to these programs. Four, flexible course modules and instructor-training materials are being developed that may be infused into a wide range of existing curricula. The modules integrate design for manufacturability, teamwork skills and computer aided-design content to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of instruction. Summative evaluation tools are being used to assess the impacts of the modules on student skills.\r\n\r\nWomen who are completing an internship in a baccalaureate program in technical training are delivering a program designed to recruit female students into manufacturing-related programs at three Midwestern community colleges. In addition, these interns are supporting community college technical instruction to supplement release time for community college instructors who are involved in this project. \r\n\r\nAn outcome of this project is larger numbers of better prepared workers that will lead to a more competitive U.S. manufacturing industry. The eventual impact on students is a heightened awareness of the interaction between design and manufacturing, and the skills to effectively operate in a team environment.\r\n\r\n",
