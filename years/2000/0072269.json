Husek's 1977 question of whether\r\ncompact spaces having a small diagonal are metrizable, J. Steprans'\r\nfifteen-year old problem concerning the existence of uncountable\r\nnon-discrete spaces which are homeomorphic to each of their uncountable\r\nsubspaces, and J. Ceder's forty year old problem of whether stratifiable\r\nspaces have a sigma-closure preserving base.  All three questions involve\r\nfundamental topological properties and constructions; they lie in the\r\nmainstream of set-theoretic topology and have been worked on by many\r\nresearchers.   The principle investigator has significant partial results\r\non all of them which answer related questions and give hope for further\r\nprogress.  In particular, he has settled the first question for countably\r\ncompact spaces, affirmatively answered a countable version of the second\r\nquestion, and with respect to the third question has obtained several\r\nimportant results including a positive answer to a closely related\r\nquestion of Ceder.    \r\n\r\nSet theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines\r\nwith common turn-of-the-century roots.  General topology provides a\r\nframework for the study of shapes, from ordinary structures in standard\r\nthree-dimensional space to much more abstract shapes, and the continuous\r\ndeformations of these shapes.  Dramatic advances in set theory and logic\r\nduring the past forty years have led to the realization that many\r\nlong-standing questions in the general topology of abstract spaces rest on\r\ncomplicated set-theoreti combinatorics and often cannot be solved\r\nassuming only the standard axioms of set theory.  Thus began a fruitful\r\ninteraction between the set theory and general topology which continues\r\ntoday.    The principle investigator's proposed problems lie within the\r\nscope of this interesting interaction.   Proposed methods of solutions to\r\nthe problems involve an interweaving of topological methods with\r\nsophisticated set theoretic tools.    Solutions to these problems would\r\ndeepen our understanding of fundamental topological properties and\r\nrelationships, and would likely require new set-theoretical and\r\ntopological techniques applicable to a variety of other problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
