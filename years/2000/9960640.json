 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I program will encompass the revolutionary ionically self-assembled monolayer (ISAM) methods of creating multifunctional thin-films monolayer by monolayer to yield self-assembled, electronically and photonically-active polymeric thin films.  F&S/Luna Innovations and research partners have demonstrated that the ISAM technique can be used to fabricate both polymer light emitting diodes and inherently noncentrosymmetric electro-optic polymer films.  Because the self-assembly technique relies inherently on polyelectrolytes, electrochromic devices become another important area of opportunity for the combination of ISAM with conducting polymers.  Such devices change their color and/or opacity when a voltage is applied.  The ISAM process allows molecular level control over the assembly of the layered structures of an electrochromic device with exceptional homogeneity and ease of processing. ISAM electrochromic thin film devices offer the potential for enhanced electrochromic contrast and increased switching speed as well as major advantages of excellent homogeneity, high thermal and chemical stability, simplicity and low-cost.  Importantly, the films can be conformally fabricated over large areas on flexible substrates.  F&S/Luna Innovations will work with optoelectronic and polymer synthesis university researchers to rapidly transition recent laboratory results to prototype device products.\r\n\r\nISAM electrochromic devices have immediate application in military and commercial areas for inexpensive, large area, flexible optical displays, smart windows, and automotive rear view mirrors and sunroofs.\r\n",
