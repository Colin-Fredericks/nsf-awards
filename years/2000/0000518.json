For several years, progress in inserting optical interconnection technology into computer systems was hindered by the relatively high cost of optoelectronic components and devices as compared to electronic devices. However, more recently, there have been significant developments in optical and optoelectronic devices, and packaging technologies, which make optical interconnection technology a viable and cost-effective option for building high bandwidth, low latency, and scalable interconnection networks.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates into the application of the recent advances in optical interconnection technology to the communication problems facing scalable parallel computing systems. The ultimate goal is the development and design of high bandwidth, low latency, and high connectivity optical interconnection networks that will not only enable parallel computing systems to be size scalable but also generation scalable. These networks will allow the system to increase in size as well as the ability to use successive, faster generations of processors in a cost-effective manner, and with minimal redesign.\r\n\r\nThe approach consists of combining the unique advantages of optical systems with architectural innovations into an integrated solution. On the architectural side, the proposed research develops crossbar-connected networks that can scale to a large number of processors yet still have close to constant network diameter, very low node degree, high bisection bandwidth, and a reasonable cost. On the technology side, implementation methods that will utilize the large bandwidth of wavelength division multiplexing, the inherent benefits of low-power, high-speed, and compact size of free-space optics, and the flexibility of optical fiber and waveguides will be investigated in order to greatly reduce network and remote memory access latencies. Each optical interconnection technology (free-space, waveguide, fiber) will be used where it is most appropriate.\r\n",
