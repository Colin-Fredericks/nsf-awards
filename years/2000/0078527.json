 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will demonstrate the\r\nenhanced performance of membrane-based gas-liquid contactors to abate SO2\r\nemissions from flue gas. SO2 present in flue gas streams leads to deforestation and\r\ndamage to crops and property as a result of its participation in the formation of acid\r\nrain. In Phase I, Compact Membrane Systems, Inc. (CMS) developed a nonporous\r\nperfluorocopolymer composite membrane designed for use in membrane-based gas\r\nliquid contactors to scrub flue gas of SO2 using an aqueous absorbent solution. This\r\nmembrane is designed to overcome the major drawbacks of conventional\r\nmicroporous supports, i.e. progressive wetting out of the microporous substrate by\r\nthe (typically) aqueous absorbent and in some instances salt precipitation at the\r\nliquid-gas interface. In addition to all the operational advantages of membrane\r\ncontactors, CMS membranes result in sustained improved SO2 removal efficiencies.\r\nDuring Phase I it was demonstrated that this membrane permeated SO2, scrubbed a\r\nflue gas simulant gas stream of SO2 as well as if not better than a conventional\r\nmicroporous membrane contactor under identical conditions, and showed no loss in\r\nperformance despite exposure to an acidified silica suspension. Phase II will scale-up\r\nthe process to employ large pilot-scale contactors, study absorbent regeneration\r\ntechnologies, demonstrate the whole process on a pilot-scale combustor, and\r\ndemonstrate that the CMS system offers better efficiencies and economics of flue gas\r\nremoval compared to existing systems.\r\n\r\nThe enhanced performance of membrane-based gas-liquid contactors to abate SO2\r\nemissions from flue gas is of considerable interest to ore processors, pulp and paper\r\nindustries, many oil and natural gas processors (particularly those which have to\r\ntreat tail gases from gas sweetening processes), power plants employing coal as a\r\nfossil fuel, etc.\r\n",
