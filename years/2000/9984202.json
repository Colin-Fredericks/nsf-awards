 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hemocyanins are giant copper-containing proteins found only in arthropods and molluscs.  Like hemoglobins, they function to transport oxygen.  Recent discoveries have shown that hemocyanins are part of a larger gene family of proteins having similar shapes but diverse functions.  Identification of four of these proteins in one crustacean makes it possible to carry out integrated studies in one species of animal.  This research is directed at understanding how the genes are expressed and how production of the proteins is coordinated during development and molting, the similarities and differences among the proteins as they have changed through time, and how the proteins are related to one another.  Neurocyanin is uniquely located in nerve cells, cryptocyanin participates in forming a new exoskeleton, phenoloxidase helps to harden the new exoskeleton after the molt, and hemocyanin provides oxygen to the respiring tissues and changes its oxygen transporting properties as the crab matures.  Dr. Terwilliger will monitor expression of these proteins through development and molting, using techniques of protein purification, messenger RNA localization, polymerase chain reaction, nucleic acid sequencing, and oxygen binding.\r\n\r\nResults of this study will provide deeper insight into how organisms regulate expression of related proteins with diverse functional roles.  The experiments will enhance understanding of how these proteins in the hemocyanin gene family participate in molting.  Basic knowledge about the effects of these proteins on molting and growth of these economically important crustaceans will have important implications to the fishery as well.\r\n",
