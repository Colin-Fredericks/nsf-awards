 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this effort is to relate the composition of acetylene plasmas to processing variables used in depositing plasma-polymerized acetylene films.  These films are then investigated as adhesives for rubber-to-metal bonding.  Plasma composition is also correlated with such film properties as adhesion, durability of adhesion, and corrosion inhibition.  Plasma-polymerized acetylene films are deposited onto steel substrates in a microwave reactor using argon or other inert gases as carrier gases.  The composition and morphology of the films are controlled through external variables such as power, pressure, monomer flow rate, and RF bias of the substrate.  Plasma composition is determined by residual gas analysis (RGA), optical emission spectroscopy (OES), and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (TOFMS).  Films are characterized using reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).  Film properties are determined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), fracture mechanics tests, and industrial test methods.\r\n\r\nThis is a collaboration involving the University of Dayton (plasma characterization), the University of Cincinnati (plasma polymerization and film characterization), the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (film properties), and the Autonomous National University of Mexico (corrosion inhibition).\r\n",
