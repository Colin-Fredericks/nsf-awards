 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) \r\n\rThe study of the basic unit of life, the cell, in undergraduate education is limited to microscopic or population based observations. The flow cytometer, an instrument that rapidly generates an 'optical fingerprint' of each cell within a population, provides a powerful new approach to the study of cells. This proposal establishes a flow cytometry teaching laboratory, provides faculty development and creates and disseminates inquiry-based curricula for a wide range of instructional environments through the training of university, community college, and present and prospective high school science teachers. In workshops, instructors will develop inquiry-based curricula and interactive workbooks to incorporate hands-on flow cytometry exercises into biology laboratories. Three levels of flow cytometry laboratory instruction are described: 1) basic cell biology and microbiology laboratories that address the principles of flow cytometry through the manipulation of cells and their environment by the students; 2) advanced biology laboratories where students will use molecular probes, cell preparation protocols, flow cytometry instrumentation and software analysis; and 3) individualized hands-on instruction and independent research projects. The high instrument cost and extensive training required in flow cytometry have limited its use in undergraduate teaching. These problems are addressed in this proposal and solved through the use of shared instrumentation, the distribution of experimental results over the Internet and training workshops. Financial responsibility is shared through collaboration between San Jose State University, BD Biosciences, the California State University Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology and the National Science Foundation. Programmatic evaluations are intended to refine flow cytometry workbooks and instruction over the funding period, and dissemination of results and materials through electronic and print media, professional meetings and workshops will lead to widespread inquiry-based instructional activities in flow cytometry. \r\n",
