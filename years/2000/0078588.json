 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the PI's transition from a traditional biostatistical research career in clinical trials,\r\ntoxicology and environmental health to statistical methods for community based research, with an emphasis on sociology and behavioral science.  The desire for this transition has arisen from the PIs involvement in\r\nseveral initiatives designed to foster diversity in the Biostatistics Department at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH).\r\n\r\nThree types of activities are proposed:\r\n\r\nPublication of a series of articles on diversity.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of working collaborations with social and behavioral scientists at the Harvard School of Public Health, with a view to generating stable funding sources to support the future efforts of Biostatistics faculty\r\nand students in these areas.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of new statisticalmethods for community based research.  Specific topics to be addressed include spatial analysis of time to event data, missing data problems especially in spatial data analysis settings, measurement error and missing data problems in multilevel modeling. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the PI is an established and relatively senior researcher with a good track record as a statistical\r\nmethodologist, the proposal meets the POWRE guidelines in two ways:\r\n\r\nIt will support the PI during a critical time in her career while she makes a transition in her research interests, learns a new area and establishes collaborations that can provide  sustainable long-term funding in this new area.   \r\n\r\nIt involves innovative ideas for integrating research and education, specifically for underrepresented minority students.\r\n\r\nThis POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
