In addition to work in the lab, students participate in weekly meetings that include technical presentations from leaders in computers and visits to local companies. These activities are done jointly with two other undergraduate research programs currently undertaken by the department under the MERIT (Maryland Engineering Research Intership Teams) pogram.  The professional d development activities consist of seminars/workshops on technical writing, oral communcations, graduate educations, academic careers, industrial   careers, and professional ethics.  At the end of the summer, representatives from indsutry serve as judges for the MERIT fair where students from the CRISP program and other similar research experience programs present the results of their research and compete against each other for the best project award.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
