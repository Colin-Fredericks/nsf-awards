 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes research to search for evidence of a masive neutron event that has been postulated to have occured in the Paleo-Indian era.  The preliminary observed anomalies are suggested to be explained by a global cosmic event involving both micrometeorites and massive neutron irradiation.  The postulate is based on preliminary measurements of the relative abundances of 235, 238U and 239Pu in archaelogically obtained artifacts.  In this work, it is porposed that core samples be collected at Michigan sites with soil undisturbed over archeological times.  The samples would then be studied my microscope (looking for micrometereoritical evidence) and by radioanalysis at LBNL (by profiling the amount of Uranium and Plutonium as a function of depth).  It is claimed that this would be the first complete radioprofile in North America and would provide a baseline measurement about cosmic-induced radioactivity.  Establishing a relation between recurrent cosmic events and mass extinction would affect a number of scientific fields.",
