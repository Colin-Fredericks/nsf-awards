 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing tools and processes for the quality control of digital learning materials, using a model based on building and sustaining communities of individual and institutional users and contributors, professional discipline organizations, and publishers of education materials. The effort leverages the work of the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT) Initiative which has a growing collection of over 2,000 digital learning materials. Over twenty higher education institutions - led by the California State University System, the University of Georgia System, the University of North Carolina System, and the University of Oklahoma System - are forming discipline communities in biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering mathematics to develop standards and processes for implementing and sustaining mechanisms for peer review of digital learning materials. Additional discipline communities are expected to form as the project evolves. Discussion, debate, and communication take place via MERLOT's web-based worksites where members of the virtual communities collaborate. Institutional participants are supporting their faculty's endeavors through stipends and/or reassigned time and travel allotments for attending the MERLOT sponsored workshops and conferences.",
