 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nUTeach is a collaboration between the Colleges of Natural Sciences and Education at The University of Texas at Austin, in conjunction with the Austin Independent School District, to improve the preparation of secondary science and mathematics teachers. Anticipating a projected steady state of 500 students, it is becoming one of the largest programs for secondary science and mathematics teacher preparation housed in a research university. The UTeach program includes extensive recruitment among students in the Colleges of Natural Sciences and Engineering and at Austin Community College, financial support for students, and revised pedagogy and content courses for prospective teachers. Project goals include: 1) expansion of guided early field experiences supervised by master teachers; 2) development of exemplary undergraduate courses that model Standards-based instruction and reform of large service courses in science and mathematics that pose particular barriers to students with weak backgrounds; 3) increased use of modern information and communications technologies in both education and subject-matter courses; and 4) attention to issues of equity, including student recruitment and support, as well as program content. While the design of the program addresses the immediate needs of the state of Texas, the project is producing a set of teacher education programs and products that can be used and replicated nationally.\r\n",
