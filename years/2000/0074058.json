 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 0074058\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate material and symbolic aspects of domestic food distribution among Samburu (Kenya) pastoralists under conditions of chronic scarcity.  Seasonal and cyclical scarcity have shaped many aspects of Samburu life, including key aspects of gender and age-based roles and identities; in recent years scarcity has increased with decline of the pastoral economy and population growth. Previous research has suggested that women and junior males suffer disproportionately during famines in pastoral societies dominated by senior males. This research hypothesizes, however, that various aspects of Samburu society, in particular the manner in which the domestic domain is female centered and the nature of Samburu gender roles and identities, mitigate the power of elders to have differential access to nutritional resources. Methods include the collection of nutritional data in collaboration with a Kenyan nutritionist, as well as a demographic/economic survey of the community, structured interviews, and the analysis of household food distribution patterns. This project will contribute to our understanding of gendered dynamics within pastoral societies and to development policy planning directed towards famine relief in various parts of the world. \r\n\r\n",
