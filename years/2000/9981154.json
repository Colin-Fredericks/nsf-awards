 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Systems Science (40) The Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer has been adapted for use with inquiry-based learning and individual research projects in the undergraduate Geology and Chemistry curricula.  Collaborative inquiry-based learning methods are adapted from successful class projects at Dartmouth University (Environmental Geology class, Dr. Xiahong Feng,  and Isotopes as Tracers in the Environmental class described in Stern, L. A., C. P. Chamberlain, J. D. Blum and M. L. Fogel, Isotopic Lessons in a Beer Bottle, J Geoscience Ed, 45, 157-161, 1997), and other institutions (Foos, A. M., Integration of a Class Research Project into a Traditional Geochemistry Lab Course, J Geoscience Ed, 45, 322-324, 1997).   In upper division Geology and Chemistry classes, students design and execute class, group, and individual projects gaining direct experience with methods of scientific inquiry.  Students identify a question of scientific merit, design and execute a sampling and analysis strategy, collect and interpret data, and present results.  The Environmental Geochemistry class has performed a class project by utilizing the ICP-MS in identifying local environmental problems involving water and soil contamination near mine sites. We are also adapting successful pedagogical models that integrate individual research projects into classes, including those of Professor Karen Harpp (Colgate University) and those based on our own experiences with the automated x-ray powder diffractometer purchased by NSF ILI Grant -DUE 9651022.  \t\r\nGeneral education students, pre-service teachers, and local high school students participate in a regional water project focusing on water quality issues.  Through this project, they have gained exposure to the processes of data collection and analysis, an experience that enhances their ability to critically understand scientific principles (e.g., Smith G. L., Using Field and Laboratory Exercises on Local Water Bodies to Teach Fundamental Concepts in an Introductory Oceanography Course, J Geoscience Ed, 43,480-484, 1995).   \t\r\nImportant curricular changes resulting from this grant include hands-on experience with the ICP-MS, collaborative student effort, multi-week experiments, more emphasis on analysis of authentic data, and an increased number of individual and group presentations.  Implementation of an inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning through use of state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation has provided opportunities for our students in critical thinking and problem-solving skills while preparing them for successful career ventures in the 21st century.",
