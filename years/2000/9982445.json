 "awd_abstract_narration": "The insect juvenile hormones (JHs) are methyl esters of farnesoic acid C10,11 epoxide (JH III), and analogous compounds.  JH is an important regulatory factor in embryogenesis, larval and adult development, metamorphosis, reproduction, and metabolism in insects.  Evidence indicates that the primary pathways of JH degradation lead to loss of endocrine function.  The two primary metabolic pathways of JH degradation in insects are ester hydrolysis by JH esterase and epoxide hydration by an epoxide hydrolase (EH).  While the development of specific inhibitors of JH esterase has been instrumental in demonstrating a biological role for this enzyme in insects, significantly less information is available on the role of JH epoxide hydrolase (JH-EH).  In this proposal, we plan to extend our knowledge of the role of JH-EH in endocrine regulation in insects.  The use of techniques in molecular biology to biosynthesize the enzyme will allow for comprehensive study of the protein, and the design of novel compounds which will act as JH-EH inhibitors will allow for evaluation of the inhibition of enzyme action on development in the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni).  The basic knowledge of EH structure, mechanism of action, and modes of inhibition gained in this study will provide a more comprehensive understanding of insect JH-EH which may ultimately lead to new methods for insect control.",
