The focus of the project is on the development of modules, course materials, courses, a delivery infrastructure, faculty enhancement workshops, and web-based data collection. Module topics include: networks and the Internet, mobile and wireless computing, network management, concepts of distributed systems, network security, performance evaluation, distributed applications, and parallel and distributed simulation. This project provides a web and CD-ROM based mechanism for distribution of modules, courses, support-software and evaluation instruments. A one-week workshop for faculty, government, and industry covering these topics will be conducted in 2002 and 2003. In addition to transferring current research in distributed systems into the undergraduate curriculum at the University of Central Florida, the project also enables three partner institutions with underrepresented student populations (Grambling State University, Florida A&M University, and the University of Houston) to actively participate in the project. The collaborating institutions are involved in development and evaluation of the instructional modules and use them in their programs either as new courses or thread the modules through existing undergraduate courses.\r\n",
