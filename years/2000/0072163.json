 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some of the most impressive recent work in dynamical systems has been \r\nan outgrowth of the study of dynamics in one complex variable. The \r\nfundamental assumption motivating this proposal is that complex \r\nmethods have an important role to play in dynamics when the number of \r\ndimensions is greater than one as well.  The subject of this proposal \r\nis a particular \"model family\" of dynamical systems, the polynomial \r\ndiffeomorphisms in two complex dimensions. The complex Henon \r\ndiffeomorphisms which are a notable special case. These are perhaps \r\nthe simplest invertible holomorphic dynamical system with interesting \r\ndynamics. One of the lessons of dynamics in one variable is that \r\nthere is a range of dynamical behaviors starting with expanding maps \r\nand continuing with Misurewicz maps, semi-hyperbolic and \r\nCollet-Eckmann maps.  The two variable analog of the expanding \r\nproperty is hyperbolicity. This proposal is focused on understanding \r\nthe two variable analog of the semi-hyperbolic condition which we \r\ncall quasi-hyperbolicity. In one variable these conditions are \r\nrelated to the recurrence properties of critical points.  In two \r\nvariables the notion of critical point needs to be replaced by other \r\nconcepts such as regularity of stable and unstable manifolds. An \r\ninteresting example of quasi-hyperbolic diffeomorphisms are real \r\npolynomial diffeomorphisms of maximal entropy such as limits of \r\nhorseshoes in the real Henon case. Though several questions about the \r\nbehavior of such diffeomorphisms have been answered in previous work \r\na number of open questions remain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the computer has increased the usefulness of \r\nsimple deterministic mathematical models in a number of sciences. An \r\nillustrative example is the logistic map which can be used to \r\ndescribe the behavior of a single insect population in successive \r\nyears. When the mathematical model is linear there is a well \r\ndeveloped underlying theory. When the model is non-linear there are \r\nimportant theoretical questions which we have not yet been able to \r\naddress. Recently mathematicians have made important breakthroughs in \r\nunderstanding the logistic map. One technique which proved essential \r\nwas the consideration of an associated complex dynamical system. My \r\nproposal addresses some of the problems of using similar complex \r\ntechniques when the system involved has dimension greater than one \r\n(for example when there are two interacting populations.)\r\n\r\n",
