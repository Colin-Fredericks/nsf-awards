It involves a variety of tasks, such as, modeling, identification, simulation, planning, decision making, and optimization.\r\n\r\nSome application areas of control and systems include transportation, manufacturing, communications, processing industries, and financial markets. The basic control systems science influences and impacts a diverse range of study, such as, biology, physics, chemistry, economics, and medicine.\r\n",
