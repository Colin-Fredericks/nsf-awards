 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Reinhold \r\nMass spectrometry (MS) coupled with methods to fragment ions is fundamental\r\nfor elucidating molecular structures in biology. Combining mass measurements\r\nwith fragmentation patterns is necessary as the bare ion mass (to arbitrary\r\nprecision) often fails to identify the ion's molecular structure. The\r\ndevelopment of ion trapping mass spectrometers (based on Paul or Penning\r\ntraps) allows multiple sequences of ion isolation and fragmentation (MSn).\r\nThese instruments allow the disassembly of complex ions into components,\r\ngenerating a nested hierarchy of fragmentation patterns. The ensemble of\r\nfragmentation patterns substantially extends what can be determined by mass\r\nspectrometry. Ideally, combining ion disassembly with knowledge of fragment\r\ndissociation patterns could allow structural understanding for almost all\r\ncomplex biomolecules, e.g., peptides, oligosaccharides, lipids, and\r\nglycoconjugates. As important as these advances have been, it is also clear\r\nthat present MS instruments fall short of the developing needs in biology.\r\nThe explosion of genome data has accelerated a shift in biology from\r\nfocusing on individual molecules and interactions into a focus where complex\r\nnetworks of interactions at the cell and organism level are studied.\r\nAddressing these demands will require MSn analyses of mixtures of complex\r\nmolecules and a major limitation of present instruments is the loss of\r\nsensitivity in such MSn analyses. Ions are lost by deliberate ejection\r\nduring the isolation of a specific component and by incidental and unwanted\r\nlosses through dynamical instability during the instrumental execution of\r\nMSn steps. The objective of the research is to develop a new technology for\r\nMSn analyses that will eliminate or substantially reduce these losses.\r\n\r\nComputer simulations of ion motion in radio frequency ion traps of a novel\r\ngeometry have suggested that it is possible to couple these devices and use\r\nthe array of coupled traps as a new type of MSn instrument. A prototype mass\r\nspectrometer consisting of a coupled series of ion traps mated to an\r\northogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer will be built. The mass\r\nselective transfer of ions between trapping regions and characterizing ion\r\ndissociation within the traps are the immediate experimental objectives.\r\n\r\nExperimental analysis of the prototype combined with computational\r\nsimulations will be used to direct future development of this class of mass\r\nspectrometers as analytical instruments. Correlating the observations with\r\nnumerical models of the device will also aid the general technology of\r\nsimulating (hence designing) gas phase ion manipulation instruments.\r\nSubstantially higher performance MSn mass spectrometry will be an important\r\ncomponent in the technologies that address the analytical challenge of\r\ngenome-era biology.\r\n\r\n",
