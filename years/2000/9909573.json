It is the 4th stage of a six-part, long-range vision and plan that focuses on comprehending science as a way of thinking and doing.  \"Making Models\" will serve over one million visitors per year, mostly families and school groups.  The models to be featured include physical, biological, conceptual, mathematical, and computer simulation models.  Four (4) specific science inquiry skills will be stressed, which are associated with making and using models:  recognition of similarities, assessment of limitations, communication of ideas, and the creation of one's own models for developing personal understanding and appreciation of the world in which we live.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with this new exhibit, some current exhibits and programs will be modified to meet these modeling goals.  Demonstrating the application of these new exhibit techniques for other museums and science centers, and evaluating how visitors learn in this setting will also be performed, with the results disseminated on a national level.\r\n\r\nThe Museum will collaborate with two (2) other nationally known sites in this development and evaluation of exhibit components, creation of new teacher development programs, and the development of models-related web resources.",
