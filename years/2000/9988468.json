 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis project is on the design, analysis, and implementation of \r\nalgorithmic techniques for solving geometric problems that arise in \r\nradiosurgery, radiation therapy, and other medical applications.  \r\nRadiosurgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that uses \r\na set of focused beams of radiation to destroy tumors.  A key step \r\nin radiotherapy and radiosurgery is to develop a treatment plan that \r\ndefines the best radiation beam arrangements and time settings to \r\ndestroy the target tumor without harming the surrounding healthy \r\ntissues.  At the core of radiation treatment planning is a set \r\nof substantially non-trivial geometric optimization problems.\r\nWe seek to investigate a number of geometric optimization \r\nproblems arising in radiation treatment planning, such as beam \r\nselection (including beam probing and its many variations), surgical \r\nnavigation and routing, sphere packing, beam shaping, image \r\nsegmentation, shape approximation, and beam source path planning.\r\nThis interdisciplinary research will draw diverse techniques from \r\ncomputational geometry and other theoretical areas, such as operations \r\nresearch and combinatorial optimization.  Furthermore, this research \r\nwill provide a rich source of problems and new challenges that prod \r\nfurther development of algorithmic techniques in these theoretical \r\nareas.  The planned research includes an important experimental \r\ncomponent.  Educational activities on course development and student \r\ntraining in the interdisciplinary area of computational medicine are \r\nalso part of the project.\r\n\r\n",
