 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most promising approaches to making video-on-demand services more competitive is to continuously broadcast the most frequently requested videos.  This research addresses three important limitations that are common to most existing broadcasting protocols for video-on-demand.\r\n\r\nA first research direction is the development of broadcasting protocols that can handle compressed videos having variable bandwidth requirements.  The performance on these new protocols will be evaluated using a representative set of videos in the MPEG-2 format used by DVD.\r\n\r\nA second research direction is the efficient implementation of interactive functions analogous to those existing on a VCR.  These functions will allow customers to pause, move backward, and move forward as if they were watching a videocassette.\r\n\r\nA third research direction is the design of broadcasting protocols that can adjust their broadcasting schedules to all observed changes in the request arrival rate.  As a result, these dynamic broadcasting protocols will perform equally well at peak hours and at hours of lower demand.\r\n\r\nAll of these broadcasting protocols will be demonstrated on a very simple testbed consisting of a single workstation broadcasting a few specific videos.\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative research project between the University of California, Santa Cruz and the University of Houston.\r\n",
