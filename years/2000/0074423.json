It will be dedicated to examining the successes and failures of projects funded by the program in particular, and of the scientific community's attempts to ducment and disseminate information on the world's biota in general.  Although the BS&I program has existed for approximately 10 years, there has never been a community-wide meeting to address shared concerns, interests, methods, or the future of such surveys in general.  Topics to be discussed include: the past, present and future of BS&I projects and the program itself; the question of large scale, long-term projects; the future of electronic data gathering and dissemination; the future of funding and partnering with other federal agencies, NGOs, and other agencies; the question of site-based biodiversity observatories; the use of biotic surveys to document the generation and maintenance of biodiversity, and other topics.",
