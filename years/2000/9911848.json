The institution has created a collaboration with neighboring state institutions (Appalachian State University and North Carolina A&T), the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction and local school districts.  The program will teach the modeling method to physics teachers, physical science teachers and technology teachers.  Altogether 356 teachers will be involved in modeling workshops and each teacher will be in the project for two summers.  A group of Master Teachers, trained during in the summer workshops, will be expected to implement the modeling method in their classrooms and, with the help of the resources on the web specifically developed for the project, will help peer teachers also implement the modeling method in their classrooms.  At the same time as the development of the on-site program for teachers, an on-line resource will be developed which will be available to teachers at the national level.  This interactive web-site will be an \"anytime, anywhere\" source of information for teachers throughout the country and will also be available to provide graduate credit for those teachers who fulfill appropriate requirements.  This site will demonstrate the modeling approach of Hestenes and demonstrate to teachers how to move students through their misconceptions of simple physics principles.  It is estimated that 150 teachers will take advantage of the credit option. \r\n\r\nMatching funds amount to 27% of the NSF award.\r\n\r\n",
