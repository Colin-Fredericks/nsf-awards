 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Environmental Molecular Science Institute (EMSI) Award to Ohio State University is supported by the Special Projects Office in the Chemistry Division, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. Patrick G. Hatcher and Samuel J. Traina supported by this award will study the role of environmental molecular interfaces on the chemical and biological activity of atmospheric, water and soil processes. This multidisciplinary program also supports sixteen other faculty members from different departments of Ohio State University.  In addition, support is also provided to Paul Davidovits (Boston College), Satish Myneni (Princeton University) and Elizabeth Guthrie (Univ. of Tennessee) through subawards. Two major technical thrusts will be studied, 1) atmospheric processes at air/water/organic interfaces and ice interfaces, and 2) interactions of pollutants with water/solid interfacial processes in soils, sediments and aquatic media. Ice core studies at molecular level will provide an understanding of past and future chemical processes. These studies will have broad impact on issues related to ecosystem impairment and degradation, and long term deleterious impact on human and natural biota. In support of the technical thrusts, is a sizable effort in the use and development of advanced analytical methods. Staff from Argonne National Laboratory will provide expertise in laser desorption mass spectrometry, x-ray absorption spectrometry, solid state and spatially-resolved Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry, and isotopic labeling studies. Industrial collaborations with Aerodyne Research on aerosol and cloud chamber chemistry, and Exxon and Ciba Specialty Chemicals on targeted contaminated sites have been established and expanded.  Outreach training programs proposed involved undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students to attract young people to careers in environmental molecular sciences.  In addition, the outreach program at Ohio State University will be coordinated with Argonne National Laboratory.\r\n   \r\nThis fundamental multidisciplinary research will advance our understanding of the role of environmental molecular interfaces on the chemical and biological activity of atmospheric, water and soil processes. The studies will also provide information at molecular level, the interactions of pollutants with water/solid interfacial processes in soils, sediments and aquatic media. The outreach programs including the web site proposed will provide training in and information about environmental molecular sciences.",
