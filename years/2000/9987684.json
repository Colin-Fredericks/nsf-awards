 "awd_abstract_narration": "ATM-9987684\r\nHolzworth\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to study middle atmosphere electrodynamics and coupling between the atmosphere and ionosphere.  From November 1992 through April 1993 one of the most extensive data sets on atmospheric electrodynamics was collected using superpressure balloons in the stratosphere.  The experiment, called ELBBO: Extended Life Balloon Borne Observatories, included vector electric field and related electrodynamic measurements, and was sponsored jointly by the National Science Foundation (grant ATM 8920428) and by NASA.  Overall the ELBBO experiment was very successful and collected high quality data from five payloads, and included record breaking flight duration at this altitude (26 km).  The first of four related research goals of this proposed new effort has to do with a detailed analysis of the new source of horizontal electric fields: evidence of this new source has now been found in the ELBBO data set.  Additional goals have to do with other middle atmosphere electrodynamics questions relating to ways in which local variability can effect global circuit dynamics.  In addition, coupling to the neutral atmosphere and the influence of magnetic storms on middle atmospheric electrodynamics will be investigated.\r\n",
