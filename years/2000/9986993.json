 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Program will address the national workforce need to increase substantially the number of graduates of associate degree programs in Computer Science, Computer Technology, and Engineering Technology fields. Seven objectives will guide the Program activities and produce measurable outcomes by the conclusion of the project in August 2002: \r\n\r\n1. Improved education of participating students by August 2002;\r\n2. Increased participation of underrepresented groups in Computer Science, Computer Technology, and Engineering Technology disciplines by August 2002;\r\n3. Increased retention of students to degree achievement for CSEMS scholars by August 2002;\r\n4. Improved professional development and employment/further higher education placement of participating students by August 2002; \r\n5. Strengthened partnerships between university and related employment sectors by August 2002; \r\n6. Institutionalization of scholarship best practices by fall 2002; \r\n7. Support the university's strategic priority and applicable strategic goals throughout the duration of the program.\r\n\r\nThe Program will provide educational opportunities to financially disadvantaged, academically-talented students through scholarships that promote full-time enrollment and Associate in Applied Science degree achievement in Computer Science, Computer Technology, and Engineering Technology programs of study. The Scholarship Selection Committee will designate up to 40 applicants per academic year in the 2000-01 and 2001-02 academic years to each receive a $2,500 scholarship per academic year.\r\n\t\r\nThe Program will employ a comprehensive plan of targeted student recruitment, assessment, orientation, admissions counseling, advisement, academic placement and support, mentoring, monitoring and follow-up, internship guidance, and employment placement assistance to meet the goal and objectives of the program. Groups underrepresented in appropriate fields will receive special consideration to promote their participation. \r\n\r\nThe significance of this project will be to develop a model of effective student recruitment and retention that can be delivered through scholarship programs.\r\n",
