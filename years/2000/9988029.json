Anticipated outcomes are: (1) Students develop excellent science process skills. (2) Students acquire broad perspectives on ecology in the context of both science and society to address real-world problems. (3) Students develop a strong background in several branches of ecology. (4) Students are better equipped to choose and pursue a career in ecology. (5) The program contributes to the field of ecology by providing quality training for a diverse group of students. (6) We disseminate a well documented and evaluated model for student training.  The 114 participants in our 1988-1999 programs included 32% minorities and 66 % women; over 86 % of those who have graduated currently are in graduate school or are working in science.  The 2000-2002 program builds on the strengths of our past program and will bring 10 students to IES for a twelve-week program each summer, 8 with NSF funds and 2 with funds from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  The program has three components: (1)Student Research Projects - working closely with a mentor scientist, each student delineates a research question and associated hypotheses, develops and implements the project, analyzes data, gives an oral presentation in a formal Research Symposium and writes a paper for an IES Occasional Publication. (2) Research Strategies for the undergraduate - workshops give explicit training in the tools essential for research and foster student reflection. (3) Research in Context - discussions, case studies, and seminars broaden students' perspectives on the various contexts and applications of science, including a full-day Forum on Opportunities in Ecology that exposes students to a broad range of careers in science and applications of ecology in the modern world.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
