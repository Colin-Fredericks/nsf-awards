 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Science  (61)  This advanced molecular biology laboratory course, which uses a project approach to learning and incorporates an independent research component, is designed to improve the preparation of biology students for careers in research, biotechnology and science education and to increase knowledge retention and integration of concepts among upper level biology majors. The students use enhancer trap techniques in Drosophila melanogaster to work on two related projects in a single semester. One project carefully proceeds through a set of experiments that take the students from a behavior mutant (flightless), to a cloned and sequenced gene (gene for muscle myosin heavy chain protein), and finally to a study of the protein. This part of the laboratory experience exposes the students to a wide range of the techniques and instrumentation commonly used in biotechnology and molecular biology laboratories and demonstrates the logical progression of a research program. The second project involves an independent research component. It starts with mutants which have already been isolated but for which the mutated gene has not yet been discovered.  Students use the techniques they have learned to clone and sequence the gene and to begin to study the protein. The integration of a research component into this laboratory course increases students' mastery of the principles of scientific inquiry and their ability to draw on their accumulated knowledge to solve research problems. Therefore, in addition to exposing students to specific techniques and instrumentation, this course also increases overall learning and helps students integrate concepts across disciplines. This course gives students who plan careers in research or biotechnology practical experience that mimics the realities of the laboratory setting. It provides students who are planning careers in education with the background necessary to bring modem technology and inquiry-based learning into the classroom. The project adapts ideas and teaching techniques outlined in two NSF supported projects:  that of Malcolm Campbell (DUE 9851242 as described in http://www.bio.davidson.edu/Biology/IDH.html) and of Jill Keeney (Career Grant 9722274). \r\n",
