 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major new materials analysis facility will be established within the State of Kentucky.  The facility is designed to build on, complement and integrating existing capabilities for nano-scale analysis available within the state.  It will consist of the following components. \r\n Several complementary analysis tools designed to probe composition and structure of the surface and sub-surface to a depth of several atomic monolayers, with nanometer, and sometimes, atomic resolution.\r\n A sample preparation lab for preparing and mounting crystalline samples that are 10-1000 atomic layers thick for analysis by University of Louisville (UL) and University of Kentucky (UK) Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) facilities.\r\n An expert staff to assist and support Kentucky researchers in using the analytical system, as well as expedite for UL researchers analysis using the TEM's at the UL Medical School and UK Chemical and Materials Engineering Department.\r\nKey to the project is a custom designed system containing Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, surface profiling microscopes (including atomic force and surface tunneling microscopy and surface tunneling spectroscopy), and ion milling to provide X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy depth.  Together these instruments provide precise and detailed information on material composition, topography, crystalline structure, and electronic properties, as well as some capabilities to perform in situ surface modification and nanolithographic patterning.  The instruments attach to three interconnected, ultra high vacuum (UHV) chambers, which permit measurements in a UHV or other controlled atmosphere without exposure to the detrimental effects of air.  The system can be connected through UHV transports to many other co-located analyses, syntheses and processing chambers, and thus supports investigations of researchers who require in vacuo materials analysis and synthesis capabilities.\r\n",
