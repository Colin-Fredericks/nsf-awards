 "awd_abstract_narration": "A career development plan is presented with the objective of developing an interdisciplinary eye tracking education and research program at Clemson University. The four development areas forming the program are described: (1)pedagogical innovation, (2) laboratory infrastructure, (3) interdisciplinary eye movement research, and (4) independent computer science research. Work in areas (1) and (2) has already begun. The long-term research directions outlined in areas (3) and (4) specify a research agenda designed to sustain and nurture the program's growth. This proposal defines two virtual reality eye tracking research projects, the results of which will serve as part of the foundation for future research and career development.\r\n\r\nPedagogical Innovation: A newly approved interdisciplinary course, commencing in Fall 1999, is described. This class features applied instruction in eye tracking methodology and thus presents a nationally distinctive course offering. The course content provides a context for ongoing and proposed eye tracking research. This proposal also discusses the strategies for the formative and surnmative evaluation of this curricular development.\r\n\r\nLaboratory Infrastructure: Hands-on course instruction and related research is conducted within the newly installed eye tracking facility housed in Clemson's Virtual Reality Laboratory. The laboratory includes two top-of-the-line Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) from Virtual Research, one of which is outfitted with a binocular eye tracker from ISCAN. The HMI)s are driven by an SGI Onyx2 InfiniteReality graphics engine, which generates a myriad of complex stimuli, including graphics, virtual environments, digital images, and video. The binocular HMD-fitted eye tracker, the principal component currently used in virtual reality eye \r\ntracking research, appears to be the first of its kind to be assembled in the United States.\r\n\r\nInterdisciplinary Research: Related collaborative research directions are \r\noutlined, with the support of faculty from Psychology, Marketing, and Industrial Engineering. Students from these departments can enroll in the eye tracking course and are expected to participate in ongoing research, \r\nSupporting the burgeoning education program, the objective of the proposed collaborative efforts is to explore fundamental questions regarding dynamic vision and perceptual processes. Results from completed projects will be featured in the course as it evolves over time.\r\n\r\nIndependent Research: The underlying theme of this proposed research is display generation and processing, matching the dynamic nature of human vision as revealed by eye movements. \r\nAlthough long-range computer science directions are specified within the areas of computer graphics, \r\nhuman-computer interaction, and digital imaging, this\r\nproposal focuses on two related projects pertinent to virtual reality \r\nresearch. These projects constitute the primary\r\nreason for requested funding. The aim of both projects is to develop \r\nstrategies to increase the display rate of com-\r\nplex virtual environments through gaze-contingent object and scene \r\nmodeling. The proposed evaluation of the two\r\nvirtual environments is based on measurements of system and human \r\nperformance. Expected deliverables include\r\nmultivariate acuity-matching degradation functions suitable for either \r\nmodel- or frame-based scene generation result-\r\ning in display-time compression. The development of the two proposed \r\nprojects is slated over a four-year period. The\r\nschedule is summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. First year: completion of software development for initial \r\ngaze-contingent virtual environment construction;\r\ncompletion of pilot studies; dissemination of preliminary results and \r\nexperiences.\r\n2. Second year: implementation of gaze-contingent modeling strategies; \r\ninitiation of human subject experiments.\r\n3. Third year: implementation of gaze-contingent visuotopic strategies; \r\ninitiation of human subject experiments,\r\n4. Fourth year: completion of experiments and data analysis; dissemination \r\nof project results.\r\n\r\nThe four-year duration of the two proposed projects presents an opportunity \r\nto lay the groundwork for future career\r\ndevelopment. Although this career development proposal is broad in scope, \r\nit is tacitly assumed that the work outlined\r\nherein forms the foundation for a lifetime of research and teaching \r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n",
