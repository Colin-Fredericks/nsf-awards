 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore the feasibility of developing innovative spatial/temporal statistical techniques to enhance site-specific tornado hazard analysis for any location in the conterminous United States. The approach involves use of  a multivariate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and application of Monte Carlo techniques that can be applied to the SPC Tornado Database for the purpose of regionalizing areas of similar tornado occurrence at the county level. These regionalizations provide an optimal basis for determining areas that are represented by 'homogeneous tornado statistics' (similar tornado climatology) - an important assumption implicitly made during the application of any tornado hazard model, and one that has not been suitably addressed in the past. This will allow quantification of hazard estimates to be associated with confidence estimates based on the characteristics of the data surrounding the point of interest. In addition, a new, statistically-based method will be developed for identifying and removing spatial and temporal bias in the tornado database due to variations in population. The statistical methods will utilize the 'homogeneous' regionalization. Defining 'homogeneous' regions and removing the population bias will enable the SPC Tornado Database to be used to produce a more accurate assessment of the 'true' tornado hazard for a specific site.\r\nWith the science developed fully integrated into a 'site-specific tornado hazard analysis system,' any group with an interest in tornado climatology, hazard analysis, or risk assessment will have an interest in the technology. These groups include companies and organizations that have responsibility (or vested interest) in mitigating loss of life and costs of tornado-related disasters. Potential users include insurance companies,\r\ngovernment agencies (DOE, NRC, civil emergency management), engineers, the media, chambers of commerce, and basic researchers. These end users represent a significant commercial market for the technology.\r\n",
