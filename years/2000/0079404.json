 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this Major Research Instrumentation project is to develop a virtual and  augmented reality (VAR) system for research in intelligent and collaborative design and manufacturing. The VAR system will be capable of providing 3-D visualization of co-existing virtual and real objects. Our approach of developing the VAR system is to integrate commercial virtual reality systems with image acquisition hardware and software that has been used in the past for feature recognition, object identification, and process inspection. Various components including the display device, haptic device, motion tracker, stereo cameras, etc. will be integrated into a powerful VAR system capable of immersing the user in 3-D virtual and augmented environments. The system development will address the following issues: 1) calibration, characterization, control, and integration of system components, 2) stereo video acquisition and depth map calculation, 3) precision registration between the virtual and real worlds, and 4) development of fast collision detection and response algorithms. The developed VAR system will be used to perform research on topics including freeform design model creation, collaborative modular fixture design, assembly/disassembly analysis and planning, human cognition and collaboration in a VAR environment, web-based collaborative infrastructure support for VAR applications, and distributed collaborative product design and development.\r\n\r\nThis project is expected to have significant impact on research, education, research training, and infrastructure building at the proposal institution. Also, it has high potential of revolutionizing the future practice of design and manufacturing, including networked collaboration, for a wide range of products.\r\n",
