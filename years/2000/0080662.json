 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to develop, improve, test and evaluate GRE (Graduate Record Exam) preparatory courses for SMET majors at five women's college's in partnership with the graduate school that developed the SMART GRE Prep course as a component of a NSF MPWG.  The sites will use material from this successful course, but provide new materials and approaches to test the course in a variety of contexts. Partners include The Graduate School of Baylor College of Medicine and Wesleyan College.  The project will directly serve more than 650 SMET students.  The courses will use standardize diagnostic and exit exams to compare results of different models and test successful components at different sites in years two and three.  Course guidebooks will be developed and information regarding models will be disseminated to other women's colleges and those with an interest in securing opportunities for women to pursue advances SMET degrees.  This Large Collaborative Project will provide  information for campuses to improve graduate school opportunities for thousands of US women, SMET majors and impact undergraduate students, faculty and graduate student mentors, and faculty and staff who develop expertise in teaching skills assessed on the GRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
