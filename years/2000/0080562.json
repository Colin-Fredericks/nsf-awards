 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose to increase the effectiveness of the U.C. Berkeley Computer Science Department teaching faculty and to extend the reach of the program well beyond the confines of the campus and the duration of a traditional academic career. In particular, the proposed approach will take advantage of problem-based learning to maintain a high standard of quality and will utilize electronic tools that can support the special time and space requirements of off-campus learners.\r\n\r\nBy incorporating the principles and knowledge of problem-based learning, learner-centered design, computer-supported cooperative work, and current research projects in the department, an informed design of a suite of learning, collaboration, and awareness tools will be developed, including:\r\n\r\n    Enhanced lecture viewing tools, including secondary discussion channel chat and participation, TVI and DTVI, asynchronous discussion groups, and analysis tools\r\n    Media sharing tools with asynchronous discussion and scaffolding tools to support group work, including integration of note-taking tools that are searchable across a number of classes and projects\r\n    Group awareness tools for keeping students informed about what others in their group are working on, how much they have accomplished, as well as what other groups are doing\r\n    Monitoring tools to track electronic communications & tool usage by student groups\r\n    Instructor awareness tools for identifying group progress and lack of progress in achieving project and learning goals, including analysis tools using data generated from the monitoring tools\r\n",
