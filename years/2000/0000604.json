This program builds on the successful \"ThinkQuest\" model, in which small teams of 2-3 students work with adult coaches to research subjects of interest and share their knowledge through the creation of websites.  \"ScienceQuest\" teams focus on science topics and are housed in HUD Neighborhood Network technology centers, located in communities with HUD-assisted or insured housing residents.  Participants include individuals with and without disabilities from low-income urban areas. Students select a science topic and research it using online resources, hands-on experiments and visits to museums and science centers.   Coaches such as scientists, teachers, museum staff and other role models, as well as on-line scientists, provide assistance by setting goals, devising an action plan and identifying appropriate resources.  The \"I-Search\" model, a four-step strategy used to direct student inquiry, is used to guide investigations and aid in content acquisition.  Once completed, websites are mounted on the \"ThinkQuest\" server.  Parental participation is encouraged throughout the process.  \"ScienceQuest\" will be piloted in the greater Boston area in year one, and disseminated to 75 Neighborhood Network sites throughout the country in years two and three of the grant.  Each site may have one or more teams.  With more than 500 Neighborhood Networks in place, \"ScienceQuest\" has the potential for widespread dissemination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
