 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will study the use of chimeraplasty in plants. Chimeraplasty is the use of a novel technology currently being explored in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems which utilizes chimeric, self-complimentary oligonucleotides comprised of DNA and modified RNA to target and mutate genes in vivo.  Phase 1 of this project will use the model system of Arabidopsis thaliana to assess the applicability of this new technology to modify a complex biosynthetic pathway. Follow-on\r\nPhase 2 funding will be used to apply the strategies learned in Phase 1 to a commercial oilseed crop. Lipid synthesis in plants has many potential trait development opportunities in many oilseed crops. The major objective of this phase 1 project is to modify a well-characterized gene in A. thaliana with this new exciting in vivo genome modification technology. Completion of this objective will lead to the translation of this technology into a specific trait and product development program. When complete this program will have produced a unique and stable non-transgenic modified-oil product, never before seen in the market place.  The development of a novel cottonseed oil product.  This product will be a stable genome modification that is non-transgenic and therefore has the potential to quickly reach the market. The product will also have completely new oilseed characteristics never before seen in the vegetable oils market.\r\n",
