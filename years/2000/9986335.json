The Panel strives to fulfill this purpose by generating, discussing, and publishing high quality, relevant, and timely research on a broad range of applied macroeconomic topics. The Panel's notion of relevance is broad. It includes research to explore fundamental characteristics of the economy and how it responds to policy, as well as more applied research aimed at clarifying and quantifying economic relations. It is concerned with issues affecting economic performance broadly, including areas such as global interdependence and trade policy, as well as the full range of issues associated with long run growth, business cycles, and economic stabilization. The Panel is committed to producing quality research, and its method of operation is designed with that goal foremost in mind. Its research, published in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, undergoes a much more intensive process of review, criticism, discussion and editing than conventional journals can provide. In this process, and in the selection of topics and authors, the directors of the Panel (principal investigators) are aided by the Panel advisers-- experts spanning a broad range of research interests, professional views and methodological preferences-- and, most actively, by a newly formed Advisory Group consisting of nine of those advisers.  The directors are especially interested in involving women, minorities and younger researchers and they and the Advisory Group have this in mind in selecting authors and discussants for the research papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
