 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates a system comprised of a set of online services collectively called the Instructional Architect. The Instructional Architect is a suite of services for digital libraries consisting of four tools that provide for discovery, presentation, inspection, and recommendation of learning objects. \r\n\r\nA primary goal of digital libraries is to provide users, including teachers and students, a way to search for and display digital learning resources or learning objects. Often, the digital libraries do not provide methods or support for recombining and embedding discovered learning objects within new instruction and curriculum. This project provides this functionality by including an additional tier of services that will overlay and be compatible with existing digital library services. These services include the enhancement of search capabilities provided by existing digital libraries, automated recommendation of learning objects based on feedback from members of communities of users, instructional support for the combination of learning objects into lessons, an integrated Web-based development environment in which learning objects can be assembled into instruction, and a method for enabling the spontaneous formation of new communities of users based on shared interests.\r\n\r\nWhile many advances have been made in the creation of digital libraries, there is considerable room for improving how learning objects are accessed and re-used by the large population of teachers and learners who have Internet access but need technological and instructional support. This project will result in a system that will enable more focused and relevant access to learning objects for the purpose of creating instruction and thus enhance the role of digital libraries in promoting effective SMET education.\r\n",
