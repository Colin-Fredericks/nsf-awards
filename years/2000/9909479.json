 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project proposes to study the measurement, mechanism dependence, and scaling of seismic energy.  Estimates of the seismic energy have large potential errors, with different estimates for the same earthquake commonly varying by a factor of 10 or more, and the scaling properties and focal mechanism dependence of seismic energy reported by different studies are contradictory.  Some studies find that the earthquake stress drop (calculated by dividing seismic energy by the seismic moment) varies with earthquake size, while other studies find no variation.  Some studies find a systematic variation of earthquake stress drop with focal mechanism, while others find no mechanism dependence.  Several studies have suggested that teleseismic estimates of seismic energy are about an order of magnitude lower than near-source estimates, yet the source of this discrepancy has not been identified and corrected.  Seismic energy is difficult to estimate because it is a broadband measure of the strength of the earthquake source and hence one must account and correct for both wave propagation effects and source excitation over a wide frequency range.  In the proposed study, the research will take advantage of modern broadband digital data to resolve discrepancies in estimates of the seismic energy.  These improved estimates will be used to test for possible scaling and mechanism dependence and explore their implications for the earthquake process.\r\n",
