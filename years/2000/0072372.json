The conference is designed \r\nto enhance the research and educational atmosphere of the \r\ncommunity of geometers and topologists in Texas and the \r\nsurrounding states.  The conference has three specific goals.  \r\nFirst the conference is committed to bring researchers of national \r\nand international stature to the area to discuss their research \r\nand to interact with mathematicians from this geographic region.  Second the conference makes it possible for the community of \r\ngeometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a \r\nhuge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular\r\nbasis, which both stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools.  Third the \r\nconference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. There will be six conferences over three years, hosted by major universities in Texas: \r\n2000-2001: Rice University (fall), Texas Christian University (spring)\r\n2001-2002: University of Texas (fall), Texas Tech University (spring)\r\n2002-2003: Texas A&M University (fall), University of Houston (spring)\r\nIn addition, two universities (University of Texas at Arlington, University of Texas at Dallas) will assist in the conference at Texas Christian University.\r\n\r\nThe Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 23 times to date.  The roster of mathematicians who have participated in the conference includes many of the most influential geometers and topologists in the world.  Each conference specifically tailors its program to reflect recent developments in important areas of geometry and topology. Information about upcoming conferences as well as the mission and history of the conference is always available at http://www.math.tamu.edu/research/workshops/TGTC/index.html.\r\n\r\n",
