 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a contribution to a coordinated attempt to understand the interactions of biological and physical dynamics by developing relationships among the evolution of the antarctic winter ice and snow cover, biological habitat variability, and the seasonal progression of marine ecological processes.   The work will be carried out in the context of the Southern Ocean Experiment of the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics Study (Globec), a large, multi-investigator study of the winter survival strategy of krill under the antarctic sea ice in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThere are several aspects to this project: One is the collection, analysis, and archiving of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), and Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) data in order to characterize mesoscale circulation features and the regional hydrography.  Another is to develop an accurate and fully validated model of tidal currents in Marguerite Bay.  A third is to provide a data set of small-scale processes such as shear instabilities, tidal stirring, mesoscale eddies, and double diffusion, that are required for the effective parameterization of the vertical diffusivities of heat, salt, and nutrients.  The results of this project will provide a unified data set that satisfies the data requirement of the coordinated chemical and biological studies which will link water column and sea ice processes with the biology of krill and its predators.  The results further will help to link these winter observations to similar observations made in summer and elsewhere around Antarctic in the international context of the Globec program.  The overall objective is to develop a comprehensive ecosystem model that will test our understanding of the system, determine its sensitivities, and to provide an organizing mechanism for integrating the Southern Ocean Globec observations.\t\r\n***\r\n",
