These equations \r\narise naturally in the study of J-holomorphic curves in \r\nsymplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian group action. Instances \r\nof these equations include the vortex equations, the \r\nanti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations, and the Seiberg-Witten \r\nequations. Solutions of the equations give rise to invariants \r\nof Hamiltonian group actions. These invariants are related via \r\nan adiabatic limit to the Gromov-Witten invariants of the \r\nsymplectic quotient by the group action.  This project pursues \r\nthe following goals: (1) achieving a deeper understanding of \r\nknown connections between invariants; (2) establishing new correspondences between invariants; (3) using the correspondences between invariants to compute invariants. Invariants that can be addressed in this way include: Donaldson invariants and\r\nSeiberg-Witten invariants of certain smooth 4-manifolds; \r\ninstanton Floer homology and Seiberg-Witten Floer homology \r\nof certain smooth 3-manifolds; Gromov-Witten invariants, \r\nquantum cohomology and Floer homology of symplectic manifolds.   \r\n\r\nA symplectic manifold is a generalisation of the phase space\r\nin classical mechanics. Geometric properties of this space \r\ninfluence the behavior of mechanical systems. For example, \r\ncompactness of the space forces mechanical systems to admit \r\nperiodic motions. This project focuses on geometric properties \r\nof symplectic manifolds with symmetries. Symmetries of a \r\nmechanical system lead to conserved quantities represented \r\nby a moment map. Classical examples of moment maps are linear \r\nand angular momentum. This project lies in the intersection \r\nbetween two large branches of symplectic geometry: the study of J-holomorphic curves, and the study of Hamiltonian group \r\nactions. These branches have traditionally had little overlap.\r\nMoreover, the project touches several areas adjacent to \r\nsymplectic geometry: Hamiltonian dynamics, quantum field\r\ntheory, low-dimensional topology, and algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
