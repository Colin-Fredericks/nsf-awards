 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project entitled \"Fluorocarbon and Peptide Film Growth from Polyatomic Ion Beams\" is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.   The work, by the research group headed by Dr. Luke Hanley at the University of Illinois - Chicago, will examine the use of covalently bound, polyatomic ion beams, of the size 4-100 atoms, for the growth of smooth and nanotextured thin films.  The ion beams permit the controlled transfer of chemical functionality to a surface.  There are two related studies included in the project.  (1) Studies will be performed on the growth of fluorocarbon (FC) films on polymers and silicon surfaces.  Second, peptide ion beams will be used to grow biomolecular thin films on polymers.    AFM and XPS will be used to characterize the films.  Both studies seek to determine how polyatomic ions affect film growth on individual particle surfaces with an emphasis on understanding film growth from plasmas.\r\n\r\nThis research is of relatively high risk but will have a significant impact on the fundamental understanding of surface chemistry.  In particular, it will provide details of the mechanisms of the interactions of ions with surfaces.  The ion beams will be both mass and energy selected.  Fluorocarbon films can have protective, protein resistant, gas permeable and/or optical properties which have application in the areas of biomaterials, optics, sensors and electronics.  The results of this research will be of interest to industry, national labs and academics working in the area of surface science.",
