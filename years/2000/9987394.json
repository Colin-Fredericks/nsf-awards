Increasingly, this information is being made available for wide distribution via the Internet.There is currently very little content involving evolutionary and population biology available on the Internet, and that which is available is not well organized or easily found. This hinders communication between scientific researchers, as well as their access to important research resources such as data analysis software. More significantly, a lack of information limits the potential that the Internet has for greatly enhancing education in these areas of biology. This has an impact not only on students who might be using the Internet as a research tool, but also on teachers and professors who could enhance their courses with appropriate supporting materials and ideas.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses this deficiency by creating a website, EvoNet.org, focusing on the collection, organization, and distribution of research and educational information regarding evolutionary and population biology. Development of this site enhances and supports research and education in the biological sciences in general, and provides an important contribution to the informational infrastructure of science.\r\n\r\n",
