The co-organizers are Professors Mark Kasevich at Yale University in New Haven and Professor Masao Kitano at Kyoto University in Japan.  The past three years have seen the development of unprecedented methods to manipulate and investigate the coherence properties of simple quantum systems involving atoms and photons.  Examples include:  1) the experimental observation interference between two initially isolated condenses;  2) the demonstration of atom holographic techniques;  3) the study of the phase evolution of two species condenses;  4) the experimental beginnings of non-linear atom optics;  5) the creation of entangled states with ions;  6) theoretical advances in quantum computing;  7) the observation of slow group velocities in a Bose-Einstein condensates; and  8) the demonstration of quantum teleportation.  With this explosion in growth of methods in a diverse group of physical systems, this meeting provides the opportunity for catalyzing advances by bringing together U.S. and Japanese researchers.  The discussion topics for the seminar include:  (1) electromagnetically-induced transparency/coherent interactions;  (2) atom optics and interferometry;  (3) precision measurements;  (4) cold atoms and molecules;  (5) Bose-Einstein condensation;  and (6) quantum computation and quantum measurement.  \r\n\r\nRecent progress in the fields of quantum optics and atomic physics continues to strengthen our ability to observe and manipulate coherent quantum systems.  In addition to amplifying our understanding of fundamental issues of quantum coherence, these advances are opening exciting applications in the areas of atom optics and interferometry, precision measurements, non-linear optics, quantum measurement, and quantum computing.  The Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Dissemination of information from the meeting will be available at the following Web site: http://amo.physics.yale.edu/usjapan2000.\r\n",
