 "awd_abstract_narration": "-------------------------------------------\r\nCCR-9984681\r\n(title unchanged)\r\nPI: John T Boyland\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware evolves through the addition of features, removal of defects,\r\nor improvement in the basic algorithms.  The desired changes may be\r\neasiest to incorporate if the program is first restructured.  This\r\nresearch has impact through its incorporation into the ACT/Fluid\r\nprototype software engineering tool, which supports programmer-guided\r\nprogram manipulation and restructuring.  Since the tool does not have\r\naccess to the whole program (portions may be hidden in libraries or\r\nundergoing concurrent development), this research proposes decorating\r\ninterfaces between components with annotations called ``promises.''\r\nPromises serve as surrogates of missing code during inter-procedural\r\nanalysis, serve as proof obligations when that code is itself\r\nanalyzed, and serve as contracts between separately-developed program\r\ncomponents.  The investigator is integrating the research directly\r\ninto two computer science courses: one, a graduate course on program\r\nanalysis; the other uses the ACT/Fluid prototype as a refactoring tool\r\nfor Java programs.  Additionally, the investigator is addressing the\r\nneeds of non-traditional students through increased emphasis\r\non `how' and `why' issues, more supportive instructor-student\r\ninteraction, and improved assessment procedures.  Successful\r\ncompletion of this project will encourage the use of verified program\r\nmanipulations in software evolution, leading to better structured\r\nprograms with fewer defects",
