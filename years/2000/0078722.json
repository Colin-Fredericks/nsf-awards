 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project's goal is a commercial\r\nquality liquid crystal exhibiting V-shaped switching with no hysteresis. This LC will be\r\nused in gray-scale displays and telecommunications optical switches.\r\nFerroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs), due to their fast switching speed and wide\r\nviewing angle, have inherent advantages over the more commonly used nematic liquid\r\ncrystals. However, when used in displays, they have a disadvantage - they generally can\r\nbe driven to only two states, on and off. Since displays require intermediate gray states,\r\nFLCs currently attain gray scale by rapidly switching on and off. This project uses a new\r\ntype of FLC which, in addition to its speed and viewing angle advantage, also shows\r\nanalog switching. This type of material, previously known as a \"thresholdless\r\nantiferroelectric\", is now known to be an FLC with a linear optical response to applied\r\nfield (also known as \"V-shaped switching\").\r\n\r\nThis project's objective is to make new liquid crystal compounds and mixtures that\r\nexhibit V-shaped switching. Towards that end, a variety of cores, chiral tails, and achiral\r\ntails, all of which are either known or suspected to promote a de Vries-type smectic A,\r\nhave been proposed. About 50 - 100 liquid crystals will be synthesized by combining\r\nthese various components. These new LCs will be combined with LCs made in the Phase\r\nI or earlier, giving mixtures that ideally will have not only a de Vries smectic A phase,\r\nbut also a wide room-temperature smectic C phase, good low-voltage analog electrooptic\r\nresponse, good alignability, and fast hysteresis-free switching. An optimal alignment\r\nlayer configuration will be determined. The newly formulated mixtures will be placed in\r\ncells containing this alignment layer to give V-shaped switching displays.\r\nThis project could be instrumental in advancing our knowledge of the root causes of\r\nV-shaped switching in FLC and, by extension, add insight into the responses of self-assembling molecules to applied forces. In addition, since the interaction of the alignment\r\nlayer with the liquid crystal is crucial for V-shaped switching, much more so than for\r\ntypical FLCs, this project will provide a better understanding of the alignment layer-LC\r\ninteractions.\r\n",
