 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds for the verification  of theoretically predicted distortion in grazing incidence interferometric measurements and for the development of a method for elimination of imaging distortion, variable sensitivity and low axial spatial resolution present in current techniques of grazing incidence interferometry.  Verification of the errors will involve both calculation of the expected effects of different sample geometries and experimental measurements of the distortion. Measurements will be carried out using a diffractively coupled grazing incidence interferometer designed to measure nominally flat parts. Specific geometries will be created on the parts using single-point diamond turning. The results of the verification studies will be used to develop a design for a distortion-corrected grazing incidence interferometer.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of industrial metrology instruments using the principles of grazing-incidence interferometry. The primary goal of this research is to allow the design of  grazing-incidence interferometers with the ability to resolve features with both small height and small lateral extent. Such interferometric metrology capability would allow high-resolution in-process metrology for quality control of a wide variety of manufactured parts.",
