 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) College-level science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) faculty are increasingly expected to educate all students to be scientifically literate, to develop the ranks of future scientists, engineers, and technicians, and to prepare K-12 teachers who are fully prepared to teach science and mathematics. They are expected to achieve these goals in the context of a national reform movement in undergraduate SMET education, while also making appropriate and (at times) transformative use of new computer-based learning technologies. Faculty typically find only a few professional development resources to assist them in meeting these daunting expectations. This project is working to meet these needs by constructing a complete, web-based professional development site. This site will give faculty access to 9 case studies covering a variety of SMET disciplines of effective \"Learning Through Technology\" (LT2). These cases are focused on certain types of learning technologies that seem particularly promising in SMET disciplines. All are computer based, connected to well-established teaching methods, and enable some of the following learning activities: visualization, simulation, data analysis, interpersonal interaction, software-based feedback, locating pertinent information, and improved student \"creativity.\" The case studies combined with other elements of the site will provide important information to faculty seeking to learn more about computer-based learning applications and how to implement these effectively. The project is building on an earlier discovery that the implementation of this technology matters at least as much as the technology itself. The web-site is designed to emulate \"hallway conversations\" that characterize how many faculty share crucial information about new technical developments. This resource is being designed to ease the way for faculty to learn how to use instructional technology to improve student learning. This resource also teaches faculty about technology pitfalls to avoid and provides them access to a series of vignettes that provides more breadth and depth while demonstrating how their faculty peers are integrating instructional technology into their courses. It is anticipated that this will raise the rate of adaptation and implementation of exemplary materials and practices using instructional technology.",
