 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the use of virtual environments as a medium for the study of human behavior in dynamic environments.  The project has two thrusts:  a computational component directed at advancing scenario modeling techniques to meet the needs of experiments for replicable experiences that adapt to subject behavior, and an experimental component that investigates children's bicycle riding behavior in a virtual bicycling simulator.  Virtual environments present an exciting new medium for the study of human behavior that combines the rigor of controlled laboratory experiments with the ecological validity of natural experiments.  They immerse subjects in worlds that appear physically real, but where conditions can be controlled.  In addition, they can realistically simulate dangerous circumstances without risking injury to subjects.  To exploit the potential of virtual environments as laboratories for studying human behavior, significant advances must be made in techniques for controlling the dynamics of virtual environments populated with vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and traffic lights.   In experiments, the right things must happen at the right time and place.   Furthermore, the activity should maintain an appearance of spontaneity;   subjects should feel that they have freedom of action and that other objects are behaving normally.  The research will investigate on-line direction as a means to adaptively coordinate the behaviors of simulated objects during experiments. Psychological studies will serve as a proving ground to test and harden scenario control methodologies.   Experiments conducted in virtual environments will be compared to experiments conducted in real environments to validate the use of simulators as laboratories for the study of human behavior.   This work integrates research on high-fidelity simulation, control of complex behaviors, human factors, and developmental psychology.  The research will advance virtual environment technology, experimental methods, and simulator validation, and increase our understanding of a leading cause of childhood injuries.",
