 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nThe applicant proposes to work on several related problems in function\r\ntheoretic operator theory and in Euclidean harmonic analysis. He plans to\r\nuse his recent work with Arcozzi and Sawyer as a basis for the study of\r\ninterpolating sequences in Besov spaces. He proposes to use phase space\r\nmethods to study eigenvectors of pseudodifferential operators and as well\r\nas solutions to other extremal problems. He also plans to use his recent\r\nwork with Holland on the asymptotic behavior of Bergman kernel functions\r\nas a starting point to investigate whether generalized Segal-Bargmann\r\nspaces can be used to give quantum deformations of the plane. Finally, he\r\nplans to investigate whether certain techniques that arose in recent work\r\non higher order Hankel operators have broader application in operator\r\ntheory. The work proposed will advance the understanding of the function\r\ntheoretic operator theory on spaces of holomorphic functions and of\r\noperators arising in Euclidean harmonic analysis. It will also develop new\r\nviewpoints and techniques that will have general applicability in those\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nMore generally, the proposed work is at the interface of operator theory,\r\nfunction theory, and harmonic analysis.  The unifying theme of the work is\r\nthe systematic use of phase space methods, both as a technical tool and,\r\nmore importantly, as a unifying conceptual structure.  Those tools and\r\nthat viewpoint have been very productive, both historically and recently,\r\nof important new techniques in theoretical mathematics and of major new\r\napplications of mathematics to science and engineering.  The recent work\r\nLacey and Thiele on bilinear operators is an example of the first and the\r\nimpact of wavelet and related methods on signal processing is a\r\nspectacular example of the second.  One certainly expects that further\r\nresearch in these areas will continue to produce important additional\r\ncontributions inside and outside of mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
