 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine whether the aero-sol-gel (ASG) process can be used to produce nano-structured, mixed-oxide powders for catalysis applications.  This exploratory project is aimed at demonstrating use of ASG mixed oxides as epoxidation catalysts in simple, liquid-state reactions of olefins.  Amorphous titania-silica and vanadium oxide-silica catalysts will be synthesized; similar catalysts have already been produced by a solution sol-gel process.  With aerosols, two normally immiscible chemical components can be forced into the confinement of a droplet by co-condensation of vapor streams, and processing under ambient conditions is feasible.  Manipulation of primary particle size, specific surface area, bulk density, and aggregate size as well as composition is anticipated.  Mixed oxides will be characterized in terms of titania content through mass spectroscopy.  Catalysts will be characterized by infrared analysis to estimate the presence of titanium-oxygen-silicon bonding.  Kinetic studies will be based on the well-characterized epoxidation of octene.  Informal collaboration with Goodyear Chemical is planned.  If successful, this work could lead to a new method for producing solid catalysts by an inexpensive route.\r\n",
