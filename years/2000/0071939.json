The first project involves understanding certain \r\naspects of dispersive wave turbulence, that is, the statistical description of \r\na large number of interacting dispersive waves, such as those on the ocean \r\nsurface. First, a reduced model will be used which contains the \r\nfundamental nonlinear processes and can yield the scaling for the energy \r\ntransfer mechanisms. Second, spectra of two-- and three--dimensional \r\nocean waves with a reduced equation valid for finite depth and deep water \r\nwill be computed and compared with results from the reduced model. The \r\nsecond project involves the study of three-dimensional solitary waves in \r\nregimes where surface tension is an important part of the dynamics. These \r\nare waves that can be generated, for example, by flow of a thin fluid layer \r\nover a small obstacle. Here, it is proposed to use solutions that have \r\nalready been computed to find additional solutions in regimes of physical \r\ninterest, such as increasing depth. The third project is to study the \r\ndynamics of reaction-diffusion equations in the presence of spatial \r\ninhomogeneities, as for example, in models of certain chemical reactions \r\nwhere the reactant concentration is not uniform in space. In the spatially \r\nhomogeneous case, one obtains various coherent patterns in the reaction. \r\nHow these patterns and their boundaries are modified by the \r\ninhomogeneities will be studied.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to understand several aspects of wave \r\ndynamics in fluids using a combination of theory and advanced \r\ncomputation. There are three distinct phenomena that will be studied. \r\nFirst, the evolution of wave turbulence will be studied: the physical \r\nsituation in which many waves of different wavelengths and traveling in \r\ndifferent directions are superposed. The simplest example is the apparent \r\nrandom mix of waves on the surface of the ocean. The goal is to predict \r\nthe relative energy in the different waves and the mechanisms by which \r\nwaves of different sizes exchange energy. These are important predictions \r\nwhose applications range from understanding satellite remote sensing data \r\nto climate dynamics. Second, a class of water waves called lump solitons \r\nwill be studied: localized coherent waves that travel in a particular \r\ndirection. The goal is to obtain the range of physical situations in which \r\nthese waves can exist. This work has implications in a variety of thin film \r\nand coating applications. Lastly, the dynamics of the components of \r\nbiological and chemical reacting systems where the concentration of the \r\nreactants vary in space will be studied. The particular case where a \r\ncatalyst for the reaction is not distributed uniformly and therefore the \r\nreaction proceeds differently in different places will be studied. The goal \r\nis to understand how the reaction varies from place to place and what \r\nhappens at the boundaries where the reactions change character.\r\n",
