In addition, there will be an educational initiative to bring the goals and results of this scientific project to the Macalester College community and the general public. The timing of this research project is excellent, since this is an exciting time for stellar spectroscopy as several 8- to 10-m telescopes are becoming available to astronomers.   The use of these new telescopes will make the observations and analyses of stars in nearby galaxies a new possibility. The main goal of this project is to determine chemical abundances and critical abundance ratios in Local Group dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies. These new results, such as Oxygen/Iron (O/Fe) and Barium/Iron (Ba/Fe) abundance ratios, available only now from new stellar analyses, will constrain the star formation histories and galaxy evolution models of these Local Group galaxies.  The results obtained may be applied more generally to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution throughout the Universe. These known abundances of the elements in the stars themselves will also constrain massive star evolution models at very low metallicities, and the results will be applicable to population studies of high redshift galaxies.  \r\n\r\nThe goals and results of this scientific program will be used in a number of educational and outreach initiatives at Macalester College that will impact a variety of students and the general public.  Firstly, the scientific program will generate approximately six to nine senior thesis projects by physics majors, and up to twelve independent research projects for non-physics majors.  Secondly, a new seminar series for non-science majors will make it possible to introduce knowledge about the Local Universe.  The information will be available to make it possible to expand on the goals, scientific methods used, and discuss results from the scientific project.  Thirdly, this will provide new background information on the Universe for Macalester College science and mathematics majors. Fourthly, a colloquium series on astrophysics in the Local Universe will be geared towards the Macalester College community and general public.  Expert astronomers will be invited to the College to deliver the public lectures and interact with students and faculty. In addition, both the seminar series and the colloquium series will be tied to the Macalester College program for public nights at the observatory, so that\r\nparticipants can learn about a topic in a lecture and then actually observe related celestial objects for a more enriching experience. Finally, the data from the science program will be used to develop new\r\nexercises and laboratory demonstrations in both the introductory and advanced astronomy laboratory courses. The integration of scientific and educational programs is an excellent reflection of the mission of Macalester College.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Astronomical Sciences provides support for this project.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
