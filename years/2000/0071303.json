The goal of this workshop is to provide an international forum for presenting novel\r\nresults, methodologies, and tools for the design of hybrid dynamic systems. The term\r\n'hybrid systems' has emerged over the past few years to describe the increasing number of\r\ncomputer-controlled systems that require a mixture of continuous and discrete state\r\nvariables to be modeled effectively. The lack of a satisfactory, cost-effective\r\nmethodologies for designing reliable and efficient hybrid systems is widely acknowledged.\r\nIt is the purpose of the workshops on hybrid systems to develop a scientific community\r\nand a body of knowledge that synthesizes discrete and continuous technologies. The\r\nmeeting will include four invited plenary speakers and more than 30 contributed\r\npresentations selected by a program committee from submitted extended abstracts.\r\nAttendance of approximately 100 researchers is expected. This proposal asks for financial\r\nsupport for approximately 20 graduate students to attend the workshop.\r\n",
