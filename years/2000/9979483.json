 "awd_abstract_narration": "9979483\r\nSievers\r\n\r\nA recent advance of the theory of nonlinear excitations in discrete lattices was the discovery that some localized vibrations in perfectly periodic lattices can be stabilized in bulk crystals, at their surfaces or at their edges by lattice discreteness.  Because these excitations display nanoscale dimensions and are predicted to move through the lattice their experimental generation and observation is of paramount interest.  To this end the proposed  experimental study of nonlinear spin lattice systems has definite advantages because the dissipation of spin waves in magnetic materials is weak compared to that of lattice vibrations in crystals. Consequently, large amplitude excitations are more readily obtainable and one objective of this project is to examine experimentally the physical properties of such localized excitations in antiferromagnets.  In addition to generation and detection it is also important to explore the propagation and transport properties of intrinsic localized modes.  Depending on the successes found for magnetic excitations, experimental studies of intrinsic localization associated with macroscopic and quantum systems will also be explored.  The general feature that such localization in periodic lattices depends only on nonlinearity plus discreteness ensures that graduate and undergraduate students working in this area will have training in nonlinear dynamics spanning a variety of length scales, ranging from the nano- to the macroscopic one.\r\n%%%\r\nThis experimental program is directed at probing the underlying simplicity of the dynamics of nonlinear periodic physical systems, which range from studies of large amplitude excitations in atomic lattices to those in micro electrical mechanical arrays.  Graduate and undergraduate students working in this new research area will have training in condensed matter nonlinear dynamics involving all the technologically important length scales.\r\n***\r\n",
