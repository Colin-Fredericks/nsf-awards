 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary thrusts of this research are to help improve human-computer interaction methodologies, develop new interface modes, make physics-based interaction accessible to all users, and enhance the capabilities of graphical modelers. To these ends, the PI is focusing on the interactive manipulation and direct sculpting of Subdivision Splines (S-splines) through the integration of physics-based interaction with powerful subdivision geometry, both in terms of its theoretical aspects and its practical aspects in visual computing applications. The novel, dynamic framework of s-splines will not only augment well-established NURBS-based design technologies but also generalize newly developed theory and methodology of physics-based modeling in the practice of modeling and design. The ultimate goal is to develop software environments that can greatly facilitate human-computer interaction through the physics-based modeling of graphical entities. This work will broaden the accessibility of graphical modeling by combining conventional geometric models with computational physics and applied mathematics, thus offering novel interactive methodologies based on realistic model behavior.",
