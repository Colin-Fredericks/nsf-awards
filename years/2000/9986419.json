The project is structured to increase our understanding of how teachers at the middle school level can incorporate electronic technology and whether their students learn mathematics and science concepts more effectively through the use of the technology.  The materials address two important science standards at the middle school level:  force and motion, and transfer of energy.  The units are constructed to enhance or replace modules in other curricula.  They support data collection and analysis, integration of mathematics, understanding changes and modeling.  Measurements are made using inexpensive, but sensitive, probeware connected to handheld computers.  The Pedagogica software adds scaffolding, guided inquiry and student assessment to the probeware.  Student learning of complex relationships can be facilitated by the use of probeware.  Models and simulations allow students to explore behavior that is difficult to understand by traditional means.  Teacher support materials encourage teachers change practice for a few weeks.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
