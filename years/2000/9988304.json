Shvartsman\r\nThis research investigates algorithmic approaches to robust building blocks for parallel computing. The research direction is based on the idea that parallel solutions to computational problems can be formulated as compositions of building blocks, components that encapsulate efficient and fault-tolerant parallel implementations of well-defined computation primitives. Building blocks come equipped with precise specifications of their compositionality, and in general provide services at a higher level of abstraction than the operations made available by common parallel programming languages. A major goal of this research is to provide provably efficient building blocks that help the designers of complex parallel applications to concentrate on algorithm design while freeing them from the need to perpetually consider the problem of efficient and effective mapping of the algorithms expressed in some notation to a specific target machine. Traditionally, research in the distributed computing field has concentrated on fault-tolerance, while parallel computing research has taken speed-up as its main focus. This research synthesizes these two foci, and together with the building block methodology, it yields an approach to computing with multiple processors that obtains scalable parallel speed-up, while providing correctness and compositionality guarantees, and enabling graceful degradation in the face of failures. By combining the research on robust parallel computing with the building blocks approach to constructing complex systems, this work intends to substantially advance the state-of-the-art in the theory of effective and efficient parallel computing. Towards this end this research program deals with robust (i.e., efficient and fault-tolerant) algorithms, lower bounds that define the limits for achieving our efficiency goals, composable building blocks that encapsulate key algorithms, and program simulations and transformations that allow to efficiently execute programs specified at a high level of abstraction on the available parallel platforms.",
