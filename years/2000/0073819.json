 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing is an important traffic engineering mechanism for providing requisite services for many emerging applications on the Internet.  In QoS routing, paths for flows are selected based upon knowledge of the resource availability (referred to as QoS State) at network nodes (i.e., routers) and the QoS requirements of the flows.  It is expected that QoS routing will choose, among the many possible choices, a path that has sufficient resources to accommodate the QoS requirement of a given flow.  Because of its awareness of the network QoS state, QoS routing, if done appropriately, can significantly improve network throughput.\r\n     In this proposal, the researchers present a novel approach to QoS routing -the localized QoS routing approach.  Unlike the conventional global QoS routing approach that requires network-wide exchange of QoS states among routers, the proposed localized routing approach attempts to infer the network QoS state from locally collected flow statistics such as flow arrival/departure rates and flow blocking probabilities, and performs path selection based on this local information.  As a result, the proposed localized QoS routing approach avoids the drawbacks of the conventional global QoS approach such as degraded performance in the presence of inaccurate routing information.  Furthermore, it has the advantage of minimal communication overhead, no processing overhead at core routers, and easy deployability.\r\n     The researchers propose to study and develop localized QoS routing algorithms using a novel adaptive proportional routing framework.  Adaptive proportional routing exploits the inherent randomness in path selection by proportioning flows among multiple paths between a source and a destination.  Flow proportions are determined based on the perceived quality of these paths, and are dynamically adjusted in response to the changing network conditions.  Using adaptive proportional routing framework, the researchers will focus on the following aspects of their localized QoS routing approach.\r\n     Theoretical Foundations:  The researchers plan to develop theoretical models under which the behavior of localized QoS routing can be studied and analyzed.  Their insights will then be used to guide the design of practical schemes.\r\n     Proportional Source Routing:  The researchers will develop proportional source routing schemes using local flow statistics collected either at route-level or link-level.  Through theoretical analysis and simulations, the researchers will study the adaptivity and stability of these schemes.\r\n     Proportional Next-hop Routing:  The researchers also will explore applicability of localized adaptive proportional routing to hop-by-hop path selection and will develop proportional next-hop flow routing schemes using locally gathered aggregate flow statistics.\r\n     Hierarchical Proportional Routing:  The researchers plan to study methods for topology and QoS state aggregation using the localized adaptive proportional routing framework, and to develop hierarchical proportional routing schemes using a combination of proportional source routing and proportional next-hop routing.\r\n     Proportional Hybrid Routing:  The researchers will develop hybrid QoS routing schemes that 1) combine infrequent global QoS update mechanisms and localized flow proportioning methods, and 2) integrate on-line path selection with off-line traffic engineering/flow placement. The fundamental trade-off between the system overhead, the time scale of control and the system performance will be investigated in these contexts.\r\n     Implementation:   The researchers plan to implement the proposed localized QoS routing schemes in a testbed.  They will measure the performance and processing overhead of these schemes under real traffic settings.\r\n     The deliverables from the research effort will include journal and conference publications, technical reports and memorandums, Internet Drafts, and software prototype implementation.\r\n",
