It is time for a multi-disciplined approach given the complexity, apparent non-linearity, and feed-back-type of processes involved. Some combination of intensive, process-oriented, field studies, large-scale ocean surveys and comprehensive modeling will most likely be required to advance our understanding of the DMS-climate link. Unlike previous DMS research, we propose to study simultaneously all known processes that regulate DMS concentration in seawater, leading to its sea-air flux. Also novel will be the inclusion of modeling from the outset, the ultimate goal of which will be the refinement of a DMS submodel that can be included in comprehensive and predictive global climate-system models. An ecological DMS model already exists and global scale DMS modeling has been done with GCMs [Erickson et al., 1990] and data compilations [Kettle et al., 1999]; however, much more work needs to be done, especially if a \"big picture\" understanding is to emerge. \r\n\r\nDeveloping an effective, detailed plan of research will require the coordination of a diverse set of investigators and a comprehensive review of the state of DMS science. This is a request for incubation funds to support a review of our current understanding of DMS dynamics in seawater and a workshop on DMS dynamics in seawater. \r\n",
