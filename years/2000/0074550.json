 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant for Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI).  The understanding and prediction of the physical properties of domain structures which arise in a ferroic phase transition are based on an analysis of the properties and interrelationships of the associated crystallographic symmetries.  To provide a basis for the classification of domain pairs and domain twins, the PI has derived and tabulated both the magnetic and non-magnetic subperiodic groups.  This work will be continued and extended with a new tabulation of the magnetic space groups and a determination of the relationship between the magnetic space groups and magnetic subperiodic groups which is fundamental for the analysis of the relationship between domain structures and their domain walls.\r\n\r\nAlso to be derived will be all of the magnetic twin laws, groups that express the symmetry relationships between two simultaneously observed magnetic domain states (domain pair) and  are used to determine physical properties that can distinguish between the observed magnetic domains.  The PI will also determine a classification of magnetic domain pairs where all domain pairs in a single class can be distinguished by the same set of physical property tensors, and determine in which ferroic phase transition such magnetic domain pairs arise.  In the context of domain engineering the PI will classify sets of domain states, determining their symmetry and predicting their physical properties.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate students will participate in these research projects.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is a grant for research at an undergraduate institution (RUI) which involves the participation of undergraduate students.  The focus of the research is on tabulating and applying group theory to problems involving phase transitions in ferroelectrics. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
