 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whereas decoding the entire genomes of procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms was a major\r\nbiological challenge of the nineties, this new decade seeks to capture an understanding of the\r\nprotein interactions of a cell. This understanding has the potential to yield enormous societal\r\nbenefit via predictions of total cellular responses to new pharmaceutical compounds, infectious\r\nagents, environmental toxins, or disruptions in particular regulatory pathways. The research\r\ndescribed in this proposal aims to address this grand challenge by establishing a fundamentally\r\nnew and highly sensitive optical measurement technique that permits rapid, simultaneous\r\ndetection and quantification of multiple protein molecules involved in regulating intracellular\r\nsignaling pathways.\r\n\r\nThe research described in this proposal fuses principles of optics in liquid crystalline\r\nmedia with the design of nanostructured surfaces to create a fundamentally new optical tool that\r\nhas the potential to be broadly applicable to studies aimed at unraveling the complex behavior of\r\ncellular systems at the protein level. The first goal is to establish the use of biophotonic methods\r\nbased on liquid crystals for analysis of key regulatory signaling pathways in cells. Such a\r\ntechnology could impact drug discovery, pharmacodynamic monitoring, regulation of gene\r\nexpression, protein-protein interactions, and our understanding of carcinogenesis. The second\r\nbroad goal is to demonstrate that liquid crystals can form the basis of a general and powerful\r\nmethodology that permits detection of post-translational modifications to proteins. Because the\r\nidentification of specific chemical modifications of a protein can reveal its cellular location,\r\nbiological lifespan and activation status, classification of proteins by their post-translational\r\nmodification would be enormously useful in studies elucidating the complex behavior of cells.\r\n\r\nWe propose to explore the use of liquid crystals to monitor cellular expression and\r\nactivation of regulatory signaling proteins such as Ras, and to detect the interaction of Ras with\r\ntarget proteins in the multiple signaling pathways that mediate its biological activity. Although\r\nour initial focus will be on detecting the binding of Ras to anti-Ras IgG and, when activated, its\r\nbinding to the down stream effector molecular RAF1, this system is prototypical and will,\r\ntherefore, be generalizable to a broad class of regulatory signaling proteins. We propose to\r\ndemonstrate the generality of the methodology by using liquid crystals to screen simultaneously\r\nfor post-translational modifications of multiple proteins involved in a common regulatory\r\npathway.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will design surfaces that permit coupling of biomolecular recognition\r\nevents between total Ras and anti-Ras IgG, and between activated Ras and RAF1, to the\r\norientations of liquid crystals. Second, we will determine the sensitivity and capability to\r\nquantitate photonic methods based on liquid crystals using as examples detection of total Ras\r\nand activated Ras. Third, we will integrate photonic principles based on liquid crystals with\r\nmicrofluidics so as to minimize sample size and enable detection of minute amounts of\r\ncaptured proteins (~104 molecules). We will provide simultaneous measurement of total Ras and\r\nactivated Ras, and integrate the delivery of the sample and the liquid crystal. Fourth, we will\r\ndemonstrate the generality of the above described methodology based on liquid crystals by\r\nrapidly screening for the post-translational modifications of multiple proteins involved in a\r\ncommon regulatory pathway (MAPK, JNK, ERK 1/2).\r\n\r\nAlthough the principles we propose to develop are broadly applicable to fundamental\r\nstudies in cell and molecular biology, they also have the potential for a tremendous impact on\r\nbiomedical investigators. One such example is in the detection of the activation states of\r\nintracellular regulatory proteins. It is the activation state of these proteins that determines which\r\nintracellular signaling cascades are initiated, and these in turn determine the fundamental\r\nbehaviors of cells. As such, the rapid determination of the activation states of these regulatory\r\nproteins will represent a boon to the study of diverse medical conditions that result from\r\ninappropriate signaling events such as those linked to neoplastic transformation and immune\r\nmediated disorders.\r\n",
