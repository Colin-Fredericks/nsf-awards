 "awd_abstract_narration": "In all graph algorithms, graphs are encoded by binary strings.\r\nThe problem of encoding graphs by binary strings is a fundamental\r\nproblem in computer science. To be useful in graph algorithms,\r\nan encoding of a graph G should be as short as possible and\r\nsupport various graph queries and operations. The well known\r\nadjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations are used by\r\nvirtually all existing graph algorithms. However, they do not satisfy\r\nall of these requirements. New graph encoding schemes satisfying all\r\nof these requirements for various graph families will be developed.\r\nOnce such an encoding scheme for a graph family is found, it will be\r\npossible to improve and/or simplify existing algorithms for solving\r\nproblems on this graph family. In addition to graph algorithms, the\r\nshort encoding of plane triangulations (i.e. triangular meshes) has\r\nimportant applications in Computer Graphics.\r\n\r\nA planar graph may have many plane embeddings. For some applications,\r\nit is often required to find an embedding such that certain properties\r\nare satisfied. These problems arise from areas such as VLSI design,\r\nGeographic Information Systems, and some graph optimization problems.\r\nExisting algorithms for solving these problems rely on dynamic\r\nprogramming and are not efficient. In this research project we will\r\ndevelop more efficient algorithms and explore their applications.\r\n\r\nA common technique is used in several recent algorithms for solving\r\ngraph drawing and floor-planning problems: Labeling vertices or edges\r\nof a graph so that certain regular properties are satisfied; then\r\nsolving the problems by using the combinatorial structures resulting\r\nfrom the labeling. We will extend this technique and use it to solve\r\nother problems in these fields.",
