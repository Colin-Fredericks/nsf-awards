The goal of the proposed work is to \r\nimprove our theoretical understanding of this generation mechanism with \r\nparticular emphasis on three-dimensional nonlinear disturbances. To this \r\nend, an asymptotic theory will be developed to describe the generation of \r\nfinite-amplitude disturbances by nearly uniformly stratified flow over \r\nthree-dimensional topography that is more elongated in the spanwise than \r\nin the streamwise direction.  The proposed theory makes it possible to \r\nexplore certain features of fully nonlinear waves --- for instance, how \r\nwave breaking is influenced by three-dimensional effects --- that, although \r\nof primary geophysical interest, so far have defied theoretical treatment. \r\nMoreover, the mathematical approach taken here is distinct from prior \r\nstudies and promises to advance our understanding of nonlinear internal \r\nwave propagation from a mathematical standpoint as well.\r\n\r\nInternal gravity waves are common features in oceans, lakes and in the \r\natmosphere.  They owe their existence to the density stratification present \r\nin these natural fluid bodies due to variations in temperature and changes \r\nin the salinity (in the case of oceans) and pressure (in the case of the \r\natmosphere).  Geophysical internal waves are known to possess enormous \r\nscales, on the order of kilometers to hundreds of kilometers, so it is not \r\nsurprising that they are important factors in determining local weather \r\npatterns and climate dynamics.  The proposed work will provide a \r\nmathematical description of the generation of internal waves by flow over \r\ntopography, modeling the action of wind over mountain ranges in the \r\natmosphere or the flow of currents over a sill in the ocean bottom. \r\nEmphasis is placed on particular flow conditions under which internal-\r\nwave generation is most violent and is expected to play an important part \r\nin geophysical applications (e.g., the development of thunderstorms).\r\n",
