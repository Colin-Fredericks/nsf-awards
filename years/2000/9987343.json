 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides educational opportunities to low-income academically talented students through scholarships that promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement. The scholarship program leads to a bachelor's degree in computer science, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics in two years. \r\n\r\nThe program provides financial support, personal and professional development assistance for transfer students from area community colleges, and dual degree transfer students in math, science, pre-engineering programs from one historically black college. The students are pursuing careers in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe selected twenty-five scholars each receive an annual stipend and personal and professional development assistance from two mentors. This includes one mentor from industry and one faculty mentor. These two mentors closely monitor the progress of the student both in school and professionally. They offer advice, encouragement, and academic assistance. The mentors advise the student concerning course selection, personal and professional issues, and encourage participation in professional technical societies. The program manager monitors and tracks the academic progress of the students, maintains contact with the mentors, and as necessary, arranges for individual tutorial assistance. Following the first year the scholar experiences the excitement of work or research at a local industry, with faculty, or a national enterprise. The employment or research experience will strongly complement their academic progress and enhance learning. The project will increase the number of low income students, women and minorities pursuing full time undergraduate engineering and science studies, thereby increasing graduates to help meet the future work-force needs of the nation's technological enterprise. \r\n",
