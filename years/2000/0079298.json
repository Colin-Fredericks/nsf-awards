 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award will support a US-Czech collaboration on studies of a recently discovered novel nuclear myosin.  The funds (provided from the Division of International Programs) will be used strictly to promote and facilitate the international component of the research.  \r\n\r\nDr. de Lanerolle and his collaborator, Dr. Pavel Hozak in Prague, Czech Republic have already demonstrated the presence of a myosin I like protein in the nucleus.  This protein has an apparent molecular weight of 120,000, it is associated with K+-EDTA ATPase activity, it binds calmodulin, it is photoaffinity labelled with ATP, it binds actin in the absence, but not the presence, of ATP and it is recognized by an antibody to myosin I purified from adrenal glands.  Microsequencing of the 120 kDa protein has positively identified it as a member of the myosin I-beta subfamily of the myosin superfamily of actin based molecular motors.  The microsequencing data was used to clone the cDNA for this protein.  Both methods have demonstrated the presence of a 16 amino acid N-terminal extension that is unique to the 120 kDa protein.  Other data suggest that the unique 16 amino acid extension is responsible for the nuclear localization of nuclear myosin I and that nuclear myosin I associates with RNA polymerase II and is involved in transcription.  \r\n\r\nDrs. de Lanerolle and Hozak now propose to continue this international collaboration to explore these findings further.  Co-localization and functional assays will be performed in Dr. Hozak's laboratory in Prague, using plasmids, antibodies  and other reagents developed in Dr. de Lanerolle's laboratory in Chicago.  To facilitate this collaboration, Dr. Hozak's students will be trained in molecular biology methods in Dr. De Lanerolle's laboratory and Dr. de Lanerolle's students will be trained in advanced microscopy and microinjection methods and in situ transcription assays in Dr. Hozak's laboratory. \r\n\r\n",
