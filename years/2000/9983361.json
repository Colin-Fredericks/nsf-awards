 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to integrate two superconducting technologies (rapid-single-flux-quantum (RSFQ) and long-Josephson junction (LJJ))  to build a wide-bandwidth digitizer with on-chip clocking. The performance of a Flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can be enhanced by replacing the external high-frequency clock generator with an on-chip clock with very low timing jitter. In Phase I, we demonstrated an on-chip 10-50 GHz RSFQ clock source using an LJJ resonator with a quality factor of 106. We also built a clock selector circuit that allows the user to select different clock frequencies. We also implemented ballistic transport of SFQ pulses on impedance-matched striplines. In Phase II, we will integrate the high-quality LJJ oscillator along with associated circuitry with a Flash ADC through a hybrid stripline/JTL (Josephson transmission line) clock distribution network. A phase-locked loop (PLL) will be built to synchronize the LJJ oscillator with an external stable low-frequency reference to ensure long-term stability. The LJJ oscillator together with the PLL will constitute a self contained clock module capable of generating 10-100 GHz SFQ clock with femtosecond time jitter. This universal clock module can be used in almost all future superconducting electronic circuits and systems.\r\n\r\n A transient digitizer instrument capable of sampling rates above 10 GSamples/s is not commercially available today, in spite of a growing demand in fields such as inertial confinement fusion and high-energy physics. HYPRES is developing such an instrument focusing on the $630M/year market for digitizer instruments. Elimination of expensive multi-GHz external clock generators will simplify the digitizer design, lower power consumption, simplify packaging and reduce its cost. Other applications of a wideband ADC include communication signal processors and microscan receivers. A by-product of the Phase II work will be a self-contained multi-GHz clock module that can be used as on-chip clock for a variety of superconducting circuits, including processors for a petaflops-scale supercomputer currently being developed. The LJJ oscillator coupled with the fluxon sender circuit, developed in Phase I, can be used for building instantaneous clock recovery and data re-timing circuits for handling burst-mode data in data communication networks.\r\n",
