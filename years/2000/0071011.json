 "awd_abstract_narration": "In previous work, the PI introduced the study of algebraic geometric\r\ncodes over local Artinian rings, and the first main goal of this\r\nproject is to further the understanding of these objects.  In\r\nparticular, the investigator studies the minimum squared Euclidean\r\nweight of these codes.  This quantity is closely related to an\r\nexponential sum, where the sum is over points on the curve (defined\r\nover the ring) used in the construction of the code.  Thus, the\r\nquestion of the error-correcting capability of these codes is reduced\r\nto a question in number theory.  Results have already been obtained by\r\nthe investigator and a colleague in the two special cases where the\r\ncurve involved is either the Serre-Tate canonical lift of an ordinary\r\nelliptic curve or a plane curve with a single point at infinity.  The\r\nPI is continuing this work with the goal of studying the squared\r\nEuclidean weight and associated exponential sum for more general\r\ncurves.  Additionally, the PI is working towards the development of a\r\ndecoding algorithm for these codes, with respect to the squared\r\nEuclidean weight.  The second main goal of the project involves the\r\nsearch for a structure theory of codes, a topic which has been around\r\nalmost from the beginning of the study of codes.  This search was\r\nlargely unsuccessful until the introduction of so-called critical\r\nindecomposable codes in a recent paper of Assmus. The PI is developing\r\nthis theory further and demonstrating its power by revisiting the\r\nclassification of self-dual codes.\r\n\r\nWhenever data is transmitted across a channel, errors are bound to\r\noccur.  The goal of coding theory is to find efficient ways of adding\r\nredundancy so that errors can be detected, or even corrected.  Two\r\nbasic questions must be asked about every code: \"What is the\r\nerror-correcting capability of this code?\" and \"If an error occurs in\r\ntransmission while using this code, is there an efficient way of\r\nrecovering the original codeword?\"  In the case that code is defined\r\nover the ring of integers modulo a power of a prime, the\r\nerror-correcting capability of the code is measured in terms of the\r\ncode's minimum squared Euclidean weight and the investigator studies\r\nthis property in the case of algebraic geometric codes.  The problem\r\nof recovering the original codeword is equivalent to finding a\r\ndecoding algorithm for the code, which has important connections to\r\ncryptography also.  Finally, a structure theory for codes allows the\r\nstudy of codes from a systematic point of view.  In particular,\r\nself-dual codes often achieve a good balance between error-correcting\r\ncapability and efficiency, and a structure theory allows a new attack\r\nfor the study of these objects.\r\n",
