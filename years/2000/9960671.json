 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will facilitate the development of gasoline and diesel fuel biodesulfurization (BDS). Recent domestic and international targets have been set to reduce the leads in fuel to less than 100 ppm (present regulations are over 300 ppm). Conventional hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is costly and works poorly at these low concentrations of sulfur. In this program we will develop stable non-wetting membrane contactors to provide bubbleless oxygen delivery to grow bacteria for BDS of gasoline and other fuels. Providing non-flammable oxygen delivery is major obstacle to commercial development of gasoline based BDS. Present oxygen delivery technologies introduce oxygen bubbles to fuel, but our membrane is hypothesized to dissolve oxygen directly into liquid. Also, unlike conventional microporous membranes,\r\nour membranes should not wet out over time. This new technology, if successful, should help make BDS viable commercial alternative to HDS allowing gasoline producers to further reduce sulfur levels with low cost high quality process. In Phase I, we will demonstrate process using dibenzothiophene as surrogate fuel. We will measure rate of oxygen transfer and sulfur conversion. Economic analysis and durability testing will verify potential of process.",
