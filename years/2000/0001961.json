 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project investigates specific aspects of the mental computation of verbal morphology in speakers of Spanish as a first language, and speakers of English as a second language. The project is framed within a research program directed by Michael Ullman. The program investigates the computational and neural underpinnings of two capacities that characterize language: the mental lexicon of memorized words, and the mental grammar of rules that specify how lexical forms combine into larger sequences. It tests the 'dual-system' hypothesis that the lexicon is subserved by associative memory, whereas a symbol-manipulation system underlies grammatical combinations. In contrast, 'single-system' theories posit that all words and rules depend upon associative memory. \r\n\r\nEvidence supporting a dual-system view has come from psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies of morphology. These have shown that irregular forms (e.g. 'dug') are lexically memorized, while regular forms (e.g. 'walked') are computed by grammatical rules. Most studies have examined this distinction in English past-tense inflection, in native English speakers. This project will test the generality of the results in (1) Spanish verbal morphology, which differs substantially from English morphology, in native Spanish speakers; and (2) English past-tense morphology, in Spanish and Chinese native-speaking adult learners of English as a second language.",
