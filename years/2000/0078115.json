This conference will bring together biologists studying plant developmental mechanisms using genetic, genomic and cell biological approaches.  In addition, Dr. Richards plan to highlight two emerging areas:  the evolution of plant developmental programs, and the impact of epigenetic regulation on plant developmental programs, and the impact of epigenetic regulation on plant development and morphology.\r\n\r\nBeyond simply extending a successful conference series, Dr. Richards believe that this FASEB Summer Research Conference can serve two important roles.  First, the meeting will provide an intimate venue conducive to creative interaction among researchers with different expertise and perspectives.  This is particularly important as the maturation of molecular genetic research and the availability of  genomic resources usher in a movement towards more integrated approaches incorporating biochemical and cell biological data.  Second, the FASEB conference will provide opportunity to attend a smaller meeting, where interaction between younger and more established researchers can occur.  Opportunities to attend such conferences are becoming increasingly rare as the field of plant \r\n",
