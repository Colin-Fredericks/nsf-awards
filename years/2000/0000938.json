 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal we consider a large class of discrete-state systems such as traffic networks, manufacturing systems, computer networks, distributed/parallel computing.  A livelock in such systems is a situation when some process is unable to finish because its clients perpetually create more work for it to do after they have been serviced.  This phenomenon is different from that of a deadlock where there is essentially no activity as each process is perpetually in a state of waiting, anticipating the release of resources that are held by other processes.  The issue of deadlock- and livelock-avoidance is particularly important to the synthesis of protocols, routing, cache/memory management, computer operating systems, manufacturing systems, traffic management, operations management of large organizations, etc.  In this proposal, we present a collection of open-problems in the synthesis of supervisory control policies that guarantee liveness (i.e. absence of deadlock and livelock) in Petri net (PN) models of the discrete-state systems described above.   We also present some open-issues in the performance improvement of PN models that are deadlock- and livelock-free under supervision.",
