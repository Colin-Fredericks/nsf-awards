 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been suggested through the use of lesion studies that a specific area of the chick forebrain (the IMHV) is involved in learning and memory. In the lesion technique a brain area is precisely removed (leaving other brain regions intact) and the resulting behavior examined. If an area of the brain is critical for a behavior, then removal of that structure will interfere with that behavior. Previous studies have shown that lesions of the chick forebrain (an area known as the IMHV) produce forgetting in passive avoidance learning, a task in which a chick pecks a bead coated with a bitter liquid. IMHV lesions also impair memory in sickness-conditioned learning (here the chick learns to avoid pecking beads associated with illness). These studies would suggest that the IMHV is important for all types of memory. \r\n\tHowever, recent studies have demonstrated that IMHV lesions do not impair learning of a one-trial, water-bead task (here the chick pecks a bead coated with a positive reward). That is, lesions given before learning do not impair the ability of the chick to learn the task. Both the passive avoidance and the sickness-conditioned learning tasks are aversive and require pecking at beads. The water-bead task requires pecking at beads, but is not aversive (it is appetitive). It is possible that IMHV lesions only impair learning of aversive, pecking tasks. \r\n\tTo test this hypothesis, the project will examine the effects of lesions in non-pecking tasks that are either aversive or appetitive. Chicks can learn, in one trial, to associate a specific \"place\" with either sickness (sickness-conditioned place aversion) or heat reward (place preference learning). The experiments will examine the effects of IMHV lesions in both sickness-conditioned place aversion and place preference learning. Taken together with previous research, these experiments will determine the effects of IMHV lesions on pecking, non-pecking, aversive and appetitive types of learning. \r\n\tThe experiments will be carried out with several undergraduates each year from Dickinson College. This project provides the students with two major skills. The first is practical research, in which the students learn how to perform many of the techniques used in neuroscience research. The other, more important skill, is a change in the student's attitude from consumers to producers of knowledge. The results of the experiments will answer the questions that remain about the functional role of a specific brain area in learning and memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
