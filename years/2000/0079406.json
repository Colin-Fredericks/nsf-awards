Recent  developments  have  made  this problem particularly timely. Massive genome sequencing efforts have lead to an explosion in our knowledge of the primary  sequence  of  proteins.  Unfortunately  it  is still impossible to predict  structure  from   sequence.    In  principle,  a  more  thorough understanding  of  the  folding  process should aid efforts to decipher the code  that  links  sequence  and structure. A detailed understanding of the folding  process  will  also  aid  efforts to rationally modify proteins to enhance desired properties or confer new functions.  \r\n\r\nThe  research  described  in  this  project  focuses  on experimental investigations  of  several  issues in protein folding. The hypothesis that chain  topology  is  the  major  determinant  of  folding  kinetics will be examined  by conducting studies of the folding of two sets of proteins. The folding  kinetics  of  the  C-terminal  domain  of  the  protein L9 will be measured  and  compared  to  theoretical predictions. In the intact protein, this  domain appears to fold much more slowly than predicted by theory. The folding  of  the  isolated  domain  will be studied in order to test if the deviation is caused by interactions with the rest of the protein or is more fundamental.  The  structure  of  the N-terminal domain of RNase HI is very similar  to  the  N-terminal  domain  of  L9 (NTL9) and the folding of this protein will be compared to NTL9. The role of the unfolded state in protein folding  and  stability will be examined using NTL9 as a model system. Each of the six acidic residues in NTL9 with be mutated and the pH dependence of the  stability  determined.  These  measurements  provide information about electrostatic   interactions  in  the  unfolded  state.  The  formation  of electrostatic  interactions  during  the folding process will be studied by conducting  kinetic  measurements  with  this set of mutants. These studies will  be  complimented  by  experiments  that  probe the development of the hydrophobic  core  of  NTL9  during  folding.  Taken  together, the kinetic studies will provide a detailed picture of  the folding of NTL9. \r\n\r\n",
