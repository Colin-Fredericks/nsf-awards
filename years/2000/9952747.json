 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThe New York Learning Standards for Mathematics, Science and Technology (MST) call for changes in the way mathematics and science are taught in the classroom, including in particular an increased emphasis on inquiry-based and problem-based learning. Since these reforms have key implications for teacher preparation programs, this project is obtaining specific computer technology, software, and accompanying data acquisition instrumentation to be configured in a laboratory/classroom environment conducive to inquiry- and problem-based learning and teaching. This resulting MST Laboratory is enabling prospective K-6 teachers to construct the critical links between mathematical analysis and scientific investigation and to develop the technological competence necessary to teach in accordance with the NYS MST Learning Standards. Project activities include adoption, adaptation and implementation of materials and technology for six mathematics- and science- related courses to be taught in the integrated MST Laboratory. These materials and educational practices are being adapted from the Long Island Consortium for Interconnected Learning and other projects in the Mathematical Sciences and their Applications Across the Curriculum Initiative. St. John Fisher College is a founding member of the New York State Coalition (NYSC) which is comprised of some thirty two- and four-year colleges. Dissemination of the results of this project is being facilitated by the NYSC. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
