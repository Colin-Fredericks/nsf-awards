 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies combinatorial problems which arise\r\nin various areas of mathematics.  In joint work with R. Guralnick,\r\nthe investigator examines branched coverings of Riemann surfaces\r\nwhose monodromy groups are the symmetric and alternating groups\r\nS_n and A_n acting on subsets of a fixed size from the n-set. The\r\nmain goals of this project are 1) to show that with a small and known list of exceptions, the genus of the covering surface must grow with both the number of sheets of the covering and the number of branch points, and \r\n2) to determine all such coverings for which the genus of the covering\r\nspace is at most one.\r\nThis project is one of the final steps in a program initiated by\r\nGuralnick and J. Thompson. In addition, the investigator continues his\r\nstudy of monotone graph and hypergraph properties which arise in V.\r\nVassiliev's theory of finite type invariants of knots and ornaments.\r\nFinally, the investigator continues his examination of order complexes\r\nof subgroup lattices of finite groups. He attempts to use topological\r\nmethods to distinguish intervals in subgroup lattices of finite groups\r\nfrom arbitrary finite lattices.  With V. Welker, he investigates the\r\ntopology of the order complexes of subgroup lattices of finite simple\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nThe investigator's main interests are in combinatorics, which is the\r\nstudy of discrete, usually finite mathematical objects.  Combinatorial\r\nobjects arise in various areas of applied mathematics and computer\r\nscience, including communications and the theory of algorithmic\r\ncomplexity.  Also, there are complicated nondiscrete mathematical\r\nobjects which can be better understood by examining associated\r\ncombinatorial objects.  The investigator studies combinatorial objects\r\nwhich arise in this manner.",
