Fleisch, University of California, Riverside\r\n\r\nPROJECT ABSTRACT:\r\nThis research examines architectures, hardware, software, and algorithmic\r\ntechniques to  conserve energy in a distributed system cluster.  The research focuses on\r\nimprovement for better energy conservation. The research encompasses 1) monitoring and analysis and 2)\r\nimprovement for better energy conservation including local optimizations and cluster-wide \r\noptimizations.  For 1), the research will quantify power consumption costs for \r\nvarious configurations of networked systems.  The research will gather and observe traffic in cluster systems that affects energy consumption and performance.  For 2), the research will consider both local optimizations and cluster-wide optimizations that will improve energy conservation. For local optimizations, there will be\r\nlow level improvements in device management, base-level communication algorithms, \r\nsystem daemons, drivers and systems applications. For cluster-wide optimizations, \r\nthe research will consider a global process manager (GPM) similar to a load \r\nbalancer that will move applications between sites based on criteria that includes \r\nboth performance and power savings.  \r\n\r\nThe expected outcome of the research could suggest model topologies, networking technology, and \r\nsoftware modifications for energy efficient distributed systems of the future.  Lastly, the research could \r\nlead to improved algorithms for conventional systems software to operate in a more power-efficient \r\nmanner. \r\n",
