More than 30 senior investigators are in residence each summer at RMBL and many of them have agreed to supervise undergraduates in the REU program.  Students will be given guidance in experimental design, project selection and initiation, and report preparation.  Students will have the opportunity to participate fully in the rich intellectual life of summers at RMBL by attending scientific seminars, REU-related activities, interacting with RMBL scientists, and living in a residential field biology community.  The intellectual progress of each student will be monitored carefully as the summer proceeds and as students move from relative dependence to relative independence in their  research program..  Participants will be encouraged to submit final papers to a new peer-reviewed electronic journal of undergraduate research that will be maintained on the RMBL web site.\r\n\r\nA strength of past RMBL REU programs is the diversity of scientists, the rich intellectual tradition present each summer, and the social  atmosphere that promotes student-scientist interactions.  Senior scientists and graduate students come to RMBL from over 40 institutions ranging from small colleges to major research universities to conduct research in a wide range of evolutionary and ecological disciplines and terrestrial and aquatic foci.  The RMBL is proud of its success in educating  women interested in field biology and in attracting senior female scientists.  Efforts to increase minority student representation at RMBL and in the REU program have been successful in the past and will continue to be a principal focus of recruitment efforts.\r\n\r\n",
