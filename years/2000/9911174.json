The two main modes of industrial catalyst deactivation are poisoning and sintering.  During catalyst sintering, metal may migrate to form larger particles or sintering of the support may lead to encapsulation of the metal.  Sintering is a mode of catalyst deactivation in many applications including automotive catalytic converters and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.  Mechanistic understanding of sintering processes is limited and based primarily on model catalysts.  Several surface techniques are proposed to improve the present state of knowledge; these include small angle x-ray and neutron scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction.  Methods to control the nano-scale surface topology of catalyst supports, based on analytical results, will be developed. Understanding of the redispersion process could suggest strategies where periodic regeneration of the catalyst could be carried out in-situ.  If successful, this project could lead to improved catalyst design for high temperature processes.  \r\n\r\n",
