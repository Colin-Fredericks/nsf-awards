 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Thompson \r\n\r\n\tA confocal laser scanning imaging system will be used by faculty, graduate students, undergraduates and visitors to Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station.  The equipment includes a Zeiss Axiovert SI00 inverted microscope and a Noran Oz confocal scanning system.This equipment will: I) Enhance ongoing faculty research, 2) Promote new research activities, 3) Promote the training of graduate and post-doctoral students in modern methods of optical microscopy in a way that will enhance their research and career\r\ndevelopment, and 4) Strengthen ongoing efforts to permit undergraduate\r\nstudents access to the lasted research techniques.\r\n\tThe confocal imaging system will be used by four principle investigators\r\nto address a number of cell biological questions using methods ranging from\r\nion imaging, sophisticated fluorescence microscopy, high resolution\r\nNomarski DIC,  to morphometry.  One group is investigating the spatial and\r\ntemporal aspects of second messenger signaling in neurons following the\r\nactivation of surface receptors by neurotransmitters, including the\r\ndynamics of Ca2+ and NO signals.  A second group is investigating the\r\ndevelopment and biophysical properties of motor systems in the squid using\r\nneuroanatomical and immunocytochemical methods.  A third study focuses on\r\nthe specializations of fish heater organs and cardiac cells using\r\nimmunocytochemistry and antibodies specific for different isoforms of Ca\r\npumps and myosin  ATPase.  The fourth group uses fluorescence imaging\r\ntechniques to investigate the time course and spatial pattern of NO and\r\nCa2+ during fertilization of the sea urchin egg. \r\n\tThe principle investigators are addressing questions at the leading edge\r\nof their disciplines.  This shared confocal microscopy center adds\r\nsubstantially to their ability to further their science, enhances their\r\nteaching efforts, and increases collaboration with Stanford colleagues and\r\nvisitors from other institutions.  This is in keeping with the role of the\r\nHopkins Marine Station as a regional center for marine biology research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
