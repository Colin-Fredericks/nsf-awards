 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mask aligner is a critical equipment for interdisciplinary researches that require the definition of small-geometry patterns precisely and repeatedly. This proposal is for the acquisition of a state-of-the-art contact/proximity mask aligner for multi-purpose, multi-user researches and education. In addition to conventional exposure and alignment functions, this equipment has the following capabilities: 1) a wide wavelength range of exposure light for resolution requirements, 2) holding varieties types and sizes of substrates for miscellaneous applications, and 3) maintaining constant light intensity for the consistent operation condition.   \r\n\r\nThis mask aligner is used by three research groups in microelectronics, biotechnology, and polymer science. Totally, seventeen graduate students, four undergraduate students, and one post doctoral scholar utilize this equipment for research. The aligner is also an educational tool for new courses, undergraduate or short-term research. Students from diversified backgrounds have been involved in these activities recently. This mask aligner expands research capabilities of other groups in science and engineering fields in the Texas A&M University.\r\n\r\nThe mask aligner is located in the recently upgraded Thin Film Microelectronic Research Laboratory. The university cost-shared 33% of the equipment price as well as complete shipping and installation/training expenses. The equipment's annual maintenance cost is supplied by PI's and co-PIs' other research grants.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
