 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  Five instructional, interactive modules promoting critical thinking, problem-solving skills, understanding, and creativity are in development.  Each module consists of an introductory tutorial via computer, investigative laboratory exercises, and practical applications of learned material.  Module design is inspired by highly acclaimed and NSF-funded BioQUEST projects that give biology students the opportunity to engage in activities like those of practicing scientists.  This project builds on their philosophy but offers increased flexibility in terms of tailoring deliverables to meet specific curricular needs, provides an enhanced visual component incorporating multimedia technology, and correlates presented information with everyday situations with the help of outside professionals brought in to enlighten and/or evaluate students.  Collaborators include faculty and staff from the Biology Department and Math-Science Learning Center at Montgomery College and instructional computer design experts from Catonsville Community College and Digital Consulting and Training, Inc.  Success is being evaluated via short-term and long-term examination of student and faculty academic performance and satisfaction as assessed through a comprehensive evaluation plan.  Project success is being measured by comparing the retention rate of students, particularly those who are economically and educationally disadvantaged, exposed to the revised curriculum with those in the control group.  Furthermore, project success is being measured as behavioral and instructional modification of instructors reflected as active participation in course design and development, enthusiasm, and job satisfaction.  Positive results are being incorporated into undergraduate curricula at Montgomery College as part of the continuous restructuring of introductory science courses.  Project results are being disseminated at the local, regional, and national levels through summer teacher institutes, presentations at education-oriented meetings and five cross-platform interactive modules delivered via the Internet.\r\n\r\n",
