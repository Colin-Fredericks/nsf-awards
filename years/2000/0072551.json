Given \r\nsuch an operator on a compact manifold with boundary it is \r\npossible to characterize those boundary conditions which lead \r\nto a self--adjoint elliptic problem.  These so--called well--posed boundary value problems were introduced by R. T. Seeley. A recent account from a functional analytic perspective was given by the researcher in collaboration with J. Br\\\"uning.  This is the \r\nstarting point of the current project in which the researcher \r\nwants to investigate spectral invariants associated to Dirac \r\noperators on manifolds with boundary. More specifically,\r\nwe want to present an analytic proof of the gluing formula \r\nfor the analytic torsion in the presence of an arbitrary \r\nflat bundle. As a consequence one obtains an alternative \r\napproach to Cheeger--Muller type theorems on the relation \r\nbetween analytical and topological torsion in the most\r\ngeneral setting, including manifolds with boundary.  An \r\ninvariant related to the analytic torsion is the zeta-regularized determinant. We want to study this determinant as a function\r\nof the boundary condition, generalizing earlier work of Burghelea-Friedlander--Kappeler and Scott-Wojciechowski.\r\nThe third subproject, jointly with J. Bruening,  deals with a functional analytic approach to boundary value problems for \r\nDirac type operators. The ultimate goal is to find a simple \r\nfunctional analytic model for a Dirac type operator on a \r\nmanifold with boundary which allows to derive basic results\r\nlike heat trace expansions, index theorems and the spectral\r\nflow theorem. Such a model would hopefully lead to such \r\ntheorems for manifolds with corners.\r\n\r\nDirac type operators are symmetric first order elliptic \r\ndifferential operators arising naturally in Riemannian geometry. \r\nThey are of considerable interest in theoretical physics. \r\nThere are interesting relations between the spectrum of \r\nthe operator (the 'measurable' quantities of the physical \r\nsystem) and the underlying geometry. In general the spectrum \r\nof the operator is hard to compute.  However, it is possible \r\nto extract certain spectral invariants which are intimately \r\nrelated to the geometry. If the underlying geometry is a \r\nmanifold with boundary then, at first, one has to impose \r\nboundary conditions in order to get a self--adjoint problem \r\nand hence a well--defined spectrum. In the current project \r\nthe author wants to investigate certain spectral invariants \r\n(analytic torsion, determinant) for such boundary value \r\nproblems. A special issue is the dependence of the invariants \r\non the choice of the boundary condition.\r\n \r\n",
