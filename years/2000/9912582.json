The meeting will have a session devoted to the August 17, 1999 earthquake centered in Izmit, Turkey, and measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale.  The session is organized by Dr. Robert Reilinger of the Earth, Atmosphere, and Planetary Sciences Department at M.I.T.   The purpose of the session is to exchange data and other information gathered by Turkish and US scientists in the days following that strong quake.   Significant data was obtained in Turkey by the P.I.'s team, under a grant made by NSF/EAR, immediately following the quake.  This earthquake is of special interest to the geophysical community because it represents the latest in a series of earthquakes in this century that ruptured sequentially from east to west along the entire length of the North Anatolian fault (NAF).  The surface offsets for this sequence of earthquakes has been well documented and has provided a wealth of information on the interaction of sequential earthquakes, which has relevance to earthquake processes in general, and to seismic hazard studies in the Istanbul region.  Furthermore, the Izmit earthquake occurred in an area that is being monitored in detail with Global Positioning System observations.  These geodetic observations are providing new information on pre-, co-, and post-seismic deformation.  This information will enhance our understanding of the mechanics of the entire earthquake cycle.  In particular, and because of the similarities between the NAF and the San Andreas fault, the information gained from the Izmit earthquake will aid our understanding of earthquake processes along the San Andreas and other continental transform faults.\r\n\r\nScope:  This project will support participation by key scientists from Turkey, who are actively involved in seismic studies using GPS measurements of ground movement, in an important meeting intended to understand the results from field data collected in the major earthquake of 1999 in Turkey.  Their participation should lead to improvement in the interpretation of the results obtained and in the conclusions to be reached.  The attendance by these scientists should help US geologists and geophysicists with their future research in this field, and would enhance the potential for further collaboration.  The participation of the Turkish scientists will therefore have mutual benefits to all involved in these studies and for future efforts.  The project fits well within the objectives of the Division of International Programs for facilitating the exchange of important scientific data with foreign countries, and for enhancing mutually beneficial international collaboration.  \r\n",
