 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Connecticut Audubon Coastal Center (CACC), which administers the Milford Point Ecosystem Project (MPEF), will undertake a year-long systematic, comprehensive planning program. This program is a major step towards achieving the five-year CACC goal to develop a model field station for the study of coastal ecosystems at Milford Point. To initiate the planning process, the CACC, and its Science Advisory Committee (SAC), has identified three objectives:\r\n1. Upgrade data management and communications systems to state-of-the-art status in order to foster strong multidisciplinary research and education programs.\r\n2. Identify the needs of institutes of higher education to conduct multidisciplinary ecosystem field research and training at CACC facilities; design and implement activities to fill needs\r\n3. Create a framework for partnering in regional research that will draw a broad spectrum of scientists to the Center for research and for research-based education\r\nThe CACC will build on its strong foundation and will use its 32-member expert SAC (section IIIA) to conduct a dynamic, yet logical, planning process to meet these objectives. Activities and products include:\r\n1. Four strategic planning workshops. Each workshop will include invited\r\nconsultants, will concentrate on a single aspect, and will produce a product aimed at\r\naccomplishing the five-year goal: a) assessment of communications and data management systems and of scientific equipment needed to attract and foster interaction among an array of users; prioritized recommendations for next steps; b) development of a series of training workshops and research programs for a multidisciplinary ecosystem approach, with a plan for their implementation; c) guidelines for seeking funding opportunities for research and training and a plan of development; d) framework and five-year plan for building regional partnerships with outside scientific researchers and research facilities.\r\n2. Activities think tank. An outline of activities to complement educators' course offerings will be produced at this meeting.\r\n3. Best practices field study. Innovative models for the integration of estuarine research and education will be explored. In addition, managers and research directors from leading field station sites will be invited to assist the CACC in developing long-term plans for scientific research and training.\r\n4. Communications plan. A plan will be developed to inform potential users about\r\nMPEP and the use of the CACC as a field station. \r\n\r\nThe CACC is dedicated to salt marsh, coastal and estuarine research.  Because of its location at the mouth of the Housatonic River, next to a new and rapidly accreting salt marsh, CACC is well situated to provide access for research and training in coastal ecology.  In addition, the CACC has a strong associations with teachers, colleges, universities and school systems in its own and adjacent counties and along the Housatonic River. This professional infrastructure, along with CACC's unique location, has the potential for making a significant impact on field research and training in urban and suburban coastal ecology.\r\n",
