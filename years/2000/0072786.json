 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0072786 - Craig R. Guilbault\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity and convenience, topologists \r\noften focus on compact spaces. Nevertheless, non-compact \r\nspaces---with all of their associated complications---are \r\nfrequently unavoidable. For example, the complement of a \r\ncompact subset of a closed manifold is not compact. Hence,\r\na topologist studying embeddings is quickly forced to consider non-compact manifolds. In fact, much of the foundational work \r\nin the area of non-compact manifold topology was motivated by \r\nquestions about embeddings.  While non-compact manifolds and \r\ncomplexes continue to play a central role in topology, an \r\nimportant new source of examples has entered the picture.\r\nIncreasingly, the examples of widespread interest arise as \r\ncovering spaces of compact manifolds and cell complexes. \r\nIn fact, progress on some of the most fundamental questions \r\nin geometric topology and geometric group theory demand a \r\nbetter understanding of these types of spaces---most of\r\nwhich are non-compact.  With these examples in mind, this \r\nproject aims to generalize and expand our understanding \r\nof non-compact manifolds and cell complexes. Of particular \r\ninterest are Z-compactifications, structure theorems for \r\nends of non-compact manifolds, and existence and uniqueness\r\nquestions for boundaries of groups.\r\n\r\nMany objects encountered in geometry and topology---like \r\nthe real line and the Euclidean plane---are \"unbounded\" \r\nor \"open\" in nature. These spaces are fundamentally \r\ndifferent from bounded or \"compact\" spaces, such as a\r\nline segment, a circle, or the surface of the earth. \r\nThe extra flexibility permitted by unboundedness opens \r\nthe door to exotic behavior \"near infinity\". There are \r\nmany examples of unbounded spaces that---although\r\nthey are constructed from simple bounded pieces---have \r\nquite complicated geometry and topology near infinity. \r\nOne strategy for investigating such a space is to \r\n\"compactify\" it by adding a boundary at infinity---much \r\nas an artist mentally creates a horizon of vanishing points \r\nto help him draw in perspective. When this is possible, \r\nproperties of the boundary can reveal important characteristics \r\nof the original space. In some sense, the boundary represents \r\na crystallization of the \"topology at infinity\".  Another \r\nstrategy for studying an unbounded space involves breaking \r\nit into a manageable collection of bounded pieces. Ideally, \r\none would like to choose pieces that capture key properties \r\nof the space, thus allowing one to study the non-compact \r\nspace---one compact piece at a time. \r\n",
