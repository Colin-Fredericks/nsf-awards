 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\nThis project is addressing the challenge of curriculum attractiveness and efficiency in fundamental engineering. Its goal is to stimulate interest and enthusiasm among undergraduate students in pre-engineering, engineering, and engineering technology, and to foster more creative thinking and learning styles. Development and testing of one module for statics will result in educational material available on CD-ROM and the Internet which supplements introductory statics courses. The unique feature of this effort is that anthropomorphic machine parts and engineering formulas will interact with each other, with the students, and with audiovisual representations of the world's greatest scientists. Modules are emphasizing methods of system and process identification, pattern analysis and synthesis, simultaneous conditions, engineering modeling and approximation, and the 'teamwork' of these methods in maximizing thinking and learning efficiency. The project is a collaboration between Northern Illinois University and two community colleges, Elgin Community College and Rock Valley College.",
