 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because improved parallel computing requires introduction of quality of service and security into cluster computing environments, the following study and research is incorporated in this effort:  QoS for intracluster scheduling is studies and prototyped; Intrusion Detection Integration with a single cluster environment is studied and prototyped.  Furthermore, since ubiquitous middleware offers a powerful paradigm for integrating resources in common operating environments, Proposers study CORBA interoperation with QoS and parallel computing.\r\n\r\nSeveral specific themes facilitate new science in this work.  Background study on existing QoS-oriented research for LANs and clusters are brought to bear on the current work, including previous work of Proposers involving RSVP and cluster admission controls.  Furthermore, lower middleware for delivering admission-based messaging for clusters is prototyped on a Myrinet SAN (single cluster configuration).  A high-quality implementation of the MPI/RT standard messaging middleware is integrated with QoS-based middleware.  CORBA is studied as a possible parallel processing notation and environment, including potential for peer-to-peer constructs such as in MPI.  Intrusion detection methodologies are converted for use in SAN-based settings, such as Myrinet.  Finally, CORBA uses in hard realtime settings are considered.  New middleware prototyped in this effort are promulgated through the worldwide web.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
