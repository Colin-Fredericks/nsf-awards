 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large number of studies show that animals respond to predation risk by lowering their activity or moving into safer habitats, but little is known about the ecological consequences of these behavioral shifts.  This research project will evaluate the role of behavioral flexibility in mediating species interactions in the food web of ponds and marshes. Freshwater snails move under cover or to the water's surface when confronted with fish or crayfish predators.  This habitat shift may affect the outcome of competition among different species or sizes of snails, force more snails into habitats with other predators, or lead to higher resource levels in dangerous habitats.  Chemical cues can be used to present snails with the perception of risk without affecting snail density, thereby separating the lethal and non-lethal effects of predators on prey. This approach will be used in a series of field experiments, and field observations to measure the non-lethal effects of predators on species interactions.  \r\n\r\nThis project will help establish whether induced behavioral responses are generally important in shaping communities.  The results will further our understanding of how natural communities function, thereby enhancing our ability to manage natural resources and conserve biological diversity.  \r\n\r\n",
