 "awd_abstract_narration": "An International Symposium on Biological Polyesters will be held from September 11-14thm, 2000, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  This conference focuses on developments in the study of biological polyesters, a field at the interface of chemical, materials and biological sciences with direct applications in biotechnology, medicine and basic biological research.  This rapidly expanding field has become the focus of great interest in both industrial and medical sectors, responding to the increasing need for bioinspired and environmentally biodegradable specialty polymers.  Discussions during the planned conference include sessions on recent advance in the understanding and manipulation of synthesis and degradation pathways in different biological systems (plants and microbes) and their impact on polymer design and development.  Practical applications of biological polyesters in fields of medicine, commodities, and chemicals will also be presented in dedicated sessions.  The conference will be attended by approximately 200 academic and industrial scientists from around the world.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award, co-supported by the Division of Materials Research and Bioengineering and Environmental Systems, provides partial support for U.S. participants.\r\n",
