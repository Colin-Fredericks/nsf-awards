The conference is organized under the auspices of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), and will bring together international scientists studying translation and mRNA decay, in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Of key interest to this meeting are exciting new observations focused at interface between translation and decay, and the mechanisms by which these two complicated processes are coordinated. The conference format consists of nine major sessions, five in the morning and four in the evening, spanning five days. An afternoon poster session and two afternoon round-table discussions are included. Afternoon activities and mealtimes represent opportunities for interaction and discussion that might not occur during the more formal oral sessions, especially among junior and senior scientists. There will be approximately 45 invited lecturers, with another 10 selected from the applicants. Special attention will be given to new investigators, as well as women and minorities.   Given rapid developments in this important area, we expect the 2000 conference to foster further exchange, interaction and collaboration among investigators working at different levels in the field.\r\n",
