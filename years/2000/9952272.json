 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) Although separation science is of fundamental importance in many areas of chemical investigations, it is an area which is often neglected or inadequately presented to undergraduate audiences.  Experimental endeavors often do not take full advantage of the features of modern high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrumentation.  Exposure to capillary electrophoresis instrumentation (CE) is extremely limited at the undergraduate level.  Frequently, these pieces of instrumentation are reserved for use in the upper division courses.  This project is addressing the shortcomings of typical undergraduate educational programs in terms of the experience with separations.  Laboratories using HPLC and CE instrumentation are being introduced at both the lower and upper divisional levels.  Students are repeatedly encountering both instruments, and the unique capabilities and limitations of these instruments are being highlighted.  The project is taking experiments from the educational literature and from the research literature and is modifying these experiments so that students investigate the effects when they change experimental parameters.  As students gain in experience as they move from the lower to upper division, their decision making role in the experiments increases.  This is possible because with repeated exposure to the instruments, students are able to explore the different modes of operation of each separation technique.  At the junior and senior level, they choose the methods most appropriate to their particular and individualized samples.  Students are encouraged to collaborate with other student groups.  The expected overall outcome is that students will have a sophisticated understanding of the capabilities and limitations of HPLC and CE separations.  Lower division students who do not complete the full course sequence are gaining an appreciation for the techniques used to analyze mixtures.  Upper division students are able to make intelligent predictions of the effects of various experimental parameters on a given separation.  Perhaps most importantly, they are able to choose the most likely successful approach in terms of column type, mobile phase, and derivatization chemistry for a given analysis.  The evaluation plan includes a component that will track the impact of this repeated exposure by students to the instrumentation on the ability of the students to develop increasing sophistication in designing effective separations using HPLC and CE. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
