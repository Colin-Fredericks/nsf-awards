 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) \r\n\r\nThis project provides learner-centered instruction for non-science majors that promotes critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity among students through the use of \"high technology\" (multimedia, virtual lab activities, and web-delivered instructional materials) and \"high touch\" (collaborative learning, active learning, directed wet laboratory activities, and small group sessions).  The focus of this project is on lecture and laboratory curriculum development, equipment acquisition, faculty development, and laboratory improvement.  The revitalized curriculum, enhanced teaching, and improved laboratory setting prepare students better for advanced science courses, teaching careers, technical training and, most importantly, improve science literacy and application in the home, workplace, and world.  The major project outcomes are:  (a) a revitalized, transformed General Biology Curriculum that includes a \"high technology\" and \"high touch\" approach leading to higher student retention and success in biology; (b) hands-on student and faculty experience with computers, the Internet, distance learning, WebCT, CD-ROM, DVD, and other advanced technology; (c) a Faculty Teaching and Learning Biology Resource Library for part-time and full-time faculty; (d) faculty development in application of current teaching and learning practices; (e) enhanced preparation of potential K-12 teachers by increasing knowledge of and access to technological resources (Penick, 1995); and (f) improved science literacy among students (Uno & Bybee, 1994).  This project builds on and adapts the NSF-funded Workshop Biology program at the University of Oregon that incorporated active and collaborative learning into the classroom.  The PCC model adapts elements of Workshop Biology into a community college setting with an added emphasis on student group work.\r\n\r\n",
