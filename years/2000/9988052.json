 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Drs. Gregory R. Cook, Mukund Sibi and other members of the Chemistry Department at the North Dakota State University in establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002, 36 undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting summer research under the supervision of Chemistry faculty. Participants will take part in a professional development program including: seminars by off-campus speakers and North Dakota faculty, workshops on scientific writing and graduate study and field trips to corporate and government laboratories. Participants will be involved in research projects along with graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, research staff, other undergraduates and their faculty mentors. In partnership with Dakota Technologies, Inc, research internships in a corporate lab will also be available to participants. Students will participate in biweekly research group meetings as well as present a formal talk and a poster on their research. Students will achieve a realistic understanding of the demands of independent chemical research and gain self confidence in pursuing such studies.",
