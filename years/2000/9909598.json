The workhorse of two radiogenic isotope  research groups in the Department of Geological  Sciences for  over  a  decade,  this mass spectrometer  has  the  \"Multi-1\" collector block with six old-design, short-life Faraday cups  that are  moved manually. Because of their advanced age and throughput, the  Faraday  detectors  have  suffered  some  damage  leading  to degradation  in gain and peak shape. The net result of  this  wear and tear is poor precision and reproducibility in the measurements of  Sr  and Nd isotopic ratios. In addition, electronic components in the instrument have aged and are beginning to impose disruptive downtimes.  Most  critical  of  these  are  the  Solatron  digital voltmeters  (DVM's), which are known to become temperamental  with age and have been the source of frustrations in many other isotope labs.  Solatron  DVM's are no longer manufactured,  and  therefore finding adequate parts to fix them has become a problem. In  order to  lengthen  the service of this mass spectrometer,  the  Faraday detectors, the Daly detector and the DVM's need to be replaced  by their more modern equivalents, which have superior performance  in stability,  sensitivity  and durability.  Modest  funds  are  also requested   to  purchase  a  filament  outgasser  for  this   mass spectrometer.  The  mass spectrometer and its periphery  equipment are  critically  important  to  the research  of  several  faculty members, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students as detailed in the proposal.\r\n***\r\n",
