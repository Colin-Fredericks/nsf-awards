The programs will show how writing is a different thing from speech, and how it did not evolve, like speech, but had to be invented.  The goal of the project is to inform a wide, general audience about the most important technological invention since the beginning of civilization, to introduce them to the science of writing systems (grammatology), and to create an original \"Introduction to Writing\" for colleges and high schools.  \r\n\r\nDuring this planning phase, the staff will conduct the research needed to bring order and focus to the topic and develop a treatment for presenting the topic in the two films.  The PI and his colleagues would draw upon the wisdom of numerous experts in the field of science of writing including three world renowned scholars:  William Bright, University of Colorado, Professor Emeritus, UCLA, and editor of \"Written Language and Literacy;\"  Peter Daniels, author, scholar, lecturer on grammatology, and editor of \"The World's Writing Systems;\" and Victor Mair, Professor of Chinese at U-Penn.  On the literary side, writers to be interviewed in the planning phase include Kurt Vonnegut, Elmore Leonard, and Helen Vendler.   Specific costs involved in the nine-month planning phase include travel; producer, writer, and researcher fees; fees to consultants; and mini conferences of experts.\r\n\r\n",
