The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Peter M. Abbamonte with support for twelve months work with Dr. George A. Sawatzky at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.  His project is entitled \"Novel Resonant Soft X-Ray Scattering from Correlated Electron Systems.\"  This project is co-funded by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI and his host propose to use novel x-ray scattering techniques to study charge and spin ordering in correlated electron systems.  Initially they plan to measure the incommensurate phases and also the magnetic flux-line lattice in High Tc superconductors using resonant soft x-ray diffraction.  This will be done with a unique UHV diffractometer of their design.  This is a completely new spectroscopic technique that they believe will someday be standard in synchrotrons around the world.  Their hope is to begin a new sub-field of structure determination techniques.\r\n\r\nDrs. Abbamonte and Swatzky will be working for part of the duration at the European Synchrotron Research Facility in Grenoble, France.  Dr. Sawatzky has expertise in core spectroscopy and many-body theory, UHV techniques and x-ray spectroscopy.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
