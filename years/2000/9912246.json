The students will learn about the process of conducting research through participation in large ongoing research projects in physical and environmental oceanography, coastal hydrodynamics, and offshore engineering.  Students will be matched with faculty mentors and will undertake self-contained research projects within the context of the larger research program.  Dissemination of the research results will be emphasized; all students will participate in research group meetings, prepare and present reports on their work at undergraduate research symposia, with the participation of Chinese graduate and undergraduate students. Host institutions in China include the Ocean University of Qingdao and Dalian University of Technology. \r\n\r\nExperience working with fellow students and colleagues in a research environment overseas will contribute to creating an internationally engaged and competitive science and technology workforce, and to fostering a global approach to science and solving environmental problems.\r\n",
