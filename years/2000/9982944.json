The mechanisms involved are largely\r\nunknown.  In C. elegans embryos, polarized cell division causes key mRNAs to\r\nbe translated in localized domains, which in turn creates differences\r\nbetween early blastomeres.  The translation of glp-1 mRNA is restricted to\r\nanterior cells by regulatory elements in its 3' untranslated region (3'\r\nUTR).  GLP-1 protein is a conserved membrane receptor that is required for\r\nanterior development. The central hypothesis is that glp-1 mRNA is\r\ncontrolled by a regulatory system that is connected to asymmetric cell\r\ndivision and contributes to embryonic polarity. For this project, the\r\nfollowing questions will be addressed. (1) What are the gene products that\r\nrestrict the translation of glp-1 mRNA to anterior cells of the embryo?   A\r\nnovel functional screen will be used to clone new genes that control GLP-1\r\nlocalization and early polarity.  (2)What are the roles of these gene\r\nproducts in the control of translation and polarity?  Mutations in these\r\ngenes will be used to examine their function in early embryogenesis.\r\nAntibody and mRNA probes will be used to examine the pathways that lead to\r\nlocalized expression of cell fate regulators in the embryo.  RNA binding\r\nassays will be used to determine if new proteins control, or are components,\r\nof factors that bind to the glp-1 3' UTR and regulate translation. These\r\nexperiments will lead to the discovery of the molecular networks that\r\nconnect cell polarity and cell division to the control of mRNA translation.\r\nBecause the few known components are conserved between nematodes and\r\nmammals, this project will likely uncover fundamental mechanisms of mRNA\r\nregulation and cell specification, processes that are critical to human\r\ndevelopment and health.  In addition, this work may lead to novel strategies\r\nto control the expression of genes that influence human disease.  Finally,\r\nthis work could also lead to new ways of controlling nematode parasites\r\nharmful to agriculture or human health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
