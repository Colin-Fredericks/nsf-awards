 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nSINGULAR CONTROL OF DIFFUSION PROCESSES\r\nAND ITS APPLICATIONS TO THE MODELS OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS\r\n\r\nThe proposed research lies within the area of optimal\r\nstochastic control. It deals with optimal control of\r\ndiffusion processes by means of singular with respect\r\nto time functionals.  This type of control naturally\r\nappears in the problems in which there is no natural\r\nrestriction on the rates of control and  as a result\r\nthe  optimal control rate is infinite. The optimal\r\npolicy in these types of problems is to reflect the\r\nprocess from an a priori unknown boundary.  Such type\r\nof action also arises in problems with additive control,\r\nas an approximation for a \"bang-bang\" optimal policy.\r\nThe proposed research consists of developing the theory\r\nof the related Partial Differential Equations with gradient\r\nconstraints, studying optimal reflecting barriers and\r\noptimal policies in one dimensional and multidimensional\r\ncases.  Applications include stochastic control models\r\nof flexible manufacturing systems as well as dividend\r\noptimization and  multidimensional portfolio optimization\r\nmodels. It is also intended to consider application of\r\nthe singular stochastic control theory to optimization     \r\nproblems in  insurance. We will also study stochastic\r\ncontrol models of large economies and analysis of the\r\nrelationship between the general framework of the no\r\narbitrage asset pricing in mathematical finance and the\r\nequilibrium paths in those models.\r\n\r\nIn addition to developing new stochastic control and stochastic\r\nprocesses theory, the applications of this research would\r\ninclude devising better models for optimization of the\r\nmanufacturing processes and outputs. In addition our research\r\nwould also result in developing new optimization models\r\nin mathematical finance and insurance.  While perceived by\r\nmany nonspecialists as a tool for making a fast profit,\r\nmathematical finance in fact is a \"technology\" for risk\r\nreduction. In this regard its merge with insurance is only\r\ntoo natural. The issues of controlling the risk as well as\r\ninsurance aspects of the financial risk has loomed large\r\nrecently in both financial markets as well as in the insurance\r\nindustry. The importance of optimization in devise of the\r\npolicies employed by insurance and financial institutions\r\nis hard to overestimate. Exposure to unnecessary economic and   \r\nfinancial risks and failure to employ the optimal procedures\r\nmay have serious economic and social impacts. Our research\r\ndeals with development of mathematical models of optimal\r\nrisk control techniques for financial and insurance corporations.\r\nThis  will also enable one to get a better insight into the\r\nnature of the optimal risk reduction techniques a publicly\r\ntraded financial corporation should adhere to, as well as the\r\noptimal dividend distribution policy it should follow.   \r\n\r\n",
