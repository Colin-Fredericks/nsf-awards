 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry  (12)\r\nUse of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) for undergraduate instruction and research and adaptation of experiments published in various journals allow widespread use of sophisticated instrumentation in introductory and advanced level undergraduate chemistry courses. The project is one part of an overall curriculum modernization plan the goal of which is to provide students with more hands-on experience using modern instrumentation and to incorporate additional laboratory exercises that more fully engage students in the scientific process and exploration of scientific concepts. GC/MS is being integrated into a new honors freshman chemistry sequence, into sophomore-level organic and analytical chemistry courses, and into upper-division physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and organic spectroscopy courses. GC/MS based laboratory exercises from standard literature are being adapted for use in target courses, and new laboratory modules are being developed, including a novel collaborative exercise between students enrolled in two different courses. A central theme in the proposed instructional applications is the incorporation of open-ended, discovery-based labs. The GC/MS also receives widespread use in faculty directed undergraduate research projects, particularly in the area of organic chemistry.",
