 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) plans to hold a series of World Congresses on Risk Analysis during the 21st century.  The goal of the Congresses will be to foster the creation and communication of integrated and interdisciplinary knowledge for risk analysis in developed and developing countries.  The theme for the First World Congress is \"Risk and Governance,\" reflecting the worldwide trend toward making better use of risk-oriented concepts in public decision making.  SRA's efforts are expected to build on the ongoing risk-oriented efforts in various countries as well as the efforts of international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Bank, the World Health Organization, and the European Commission.\r\n\r\nGroundwork for these World Congresses will be established at an initial World Symposium on Risk Analysis in June of 2000.  The overall objective of the Symposium is to develop an intellectual and operational foundation for the subsequent World Congresses.  Leaders in the risk analysis field from around the world will be invited by an SRA organizing Committee to examine the state of knowledge in various topics.  Symposium participants will be responsible for developing: (1) a set of concise written statements of the state of the field in various sub-areas; and (2) a directory of contacts and organizations around the world who are interested in risk analysis and should be approached for interest and participation in the World Congresses.\r\n\r\nSRA seeks partial financial support from NSF for the World Symposium.\r\n",
