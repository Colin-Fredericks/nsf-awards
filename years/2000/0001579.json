Nazih El-Derini, Department of Computer Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.  The project is intended to present an architecture that supports Internet Protocol (IP) multicast for hosts using the local registration Mobile-IP protocol over hierarchical organization.  The Mobile-IP (M-IP) protocol allows IP hosts to move between different networks without the need to tear down established sessions.  The M-IP systems supporting local registration were introduced to reduce the number of times when home registration with the remotely located home agent is needed.  Providing an efficient system that supports IP multicast in an environment where the multicast group members frequently change their location is a challenge for system providing mobility support.   Also to be presented will be the issues associated with fault tolerance in local registration M-IP systems, as well as suggested approaches to enhance the robustness of such systems against both Home Agent and Foreign Agent failures.  Simulation results describing the performance of the suggested fault tolerance mechanisms as well as theoretical analysis will be presented.\r\n\r\nScope: The US PI has significant expertise in information networking and telecommunications, and in the area of multimedia networking.  The Egyptian PI also has vast experience in the area of multimedia networking and information networking.  He has built one of the largest computer networks in the Middle East.  The two scientists have distributed tasks and responsibilities according to their capabilities and facilities.  It is expected that the collaboration will benefit both researchers and help Egypt's expanding Internet Providers industry. A postdoctoral investigator at CUNY-City College will be involved in this project.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.",
