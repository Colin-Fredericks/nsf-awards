The objective of the NCBPS meeting is to assist an encourage African-American students who have shown interest and ability in physics and astronomy to enter and complete Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research, teaching, or technical careers commensurate with their educational achievement in physics and astronomy.  This meeting will enable the undergraduate and graduate attendees of the NCBPS (attendance goal, approximately 165-190 students) to interact with each other as well as with successful minority and non-minority scientists in both a formal and informal environment.  The National Society of Black Physics will also be meeting at A&T during the time that the NCBPS will be held and will have overlapping activities for one day of the conference, thereby providing another avenue for these students to interact with Black physicists.  Additionally, A&T will bring in approximately 100+ minority public school students and their teachers for one day of the conference.  The NCBPS tradition on increased importance as we move toward the new millennium with hopes of meeting the growing challenges of an increasingly technology-driven world.\r\n\r\n",
