 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the fragmentation of the school day and the disconnectedness of science education within the elementary curriculum. The purpose of the study is to explore whether pedagogical activities can be implemented in elementary classrooms that foster connections across science and history that enhance the epistemological sophistication of students learning science. The project will involve a series of design experiments that involve providing students and teachers with intellectual tools to make explicit the similarities and differences of thinking in science and history. Because these similarities and differences are rarely explicit topics of classroom debate, students are typically left on their own to make connections from one subject to the next. As a result those least able to bring conceptual coherence to the school day-students-end up shouldering the burden of having to do so. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual tools that this project will seek to foster are ones that science and history share. These are tools of discourse and argumentation. If the project is successful in helping students appropriate and adapt the discursive tools of argument related to core ideas of evidence and cause in science and history, it should achieve two goals: (i) students will learn to appreciate the continuity of intellectual work and its essential specificities by discipline and (ii) students will begin to treat intellectual resources as useful beyond narrow circumstances. Because the fragmentation of the school day is no less a challenge for elementary school teachers, the project will also research and support teachers as they make connections across science and history. \r\n\r\nBuilding upon an established tradition of discipline-specific research on cognition and learning, this project will pursue a comparative psychology of school subjects as an empirical project organized around a set of educational interventions. The proposed extension of the discipline-specific approach is motivated by the fact that this approach fails to provide an account of how forms of inquiry in one discipline might shape intellectual endeavors in another-an issue of considerable importance given the fragmentation of the school day. The broad intellectual goal of this project is to build a theory of the whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. \r\n\r\nThe series of design experiments will be conducted in fifth-grade classrooms in collaboration with teachers. The project will collect and analyze naturalistic discourse data and use software designed specifically for supporting argumentation during science learning. The broad educational goal of these design experiments is to offer an \"existence proof\" that cross-disciplinary structures can be cultivated that simultaneously do justice to the specifics of distinct disciplines while at the same time establishing appropriate intellectual connectedness. In so doing, students and teachers are likely to gain greater confidence in the value of school knowledge. By explicitly highlighting the similarities and differences between science and other subjects (in this case, history), students can learn early in their educational careers that science is a generative, connected, and relevant intellectual activity.\r\n\r\n",
