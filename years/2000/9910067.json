The researchers will be undertaking a study of the solar explosive phenomena with YOHKOH/SOHO/Trace/Solar-8.  They will investigate several basic science issues that address the dynamic relationship between surface magnetic field structures and their counterparts in the chromosphere and corona.  The investigations will include both theoretical and empirical modeling, and coordinated analysis of contemporaneous ground-and space-based observation data of the sun.  The researchers will combine observations in different temperature bands made by YOHKOH, SOHO and TRACE to construct a comprehensive view of solar active phenomena.  The significance of this research is that the expertise of the actual investigators involved in different missions can be coordinated for a consensus observational view of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  Results of the research should provide a more complete temperature structure of the solar corona.  This is important because the magnetic field structure and the reconnection site are all obtained from the temperature profiles.  These data can provide vital information in guiding theoretical studies of corona heating mechanisms.  The project advances international human resources through the participation of postdocs.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation\r\n",
