Rivers draining Kruger National Park experienced flows of ~8,000 m3/s (~150 year return interval), causing widespread removal of riparian vegetation and extensive alterations to channel geometry.   The floods caused widespread human suffering but also provided a truly unique research opportunity.  For the first time in nearly a century there is the possibility to describe and manipulate the long-term recovery of riverine forests. This project will involve the construction and equipping of large animal exclosures to investigate the recovery of the vegetation and soils over long periods in areas with and without the influences of megafauna, and under experimental water, nutrient, and fire regimes. Research questions are related to the effects of large animal browsing (e.g., elephant, buffalo, hippopotamus) on vegetative recovery, the type and role of nutrients involved in recovery, the extent and role of exotic plants after a major disturbance, and the effects of natural wet and dry climate cycles on the vegetation.  The need for the exclosures is urgent and immediate since the South Africa growing season begins in September, 2000. \r\n",
