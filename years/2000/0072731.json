 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the preparation and study of the properties of an array of highly strained fluorocarbons and fluorocarbons incorporating interesting conjugated systems.  The project includes synthesis of a building block for use in the construction of perfluoroannulenes and valence isomers, as well as synthesis of a new photochemical source of difluorcarbene.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. David M. Lemal of the Department of Chemistry at Dartmouth College.  Professor Lemal will focus his work on extending current knowledge of fluorocarbon structure, reactivity, and synthesis, and on gaining a deeper understanding of those features that distinguish fluorocarbons from hydrocarbon analogs.  Fluorocarbons and derived materials have found a tremendous range of applications in our society ranging from high-temperature, chemically inert polymers to surfactants to refrigerants to blood substitutes to inhalation anaesthetics.  The project will provide training in  synthetic and physical organic methods for a number of undergraduates and graduate students.",
