The meeting, entitled \"Science in an Uncertain Millennium\", is expected to draw over 5000 scientists, engineers, educators, and policymakers. \r\n\r\nThe symposia are to be conducted as two separate parts of the meeting program: 1. Session 151: Health Care, Economics, and Technology: An evolving balance, and 2. Session 171: Children and Chronic Diseases: Incentives for solutions to lifelong problems. The two sessions are to describe results from the investigators' experience with the NSF/Whitaker Foundation activity in a Cost Reducing Health Care Technology (CRCHT) research project Personal Sensors for the Diagnosis and Management of Metabolic Disorders. Issues to be addressed in session 151 are the impacts that economics and policy have on the particular cost reducing technology under development. The second symposium, session 171, will give specific examples of issues pertaining to the development of technology for children's health, which is related to the particular CRHCT project.  The symposia are designed to raise awareness of these issues in both the scientific and policy communities and provide a forum for communicating these issues to a broad audience.   \r\n\r\nProceedings of the AAAS Symposia are to be published jointly with those of the Symposium Balancing Costs with Benefits of Health Care Technologies in the New Millennium: A Global Perspective (BES-0074074) to be held at the World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, July 23-28, 2000, Chicago, IL.\r\n",
