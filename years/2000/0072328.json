 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0072328\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Wenxiong Chen\r\n\r\nProfessor Wenxiong Chen will work on a series of nonlinear\r\nproblems in differential geometry. One of his main subjects is\r\nprescribing Gaussian and scalar curvature: given a function on a\r\nRiemannian manifold, can it be realized as the curvature of some\r\npointwise conformal metric? This is equivalent to solving certain\r\nsemi-linear elliptic partial differential equations.  He will\r\nalso work on uniformization theorems on singular surfaces and the\r\nexistence of harmonic maps between complete, noncompact\r\nmanifolds, which are closely related to the study of fourth order\r\nnonlinear elliptic equations, nonlinear elliptic systems, and\r\nnonlinear parabolic systems.\r\n\r\nAccording to Einstein, the Universe we live in is a curved space,\r\nin which gravity is realized as a distortion or bending of\r\nspace-time in the neighborhood of a massive object and this\r\nchange of shape is measured by the curvature tensor.  Chen's\r\nresearch is focused on understanding when a given function can\r\nbecome a curvature. This is a challenging problem in Riemannian\r\ngeometry and the analysis of partial differential equations, to\r\nwhich many researchers have contributed.  The nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations and systems studied in this project have\r\nvarious applications in physics, chemistry, and biology, such as\r\nin fluid dynamics, combustion theory, and river pollution\r\n",
