 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to subsidize travel and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the Student Research Workshop to be held April 29-May 3, 2000 in Seattle, Washington during the ANLP/NAACL 2000 joint conference (Applied Natural Language Processing and North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics).   The intimate workshop format will  encourage student participants to begin building a rapport with established researchers.   Students will have sufficient time to present their research (25 minutes) and then receive feedback from a panel of established researchers in the field (15 minutes).   The workshop will provide students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research, and will also allow them to put their work into perspective based on feedback from the panel and from fellow participants.   This nurturing effort should pay dividends by more effectively guiding students in this rapidly changing research field, and seems to be an inexpensive yet effective means of encouraging young and upcoming computational linguists.",
