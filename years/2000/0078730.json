 "awd_abstract_narration": "0078730\r\nAruchamy\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop thin-film nitrogen oxide sensors based on novel binary-phased nanocomposites by sol-gel processing.  Sol-gel processing offers many advantages for sensor fabrication, including facility and versatility for nano-engineering of the microstructure.  In Phase I, such sensor elements have shown much improved microstructure, enhanced sensitivity, and faster response speed than powder-derived sensor elements of the same composition by conventional processing.  Thin-film sensors can be readily incorporated with silicon microelectronic technology and conveniently allow miniaturization, low process costs, and high reproducibility.  Phase II will systematically optimize the processing, microstructure, and performance of the binary-phased thin-film nitrogen oxides sensors by sol-gel processing.\r\n\r\nPotential commercial applications of the research are expected in reliable, compact solid-state chemical sensors.  This innovation is expected to provide highly stable and sensitive thin-film nitrogen oxides sensors for automotive emission control, industrial processing control, and environmental monitoring.  These sensors may be used as stand-alone sensing devices or as sensing units to be integrated into on-chip multifunctional sensors and smart structures. \r\n",
