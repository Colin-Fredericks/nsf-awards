The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr.Joel Goldberg with support for 12 months to work with Professor Donald Hilvert at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland on the directed molecular evolution of a single-chain catalytic antibody with increased stability and catalytic efficiency.  This project is co-funded by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\nThis project will prepare a library of RNS-protein fusions for the directed evolution of proteins in order to generate mutant antibodies with increased stabilities and altered catalytic properties.  The PI and host will start with a catalytic antibody which efficiently converts chorismate to prephenate.  This project will provide insights into the mechanisms used by proteins to maintain active, folded conformations and promote chemical reactions.\r\nProfessor Hilvert is an expert on protein and catalytic antibodies.  The entire infrastructure for the Laboratorium fur Organische Chemie and the Department of Chemistry at the ETH are available for this project.\r\n",
