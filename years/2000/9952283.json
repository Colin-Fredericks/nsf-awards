It is integrating technology to produce a more effective learning environment for undergraduates, and strengthening undergraduate education by increasing the participation and success of women in SMET programs.  As a collateral benefit, faculty development is also being gained as a result of interacting with the testing equipment.\r\n\r\nThe addition of this new laboratory infrastructure is facilitating purposeful and substantive linkages between industry and the textile and apparel program.  This, in turn, is creating research and educational experiences that will enable graduates to enter the workforce with advanced technological skills on-par with professionals currently working in the industry.  Technological preparation is increasingly necessary for graduates to compete for high quality entry level positions in the textile and apparel industry.\r\n\r\nThe project's textile testing equipment, conditioning room, and environmental chamber meet the new academic imperative of improving student technical competence, and are serving as an academic testing site for national and regional apparel organizations that develop and source their own product lines.  This program is largely unique in the U.S., and represents the next generation of textile and apparel programs.  Furthermore, as a program primarily serving women, the infusion of technology into the curriculum is better preparing females to enter the workforce feeling comfortable and capable of performing within a technological and science-based industry.  Finally, a dissemination plan is projecting the program outwards to the corporate and academic communities as a model of \"best methods and practices\" for others to consider emulating.\r\n",
