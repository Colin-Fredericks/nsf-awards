Symbiosis is one of the most pervasive of all species interactions, yet one of the least understood. Changes in population dynamics from symbiosis may lead to cascading effects on other species interactions and community structure. In order to better understand how population dynamics are affected by symbiosis, the proposed research will focus on how a symbiotic microbe, Epichloe glyceriae, alters clonal growth characteristics of its host grass, Glyceria striata. The consequences of symbiosis on patterns of clonal growth, resource transport within host clones, and spatial pattern of infected vs uninfected plants in natural populations will be examined.\r\n\r\nSymbiosis is important in both natural and managed systems, as both positive and negative symbioses are widespread in all communities. Understanding the effects of fungal symbiosis on the grwoth form of host plants has important implications for the diversity of natural communities, productivity of agricultural systems, and management practices for conservation. Awareness of the extensive influences of symbiosis will also provide a new perspective on community structure, links between species, and the importance of biological diversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
