 "awd_abstract_narration": "Venture capital is a rapidly developing, new form of financial intermediation.  It is commonly believed to have a significant impact on the development of entrepreneurial companies.  Yet relatively little is known about how this economic institution works.  This empirical line of research seeks to obtain a better understanding of the economic foundations of the venture capital industry.  It asks some fundamental questions about the economic role of venture capital, as well as the organization of venture capital industry itself.  The research is motivated by a set of theoretically driven questions.  The empirical work consists of identifying rich enough data that then allows for a careful empirical analysis of these questions.\r\n\r\nThe proposal includes three closely related research projects on venture capital.  The first project is concerned with the question of whether venture capitalists play a role over and above those played by traditional financial intermediaries.  It asks whether venture capitalists play a role in professional ization of startup companies, including the development of human resources in startup companies.  It examines not only whether venture capitalists can play a supportive role in the development of human resources, it also looks at the control exercised by venture capitalists, especially in terms of replacing the original founders with professional managers as CEOs.  The second project examines the structure of venture capital organizations themselves.  It asks to what extent existing financial intermediaries, i.e., banks, are well-suited to engage in venture capital.  It empirically investigates whether bank-owned venture capital firms have different investment patterns relative to their counterpart private individual venture capital funds.  The third project examines the economic determinants of venture capital fund performance.  In particular, it will investigate how different investment strategies as well as the intensity of managerial incentives translate into differential performance patterns.\r\n\r\nOverall, this research contributes to a better economic understanding of venture capital.  As such it is important to the fields of corporate finance and financial intermediation.  Venture capital is one of the most important new forms of financial intermediation.  It differs substantially from traditional financial intermediaries and suggests new paradigms for thinking about financial intermediation.  It is also relevant to our understanding of the theory of the firm, examining what roles financiers can play in the development of new companies.  Finally, it is of importance to public policy.  Policy makers across the world are seeking for ways to promote the venture capital industry.  Understanding the role of banks in venture capital, for example, is important, especially since banks are the main financial institutions in many developing and developed countries.  Understanding the economic determinants of venture capital fund performance is also critical for a better understanding of what policies are more effective in the promotion of venture capital.\r\n",
