 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER research program conducted by Dr. Julie Stenken of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is supported by the Analytical and Surface Program in the Chemistry Division.  The focus of this research is to develop microdialysis probes for in vitro macrophage cell cultures with the goal of monitoring real-time chemical concentrations.  The chemicals to be monitored include hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide and prostaglandins.  She will evaluate the biocompatibility of a variety of sensor membrane materials.  She also will expand her previous work on a cyclodextrin complexation method for concentrating trace chemicals in the cell culture with sampling by microdialysis.  The educational component of her research includes the incorporation of this research into her graduate program.  Dr. Stenken also plans to develop an outreach educational program for  local high schools, directed specifically to underrepresented women and minority students.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this research on the biomedical engineering community is expected to be high.  There are a number of complex issues related to the routine use of microdialysis sampling which Dr. Stenken will address.  Studying membrane materials and the inflammatory response which they cause will lead to a clearer fundamental understanding of the compatibility of materials with blood and tissues. \r\n",
