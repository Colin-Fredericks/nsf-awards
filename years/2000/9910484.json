The proposed collaboration aims to study the prompt optical signal from gamma ray bursts by forming a telescope network between 3 geological sites: California, Arizona, U.S.A. and South Korea.  The PIs also propose to study variable astronomical objects by analyzing data from these telescopes.\r\n \r\nDr. Hye-Sook Park at Livermore Lab has led a group called LOTIS for optical detection of GRBs during the past few years.  The PI is now preparing a 60cm wide-field telescope for more vigorous observations at Kitt Peak.  Professor Yong-Ik Byun at Yonsei University has been preparing two 50cm wide-field survey telescopes called TSTAR, which will be installed and become operational this fall in Korea.  The PIs propose to combine these two separate efforts in the U.S. and Korea.  By the proposed collaboration, YSTAR telescopes will have capability to follow-up GRB events within 20 seconds after the initial detection by orbiting gamma-ray burst detectors.  The geographical locations of Korea and U.S. allow the joint team to monitor large areas of the sky continuously without significant interruption.  YSTAR's high speed computing facility will also analyze the LOTIS data archive for other optical transient events.\r\n\r\nThis project will be performed in conjunction with Dr. Byun's group at Korea under the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit. \r\n",
