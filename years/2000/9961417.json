 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to research and develop modular software for generic multisensor/actuator intelligent nodes containing commercial embedded microcontrollers and/or digital signal processors (iPod).  The software provides an autonomous multiprocessor network with operational computational data processing and actuation capabilities which can 'enable more efficient, safer and more satisfying products and services to improve quality of life in both work and home environments and to augment human capabilities'.  It would consist of an instrument development environment (IDE), an ActiveX-like object (iBroker), and an embedded virtual machine (EVM).  The IDE generates run-time commands (applets) for the PC and the iPods.  The iBroker, as intermediary, links the iPods embedded microcontrollers to a PC and/or a larger network through a master.  The EVM residing on each iPod utilizes downloaded applets and communicates through a master to the iBroker and beyond. While some software components have been tested in programs both here and elsewhere, a research effort is needed on a modular, over-arching program for a sensor based multiprocessor systems that can fully utilize their networking capabilities while providing real time multiprocessing of sensor/actuator information.  In Phase I, this software will be tested on Scitefair's recent flow measuring nodal network.",
