 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop and commercialize new type of combustible gas microsensors with high sensitivity and low power consumption. The innovation is based on self-organized nanostructured ceramic with high thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability. Deposition of the catalytic material inside the network of high surface area nanoscale pores has a potential to enable high precision, better accuracy, and longer lifetime. Nanostructured sensor element will be integrated with a low power microheater by proprietary micromachining technology. The novel combination of nanoscale morphology and micromachining will be utilized to develop sensor arrays that can monitor concentration profiles of multiple combustible gases. The technology is compatible with mainstream microfabrication, and could be easily scaled up. The program will benefit from the infrastructure for the nano- and micro-scale engineering of materials for devices and sensors that is already operational at the Nanomaterials Research Corporation (NRC) and from day-to-day participation of a team that has extensive multidisciplinary experience including sensor product development and  commercialization.\r\n\r\nProposed research could enable new types of low cost low power robust gas microsensors and sensor arrays with high sensitivity, selectivity, fast response, and possibility of regeneration. Potential applications of the technology include any area where portable gas sensors are used: mines, combustion and exhaust monitoring, air quality control, fire alarms, industrial processes monitoring, etc.",
