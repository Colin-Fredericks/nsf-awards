Kaler, U of Delaware\r\n\r\nObjectives/Hypothesis:  Concern for the natural environment drives a need for surfactant-based formulations that are biodegradable or that can be synthesized from renewable resources.  Mixtures containing alkylpolyglucoside surfactants succeed on both counts.  A fundamental study is proposed of mixtures containing alkyl polyglucosides surfactant to enable their use as potential replacements for other types of surfactants  (in particular ethoxylated alcohols) in a large number of industrially important formulations and applications.  Objective 1 is to study water-alkyl polyglucoside mixtures in terms of phase behavior and the corresponding microstructure, including exploration of the effects of additives such as salt, alcohol, or other surfactants on the phase behavior and microstructure.  Objective 2 is to examine mixtures containing nonpolar solvents and the subsequent formation of microemulsions.  Adding materials such as salt, alcohol, or other surfactants to water/oil/alkyl polyglucoside microemulsions may effect the phase behavior and microstructure beneficially and allow tailoring of formulations to specific applications.  It is proposed to examine the feasibility of employing other environmentally compatible materials, as solvents and additives to alkylpolygucosides microemulsions.  Examples of these types of materials include limonene (derived from orange processing), rape seed oil, other naturally-derived oils, and also the use of alkanediols as substitutes for alkanols.  Objective 3 is to extend the utility of alkyl polyglucoside-based mixtures by modifying their rheological properties and microstructure through addition of naturally occurring polymers (e. g., gelatin and gums).  Several classes of industrially important gums with different functionality and thickening mechanisms will be examined.\r\n\r\nApproach:  The experimental approach involves determination of surfactant phase behavior using visual a microscopic observation of mixtures as a function of chemical type, concentration, and temperature.  Microstructure will be determined and quantified using fluorescence spectroscopy and light and small angle x-ray and neutron scattering methods.\r\n\r\nExpected Results:  The work will provide a scientific basis for the use of alkyl polyglucoside surfactants as replacements for other nonionic formulations in a variety of applications including surface cleaners, personal care products, and industrial lubricants.  The work will also likely uncover features of these new materials that will be superior to conventional formulations, particularly in the areas of temperature sensitivity, rheological properties, and cost.  Completion of work reduces environmental risk because it leads directly to the development of formulations, which have a reduced impact on the environment via improved biodegradability, and the use of renewable resources.\r\n\r\nSupplement Keywords:  Waste minimization, environmental chemistry, and surfactants \r\n",
