Moudgil\r\nU. of Florida\r\n\r\n       The University of Florida Center for Surface Science and Engineering and the Engineering Research Center for Particle Science and Technology will host the 13th International Symposium on Surfactants in Solution (SIS-2000) from June 11 to June 16, 2000. The official venue for the symposium is the Sheraton of Gainesville in Gainesville, Florida.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first symposium of the new century and the new millennium.  We are confident that four plenary and many invited speakers will set the tone for the future direction of research in this area.  The synergism among the expected 600 scientists from all over the globe will promote the breaking of new grounds and generation of new ideas in the scientific community.  We are very enthusiastic to support the attendance of at least 150 post-doctoral associates and graduate students from academic institutions within the United States who will particularly benefit from the exchange of ideas at the symposium.\r\n\r\n     This series of biennial symposia has been running since 1976, and has been hosted by various countries: Bulgaria, Canada, France, India, Israel, Sweden, USA and Venezuela.  We expect that researchers from more than 45 countries will attend this biennial conference.  This international symposium covers the entire fundamental aspects and technical applications of surfactants.  The most recent developments and innovative research on surfactants have been traditionally presented in this forum.\r\n\r\nThis conference provides a rare but ever-important bridge of  communication between the scientists from academia and industry, with one of the goals being to expedite the technology transfer process from universities to industrial laboratories.  This will also help maintain \r\n the innovation in emerging technologies by the US industries.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the Center for Surface Science & Engineering at the University of Florida hosted the symposium in Gainesville, Florida, which was attended by nearly 500 researchers from all over the world.  For the SIS-2000, the scope of the scientific program has been considerably expanded by the co-sponsorship of The Engineering Research Center for Particle Science and Technology at the University of Florida,\r\n\r\n We welcome and anticipate an enthusiastic global participation in this milestone event, SIS-2000.  We have invited four outstanding plenary speakers (Table 1) and 48 invited speakers (Table 2) for various topical symposia.  We expect about 200 oral presentations and many poster presentations.  In addition, a part of the symposium will include papers honoring Professor P. Somasundaran of Columbia University, New York, on his 60th birthday for his valuable contributions to surfactant science.\r\n\r\n",
