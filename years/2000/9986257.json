 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will develop a simple yet novel and versatile digital holographic microscope\r\ndevice for imaging three-dimensional microscopic volume objects. The resultant images\r\nobtained from this device will have submicron resolution in both the lateral and\r\nlongitudinal directions. Moreover, the blurring and degrading of images due to out-of-\r\nfocus object planes are completely suppressed. The device is based on numerical\r\nreconstruction and interference of a number of digitally recorded holographic images,\r\nwhile the wavelength of the illuminating laser is scanned. Because a hologram retains\r\nall of the amplitude and phase information of the light field and because of the freedom\r\nof digital manipulation of the holograms, it is possible to carry out an interference\r\nprocess in the numerical virtual space that is quite impossible in physical space. When\r\na number of holographically recreated light fields of varying wavelengths are\r\nsuperposed, and if the wavelengths are regularly spaced, then the interference among\r\nthem result in the light intensity being concentrated at object points only - propagation\r\nof light through space is in effect eliminated. When focused, numerically, on an\r\nimage plane, only those points corresponding to any discontinuities or irregularities,\r\nsuch as cellular surfaces and structures, of the object render bright image spots. The\r\nresulting effect is analogous to scanning confocal microscope images, but this\r\nsystem presents significant potential advantages. It has no mechanical moving parts.\r\nThe image acquisition consists of N exposures of two dimensional images, instead of\r\npixel-by-pixel build-up of 3D volume. The range of physical sizes and resolution of\r\nobjects that can be imaged is readily controlled by proper choice of the wavelength\r\nintervals. And with the holographic phase information readily available, further\r\ninterferometric or holographic image processing is possible. Furthermore, the optical\r\nsectioned images of the awarded system can be reassembled into a three-dimensional\r\ndigital model that can be further manipulated for specific applications, such as\r\ncorrection of scale distortion, arbitrary section and cut-away views, and automatic\r\nfeature enhancement and identification. This system has a potential to impact\r\nthe general field of microscopic optical imaging by providing a simple and versatile\r\nmode of acquiring and manipulating three-dimensional digital model of microscopic\r\nobjects.\r\n",
