A classical example is the (catching) problem in two-level memory systems. Modern computer architectures enhance memory performance by storing the most frequently accessed data items in a cache, which is a small buffer memory with very short access time.  When a requested item r is not in the cache -- an event referred to as a (fault) -- the caching algorithm stores r in the cache. If the cache is full, the algorithm needs to decide which item to evict from the cache to make room for r.  This decision is made (online), without the knowledge of future requests. Naturally, the goal is to minimize the number of faults. \r\n\r\nDue to incomplete information, online algorithms cannot, in general, compute optimal solutions. This brings up the issue of performance evaluation: how do we tell good algorithms from bad ones?  One measure of the quality of online algorithms is their (competitive ratio), defined as the maximum, over all request sequences, and of the ratios between the solution computed by the online algorithm and the optimal (offline) solution. Thus, an algorithm with competitive ratio, says, 1.5, always computes a solution that is within 50% of the minimum. \r\n\r\nThis research deals with the competitive analysis of online algorithms and is divided into three projects.  The first project is to study several known, specific online problems, including the k-server problem, file caching, and others.  The objectives of this work are to develop efficient competitive algorithms for these problems and to establish matching lower bounds on their competitive ratios.  More fundamental issues in competitive analysis are addressed in the second project. The main focus here is on the techniques for the design and analysis of online algorithms. The most promising, emerging ideas in this direction include the work-function algorithm (and its extensions) and the primal-dual method. Both of these techniques, as well as some other, have been successfully applied to specific online problems, but the mechanism behind their success is still poorly understood, and they still require an in-depth study to determine their applicability to other problems.  The third project is to explore some extensions of the competitive analysis that have been recently introduced for the caching problem: access graphs, diffuse adversaries, and loose competitiveness. In addition to work on some remaining open problems in this area, this project will also focus on adapting these new models to online problems other than caching (for example, file migration), and, if appropriate, on designing and studying other problem-specific models. \r\n",
