 "awd_abstract_narration": "ICalculus reform has been a major educational innovation extending over the past decade and more.  Many colleges and universities have adopted, at least in part, some form of calculus reform in their calculus courses.  The reform has also been the focus of considerable controversy in the mathematics community, with vocal defenders and opponents to be found within many mathematics departments.  However, there has been little empirical evidence to support either position.  A previous review of the literature on calculus reform by one of the authors (Ganter) concluded that findings were mixed regarding impacts on student achievement and attitudes. \r\n\r\nThis study attempts to provide information on long-term effects of calculus reform by employing matching sets of students who were enrolled in either \"traditional\" or \"reform\" calculus classes.  The performance of these students, drawn from classes in 7 institutions, will be examined in courses subsequent to calculus.  A larger sample of seniors from these same institutions will also be tested on their knowledge of calculus.\r\nThe interest of employers in calculus reform backgrounds will also be explored.\r\n\r\nThe study will be carried out by the Principal Investigators with the assistance of 7 evaluation \"Fellows\" drawn from the institutions involved in the study and trained by the Principal Investigators.  The \"Fellows\" will then be a continuing resource for the mathematics and science communities. \r\n\r\n",
