 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the main problem in arithmetic geometry is the determination of the set \r\nof rational solutions of a system of polynomial equations with rational \r\ncoefficients. One of the most successful technique in the study of such a set \r\nof solutions is to reduce the equations modulo a prime p and to study first the \r\nset of solutions of the latter system of equations. It turns out that in many \r\nsituations, it is possible to describe a canonical way of reducing the \r\nequations modulo p. For instance, the canonical reduction of an abelian \r\nvariety is called its Neron model, and is the object of study in Lorenzini's \r\nfirst research project. The canonical reduction of a curve is called its \r\nregular minimal model, and is the object of study in Lorenzini's second \r\nresearch project. For all but finitely many prime p, the canonical reduction \r\nis `good' and, as the name suggests, such a reduction type  can be better \r\nunderstood than the reduction at the finitely many remaining primes. Our \r\npresent understanding of the information encoded in the canonical reductions \r\nthat are not good (and not semistable) is far from complete. Some very \r\ndifficult problems arise when studying reductions modulo small primes. One \r\nsuch difficulty can be stated as follows. A famous theorem due to Grothendieck \r\nand others states that there exists a finite field extension L/K such that \r\nthe reduction of the initial equations viewed as equations over L is either \r\ngood or semistable. In other words, it is possible to improve the reduction \r\nby extending the initial field. When p is large, the extension L/K is totally\r\nunderstood once its degree is known: it is the unique cyclic extension of that\r\ndegree. When p is small and divides the degree of L/K, there are infinitely \r\nmany extensions of that given degree, and almost nothing is known about the \r\nspecific extension L/K needed to improve the reduction of the initial \r\nequations. Lorenzini's proposed research will shed more light on this \r\nand other special phenomena that arise when the reduction modulo a small \r\nprime p is not `good'.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, human beings have been fascinated with solving diophantine \r\nequations, named after the Greek mathematician Diophantus who lived in \r\nthe third century AD. The field of diophantine equations has taken on\r\nadded significance in the modern world as it finds applications in a\r\nvariety of areas including, for example, encryption. A diophantine equation \r\nis a mathematical expression in several variables, say x and y.  The central \r\nproblem in the field is to find all possible solutions where x and y \r\nare both whole numbers or both fractions. For instance, the equation xy-10=0 \r\nhas many solutions (e.g., x = y = square root of 10) but the solutions in \r\nwhole positive numbers are in this case the divisors of 10, namely \r\n(x,y) = (1,10), (2,5), (5,2), and (10,1). While such an  equation is very \r\nsimple, a slight modification, such as replacing 10 by a very large number \r\n(for instance, one having 150 digits) renders the new equation extremely hard \r\nto solve in practice. It is this fact, that it is so hard to solve such \r\nequations, that is the key to many of the safest current military codes and \r\ndata encryption systems. The complexity of the determination of all solutions \r\nin whole numbers or fractions of an equation increases with the power at which\r\nthe variables appear in the equation. For instance, the equation `x to the \r\npower n plus y to the power n equals 1' was conjectured in the 17th century \r\nto have only two solutions when n is any odd number greater than 1. \r\n(Those two solutions are (x,y)=(1,0) and (x,y)= (0,1). This  conjecture \r\nis called Fermat's Last Theorem and was proved only in 1994. Since the time \r\nof the Greeks, mathematicians have developed sophisticated tools to aid in \r\nsolving equations. This investigator has developed some such mathematical \r\ntools and is currently working on further contributions to this field.",
