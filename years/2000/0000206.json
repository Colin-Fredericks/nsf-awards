 "awd_abstract_narration": "The definitions of P and NP are based on polynomial time computations.  It has been a long-time concern whether one should call a problem with computational complexity Q (n100) 'tractable\".  A commonly accepted explanation is that in practice most problems in P in fact can be solved in time O(n3) or better.  However, recent research has shown that some very important practical problems seem to require algorithms whose complexity is bounded only by very high degree polynomials.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many NP-hard problems, described in a parameterized version, for which it is desired to construct the precise solutions deterministically, while a wide range of applications is only interested in solving these problems with a small or moderate value for the parameters.  The point is how to take advantage of this fact and develop most efficient algorithms for these intractable problems in practice.\r\n\r\nThe research studies the refinement of the classification of tractability and intractability, based on the recently developed theory of parameterized complexity, with the aim of identifying \"impractical\" polynomial time algorithms and \"efficient\" exponential time algorithms for practical problems.  The following specific issues in algorithm theory are investigated:\r\n\r\ndeveloping efficient parameterized algorithms for intractable problems.  This includes two steps:  identifying fixed-parameter tractable problems, and development of most efficient parameterized algorithms for the problems.\r\n\r\nidentifying \"hard\" polynomial time solvable problems, based on the framework of the W[1]-hardness.  Problems from other practice will also be studied based on this framework.\r\n\r\ninvestigating the relationship between parameterized complexity and approximability.  Parameterized complexity suggests new techniques for proving non-approximability for certain optimization problems that may otherwise be not easy or even impossible based on classical complexity theory.\r\n\r\n",
