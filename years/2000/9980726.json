 "awd_abstract_narration": "BIOCOMPLEXITY: Collaborative Research: Factors affecting, and impact of, diazotrophic microorganisms in the western Equatorial Atlantic Ocean\r\n\r\n\tThis biocomplexity research focuses on plankton dynamics in the western Equatorial Atlantic Ocean (WEQAT).  This is a complex and understudied ecosystem that has significant impacts on marine resources in the region as well as in downstream areas such as the Caribbean Sea. The study centers on diazotrophic (nitrogen fixing) microorganisms as keystone species. Geological, physical, biological, chemical and even social factors all have a major influence on population biology and activity of diazotrophs in the WEQAT. Diazotrophs in turn have a major impact on other phytoplankton and trophic levels through input of fixed nitrogen (N). The Amazon River affects the region physically by changing salinity and thereby water column stratification, and geochemically by introducing iron and silicate which can then biologically stimulate the growth of diatoms that contain the N2 fixing endosymbiont Richelia intracellularis. Furthermore, the area receives significant seasonal atmospheric inputs of iron in dust from the Sahel region of Africa, which can promote the growth of the important N2 fixing cyanobacterium Trichodesmium. This atmospheric iron source is directly deposited on the surface waters where biological activity is greatest. For Trichodesmium, the physical environment (e.g. high wind speed) can also inhibit activity and the formation of blooms. Diazotrophs may be affected by land use practices in the Amazon Basin and the African Sahel, and N2 fixed by marine plankton can affect humans by stimulating primary productivity and fishery yields.\r\n\tUsing both remote sensing and shipboard measurements, scientists will examine the complex processes which structure these planktonic diazotroph populations, influence their importance in CO2 and N2 fixation, which, in turn, affect other planktonic processes. The seasonal and spatial relationships of Trichodesmium and Hemiaulus / Richelia associations will be examined with direct reference to the major routes of inputs of Fe and Si, and with regard to the physical environment. The group of collaborating scientists will examine the trophic structures associated with each diazotrophic community, including the vertical distribution of processes and associated autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton populations. These data will be used to develop and verify biogeochemical and trophodynamic models that incorporate the complex physical, chemical and biological interactions that characterize the WEQAT region. The models will, in turn, be used to examine the hypothesis that physical forcing, through its effect on the diazotrophic populations and the structure of the food web, influences N2 fixation and, in part, determines the high productivity of the WEQAT.\r\n\tThe work uses a combination of both observations and models to address three fundamental issues in biocomplexity: 1) the relationship between ecosystem structure and function in a system that is both nonlinear and high-dimensional; 2) the response of a nonlinear ecosystem to environmental forcing; and 3) the relevant level of detail, including the resolution of physical space, that must be incorporated in nonlinear systems to capture the dynamics of a global ecosystem property (here, high productivity).  The research will significantly advance our understanding of the interaction between physical and biogeochemical processes in an important area the world's oceans, and identify how these interactions regulate variability in marine ecosystem productivity. \r\n",
