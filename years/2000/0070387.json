 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Fawley\r\n\r\n\tModern instrumentation in support of research in plant cellular and molecular biology will be housed in the Department of Botany/Biology, North Dakota State University, Fargo. Specifically, a research microscope, a high-speed centrifuge, an ultracentrifuge, rotors, a scintillation counter, and culture equipment will be used in a variety of botanical studies.\r\n\tFour researchers will be the primary users of this equipment. Dr. Marvin Fawley is investigating the phylogeny of green algae and the molecular diversity of coccoid green algae.  The equipment will support efforts to describe new species of coccoid green algae, and continuing investigations of coccoid green algal diversity.  Dr. Karen Phillips is studying phytoplankton communities and population dynamics using molecular techniques and light microscopy.  For this project, her work will focus primarily on winter phytoplankton communities\r\nand population dynamics of freshwater coccoid green algae.  Dr. Marc Anderson is studying the influence of environmental stress on metabolic processes in plants.  Dr. Anderson will investigate the response of maize seedlings to chilling-induced oxidative stress, specifically focusing on processes in the mitochondria.  Dr. Alan White is investigating the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides in plant Golgi membranes.  This equipment will support his efforts to purify enzymes involved in the synthesis of xylogulcans in the Golgi, specifically xyloglucan glucosyltransferase and xyloglucan xylosyltransferase.\r\n\tThe results of this work will have significant impact on several areas of plant biology.  Work on coccoid algae and phytoplankton population dynamics will help revise old dogmas on the diversity of coccoid algae and the dynamics of phytoplankton under the ice in winter.  Research will also lead to an understanding of the mechanism(s) (e.g. induced transcription, protein modification, etc.)  by which enzyme activities are enhanced during chilling stress.  Finally, an increased understanding of xyloglucan biosynthesis will add significantly to our understanding of cell wall polysaccharides, the process of cell wall synthesis, and the structure and functional organization of the plant Golgi apparatus. Biology students and other investigators will have full access to this equipment for their research and training\r\n\r\n",
