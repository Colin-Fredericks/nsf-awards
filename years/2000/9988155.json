In this\r\nresearch, attention will be focused primarily on finite-state system\r\nmodels.  A key characteristic of the approach is compositionality,\r\nwhich permits a large system to be described as the composition of a\r\ncollection of simpler components and to be analyzed in a\r\ncomponent-by-component fashion.  This research will build on previous\r\nwork of the PIs, in which they developed a model, called\r\n\"probabilistic I/O automata\" (PIOA), for the compositional\r\nspecification of reactive, probabilistic systems, together with\r\ncompositional performance analysis algorithms for this model.  The\r\nproposed project would advance the state of the art in the area of\r\nformal specification and verification techniques for finite state\r\nsystems, which holds promise for enabling more efficient production of\r\nmore reliable software systems.\r\n",
