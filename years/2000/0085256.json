 "awd_abstract_narration": "Behavior of Large Diameter Water Pipe at Seismic Fault\r\nby M.J. O'Rourke and R. Dobry\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is a collaborative research project on the seismic behavior of potable water systems with particular emphasis on buried pipe. The project has two specific goals.  The first is to fully and properly document the behavior of buried pipeline and other water system components in the affected areas of Turkey and Taiwan during the earthquakes in 1999.  The second goal is to investigate the behavior of large diameter water pipe subject to the fault rupture hazard. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the first goal, the data gathering and subsequent analysis will be directed at establishing fragility relations based upon key engineering parameters and mechanics, as opposed to simply a statistical analysis of empirical observations.\r\n\r\nThe earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan provide a unique opportunity to develop a fundamental understanding of the behavior of large diameter pipe subject to the fault rupture hazard.  In both events, large diameter water pipe were severely damaged where they transversed the surface expression of a fault  The opportunity is unique in the sense that surface faulting has not intersected large diameter pipe in past events.  We plan to develop a fundamental understanding of this hazard by comparing the results of computer simulation and small scale laboratory modeling using the Rensselaer Geotechnical Centrifuge `with observed full scale behavior.\r\n",
