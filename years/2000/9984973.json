 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program award to Dr. Daniel Feldheim of North Carolina State University is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division.  The focus of the research will be the preparation of polymer-coated gold colloids and subsequent removal of the gold core resulting in hollow polymer nanocapsules. Polypyrrole and N-methylpyrrole will be synthesized for the preparation of polymer-gold particles. The hollow polymer nanocapsules will be evaluated for uptake, release and entrapment of molecules, and establish structure-function relationships between the polymer capsules and the entrapped molecules.  The educational part of the program is to provide cross-disciplinary research experience to undergraduate students with monthly meetings and presentations including invited speakers from industry and academia.\r\n\r\nMultifunctional polymer capsules will be prepared to encapsulate small molecules for controlled release or activity with potential applications in time-released drug delivery systems. The teaching part of the award will develop an undergraduate research program with support from industry and former NC State chemistry graduates to better prepare the students for careers in chemistry.\r\n",
