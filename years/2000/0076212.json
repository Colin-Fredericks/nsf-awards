The program's awards \r\nprovide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary \r\nfacilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Darren E. Irwin with support for twenty-four months to work \r\nwith Dr. Staffan Bensch at Lund University in Sweden.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe splitting of a single species into two, or speciation, takes a long time to occur and is \r\nthus difficult to observe directly.  A rare opportunity to study speciation  is provided by a \r\nring species, in which a long chain or interbreeding populations encircle a geographic \r\nbarrier; the terminal populations in the chain do not interbreed where they come together.  \r\nFor two ring species - the Willow Warbler encircling the Baltic Sea and the Greenish \r\nWarbler encircling central Asia - the principal investigator will use geographical \r\nvariation around the ring to reconstruct how two species evolved from one.  He will work \r\nwith Dr. Bensch at Lund to focus on four questions:  1) In the contact zone between two \r\nforms of the Willow Warbler in central Sweden, are there differences in songs between \r\nthe forms and are the differences used in mate choice? 2) How do migration patterns vary \r\naround the Greenish Warbler ring? 3) Is there gradual variation in Willow Warbler \r\npopulations around the Baltic, thereby connecting forms in southern and northern \r\nSweden?  4) What is the migratory behavior of hybrids in central Sweden?  The answers \r\nwill clarify the role of behavioral traits and selection against hybrids in speciation.\r\n\r\nDr. Bensch uses novel techniques to study migration and to measure genetic differences \r\nbetween populations.  Lund University has excellent facilities for studying both migration \r\nand genetic variation. \r\n***\r\n",
