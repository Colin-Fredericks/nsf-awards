 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to develop a research and education plan whose main objective is the integration of economic models and economic history.  The research plan strictly consists of extensive data collection effort combined with a theoretical framework and quantitative analysis. Although in the pre-modern context of medieval and Renaissance Florence, Genoa, and Venice, this research project intends to analyze important issues for contemporary developing economies that share features of a pre-modern economy. Four integrated projects will be implemented. These projects build on the investigator's previous work on medieval and Renaissance Tuscan marriage markets, but greatly expand this work in terms of both the theoretical framework and the historical and contemporary evidence used to test the models.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is explaining why in some societies parents transfer wealth to their daughters through dowries and to their sons through bequests. The custom of dowries is costly to the family. If it is efficient for parents to transfer resources to their children at the time of marriage, they should do so. If it is not efficient for them to transfer resources to their children at the time of marriage, they should be able to choose otherwise. What is the benefit of this custom?  A theoretical framework is built in which dowries are the optimal solution to the tradeoff between family wealth creation and distribution faced by altruistic parents. Second, some historians have argued that dowries disinherit women; when receiving dowries, daughters would receive a smaller share of their family's wealth with respect to their male siblings. However, the evidence presented to support this claim is thin. Given the adverse effects of dowries on women in places such as contemporary India, this question is brought out in sharp relief. Preliminary evidence on early Renaissance Tuscany indicates that dowries did not disinherit women. Parents used dowries to solve a free riding problem between their married daughters and sons, but at the same time they transferred fair shares of wealth to their daughters and sons.  Another important issue is the intertemporal variation in dowry prices. The median dowry value in Florence from 1260 to 1435 increased ten times and a dowry inflation also occurred in contemporary India. It remains an open question whether population growth and the marriage squeeze determined this increase, or whether economic growth and a greater wealth can explain it. The study of the intertemporal variation of dowries in medieval and Renaissance Florence, Genoa, and Venice will also offer the opportunity to analyze the effects of public finance and capital markets on parents' bequest behavior. This can provide interesting insights for contemporary developing countries in which the dowry system is alive and capital markets are imperfect or sometimes missing. Preliminary evidence shows that investments in shares of the public-funded debt played a major role in dowry funding in medieval and early Renaissance Florence.  A significant part of this research will involve the extensive collection of data from Italian archives. The wealth of data partly justifies the focus on the three Italian city-states that were vibrant and leading economies in medieval and Renaissance Europe. More important, the Florentine, Genoese, and Venetian economies are great case studies because by sharing features of both contemporary developing and developed countries they can shed new light on the transition from the former to the latter type of economies.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the education plan is to establish economic history as a major component of both the undergraduate and graduate curricula at Boston University. Given the strong interest by the Department of Economics in research focusing on development economics, the study of past economies, whether they failed or succeeded in developing and growing, is particularly enticing for students. The expected outcome of this education plan is the expansion and improvement of the two economic history courses offered for the first time this past year by Boston University's economics department.  To enrich the courses in economic history, the investigator will also organize each year a lecture series similar to the one realized this past year-made possible by a grant from the Humanities Foundation of Boston University-in which economists and historians working on similar topics presented their work.\r\n",
