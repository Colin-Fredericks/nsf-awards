 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motivated by theoretical as well as major practical interests, new and powerful tools have been developed in the last decade for understanding  local properties of differential operators near singularities.  The  proposed research uses recent techniques and results of exponential asymptotics to address questions in the classification of ordinary  differential equations in singular regions, as well as analytic  properties of partial differential operators.  Among the questions  addressed are: (1a) finding necessary and sufficient criteria for an  ordinary differential equation whose linear part has several regular  singular points and is homogeneous, to be analytically equivalent to  its linear part (in a domain which contains the singular points); (1b)  finding necessary criteria for a nonlinear equation to be analytically  equivalent to its linear (inhomogeneous) part in a neighborhood of one  irregular singular point of rank 1; (2) finding necessary and\r\nsufficient conditions for analytic hypoellipticity of partial  differential operators of type ``sum of squares'', with special focus on  Treves' conjecture.\r\n\r\nThis POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
