 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on finding the fundamental limits on the performance of Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs), and then building AFMs that come closer to those fundamental limits. Development of AFMs for small cantilevers that can be used by scientists and engineers across many disciplines is a primary goal of this research.  Small cantilevers have higher resonant frequencies at a given spring constant, thus the thermal noise is spread out over a larger frequency range giving less noise per unit bandwidth. Since small cantilevers have lower viscous drag in solution less dissipation and smaller fluctuations are observed. This allows faster and gentler imaging of soft materials, such as biological samples.  A strong motivation in this research and development is the long-term goal of making AFMs that can be useful on a wide range of materials, such as enzymes and other proteins for biomaterials processing. Therefore, small cantilevers and small cantilever AFMs could be an important part of the future of scanning probe microscopy, which will be of fundamental and practical interest to materials research. Graduate students involved in the project receive training in fundamental experimental techniques with cutting edge technology. This training will prepare them for a range of careers in academe, industry or government.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research focuses on finding the fundamental limits on the performance of Atomic Force Microscopes (AFMs), and then building AFMs that come closer to those fundamental limits.  Based on previous research, we know that small cantilevers will be essential for this goal.  Thus, we will build AFMs for small cantilevers with goals not only of coming closer to the fundamental limits, but also of making generally useful microscopes for a wide range of applications in materials research and beyond.  On application that seems especially promising is single molecule mechanics of enzymes that nature uses for materials synthesis.  By analyzing single molecule mechanics of enzymes and other proteins, scientists and engineers will be able to develop materials that are environmentally friendly, easy to manufacture (e.g. under ambient conditions), and cost effective. Such materials would span medical and textile industries.  Graduate students involved in the project receive training in fundamental experimental techniques with cutting edge technology. This training will prepare them for a range of careers in colleges, industry or government.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
