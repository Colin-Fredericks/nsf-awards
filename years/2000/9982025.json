 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invertebrate animals in most extant phyla have a complex life history\r\nwith larval and adult phases that are separated by a metamoprhic\r\ntransition.  It is thought that a great deal of evolutionary change has\r\noccurred in the context of this transition. Phylogenetic studies on\r\nbrachiopods indicate that an ancestor of two subphyla: Linguliformea and\r\nCraniiformea gave rise to the more derived subphylum Rhynchonelliformea.\r\nExtant members of the Linguliformea have long lived planktotrophic larvae\r\nthat eat and grow in the plankton, while extant Craniiformea have short\r\nlived lecithotrophic larvae that do not eat.  Both the Linguliformea and\r\nCraniiformea have an excellent fossil record that extends back to the Lower\r\nPaleozoic.  By analyzing the apex of the shells of these fossils one can\r\ninfer when the mantle tissue that laid down the first shell was formed.\r\nAll of the families in these two subphyla initially had planktotrophic\r\nlarvae.  The extant members of the Rhynchonelliformea all have\r\nlecithotriophic larvae.  Since this subphylum originated from an ancestor\r\nwith planktotrophic larvae, lecithotrophy is a derived state.  One aim of\r\nthis proposal is to do a study of fossils in the Rhynchonelliformea that\r\nshow traces of an embryonic or larval mantle in order to trace the\r\nevolution of larval type.  The other aim of this proposal is to examine\r\nmantle formation in the context of metamorphosis in extant brachiopods. 1)\r\nA comparative survey will be done in order to find out to what extent\r\nrepresentatives of extant subphyla use the same signal transduction\r\nmechansisms to trigger metamorphosis following exposure to an appropriate\r\nexternal cue. 2) Experiments will be done where larvae are reared well past\r\nthe normal time of metamorphosis in order to see if continuing\r\ndevelopmental events lead to the formation of post-larval structures such\r\nas a feeding apparatus, alimentary system and shell in the absence of\r\nmetamorphosis. 3) There is a candidate gene , brachiopod \"engrailed\" that\r\nmay play a role in mantle differentiation.  A comparative study will be\r\ndone to examine tissue specific expression of this gene in representatives\r\nof each subphylum.\r\n",
