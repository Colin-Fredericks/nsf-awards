This group affords a broad conduit for exchange of information between the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics program within the US Antarctic Program (USAP), and the diverse parts of the broadly-defined Antarctic earth science community. As such, it is a forum for discussion of the future goals of Antarctic geology and geophysics research, and the future needs of researchers for operational support through the USAP. More specifically, the Working Group brings to the program ideas about new scientific and technical opportunities, programmatic needs, and programmatic opportunities as perceived by the wider earth science community. The Working Group also provides an important mechanism for the flow of information from the program out to the community. The Working Group further serves to provide feedback to the program on logistical support questions relating to the USAP. In providing this function, the Working Group constitutes a useful management tool to help integrate science goals with operational portions of the USAP. The budget of this proposal primarily includes funds to cover travel costs for members of the Working Group and invited experts to attend a meeting at NSF headquarters. Funds are requested to cover salary and wages for development and maintenance of an improved web site to provide information to the Antarctic earth science community. The PI of this award will serve as Chair of the Working Group through August, 2001.",
