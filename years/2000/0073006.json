New methods of \r\nclassifying such group actions will be developed with a \r\nview to making good connections with methods of equivariant \r\nhomotopy theory; basic \"naturality\" questions for the set \r\nof group actions on a manifold will be studied.  Another \r\nset of problems concerns a variety of both topological \r\nand algebraic invariants of varieties, e.g. theories of \r\ncharacteristic classes, and new methods of explicitly \r\ncomputing them.  A related series of questions to be \r\ninvestigated concerns the relations between the global \r\ntopology of divisors and the local geometry of their \r\nsingularities which must, in general, be regarded as \r\n\"singular knots.\"  The natural actions of mapping class \r\ngroups and their Torelli subgroups on the moduli spaces \r\nof representations (which are foundational in algebraic \r\ngeometry, in gauge theory, in 3-manifold topology, and \r\nin string theory) will be investigated with a view to \r\napplications in three dimensional topology.  Decomposition \r\nmethods for studying analytic and geometric invariants of \r\nmanifolds and the relations between them will be investigated, \r\nagain with a view of applying such relation to three \r\nmanifolds.  Computations of generalized characteristic \r\nclasses of toric varieties will be combined with other \r\ntopological, geometric, and analytical methods to obtain \r\nresults in geometrical combinatorics and applications to \r\nproblems concerning lattice sums.\r\n\r\nThis research project involves several investigations in \r\na range of problems in topology and geometry in low and \r\nhigh dimensions and studies of some new applications of \r\nthese in other areas of mathematics.  Some of the research \r\nwork will involve invariants of manifolds and of more \r\ngeneral spaces, such as singular varieties.  Effective \r\nmethods of computing such natural invariants will be \r\nsought.  The moduli spaces and three manifold invariants \r\nto be investigated also arise in geometrical approaches \r\nto theoretical physics.  A combination of geometrical, \r\nalgebraic and analytical methods will be used to study \r\npossible applications of singular varieties to problems \r\nconcerning comparisons of lattice sums with integrals.  \r\nSuch comparisons are of interest in many areas of the \r\nmathematical sciences.\r\n",
