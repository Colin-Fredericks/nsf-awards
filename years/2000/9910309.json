The focus is on geotechnical investigation methods and tools for the design of excavations in civil and mining applications.  At the conclusion of the three-day ROCKSITE conference, participants from India, Norway and the United States will participate in the two-day workshop to discuss the various methods currently being used for site characterization, and participate in a field trip to the large underground powerhouse cavern, Pykara, being constructed in Southern India.\r\n\r\nThe overall theme for both meetings and the field trip is the methods for field-use characterization in rock masses, both those currently in use, as well as potentially new innovative methods.  The discussion is planned around three topics in field site characterization: (1) application to optimizing blast fragmentation, (2) application to surface and underground stability design, and (3) application to fluid flow through rock masses.  Finally, the field trip to the Pykara Powerhouse Project will address field characterization issues involved with this site.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that these meetings will develop a better understanding of rock mass characterization methods.  A World Wide Web site will be established to document the workshop findings and to encourage additional and continued discussion of rock mass characterization methods by the rock mechanics R&D community.\r\n\r\n",
