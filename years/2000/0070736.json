 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his students study capacity theory and its applications \r\nto arithmetic geometry. Capacity is a measure of size for sets, which arises \r\nin potential theory and has applications in probability, complex analysis, \r\nand number theory.  The chief goal of this project is to prove a very strong \r\nversion of the Fekete-Szego theorem on algebraic curves, which asserts that \r\nif an adelic set on a curve has large enough capacity, then there exist \r\nalgebraic points with all their conjugates near it, in an adelic sense. \r\nThe new theorem will be a basic existence theorem producing algebraic points \r\nwhich are subject to real and p-adic rationality conditions, as well as \r\ntopological constraints. To fix ideas, for sets in the complex plane, the \r\ncapacity of a circle turns out to equal its radius, and the capacity of a \r\nline segment is a quarter of its length.  In analysis, the primary distinction \r\nis between sets of capacity  0  and sets of positive capacity:  sets of \r\ncapacity  0  are 'invisible' to holomorphic functions.  In number theory, \r\nthe main distinction is between sets of capacity greater than  1,  and less \r\nthan  1.  The classical theorem of Fekete and Szego says that for a set in \r\nthe complex plane stable under complex conjugation, if the capacity of the \r\nset is greater than 1, then every neighborhood of the set contains infinitely \r\nmany Galois orbits of algebraic integers.  David Cantor generalized the theorem \r\nto adelic sets on the projective line, and subsequently the investigator \r\ngeneralized it to adelic sets on algebraic curves.  As an application, \r\nthe investigator proved an existence theorem for algebraic integer points on \r\naffine algebraic varieties, which has been the object of considerable work by \r\nMoret-Bailly and Szpiro and their students.  Earlier, Raphael Robinson had \r\nextended the Fekete-Szego theorem in another direction, showing that if a \r\nset of capacity greater than  1  were contained in the real line, then every \r\nreal neighborhood contained infinitely many Galois orbits of totally real \r\nalgebraic integers.   Recently the investigator proved an adelic version of \r\nRobinson's theorem, proving the existence of algebraic numbers which were \r\ntotally real and totally p-adic at a finite number of places.  The goal of \r\nthe project is to generalize this theorem to algebraic curves.  The methods \r\nused will involve p-adic analysis, potential theory, and approximation theory \r\nfor algebraic functions. \r\n\r\nThe study of diophantine equations (looking for integer solutions to \r\npolynomial equations in several variables) is a very old and very difficult \r\nsubject, going back to the Greeks.  It is only within the last half-century \r\nthat much progress has been made, using methods of modern number theory.  Two \r\nfamous results were a negative solution to \"Hilbert's Tenth problem\" \r\n(by Matiyasevich in 1970), which asks if there is an algorithm for determining \r\nwhether or not a given equation has integer solutions;  and the negative \r\nresolution of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Wiles in 1995), which asks if sums of \r\nn-th powers of integers can be n-th powers.   The investigator's work pursues \r\na different direction, showing that for much larger arithmetic domains than \r\nthe integers, under appropriate conditions there do exist solutions;  and \r\nmoreover there exist algorithms for telling whether or not they exist.  \r\nThe current work will considerably reduce the size of the domains where \r\nsolutions are known to exist.",
