 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop the theoretical and practical bases for constructing a real-time, multiple camera, vision-based measurement system capable of providing accurate, three-dimensional measurements: (a) for verification of advanced modeling and simulation tools; and, (b) for remote, in-situ, non-destructive evaluation of both large and small structural components. The proposed research will focus on construction of a virtual test bed (VTB) for the vision-based measurement system. The VTB will include the processes of digital imaging, system calibration, image analysis for object measurement, and data synthesis for feature identification. We anticipate that results from the VTB development will identify promising concepts in each of these areas, which will be the focus of a Phase II program. \r\n            Potential applications of the proposed measurement system technology include: (a) remote non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of civilian infrastructure; and, (b) validation of advanced computational models for a wide range of complex systems (i.e., full-scale bridge systems, tank cars, aerospace vehicles) under quasi-static and impact loading. In addition, the measurement technology is readily integrated with other measurement devices (i.e., temperature, pressure, ultrasound, acoustic) for development of a multi-level evaluation system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
