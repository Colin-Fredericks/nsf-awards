 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Abstract\r\n\r\nA square partial sum of a double trigonometric series is the sum of all the\r\nterms with both indices less than or equal to a fixed value. Our first goal is to\r\nstudy square uniqueness for double trigonometric series. By this we mean that if\r\nthe sequence of square partial sums of a double trigonometric series converges to\r\nzero everywhere, then the series is necessarily the trivial series. If this is true, we\r\nwill then try to generalize this result to higher dimensions. The corresponding\r\nstatements for circular/spherical convergence have been shown by Shapiro in\r\ndimension 2 and by Bourgain in higher dimensions; and by Ash-Freiling-Rinne\r\nand, independently, Tetunashvili for the unrestrictedly rectangular convergence\r\ncase in any dimension. There is some evidence that square uniqueness may\r\nactually be false. For example, there is an everywhere square convergent double\r\ntrigonometric series with coefficients having faster than polynomial growth rate.\r\nOur second goal is to study a related question: uniqueness for multiple Walsh\r\nseries under different types of summation modes. The new approach we will\r\ntake is to use classical harmonic analysis methods. By combining the traditional\r\nmartingale approach with the new techniques developed from recent progress\r\nmade in the area of multiple trigonometric series, we expect much progress\r\ncan be made here. This in turn may give insights into the square uniqueness\r\nquestion for trigonometric series. The third goal is to study the long standing\r\nopen question about the pointwise circular convergence for Fourier series of\r\nsquare integrable functions. We will try to shed some light on this by studying\r\nthe corresponding question for double Walsh series, which are special form of\r\ntree-index and two parameter martingales.\r\n\r\nAlmost any surface is composed of simpler ones by a process called multiple\r\nFourier analysis. A major long standing problem in pure mathematics is to\r\nshow that this construction can be accomplished in only one way. This is called\r\nthe problem of uniqueness. There are about a half dozen main varieties of this\r\nproblem depending on just how the simpler surfaces are combined to make the\r\ngeneral surface. Gathering the simple surfaces in different orders may lead to\r\ndifferent resultant surfaces. For certain gathering procedures, uniqueness has\r\nbeen proved. That is, for such gathering, there is only one way to produce\r\nthe resultant surface. The most important gathering procedure for which the\r\nuniqueness remains an open question is called square convergence. We will try\r\nto determine if uniqueness holds for this procedure. Another way to construct a\r\nsurface is to build it up as a combination of two dimensional oscillating square\r\nwaves. Such a process is called a multiple Walsh series. We will consider the\r\nuniqueness question in this context also. We hope that understanding one of\r\nthe two methods of construction may lead to insights about the other.\r\n\r\n",
