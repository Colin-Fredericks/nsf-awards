 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  The primary goal of this project is to address critical problems associated with the implementation of inquiry-based laboratory activities in courses taught by graduate teaching assistants.  This goal is being reached by first taking a comprehensive look at the infrastructure needed to support inquiry in this setting.  The principal investigators are adapting the best available laboratory activities, assessment strategies, and teaching assistant development tools to meet the specific needs of an investigative laboratory. Products of this project include a laboratory manual linked to a portfolio assessment tool, an instructor's manual containing pedagogical support, and a teaching assistant development program incorporating mentoring and supplemental pedagogical seminars.  This program is being formatively and summatively assessed by an internal evaluation team.  A dissemination program including publication of teaching materials and a course website is a major part of this project.  This project is applicable on a national level for non-major environmentally based biology courses.  The portfolio based assessment is useful to all science labs.  This program is also benefitting the preservice teachers who comprise 25% of the enrollment for the introductory course, Environment of Life.  Beyond the scope of this proposal, but fundamental to the comprehensive approach taken by the principal investigators, are longitudinal studies and linkages with the science methods courses taken by these students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
