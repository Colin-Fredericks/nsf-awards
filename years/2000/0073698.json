 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project is directed towards the development, analysis and numerical \r\nvalidation of new finite element methods for fluid flows and \r\nelectromagnetics.  The research in methods for fluid flows will focus on \r\napplications of nonstandard least-squares principles in the construction\r\nof the numerical algorithms.  While for incompressible viscous flows \r\nconventional least-squares principles have established themselves as a \r\nviable alternative to mixed Galerkin methods, such principles are not \r\ncompletely satisfactory in the context of high Re or transonic flows.  To \r\ncircumvent existing computational defects of L2-norm methods such as \r\nsensitivity to singularities, lack of norm equivalence and etc., the new \r\nalgorithms will be based on mesh-dependent and negative-norm least-squares \r\nprinciples.  The emphasis of the second research direction will be on eddy \r\ncurrent computations in three dimensions.  To address computational \r\ncomplexity of 3D simulations algorithms will use equivalent potential \r\nformulations of the governing equations.  The issue of proper gauge \r\nselection for the potentials will receive a thorough and systematic \r\nexamination so as to ensure well-posed sets of differential equations.  \r\nAlgorithmic development will pay special attention to the efficient \r\nimplementation of the relevant boundary and interface conditions where \r\nleast-squares terms will be used to enforce these conditions weakly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common thread which links the two principal research directions of\r\nthis project is the focus on new computational algorithms for partial \r\ndifferential equations.  Such equations arise in virtually every field of \r\nscience and engineering and their efficient numerical solution is critical \r\nfor our ability to conduct computer simulations of physical processes \r\nranging from atmospheric motions to flows of current in superconductors.  \r\nAs a result, development of high performance computational tools which \r\nenable realistic simulations will play an increasingly important role for \r\nthe future advances in science and technology.  The impact of such \r\ncomputational algorithms will be felt not only in terms of tremendous cost \r\nand/or time savings made possible by replacing field experiments by \r\nvirtual, computer experiments, but also by the fact that in some instances \r\ncomputer models may be the only feasible design approach.  In the focus of \r\nthis project is the development of such tools for differential equations \r\narising in modeling of fluid flows and electromagnetic fields.  Two \r\nspecific applications that we have in mind are computation of \r\nthree-dimensional eddy currents and simulations of transonic and high \r\nReynolds number flows.  One motivation for our research is the practical \r\nrelevance of these problems.  For instance, solution of the eddy current \r\nequations arises in such varied areas as development of toroidal field \r\nmagnets for fusion power, modeling of plasma physics phenomena, and design \r\nof tape heads, while transonic and high Re flows are relevant to design of \r\naircraft and modeling of dispersion of pollutants.  At the same time \r\nnumerical solution of these problems in realistic three-dimensional \r\nsettings continues to be an outstanding and challenging computational\r\ntask. Thus, our research is also motivated by the real and existing need to \r\ndevelop efficient and robust computational tools for electromagnetics and \r\nfluid flow applications which can be used in such realistic settings.\r\n\r\n",
