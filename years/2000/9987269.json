 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed program would have a dramatic impact on the time that it takes a student to graduate and in the overall academic profile of the student. Students in this project will be able to take advantage of undergraduate research opportunities that are often available to only a few select students. The five University of New Mexico (UNM) School of Engineering (SOE) departments, the Department of Mathematics and the MEMS program are proposing to use NSF CSEMS funding to create a comprehensive program to ensure retention to degree completion, professional development and career placement upon termination. The program will stress the relationships between academic studies and workplace needs.\r\n\r\nThe program provides the opportunity for students, faculty and staff to concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators and students as they pursue joint efforts that infuse their engineering and science education. The undergraduate research experiences especially provide a sense of excitement and discovery. In our PI, Dr. Paul Fleury, Dean of the School of Engineering, we have a leader who is totally committed to our goal of increasing the numbers of Hispanic, African-American and Native American students academically prepared to enter the workplace after academic achievements that have shown the close relationships between academia and the workplace, as well as the relationships between academic studies and research ??how all of these complement and reinforce one another symbiotically. Our years of experience have convinced us that effective mentors are key to producing outstanding engineers and scientists. The passionate devotion to research is contagious as students and faculty work together on research projects. \r\n\r\nAnother key aspect of our programs is our close relationships with corporate, government and other organizations that provide the students with opportunities to participate in exciting activities that make them aware of the vast opportunities that await them as a result of their completion of BS and advanced degrees. Summer internships and co-op placements provide the students with exposure to a wide variety of real world engineering experiences that reinforce their dedication to their academic work at UNM. We are especially concerned that, through our evaluation and documentation processes, other programs nationwide can replicate our successes and avoid our failures. In summary, we sincerely believe that this program can enable our extant programs to make even greater future achievements in preparing African-American, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans to receive their rightful place in the American economy. \r\n",
