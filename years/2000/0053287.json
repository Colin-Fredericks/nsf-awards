 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nLac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa Community College, (Hayward, WI) and the University of Wisconsin-Superior are forming a partnership to build an asynchronous learning environment in which a complete four-year degree in Information Technology is being offered by both institutions simultaneously as well as two-year programs in the community college. By collaborating in this partnership, and working with businesses and industrial partners, the unique needs of underserved populations are being addressed. The Information Technology program is a shared offering that provides online specializations ranging from certificates in basic computer and Intenet skills to a complete four-year degree. The courses in this program are being mirrored, credit for credit, by each institution so that whatever a student earns at one college transfers to the other college. Faculty and staff of both institutions are developing program content in a collaborative effort where new online courses are being developed and existing synchronous courses are being adapted and made available. A virtual private network is being implemented between the partners in order to allow the development of systems integration of support services. Business and industry are partnering with the higher education institutions to help create the skilled information technology workforce needed to meet their needs and strengthen the economies of the Native American and rural communities served by the colleges. Full accreditation for the program is being sought from the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges. Evaluation and assessment of the development of online content is an ongoing, dynamic process from conceptualization to implementation of curricula that is being documented and published as a model for the development of learning in an asynchronous environment.\r\n\r\n",
