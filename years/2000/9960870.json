 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems (IFOS) addresses the next generation data networks which will require terabit information handling capability.  Future networks must be reconfigurable, highly secure and easily upgradable in both bit rate and number of nodes.  IFOS proposes to apply its extensive fiber optic expertise and its proprietary wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) technology to the development of a reconfigurable high-speed fiber-optic backbone structure that supports the transmission of multiple data protocols between multiple network stations.  The approach is based on IFOS's all-fiber static and dynamic WDM network access designs, which offer high efficiency, compactness and low cost.  The strong multidisciplinary team for this project includes leading experts in fiber-optic devices, optoelectronic systems, and terabit networking.  In Phase I, the investigative team will construct a three-node, two-wavelength system with static access modules to demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously transmitting different protocols such as ATM and Ethernet.  Phase I will form a basis for Phase II where dynamic access modules will be employed and the network will be expanded to more than 10 nodes and over 6 wavelengths to demonstrate network reconfigurability and scalability.  The ultra-fast IFOS approach will enhance efficiency in secure, ultra-high-capacity networking systems including Next Generation Internet (NGI) operation with gigabit and terabit bandwidths.\r\n\r\nThe market for fiber-optic networks is growing about 19% per year and will be reaching $18 billion in 2001.  Multi-protocol fiber backbones have applications in commercial platforms, such as enterprise networks, ships, airliners, automobiles and integrated manufacturing equipment.  Each optical fiber can replace hundreds of wires resulting in substantial drop in costs and increase in performance.  The IFOS project will mesh well with the Internet-II and SuperNet (Tbps data rates) programs for the government-wide Next Generation Internet (NGI).\r\n",
