 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project in Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry comprising\r\ntwo parts. The first part deals with the study of values of L-functions\r\nof varieties (motives) over number fields. In previous work the investigator\r\nand his collaborator have extended the conjectures of Bloch\r\nKato, Fontaine, Perrin-Riou to motives with (possibly noncommutative)\r\ncoefficients. At the same time they have established a precise link\r\nbetween these conjectures and classical Galois module theory, thereby\r\ngeneralizing various conjectures and theorems in this latter area to\r\narbitrary motives. With the conjectural picture firmly in place, the\r\nmain task now is to prove more cases. What seems within reach of\r\ncurrent techniques are Tate motives over number fields, CM elliptic\r\ncurves (with CM by non-maximal orders) and the adjoint of a modular\r\nform (with action of the integral Hecke algebra). The last two are\r\ncurrently looked into by students of the investigator. Equally within\r\nreach seems to be a proof of the compatibility of the equivariant special\r\nvalue conjectures with the functional equation of the L-function.\r\nThe second part of the project is a rather concrete question in deformation\r\ntheory (of schemes, vector bundles or representations of profinite\r\ngroups). Using the theory of the cotangent complex one can define\r\nhigher Kodaira Spencer maps and the investigator proposes to study\r\nthe injectivity of these maps. In degree 1 this is known and leads to a\r\ncriterion for smoothness of the deformation ring. The case of most\r\ninterest is degree 2 where a similar injectivity would lead to a simple\r\ncriterion for the deformation ring to be a local complete intersection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a project in number theory which has been part of the mathematical\r\nheritage ever since the Babylonians discovered that there can be triangles\r\nwith all sides of integer length and one angle of ninety degrees. By the\r\ntheorem of Pythagoras this gives integer solutions of an algebraic equation.\r\nModern number theory still looks for integer solutions of algebraic equations\r\nbut this search is informed and enriched by much deeper connections with ideas\r\nfrom geometry and topology than the ones alluded to in this introductory\r\nexample.  The theory of special values of L-functions is a case in point. While defined\r\nby counting solutions of equations modulo prime number it turns out that values\r\nof these functions can sometimes be expressed in terms of integrals of\r\ndifferential forms, or volumes of certain lattices. Nobody knows exactly why such a relationship\r\nshould hold. The examples one can prove all seem to rely on some happy\r\ncoincidences, although they follow a pattern that leads one to guess (\"conjecture\") what\r\nhappens in general. This is much like the situation in an experimental science. The\r\ninvestigator and his collaborator have generalized this picture to situations where the\r\nsystem of equations has some additional symmetries and they now try to collect\r\nfurther evidence for (or indeed falsify!) their conjectures. As far as applications are\r\nconcerned, number theorists would probably agree that L-functions are a key concept in their\r\nfield. On the other hand, number theory as a whole no longer needs to be defensive about its\r\napplicability, with much of cryptography and coding, on the internet and\r\notherwise, being based on its results.",
