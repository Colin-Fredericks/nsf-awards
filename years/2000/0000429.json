The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Yang Shao-Horn with 24 months support to work with Dr. Claude Delmas, Head of the Solid State Ionics Group at the Institute of Condensed Matter Chemistry (ICMCB) in Bordeaux, France. This project is co-funded by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\nThis project will study structural and electrochemical properties of layered lithium manganese derivatives having the O2 type oxygen stacking.  The aim is to determine and improve the electrochemical behavior of novel layered lithium manganese derivatives with the O2 type structure as the positive electrode in lithium rechargeable cells.\r\nDr. Delmas has extensive knowledge in intercalation chemistry of layered compounds.  ICMCB is one of the largest public research labs in the world involved in solid state chemistry and materials science.  It is supported by approximately 200 researchers and supporting staff, with state of the art facilities in solid state chemistry and materials science.\r\n",
