Brun             DBI#  9987835\r\n\r\nIn the last two years, with funding from Indiana University-Bloomington, the members of the MBG Program  have introduced 20 undergraduate students, mostly from small colleges, to the fascinating world of scientff ic research by allowing them to participate in research at the frontiers of molecular biology and genetics.  An REU Site Grant will allow the to continuation of a very successful Undergraduate Research Program to benefit students mainly from groups traditionally underrepresented in research and students from regional undergraduate institutions.  Ten students will conduct research in laboratories that use molecular biology and genetic techniques to study problems including the regulation of gene expression, the mechanisms of cell differentiation and development, host-parasite interaction and disease resistance in plants, gene evolution, signal transduction, DNA repair, and virus infection and replication.\r\nThis program is designed to develop both the technical and the intellectual abilities of the participants.  The  philosophy is that one learns how to do research by doing it but that this only occurs under the appropriate guidance.  The program will emphasize the \"doing R\" aspect of research by involving the students in a research project under close supervision.  Students will learn about the different stages and aspects of scientific investigation by interaction with their mentors and in sessions on scientific writing and research ethics.  Students will also be exposed to the research conducted in the other host laboratories during weekly lunchtime seminars given by faculty mentors.\r\n\r\n",
