HSPN supports a testbed that consists of an assortment of ATM equipment and the research focus has been on ATM technology issues, including wireless ATM networks.  MET has workstations equipped with video capture and presentation facilities and the research emphasis has been on ubiquitous access to multimedia databases.  The MIND Lab has an array of virtual reality facilities and the current research examines communication and human-computer interaction in virtual environments.  These three labs will conduct collaborative interdisciplinary research, with the primary emphasis on the support of multimedia data streams over both wireless and hybrid networks, with the multimedia data being generated/displayed by the research activities to take place in the MET and MIND Labs. \r\n\r\nThese three labs will conduct collaborative interdisciplinary research, with the primary emphasis on the support of multimedia data streams over both wireless and hybrid networks, with the multimedia data being generated/displayed by the research activities to take place in the MET and MIND Labs.  To carry out the proposed research MSU will purchase the following equipment: (1) t multimedia lap-tops, (2) 10Mbps WaveLan products, 2 video-on-demand servers, 2 head centered: 2 head's up status displays: info hemisphere, body centered data sphere, virtual tool belt, sensor array, lipstick camera, and microphones.\r\n",
