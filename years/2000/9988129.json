 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is on developing techniques and algorithms that\r\nwill allow idle workstations to be opportunistically exploited for parallel\r\nand distributed shared-memory applications. The target environments range\r\nfrom local-area networks (LAN's) to wide-area networks (WAN's). The central\r\nchallenges are competition from other applications for workstation and\r\nnetwork resources, load imbalance arising from differing system speeds, and\r\nheterogeneity.\r\n\r\nThe intent is to design and build as transparent a system as possible. Such\r\na system will need new methods of deriving dynamic sharing and processor\r\ncapacity information online, new load-balancing and thread-migration\r\nheuristics that minimize both communication and load imbalance in dynamic\r\nenvironments, and easy-to-use API's that will provide the type information\r\nneeded to address heterogeneity. The end result of this work will be a set\r\nof techniques, policies, and code that will allow shared-memory\r\napplications to be transparently migrated across a set of non-dedicated\r\nworkstations. In allowing otherwise-unused resources to be exploited by\r\nthis new application domain, this research will significantly expand the\r\nvalue of incrementally-deployed sets of workstations.\r\n",
