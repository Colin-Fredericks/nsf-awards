Burgess\r\nSociety for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)\r\n\r\nThis award to the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) enables the organization to recruit approximately 100 Latino and Native American undergraduate students to participate in the 2000 SACNAS National Conference.  This meeting will be held in Atlanta, Oct. 12-15, 2000.  At the conference the students will present research results in the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Poster Session.  The students will also participate in a number of workshops and seminars to prepare them for the graduate school application process.  To complement those activities, a number of graduate school representatives will be available to the students in an exhibit hall.  These representatives will be talking to the students about their graduate programs and collecting their resumes.  \r\n\r\nHistorically, the SACNAS National Conferences have focused on students from chemistry, biology, and health-related disciplines.  In recent years SACNAS has been expanding its scope to include engineering as well as other science-related fields.  Thus, the SACNAS program is beginning to reflect the funding profile of NSF.  This renewal award provides support to continue that broadening process.  Short-term goals of this activity include an increase in the number of SACNAS conference attendees with interests in the non-biomedical sciences and engineering.  In the longer term, increases in Latinos and Native Americans in NSF-relevant science and engineering activities are expected.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported jointly by the Directorates for Engineering; Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; and Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
