The objective is to expand our understanding of large transverse-momentum particle production data from hadronic and nuclear collisions in a wide energy range. This project examines particle production in nuclear collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with the intent of ascertaining the presence of nontrivial collective phenomena such as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). \r\n\r\nResearcher efforts will feature theoretical description of observables in such relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The U.S.-Hungary team will attempt to identify a kinematical window, where the measured photon, lepton and hadron data reveal either QGP formation or the appearance of some other exotic state of strongly interacting matter.  Plans include the development of a phenomenological model based on pQCD to describe the experimental data and to determine whether genuine collective effects, e.g. QGP formation, are necessary to reproduce the data.  If successful, genuine collective effects revealed by the data will further our understanding of strong-interaction physics.  Such new knowledge is critical for the progress of high-energy nuclear physics and should contribute to astrophysics and cosmology as well.\r\n\r\nThis project in nuclear and particle physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.\r\n\r\n",
