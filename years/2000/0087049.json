 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), in collaboration with the Council of Independent Colleges (CIC) and the Independent Colleges Office (OIC), is conducting a three-year project to develop interest in K-12 mathematics and science teaching careers among undergraduate students and concurrently support K-12 faculty teaching science and mathematics. This project adapts components of the NSF GK-12 program for implementation in predominately undergraduate colleges, including community colleges. Recognizing the national need for excellence in science and mathematics in K-12 schools, AACC, CIC, and OIC and their community-based member colleges are developing partnerships with K-12 schools in local communities. The K-12 Teacher Development (KTD) program features science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) college students as content resources and role models in K-12 classrooms. The college students gain mentoring and classroom experiences with K-12 students by sharing their knowledge and skills; the K-12 teachers gain content resources for their classrooms. The KTD program improves communication and fosters awareness of K-12 teaching as a career for college students, offers classroom assistance and curricular enrichment to K-12 teachers, provides opportunities for college faculty to help undergraduate students implement discipline-specific applications and pedagogical strategies, and provides enriched learning opportunities in SMET for K-12 students. The program includes the following components: 1) greater awareness by college students of K-12 instruction in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology; 2) a network of K-12, community college, and four-year college faculty and schools; 3) collaboration by AACC and CIC to offer a national grant competition for their member colleges; 4) incentives such as community service scholarships, stipends, mini-grants, or course credit to encourage student involvement in K-12 schools; 5) mentoring relationships; 6) professional development opportunities for K-12 and college faculty; 7) dissemination through publications, presentations, and the World Wide Web; and 8) program evaluation",
