Fluency is a new standard of IT knowledge formulated by the\r\nNational Research Council's Committee on Information Technology Literacy in\r\ntheir report, Being Fluent With Information Technology.  To enable students\r\nto continually learn IT, Fluency provides the foundations (concepts) on\r\nwhich to build further understanding, and the mechanisms (capabilities) to\r\nunderstand when more must be learned.  The goal of this project is to pave\r\nthe way for the widespread offering of information technology fluency\r\ncourses in K-12 schools, community colleges and adult education.  The\r\nproject will allow the creation of a Fluency 1 curriculum whose\r\npresentation stretches over one year, allowing for a paced introduction of\r\nIT topics and time to prepare for and work on IT projects.  Fluency 1\r\ncontains components of algorithmic thinking and programming and should help\r\nprovide teaching guidance that is suitable to assist a present \"computer\r\nliteracy\" teacher in teaching Fluency.\r\n",
