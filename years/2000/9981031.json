 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The algebra-based introductory physics course in most universities is a two-semester sequence, whose major population are health science majors. Very little attention has been paid to this course either by researchers or curriculum developers. This project is aimed at making physics concepts more understandable to these students and more applicable to their interests. The Workshop Physics method of instruction is a way to address these issues. The Workshop Physics curriculum is being adapted to the needs of the algebra based class and new units with applications to health science topics are being developed. Another major objective of the project is to encourage the Workshop Physics method of instruction at the home institutions of the principal investigators of this project, other colleges and universities, and at high schools. This is being addressed by offering professional faculty development workshops. The Workshop Physics method of instruction is a calculus-based curriculum that involves a hands-on, computer-based laboratory environment that replaces the typical lecture-lab-discussion format. First the curriculum is being adapted from a calculus- to an algebra-based course. Next new units will be developed with applications to the health sciences. The adaptation and implementation is taking place over a three-year period, with continuous evaluation and revision. In the third summer a faculty development workshop will be held to introduce faculty to the Workshop physics method by working through the newly developed units. This and other workshops will be used to disseminate a complete algebra-based version of Workshop Physics, including the newly developed units. This project will result in an algebra-based curriculum that will give students a solid understanding of physics concepts, make them aware of relevant physics applications to health science, and introduce them to a new pedagogy. In addition, more faculty will be introduced to Workshop Physics and new units will be developed.\r\n\r\n",
