 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) This Proof-of-Concept project develops the first three chapters of a Mineralogy textbook that is accessible and relevant to students by presenting the material in accord with modern learning theory.  The chapters are thoroughly integrated with a CD-ROM focused on active learning by students.  Every text illustration is reproduced in color 3-D and includes animations, interactive exercises, and narration by the authors.   The textbook reflects the industrial experience of both authors' in industry and their years of teaching science education, geoscience, planetary science, and materials science.  The textbook addresses a diversity of student perspectives ranging from science teachers to geologists, across the broader earth sciences, to connections with cognate disciplines like chemistry, physics, mathematics, and biology.  This project involves collaboration among authors at Mount Holyoke College and the University of Idaho.  Educators at the University of Idaho are performing evaluations.  Tasa Graphic Arts, Inc.,  is producing the illustrations and the CD.  The initial three chapters are the basis for a  low-cost textbook that incorporates state-of-the-art pedagogy and computer animation that may be used by students in the geosciences as well as science education programs.  Funding for preparation of these initial chapters demonstrates the innovative ideas proposed for the full text illustrating the potential for improving the quality of science teacher preparation, adding diversity to the textbooks in this field, and providing for integration of technology into earth science and related curricula.\r\n",
