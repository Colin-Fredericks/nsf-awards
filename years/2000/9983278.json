 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance the research infrastructure at the University of Wyoming, the state's only university and its only four-year institution of higher education.   Wyoming chose to focus the improvement of its research activities around the theme of science and engineering in harsh environments,  a theme appropriate for the state considering its temperature extremes, limited precipitation, high sunlight impact, saline soil and population impact in limited geographic areas.  The specific scientific areas selected to be focused on 1) Natural Resources Sciences, and 2) Materials Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe University will hire at least 10 new faculty members (6 for Natural Resources and 4 for Materials).  These new hires are expected to engage in and develop multidisciplinary research teams that can improve the research competitiveness of the University and have a potential economic impact on the state.  Multi-use research equipment will be acquired to assist both new and existing university researchers.  A faculty development program will be initiated to assist the research competitiveness of junior faculty.   Programs will be supported that assist in the development of research-oriented small businesses within Wyoming, that involve high school and undergraduate students in research activities, and that expose K-12 teachers to university science and mathematics instruction.\r\n\r\nImprovement of the University of Wyoming's research infrastructure is important not only to the ability of the University's researchers to successfully compete for federal research funds but also to the development of the state as a whole.  Wyoming's economy has been historically based on natural resource use.  Support of research infrastructure improvements at the University of Wyoming can play a significant role in the diversification of the state's economy by assisting in the development of technology-related businesses in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
