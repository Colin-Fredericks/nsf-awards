 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology for 2000.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is in the area of Microbial Genetics and is entitled \"Molecular Biology of Anaerobic Ethylbenzene Oxidation\".  The goal of this research is to advance the understanding of the processes involved in the microbial metabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons under anaerobic conditions.  Recent biochemical investigation of anaerobic ethylbenzene degradation with the denitrifying bacterium Azoarcus sp. strain EB1 has led to a proposed pathway for ethylbenzene mineralization.  DNA microarray analysis and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments are used to identify genes differentially expressed during anaerobic growth of Azoarcus.  These experiments will lead to identification and functional analysis of genes involved in ethylbenzene mineralization, with special consideration of the gene associated with ethylbenzene dehydrogenase (a novel enzyme found within Azoarcus which catalyzes the removal of a hydride from an aromatic hydrocarbon, initiating anaerobic ethylbenzene oxidation).  The genetic tools developed here, in addition to furthering knowledge of hydrocarbon metabolism, will also be helpful in identifying environmental factors involved in regulation of ethylbenzene degradation and will help to maximize the potential use of these organisms for bioremediation applications.\r\n\r\n",
