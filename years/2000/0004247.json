 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to investigate control systems for a human-machine shared locomotion platform to assist the human in pedestrian mobility. \r\nThe project is specifically motivated by the need of  the elderly. The elderly are often restricted in their mobility and must rely on canes, walkers, and ultimately, wheelchairs for indoor mobility. Restrictions in mobility lead to a loss of independence for the elderly, often resulting in nursing home admission. This research will develop a control system for a semi-autonomous, wheeled \"walker\" (c.f. a lightweight frame used in the aid of walking) in which the user provides the locomotive force and the user and the walker collaborate on the steering.  Specific investigation includes developing shared control techniques that assists the ambulatory elderly in guidance in known environments, providing basic safety measures in known and unknown environments (i.e. curb detection and automatic braking), implementing a hardware prototype and empirically testing the performance of the system using a variety of discrete situations developed in concert with geriatrics professionals.The essence of this research is to explore new control techniques appropriate for shared control with elderly operators.\r\n\r\n",
