Technological literacy is the basis for the development of programs in Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Research into how students come to understand technological concepts lags behind similar research in science and mathematics education. This conference is the second conference of researchers in science and technology education to consider how students learn about technology. The first conference surveyed existing issues. This conference is to discuss specific models that would be useful in technology education and provide some guidance in planning research projects. The research will influence materials development and professional development projects in ATE and Instructional Materials Development (IMD.)",
