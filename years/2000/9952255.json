 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) This project will equip 12 student stations in the general chemistry laboratory with sensors interfaced to computers for data acquisition and analysis. The interface and software (LabWorks II), developed under a previous NSF initiative, adapts and integrates computer technology into the chemistry laboratory. This project involves the adaptation and implementation of well documented (and referenced) materials.  Over 300 students majoring in various disciplines of engineering technology, computer science, and other degree programs take the general chemistry course each year. It is service oriented since all students are non-majors.  A chemistry major is not offered.  The goals and objectives of the project focus on getting students fully engaged in the process of chemical experimentation and utilizing laboratory time effectively in the learning process. Using these platforms (LabWorks II), students become engaged in the overall design of an experiment as they enter or review the program for data collection. Sensors that detect changes in pH, temperature, pressure, conductivity, and color change or light absorption enable students to investigate a wide range of scientific questions, and interfacing these sensors with computers permits rapid data acquisition and expression of results in the form of graphs or statistical parameters. Students have time during the laboratory to analyze and interpret their data and often to redesign and repeat the data collection procedure. With these platforms, the emphasis of the laboratory changes from verifying and illustrating scientific principles to utilizing these principles for the exploration and investigation of practical problems and to thinking about what the results mean.  Project evaluation is directed to assessing students' skills in critical thinking, quantitative reasoning and the application of scientific reasoning.  The evaluation and assessment phase of the project is being assisted by the involvement of an outside evaluator (chemist, different college) and an internal (non-departmental) professional.",
