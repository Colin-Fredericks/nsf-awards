The organizers have contacted and received tentative \r\nacceptance from 14 plenary speakers who will address the state of the art \r\nand future research directions in their respective fields.  The plenary \r\nspeakers will also be asked to write 10-15 page chapters, summarizing the \r\nperspectives and recommendations made in their addresses, which will be \r\npublished within a year after the conference.  Secondly, younger scientists \r\nwill be invited to present contributed talks that focus on specific \r\napplications modeled by distributed parameter systems. This will provide \r\nthe younger scientists with exposure to the perspectives provided by the \r\nplenary speakers and a mechanism for disseminating their own research.  \r\nThe conference is scheduled for October 5-7, 2000 at North Carolina State \r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nSignificant advances in both theoretical and computational resources have \r\nrecently facilitated the development and implementation of distributed \r\nparameter models and control designs that incorporate the full spatial and \r\ntemporal behavior of complex physical systems. Because distributed \r\nparameter methods are based on the physical mechanisms that produce the \r\nsystem dynamics, the approach provides advanced capabilities with regard \r\nto system design and control. The Conference on Future Directions in \r\nDistributed Parameter Systems, which is scheduled for October 5-7, 2000 \r\nat North Carolina State University, will provide a forum that illustrates \r\npast accomplishments in this field and indicates open questions, \r\nchallenges, and future research directions.  The organizers have contacted \r\nand received tentative acceptances from 14 internationally recognized \r\nscientists who will address the state of the art and future research \r\ndirections in their respective fields.  The plenary speakers will also be \r\nasked to write 10-15 page chapters summarizing the perspectives and \r\nrecommendations made in their addresses.  These will be published within \r\na year after the conference.  Secondly, younger scientists will be invited to \r\npresent contributed talks that focus on specific applications modeled by \r\ndistributed parameter systems.
