 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on mass production of\r\ntriploid marine shrimp. Marine shrimp culture experienced exponential growth between 1980\r\nand 1990, increasing from 5% to 28% of total world production. Since then, farmed shrimp\r\nproduction has stagnated due to disease and water quality problems. Disease problems are\r\nlargely due to dependence on wild caught shrimp broodstock and post larvae, which carry\r\nmany untreatable viral diseases. A solution to this problem is closed-cycle culture, which\r\nalso permits genetic selection for improved production performance. To protect a breeder's\r\ninvestment in specific pathogen free (SPF)stock, specific pathogen resistant (SPR) stock,\r\nand genetic selection, it is highly desirable to sell only sterile post larvae. Triploidy is a\r\npossible solution since triploids of other species are typically sterile and may exhibit\r\nsuperior culture performance. In addition triploidy may allow for the culture of exotic\r\nspecies in environmentally sensitive areas where exclusion of exotics is desirable. \r\nPhase II will focus on development of tetraploid breeding stocks that will be crossed with\r\nnormal diploid stocks to produce triploid progeny.\r\n\r\nThe successful outcome of our R&D effort will result in significant changes in marine\r\nshrimp culture. It will prevent competitors from propagation of shrimp stocks that have\r\nbeen genetically selected for aquaculture performance. It will help stimulate large-scale\r\ninvestment in SPF, SPR, genetic selection and closed-cycle shrimp culture. It will help\r\ncreate opportunities to expand use of exotic shrimp species into environmentally sensitive\r\nculture areas. Our company intends to be at the forefront of these opportunities.\r\n",
