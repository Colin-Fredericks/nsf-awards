 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  Students entering our upper-level biology courses are weak in their understanding of basic biological concepts and scientific methodologies.  Furthermore, many students have difficulty succeeding in our introductory courses and, on average, fewer than 40% of entering students complete the major.  Our project is designed to enhance learning by our biology majors through reconstruction of our introductory biology curriculum. The project has five major objectives:  (1) to combine broad exposure of students to basic scientific concepts with significant opportunities for in-depth understanding through direct investigation; (2) to place a greater emphasis on concepts, processes, and active scientific inquiry; (3) to develop the intellectual tools needed by students to grasp and explore new scientific topics at the outset of their undergraduate curriculum; (4) to provide a supportive student-centered curriculum that facilitates the transition of students from a high school to an undergraduate level of study; and (5) to enhance the ability of faculty to adapt and introduce newly developed materials, pedagogical methods, and technologies into their courses.  We are implementing a new introductory curriculum that consists of two new concept courses and revised courses in Botany and Zoology.  The curriculum is based on adaptation and implementation of exemplary teaching practices (e.g., active learning in large lectures, collaboration among students, and case studies) and laboratory investigations (e.g., Dickey and Koniski's investigative approaches, Research Link 2000) that are inquiry-based.  Development of assessment methods and project evaluation is being conducted under the leadership of D. Ebert-May.  Throughout the project, development of the teaching abilities of all faculty is being emphasized.  As a result of our new curriculum, it is expected that students are developing the intellectual tools and knowledge of content necessary for enhanced learning in advanced courses, while increasing their confidence and interest in biological study.\r\n\r\n",
