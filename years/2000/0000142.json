 "awd_abstract_narration": "0000142\r\nThis research project addresses crack blunting and\r\nconcomitant defect generation at the atomic length scale,\r\nprocesses that profoundly impact the macroscopic\r\nmechanical response of structural metals and alloys.  The\r\nperformance and reliability of high strength steels,\r\naluminum alloys, etc., are compromised when subject to\r\nadverse conditions such as low temperature, stress, and/or\r\nharsh chemical environments.  The scope of this project\r\ngoes beyond traditional continuum-mechanical treatments,\r\nin that it attempts to  appropriately model material behavior\r\nat the various length scales from macroscopic to atomistic,\r\nwhile self-consistently bridging the various theories.  One\r\nadvantage of the approach taken is that linear elastic\r\nfracture mechanics, as well as the stress singularities and\r\nempirical fracture criteria associated therewith, are\r\ndiscarded in favor of physically-motivated criteria imposed\r\nat the near-atomic length scale. Specifically, this effort will\r\nprobe: 1) the phenomenon of \"brittle\" crack growth in the\r\npresence of pre-existing, apparently mobile, dislocations; 2)\r\nthe role of nanoscale blunting of a sharp crack propagating\r\nthrough a dislocation-free zone, embedded in a plastically\r\ndeforming medium; and 3) the mechanics of twinning and\r\ncomplex stacking fault formation.  The results are expected\r\nto improve our understanding of the brittle-to-ductile\r\ntransition and to yield practical methods for reducing the\r\nlikelihood of brittle failure of structural metallic alloys.\r\n\r\nThe specific systems to be considered in this research\r\ninclude aluminum and high strength steels, with a strong\r\nfocus on aerospace applications (e.g., cracking scenarios in\r\naging aircraft, and the extreme temperature and chemical\r\nenvironments associated with turbine and rocket\r\npowerplants).  In addition, a pilot program to explore the\r\nuse of micromachined fixtures (\"MEMS\" technology) to\r\ntest some of the concepts arising from this work, and/or to\r\nmeasure key materials properties, will be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
