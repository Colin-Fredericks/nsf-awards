 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal deals with very important area of theory development and modeling for hybrid power systems, dynamic available transmission capability (capacity), use of General Minimal Residual method (GMRES) to speed up model computation, congestion reduction via real-time control using FACTS devices. Past work includes application of Trajectory Sensitivity Theory to parameter variations, initial conditions and machine (e.g. generator) sensitivity as well as locating vulnerabilities in a power network. \r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses problems in security assessment within a restructured industry.  Such operation has shifted the focus of concern in dynamic security assessment to the assessment of available transmission capacity.  In order to handle this redefined problem, the proposal addresses (i) modeling of the system in greater detail, to incorporate power electronic devices for network flow control within a nonlinear hybrid model, and (ii) the use of trajectory sensitivity to evaluate contingent dynamic stability.  A particular strategy  proposed is to \"use the results obtained in the iterative problem solver technique to solve both the state space and the sensitivity models,\" since \"the Jacobean for both the models is the same while using the simultaneous implicit method.\r\n",
