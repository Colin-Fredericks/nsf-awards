In particular, the research focuses on women and women's organizations in Ghana.  While it is known that some such organizations have appeared in Ghana and are working to promote the social positions of women, little is known at present about the outcomes of those efforts.  Similarly, it is not known why some non-governmental organizations transform themselves to social advocacy organizations while others do not.  Research conclusions will be based on interviews with over 600 members of women's organizations, and multi-variate models of causal chains.",
