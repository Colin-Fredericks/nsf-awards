 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for a CAREER award. This project has two principal research goals. First, it will propose analytical solutions for the geometric design problems of spatial mechanisms and robotic systems using polynomial elimination methods. Second, procedures to manufacture mechanisms and robotic systems using Rapid Prototyping techniques will be developed and experimentally verified. This project has three educational goals. The first goal is to develop an advanced educational infrastructure to teach an upgraded and renovated version of the undergraduate and graduate courses on Advanced Design of Mechanisms. The second educational goal of the project is the initiation of undergraduates in research with the incorporation of a novel course entitled \"Experimental and Computational Research on the Design of Mechanical Systems\". The third goal is to establish collaborative projects on engineering design and robotic systems with the science and technology high schools of New Jersey, with the objective to attract new students in this field.\r\n\r\nManufacturing industries, robot technologies and design education will benefit from the proposed unified framework for designing complex mechanical and robotic systems by integrating advanced computer based design tools such as Computational Methods, Computer Aided Design packages, Virtual Reality with Haptic Interfaces and Rapid Prototyping.  In addition this CAREER project includes broader impact activities such as foreign collaborations, participation of underrepresented groups and cooperation with New Jersey high schools.",
