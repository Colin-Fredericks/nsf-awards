 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pseudospectral (PS) methods are high-accuracy alternatives to finite\r\ndifference (FD) and finite element methods (FEM) for the numerical solution\r\nof PDEs. They are particularly effective for solving convection-dominated\r\nequations over long times and in relatively simple geometries. Both the\r\nalgorithms themselves and the analysis of them have traditionally been\r\nclosely tied to expansions in different classes of orthogonal functions.\r\nThe recent book \"A Practical Guide to Pseudospectral Methods\" (by the\r\npresent investigator) notes that a large body of generalizations,\r\nenhancements and insights can be gained by viewing PS methods instead as\r\nspecial cases of FD methods. Several such opportunities were explored under\r\nthe grant DMS-9706916. Building on these experiences, we will now introduce\r\nradial basis functions (RBFs) as an additional component to be integrated\r\nwith PS schemes. Although computationally quite costly, the spectral\r\naccuracy of RBFs, combined with their extreme geometric flexibility, would\r\nseem to make them ideally suited to complement PS methods in the vicinity\r\nof irregular boundaries. To realize this requires much research regarding\r\nthe basic features of RBF approximations, as well as research on issues\r\nrelated to interfacing them with PS and FD methods. \r\n\r\nPseudospectral (PS) methods were first proposed in the early 1970's (in\r\nconnection with meteorology and turbulence modeling). They have since been\r\nshown to be extraordinary effective for high-accuracy calculations in\r\nnumerous other fields, such as computational electromagnetics and nonlinear\r\nwaves. Strategically important application areas include simulating the\r\nradar scattering from airplanes, the electrical interference between\r\ncomponents on computer chips, and the transmissions of signals in optical\r\nfibres. The main weakness with PS methods has been the difficulty to apply\r\nthem in complex geometries. Some of this has been overcome in recent years\r\n(usually by splitting a complicated domain in simpler parts, and then\r\napplying some suitable computational means for coupling of the subdomains).\r\nA quite different and highly promising approach will be introduced and then\r\nexplored under this grant. This involves combining 'classical' PS methods\r\nwith the geometrically extremely flexible approach known as radial basis\r\nfunctions (RBFs). This has never been attempted, and the research falls in\r\nthe 'high risk, high gain' category. Success is by no means certain, but if\r\nit happens, it could have a major impact, particularly on computational\r\nelectromagnetics in applications such as simulation of radar scattering /\r\nstealth properties of objects. \r\n",
