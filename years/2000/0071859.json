 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is an investigation of the interplay of topology and \r\nnonlinear dynamics from both applied and theoretical viewpoints. Complicated\r\ntopology arises naturally in nonlinear dynamical systems and frequently\r\n\"carries\" the dynamics of the system. Understanding this topology is\r\nessential to understanding the dynamics and the long-term behavior of the\r\nsystem. Planned are (i) further theoretical study of the topology present\r\nin \"most\" (i.e., generic) dynamical systems with a given property,  (ii)\r\napplied study of stirring and turbulence (with chemical engineers at\r\nRutgers), (iii) theoretical and applied study of area-preserving systems,\r\n(iv) an investigation of how topology and invariant measures are\r\nrelated in one-dimesional dynamical systems, and (v) further study of\r\ntopological horseshoes (with J. A. Yorke and others from the Maryland\r\ngroup). The project builds on work already done by the investigator both\r\nalone and in collaboration with other mathematicians and scientists. The\r\ntools of both topology and dynamical systems are needed and will be used\r\nto carry out the project. Theoretical results concerning stirring will be\r\nbacked up by actual experiment and observation in the lab.  \r\n\r\n\tWhenever a nonlinear dynamical system, such as the weather, or the \r\nmotion of different fluids as they are stirred, or the solar system, is\r\n\"operating\", interesting topology arises as sets are mapped back across\r\nthemselves. Understanding these sets is crucial to understanding the\r\ncomplicated behavior of nonlinear systems. Sometimes the complicated\r\ntopology can be observed as it forms, and is a marker for  certain kinds\r\nof complicated dynamics. Can this be made precise? Can it be \"quantified\"?\r\nConsider stirring, a phenomenon of special interest to the investigator,\r\nfor example. Stirring occurs in every kitchen, and seems to be a simple\r\nprocess. But this is far from the case: Stirring occurs in industrial\r\nsettings and in nature in many different contexts as chemicals or\r\nmedicines, or hot and cold air, or hot and cold water, are mixed. Most\r\noften in industry achieving homogeneity of the mixed substance efficiently\r\nis the goal. Experimental and simulated results by chemical engineers\r\ndemonstrate that those processes used today do not result in homogeneity.\r\nHow can those processes be improved? That is one of the problems to which\r\nthe results of this project should be applicable. More generally, the\r\nproject planned is a study of the topology of complicated dynamical\r\nsystems, and both the implications of the presence of complicated topology\r\nfor nonlinear systems and vice versa. \r\n\r\n",
