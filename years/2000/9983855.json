 "awd_abstract_narration": "9983855  Zhang  The objective of the proposed research is the continued development of an innovative technology using nanoscale metal particles (NMP) to rapidly and completely reduce chlorinated hydrocarbons in either in situ or ex situ applications.  The NMP technology is flexible in that it can be deployed as a stand-alone remedial system or utilized in conjunction with conventional technologies such as pump-and-treat and bioremediation.\r\nSpecific research objectives include (1) improvement and scale-up of the NMP synthetic method, (2) development of direct injection techniques and associated design parameters, (3) determination of the transport and attachment mechanisms of NMPs in porous media and (4) assessment of the long-term impacts of key environmental variables such as redox potential, pH, ionic strength and microbial growth on the rate and extent of dechlorination. The work will involve the use of both contaminated groundwater and aquifer materials from a trichloroethylene (TCE) spill site.\r\nEducational goals are intended to create an exciting, multi-disciplinary learning environment where young environmental engineers are inspired to devise innovative solutions to real-world problems using the contaminant(s) structure as a fundamental design variable.  Specifically, interactive course offerings in molecular environmental engineering will be developed for the undergraduate and graduate curricula.\r\nIt is also the goal of this research to stimulate development of critically important partnerships with the private sector.  Scientific and engineering personnel at partnering firms will be encouraged to participate in both the research and educational components of this program.  These partnerships will provide opportunities for students, particularly those of under-represented groups, to perform practical research and work with experienced practitioners. ***  \r\n",
