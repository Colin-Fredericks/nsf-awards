The institution will acquire a 10 Tesla superconducting magnet for magneto-structural and magneto-electronic studies of complex metals such as transition-metal oxide (TMO) systems. The instrument will be located at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. It will be used to conduct research that will elucidate the lattice-magnetic field correlations and field dependent local moments. The results will assist in the development of more accurate theoretical models of these materials. The study will focus on the manganese doped TMO systems (manganites) and the ruthenium doped  (ruthenates) TMO systems. These materials exhibit novel charge transport and spin correlations, including colossal magnetoresistance, and the possible coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetic correlations at the atomic level.  The exact details of this coexistence are not understood. Utilizing plane polarized synchrotron radiation researchers will be able to examine structural deformation parallel to and transverse to the applied magnetic field and correlate these structural deformations with magnetoresistance data. Additionally, direct measurements of the local magnetic moments on the transition metal sites with circular polarized radiation (x-ray magnetic circular dichroism) will be performed. Undergraduates, graduate students and experienced researchers will conduct research utilizing this magnet.  Use of the magnet will be integrated into laboratory courses.\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis is an acquisition award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program to the Foundation @ New Jersey Institute of Technology. The institution will acquire a 10 Tesla superconducting magnet for magneto-structural and magneto-electronic studies of complex metals such as transition-metal oxide systems and to train students to perform modern physics experiments. The instrument will be located at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory (NSLS). Local structural distortions play a key role in the determination of the properties of complex metals such as transition-metal oxide systems. This magnet will give researchers the capability of measuring x-ray absorption spectra and magnetic circular x-ray dichroism in varying magnetic fields. Utilizing the unique properties of x-ray radiation from the NSLS, researchers will be able to measure atomic structural deformation parallel to and transverse to the applied magnetic field and correlate the structural deformations with changes in the electron transport.  In addition, the atomic level magnetic properties on the transition metal sites with circularly polarized radiation (x-ray magnetic circular dichroism) will be studied. The elucidation of the lattice-magnetic field correlations and local magnetic properties will assist in the development of theoretical models of these materials.  Undergraduates, graduate students and experienced researchers will conduct research utilizing this magnet.  Use of the magnet will be integrated into laboratory courses.\r\n",
