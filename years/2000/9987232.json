 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed scholarship program at would be part of a larger school-wide and statewide effort to increase the numbers of students graduating from computer science and engineering programs by 25% or more. \r\n\r\nThe project will award 40 $2,500 scholarships to qualified upper division students enrolled in engineering or computer science programs as full-time students. Recruitment and outreach for awards will target low-income, academically talented students from groups under-represented in appropriate fields who will be able to enroll full time and complete their degree within two years if they receive the support of an award as part of their financial aid package.\r\n\r\n The addition of a targeted scholarship program to the school's existing scholarship and student support offerings will enable the university to: \r\n    Increase transfer student enrollment by 20% in SEAS programs in computer science and engineering; \r\n    Increase the percentage of upper division students enrolling full-time by 10%;\r\n    Increase retention of upper division students to graduation within two years; \r\n    Improve diversity of upper division student body by targeted recruitment for under-represented groups by 15%; and \r\n    Improve geographic diversity of upper division student body by 5% to expand enrollment of economically disadvantaged students from rural Oregon. \r\n\r\nThe school as part of its overall recruitment activities will lead recruitment for applicants. Special consideration will be given to working with community partners, such as the Oregon Math, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) K-12 enrichment program for under-represented students, and the Society for Women Engineers, to identify and recruit students under-represented in appropriate fields. The school will also work with other administrative units, such as the financial aid and admissions office, to identify and encourage application from qualified applicants who meet the basic program criteria. \r\n\r\nAwards decision factors will include academic indicators such as lower division GPA and class rank, as well as indicators of professional success (motivation, communication skills, and leadership) provided by the required letters of recommendation from faculty or employers, and by student essays. \r\n\r\nOnce students have accepted their awards, SEAS will coordinate its student service efforts with support services offered through other units to provide each student with a support infrastructure which is tailored to meet their needs in order to assure their success through graduation and post-graduation employment.\r\n",
