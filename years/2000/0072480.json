Please let me know\r\nif this is acceptable.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRick Falk\r\n\r\nAbstract: Finite Element Approximation of Problems in Solid Mechanics\r\n\r\nThe finite element approximation of mathematical models of thin plates and\r\nshells is studied.  For the Reissner-Mindlin plate model, there are many\r\nproven \"locking-free\" methods (i.e., no accuracy loss for smaller thickness)\r\nusing triangular and rectangular elements. It is proposed to analyze\r\nquadrilateral elements for this problem and study important but unresolved\r\nissues about these elements in more general contexts.  In addition to the\r\nshear locking which causes problems in the approximation of plate models,\r\nshells also suffer from the problem of membrane locking.  The goal is to\r\nimprove on the shell elements so far proposed and provide a rigorous analysis\r\nof convergence. Variational methods used previously for the derivation and\r\nanalysis of plate models will be extended to the derivation and analysis of\r\nshell models.  Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods are promising\r\ncandidates for a robust approximation method for both convection-dominated and\r\ndiffusion-dominated convection-diffusion problems.  Further analysis is\r\nproposed to demonstrate their effectiveness more conclusively. Computational\r\nand analytical techniques are proposed to understand the predictions of 2-D\r\nmathematical models concerned with stress driven instability, expanding on\r\nprevious grant work done on a simpler 1-D model.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is concerned with the use of mathematical models to study\r\nseveral problems in solid mechanics. The use of mathematical models offers a\r\ncost-effective way to make quantitative predictions about how mechanical\r\nsystems will change when external forces are applied and serves as an\r\nalternative to the use of costly or difficult experiments.  Typically, when\r\nrealistic mathematical models are formulated, they are in terms of equations\r\nwhose solutions, which represent physical quantities of interest to engineers\r\nand scientists, are not able to be determined analytically, i.e., in a simple\r\nform one can easily write down.  However, by employing numerical methods, good\r\napproximations to the physical quantities which are described by the\r\nmathematical models may still be found. Typically, high performance computing\r\nis needed to do the large number of calculations involved.  This project is\r\nconcerned with the design and analysis of numerical approximation schemes for\r\na number of important mathematical models used in mechanics.  These include\r\nmodels of elastic plates and shells (used for example to design the roof of a\r\nbuilding to avoid collapse) and models of nano-scale solid crystals (which\r\ncan be used to study instabilities in certain materials).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
