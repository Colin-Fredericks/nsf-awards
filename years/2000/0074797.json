 "awd_abstract_narration": "This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division supports Dr. Jetty Duffy-Matzner in developing a research program in small molecule heterocyclic chemistry at Augustana College in Sioux Falls South Dakota. The objective of this research will be to synthesize, characterize and test the antibiotic activity of a series of polymers with the potential ability to disrupt the sodium and potassium concentration differences across cellular membranes. This award will allow Dr. Duffy-Matzner to:  establish a joint collaboration with Dr. Nola Borman, Assistant Professor of Biology at Augustana College to explore the biological activities of the novel compounds synthesized in the project; involve advanced students in Augustana's medicinal chemistry course in molecular modelling; create summer research experiences  for Dr. Duffy-Matzner's undergraduate student co-workers in the laboratory of Dr. Karin Ruhlandt-Senge, an inorganic chemist at Syracuse University, who will also collaborate with Dr. Duffy-Matzner on this project. This award will contribute significantly to the professional advancement of Dr. Duffy-Matzner, at a critical stage in her career.",
