 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Psychological Association (APA) hopes by the application to obtain a $25,OOO National Science Foundation (NSF) block grant to support international travel for approximately 50 US psychologists participating in the scientific program of the XXVII International Congress of Psychology, taking place July 23-28, 2000 in Stockholm Sweden. The majority of the project grantees will be young scholars, either students or individuals who received their degrees within the last eight years. The Swedish Psychological Association, under the patronage of His Majesty King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden, is organizing the Congress, which is the quadrennial meeting of the prestigious International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS). APA is joined in this effort by the National Academy of Sciences, which houses the US National Committee (USNC) of the IUPsyS. This request has precedent in grants received in 1996 ($12,000 for the XXVI Congress in Montreal, Canada), in 1992 ($18,000 for the XXV Congress in Brussels, Belgium) and in 1988 ($25,000 for the XXIV Congress in Sydney, Australia).\r\n\r\n",
