 "awd_abstract_narration": "Craig Chambers\r\n\r\nHigher-level programming languages, such as Smalltalk, ML, and Java, can make\r\nprogramming easier, more reliable, and more flexible than lower-level\r\nprogramming languages, such as C and C++.  Unfortunately, these software\r\nengineering benefits often come at significant cost to run-time efficiency.\r\n One\r\nimportant obstacle to achieving good performance for higher-level languages is\r\nthe relatively inefficient approach to the representation and layout of data\r\nstructures, where data structures are represented uniformly as heap-allocated\r\nstructures referenced indirectly via pointers.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to reduce the performance costs of this high-level data\r\nmodel\r\nwhile retaining its software engineering benefits for programmers.\r\nDeclarative\r\ntechniques will be developed for specifying the layout of data structures and\r\nfor specifying optimizations to data structure layouts.  Techniques will be\r\ndeveloped for deciding which layout optimizations to apply, based on a mix of\r\nprogrammer suggestions, automatic static analyses, and dynamic profile\r\nfeedback.  A flexible, language-independent compiler intermediate\r\nrepresentation\r\nwill be designed that explicitly maintains, checks, and optimizes\r\nrepresentations.  The techniques will be implemented in an optimizing\r\ncompiler,\r\nand their effectiveness measured on a range of large benchmark programs in a\r\nvariety of object-oriented programming languages.\r\n",
