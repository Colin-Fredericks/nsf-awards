 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) This project is undertaking a significant enhancement of the Studio Physics I curriculum at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The curricular revision is focused on the replacement of many of the student activities currently used in the course with materials adapted from Microcomputer Based Interactive Lecture Demonstrations, \"Real Time\" Physics and Workshop Physics. Once a new activity has been developed, it undergoes a continuous cycle of classroom testing and assessment of its effectiveness. The aim of this project is to improve student learning in the Studio Physics I course at Rensselaer by improving the quality of the activities in which students engage during their time in the classroom. The primary motivation for this curricular revision is that the level of student conceptual learning in the Studio Physics I course is no higher than that found in traditionally structured courses. This is true, despite a progressive class structure, collaborative group work, computers in the classroom, and an increase in the faculty resources allocated to the introductory physics program. Hence, the primary goals of this project focus on increased student learning, with an emphasis on conceptual understanding and incorporation of guided inquiry activities into the curriculum, with the aim of providing students with exposure to science as a process.\r\n",
