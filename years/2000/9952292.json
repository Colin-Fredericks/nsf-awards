 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nMany measurements made in undergraduate electrical engineering laboratories may be carried out with general purpose laboratory equipment, but this manual process is slow, tedious, and prone to error.  Specialized instrumentation exists for many measurements tasks, but the expense of specialized instrumentation undergraduate laboratories may be difficult to justify. Computer-based laboratory instruments offer a low-cost alternative to such specialized instruments.  This project, whose theme is integration of technology into education is further developing existing instruments; to actively bring undergraduate students into the design and testing of new instruments; to integrate these new instruments into the undergraduate curriculum; and to create and disseminate software and hardware designs and curriculum materials in a form permitting other engineering program to readily duplicate.\r\n\r\n  The project adapts concepts of using computer-based laboratory instrumentation from the research laboratory of Prof. John Webster at the University of Wisconsin and the research laboratory of the Health and Kinesiology Department of the University of Texas at Tyler (UT-Tyler) which are implemented into the Department of Electrical Engineering undergraduate curriculum at the UT-Tyler. \r\n\r\n",
