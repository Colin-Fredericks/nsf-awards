 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to increase the number of high school deaf girls who take mathematics classes in high school, with an ultimate goal of increasing the numbers who major in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) in college and who eventually enter careers in SMET.  At present, very few deaf girls think of careers in SMET because they are not encouraged to take mathematics and science courses while in high school.  Deaf girls generally are not encouraged by teachers or counselors to consider careers in SMET.  Part of the reason for the lack of deaf women in SMET is due to stereotyping and partly due to the historical perspective about deaf in general.  This project, through a partnership between the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) and Mt. Holyoke College, will integrate deaf female high school students into a well established and successful summer mathematics program at Mt. Holyoke.  Through their summer experience in this program, it is expected that the deaf girls will gain confidence in their ability to handle mathematics and will consider careers in SMET.\r\n\r\nThe deaf girls in this project will be integrated into the Mt. Holyoke Summermath program with full support of interpreters and other services funded by this grant.  This will be the first time that deaf girls will be able to attend one of many summer math programs for high school girls presently offered at many colleges in the United States.  These programs have been closed to deaf students.  By forming a partnership between NTID and Mt. Holyoke, pre-training in deaf strategies can be provided to the faculty and staff at Mt. Holyoke, pre-training in deaf education strategies can be provided to the faculty and staff at Mt. Holyoke, and needed support services will be provided to the deaf girls.  Through this partnership, it is expected that the girls' self esteem, confidence, problem solving abilities toward mathematics and science will be strengthened, and that the girls will be more willing to take science and mathematics courses in high school and be better prepared to enter postsecondary programs in SMET.\r\n\r\nThis project will have a very powerful impact on deaf education, since these initial eight students can become role models for other deaf high school girls.  Furthermore, this project should help to change teachers', administrators', and parents' perspectives on the career opportunities for deaf females.  It is expected that this project will also open the doors of other SMET summer programs for high school students at postsecondary programs, and will provide real gender equality to a group of students that have been shut out from these opportunities because of their deafness.\r\n",
