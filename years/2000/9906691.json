 "awd_abstract_narration": "Local communities throughout the world are feeling the effects of global capital on their regional economies and political systems, but relatively little attention has focused on how regionally subordinate communities respond to the changes that accompany their rapid integration into a global capitalist system.  The colonias of the U.S.-Mexico border provide a distinctive yet somewhat representative glimpse of these processes in action.  Colonias are rural, unincorporated, unregulated subdivisions of U.S. cities.  They typically have substandard housing and lack access to fundamental necessities like safe clean water, waste-water treatment systems, and electricity.  This doctoral dissertation research project will examine two major questions:  What are the particular political and economic processes of the border region that lead to growth in the colonias and create the conditions of resource deprivation that colonia residents experience?  How do people living in the colonias organize in order to address and deal with these problems?  To answer these questions, a capable doctoral student is conducting intensive research in the 37 colonias of Dona Ana County in south central New Mexico.  Longitudinal methods will be used to document the evolution of relations between the colonias and broader socioeconomic and political forces in the region as a whole, using secondary sources like the records and reports of the colonias development council, the Dona Ana County colonias commission, the Catholic church, and local government units.  During the second phase of the project, the student will rely heavily on ethnographic methods as she focuses on questions of community organization.  Surveys of a broad sample of colonia residents and in-depth interviews with long-standing residents will illuminate interactions between the people and institutions in the colonias and the non-local factors that are reshaping the communities, with special attention given to social dynamics within the colonias and how regional and larger-scale processes are experienced, interpreted, and acted upon in daily activities.  Also under examination during this phase of the project will be the organizations formed by colonia residents to address a diverse set of issues and the roles that women play as leaders of these organizations and other community groups.  In addition to clarifying the social processes at work in these rapidly evolving communities, this project will contribute to a range of theoretical perspectives, including critical human geography theories associated with the meanings of places created by local residents, feminist theories that examine how daily actions, place, and life experiences intersect to produce personal identifies, and environmental justice theories dealing with environmental and resource inequalities.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
