 "awd_abstract_narration": "0077634\r\nHume\r\n\r\nNerve cells communicate information to each other at narrow zones of contact\r\nreferred to as synapses. The incoming presynaptic cell releases a chemical\r\nsignal (the neurotransmitter), which binds to receptors on the target cell,\r\neliciting electrical excitation or inhibition. The general goal of these\r\nexperiments is to understand the mechanisms that allow developing synapses\r\nto reach their stable, mature state. The principal hypothesis to be explored\r\nis that in addition to the two signals known to pass between nerve and\r\nmuscle to promote synapse maturation (agrin and ARIA), an additional\r\nsignaling system also transmits key information. This proposed signaling\r\nsystem consists of ATP (adenosine 5' triphosphate) released from presynaptic\r\nterminals interacting with two different types of ATP receptors on the\r\nmuscle cell surface. The hypothesis will be tested by using molecular\r\nbiological and pharmacological tools to alter the function of the ATP\r\nreceptors on the surface of chick muscle cells developing within the egg,\r\nand in cell culture.\r\n\r\nIt is important that mature neuromuscular synapses be stable, so that they\r\ncan reliably control of the routine actions of the nervous system such as\r\ncommanding muscles to move in the pattern that allows us to breathe.\r\nHowever, understanding the mechanisms that promote synaptic growth and\r\nmaturation are likely to also provide us with insight into the mechanisms\r\nthat bring about changes in synaptic function in other regions of the mature\r\nnervous system where synapses are not always stable. Changes in the\r\namplitude of synaptic responses are thought to be the cellular basis by\r\nwhich learning and forgetting occur.\r\n",
