 "awd_abstract_narration": "The   focus   of   this   project   is   on  the development  of conceptual\r\nfoundations    along  with   a   middleware    infrastructure   for rapid\r\nconstruction  of   dynamic   and  secure  distributed collaborations.  This\r\nproject  is   investigating   techniques   for   constructing dynamic\r\ncollaboration  environments  from  their  high-level specifications. These\r\nspecifications are interfaced with  a  middleware  to  build  the desired\r\nenvironment.  This  project  is  developing  techniques  for  specifying a\r\ncollaboration plan using XML  and  mechanisms  for  a  mobile  agent based\r\nmiddleware  for  implementing  such  a  plan. A collaboration  specification\r\nidentifies the participants in a collaboration by  their  roles,  and also\r\nspecifies  the  associated  role-based  security policies. It specifies the\r\nshared objects together with the coordination  and   workflow requirements\r\nfor   information  flow   among  the  participants.  Mechanisms  are being\r\ninvestigated for participants to dynamically join or leave an environment.\r\nThese    include   mechanisms   for   authentication   of  a participant's\r\ncredentials,  assignment  of  roles,  and  discovery  of  resources  by a\r\nparticipant.   These  mechanisms  and  services are integrated in  an\r\nagent based  middleware,  using  the  Ajanta  agent   programming system,\r\nfor constructing  distributed  collaborations. This middleware investigates\r\nuse of mobile agents for building  transportable  user  interfaces,\r\nfor executing remote  coordination  actions,  and  as mobile workflow\r\nobjects. It  also provides support for resource discovery, naming, event\r\nmanagement, and security.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
