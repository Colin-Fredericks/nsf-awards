 "awd_abstract_narration": "0079735\r\nHertzog\r\n\tThe MuLan Project will develop the instrumentation  needed to measure the lifetime of the positive muon to  unprecedented precision, namely, a factor of 20 better than the  current world average.  The muon lifetime fixes the value of the Fermi constant, which governs the strength of all weak-interaction processes, just as the fine structure constant governs  the strength of all\r\nelectromagnetic-interaction processes.   The Fermi constant is one of the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model of particle\r\nphysics.  A low-energy, continuous-wave muon beam at the Paul  Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland will be modified by a new \r\nbeam chopper system in order to create intense, short bursts  of muons, which will stop in thin targets.  A positive muon stopped in\r\nappropriate materials decays as if it were in vacuum.  Such targets will be surrounded by a nearly hermetic set of 180 \r\nfast-scintillator timing detectors, each coupled to a state-of-the-art  waveform digitizer, and all readout by a high-speed data \r\nacquisition system.  Online analysis of the nearly 100 terabytes of data will take place with a small array of fast microprocessors.  \r\n\tA second use of the instrumentation is in conjunction with an ongoing effort at PSI to measure the negative muon lifetime in\r\nhydrogen gas.  The negative muon can decay exactly in the same manner as the positive muon, or in hydrogen it can interact with a\r\nproton by the weak-interaction process known as  \"capture.\"  The capture rate is predicted very accurately by theory; however,\r\ncurrent experiments, which have various interpretation problems, are in disagreement with theory by a very significant amount.  If\r\nthis disagreement is confirmed, this difference raises the exciting possibility of pointing to new and unaccounted  for physics.  By\r\nmeasuring the difference between the positive and negative muon lifetimes, we will determine the muon capture rate reliably and at a\r\nprecision more than four times better  than current measurements.  The MuLan timing detectors, beamline and custom electronics are\r\nexpected to play a major role in this effort. \r\n\r\n",
