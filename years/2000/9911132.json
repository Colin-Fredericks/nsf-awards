Performance\r\nappraisal is one such tool that serves as a basis for important personnel\r\ndecisions, such as allocation of raises or recommendation for promotion or\r\ntermination.  Because performance appraisal strongly relies on subjective\r\njudgment, it is susceptible to systematic biases or distortions.  One such\r\nbias that has been repeatedly demonstrated in performance appraisal is\r\ncontextual contrast.  This bias consists of the tendency to rate a person's\r\nwork performance higher after assessing other employees with poorer work\r\nrecords than after assessing those with better work records. Such contextual\r\ndependency represents a serious source of error in assessment, threatening its\r\nreliability and validity.\r\n\r\nThis project explores different procedures designed to reduce or eliminate\r\ncontextual contrast in performance appraisal and thereby create more reliable\r\nand valid assessment techniques. Materials consist of performance profiles of\r\nhypothetical employees that include information on several facets of their\r\nwork records.  In each experiment, the contrast bias is induced by having\r\nparticipants evaluate different sets of materials prior to assessing a core\r\nset of materials.  The aim of the research is to develop assessment procedures\r\nthat will produce the same judgments of core materials across different\r\ncontexts. These procedures include manipulating category labels, types of\r\njudgments, and training methods. Experiments will test the degree to which\r\nincluding clear examples for the different category levels will reduce\r\ncontextual bias.  Additional experiments will test the efficacy of two\r\nalternative judgment tasks, comparative and similarity judgment, for\r\neliminating contrast effects.  Finally, another series of experiments explores\r\nthe potential for different training regimens to eliminate contextual bias.\r\nThe aim of this research is to develop procedures that could be implemented in\r\nbusiness, education, and government to produce more reliable and valid\r\nassessments.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
