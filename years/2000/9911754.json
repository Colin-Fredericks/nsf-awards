Targeting the second largest urban school district in Illinois, this Local Systemic Change project will serve all 337 K-5 classroom mathematics teachers, and their principals.  The project was developed in response to teachers' request for professional support in implementing \"Investigations in Number, Data and Space,\" a reform elementary mathematics curriculum that is aligned with both state and national standards. \r\n\r\nThis 3.5-year teacher enhancement program involves each teacher in nearly 150 hours of professional learning. This program features three intensive summer sessions focused on improving teachers' understanding of mathematics content -- geometry, rational numbers, data and statistics -- and teaching practices related to the implementation of the Investigations program.  Systematic, substantive follow-through during subsequent school years in the form of grade level seminars, after school workshops, and extensive, classroom-based support from \"PRIME\" staff, will be provided.  A Mathlinks Committee of 32 lead teachers from the 16 schools participating in the Project serves to monitor grade-level coordination and implementation of Investigations, and provides local input to PRIME staff for project activity. The PRIME project further benefits from significant support from a parent, community and business collaboration that focuses on student learning. By engaging all stakeholders, the PRIME collaborative seeks to promote and support qualitatively different approaches for teaching and teaming K-5 mathematics. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
