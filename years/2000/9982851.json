Human, Plant and Model Organism Genome Projects and related international efforts are on track with a full unraveling of this code, resulting in a flood of important data to bioscientists. The Internet is already the primary means for distributing this data. As it is growing to tens of gigabytes, and rapid increase in use of the Internet has introduced delays, a need\r\nHas emerged for use of high performance network methods to speed its distribution.To help address this need, this project supports IUBio Archive and Bio-Mirrors, centered at Indiana University with international partners, for high speed, world-wide distribution of genome data.The IUBio Archive has a ten year record of providing public access to molecular biology data and software and serves a worldwide community of bioscientists A Bio-Mirror project has been initiated with international collaborators to provide rapid public access to and exchange of genome data. Bioinformatics centers in Japan, Australia, Singapore, China and Korea are currently involved with Bio-Mirrors. This award will support the addition of computer equipment to increase the stability and capability of the project. \r\n\r\n",
