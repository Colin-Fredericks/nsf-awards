 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 25 years researchers have identified and explained numerous instances of group motivation loss - lower task motivation when people work in groups rather than as individuals. In contrast, relatively less is known about when and how group contexts can sometimes promote a gain in motivation. This project seeks to build on early work concerned with two types of group motivation gain-the \"Koehler effect\" and the \"social compensation effect.\" Early research found evidence for a group motivation gain on persistence tasks. Although some contemporary attempts to explore this phenomenon have been unsuccessful, very recent work in our laboratory has succeeded in both replicating and partially explaining it. The current project will further explore the causes and generality of the Koehler effect. The research will examine: (a) the relative validity of concerns with collective success versus self-presentation as an explanation for the Koehler effect; (b) the role that workers' ability to monitor each other's performance plays in generating the motivation gain; (c) how long workers will persist in exceeding their usual individual performance; and (d) some possible group composition moderators of the Koehler effect. Other early research identified a motivation gain that is very different from the Koehler effect: social compensation occurs when a group member has some reason to believe that fellow group members cannot or will not perform well. A series of studies will extend the initial work on social compensation. This work will explore (a) the extent to which the effect depends on believing that greater effort can sufficiently compensate for other group member's low performance; (b) whether it matters if the others' low performance is due to low ability versus low motivation; and (c) how long a group member will continue to compensate for others' low performance. The significance of this project lies both in its potential for contributing to basic knowledge about motivation in groups and its potential for application.  The project will contribute to a better understanding of group dynamics in the kind of performance contexts found in the workplace. Finding ways to increase task motivation may offer an effective way of enhancing collective performance in a diverse array of contexts, including small groups, a marriage, a work team, or a business organization.\r\n",
