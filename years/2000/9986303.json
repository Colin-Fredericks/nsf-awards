 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Research Award project demonstrates the usefulness of selection models for undertaking state level policy research.  The use of selection models serves to deal with a shortcoming currently found in this research.  In the study of state policy, the concepts of innovation, reinvention, and change are often studied in isolation.  This can lead to incomplete and disjointed views of the policy process.  Scholars are interested in not only whether states adopt certain broad categories of legislation, but also in the specific content of those laws and if they change over time.  However, when examining policy outcomes, the states that choose to adopt a given policy constitute a non-random sample and care must be used in exploring the determinants of such policy.  If traditional single-equation statistical analyses are run on such samples, biased results are likely.\r\n\r\nThe doctoral student uses selection models to examine states' decisions about whether to enact some form of legislation concerning drug-testing in the workplace, and, if said legislation is enacted, to examine the contents of the statutes and how they change over time.  Such models allow a more complete examination of state policy and protect against statistical bias.\r\n\r\n",
