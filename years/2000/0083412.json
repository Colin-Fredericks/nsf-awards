 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to advance  understanding of  luminescence properties of rare earth (RE) doped GaN, AlN and their alloys which have great potential for use in new generation of light emitting devices. Study of optical and electrical properties of wide-bandgap III-V nitride semiconductors  doped with RE ions will be performed in an attempt to gain further insight into the excitation and deexcitation processes of RE 4f n  transitions.  It will provide a comprehensive understanding of the optical-electrical properties of  these materials and thereby assessing the potential for rare earth doped semiconductor devices.  In addition, the optical properties of rare earth doped III-V nitride alloys will be investigated in order to attempts to build MIS,  p-n  heterojunction and other light emitting structures. Investigation  of electro-optical properties  of GaN and AlN doped with rare earth impurity should determine what type of defect RE ions introduce in III-nitrides  hosts. The optical technique will include photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), selective excitation spectroscopy (SES), cathodoluminescence spectroscopy (CL), rise and decay kinetics measurements and  other complementary   characterization techniques. The goal of this work is to develop highly efficient materials for novel UV visible and infrared optoelectronics devices. For these applications controllable doping n and p type are an obvious necessity. The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of photonic material science having high technological relevance.  An important feature of the project is the integration of research and education through the training of the students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
