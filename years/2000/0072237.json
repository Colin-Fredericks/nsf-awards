 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0072237\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  David E. Barrett\r\n\r\nProfessor Barrett will investigate various topics in complex\r\nanalysis.  One topic to be studied is the behavior of two\r\ndifferent systems of partial differential equations implementing\r\ndeformation of a real hypersurface in two-dimensional complex\r\neuclidean space by the Levi-form of the hypersurface.  The\r\nsystems are analogous, respectively, to harmonic-mapping heat\r\nflow and to the Ricci-flow on the space of conformal metrics, but\r\nthese particular systems have special features (the role of\r\nLorentzian geometry in the target space and the inclusion of\r\nlower-order terms which are not conjugation invariant in the\r\nsource space) that introduce new phenomena and difficulties.  The\r\nassociated steady-state system has known applications to function\r\ntheory and engineering, and the study of the time-dependent\r\nversions given above may lead to new insights into analytic\r\ncontinuation.  A second topic to be studied is the boundary\r\nbehavior of the Bergman kernel function (off the diagonal) and\r\nBergman representative coordinates on domains with corners, with\r\nparticular interest in the case of generic intersections of\r\nstrictly pseudoconvex domains (the case of intersecting balls\r\nserving as a key model problem).\r\n\r\nProfessor Barrett will investigate various problems involving\r\nmultiple parameters (the parameters are understood to lie in the\r\nso-called complex number system, a widely-used extension of the\r\nstandard number system).  One topic involves the study of systems\r\nof partial differential equations which serve to flatten a\r\nsurface in the parameter space; sometimes the equations push the\r\nsurface to an equilibrium configuration (the situation is\r\nsomewhat analogous to that of a soap film attached to a fixed\r\nwire boundary), but sometimes the surface breaks before reaching\r\nequilibrium (for example, this will happen if there is no\r\navailable equilibrium configuration).  The computation of\r\nequilibrium configurations for these problems (or the\r\ndocumentation that no equilibrium exists) is important in\r\nclassical function theory, and is also a central topic in the\r\nengineering discipline known as \"H-infinity control theory.\"  A\r\nsecond topic to be studied is based on Stefan Bergman's method of\r\nfinding a sort of \"ideal form\" for a region in complex\r\nmultiparameter space.  In the one-parameter setting Bergman's\r\nmethod tells us how to perform the useful task of smoothing out\r\ncorners appearing in the boundary of the region (such smoothing\r\nis of fundamental importance for example in classical\r\naerodynamics); the proposed research will examine what happens to\r\ncorners in the multi-parameter setting.\r\n",
