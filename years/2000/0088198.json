 "awd_abstract_narration": "Principal Investigator: Henryk Temkin\r\n\r\nProposal Number:  0088198\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis research will demonstrate a wafer based analytical system capable of detection and identification of a wide range of chemically and biologically active substances. The system will be based on fluorescence excitation and will integrate a number of new technologies, such as deep-blue and ultra-violet light-emitting diodes, advanced microfluidics, and liquid core waveguides. Specifically, we will demonstrate arrays of resonant microcavity light emitting diodes grown on silicon substrates. Fabrication of these devices on silicon will allow for efficient light coupling to the microfluidic system also prepared in a silicon substrate. Difficult problems of surface conditioning will be studied and resolved in order to make this approach feasible. A combination of these technologies will produce a sensitive and highly parallel system, capable of searching simultaneously for a number of agents of interest. The high degree of integration is expected to produce a reliable and easy to use device. \r\n\r\nFurther advances in medicine and biological sciences depend on the availability of fast, reliable, sensitive, and inexpensive diagnostic systems. In order to meet these goals, such systems must be highly miniaturized and endowed with a considerable degree of intelligence. The road to such systems is through the integration of a number of sophisticated components; from novel light sources to advanced electronics to efficient data processing. To accomplish this objective, interdisciplinary scientific efforts are needed. This work brings together a team of scientists with backgrounds from electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, and mechanical engineering capable of producing a miniaturized micro-analysis system. The work will expose our undergraduate and graduate students to a multi-disciplinary team environment and state-of-the-art research and thus, will have a major, positive impact on their education.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.\r\n",
