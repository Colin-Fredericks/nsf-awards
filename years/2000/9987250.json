 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (59), (58), (31), (35), (21) The CSEMS project is designed to closely blend the university's faculty and staff, the local business community, and 40 talented but financially disadvantaged students enrolled in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics baccalaureate programs. The project is designed to offer the 40 prospective scholars a $2500 per year CSEM Scholarship for two years (based on need and eligibility) and an opportunity for involvement in a business/laboratory setting with a mentor from the community in the student's major field of study. The project, in addition to addressing the scholars' academic and curricular needs, provides the students with a support system of career counseling, faculty and local business mentors, special programs, and other institutionalized services.  The intent is to increase the number of women and minorities in the fields of computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics.  Emphasis is placed on locating qualified students in the CSEM areas for the project. By providing educational opportunities to low-income, academically talented students through scholarships that promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement in higher education, the university expects improved education for students in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics; increased retention of students to degree achievement; improved professional development and employment/further higher education placement of participating students; and strengthened partnerships between the university and CSEM related employment sectors. \r\n",
