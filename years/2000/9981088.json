 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThis educational materials development proof-of-concept project is developing materials and a laboratory setting for students studying principles in human-computer interaction (HCI) to perform an ethnographic design study using observation, interviews, and video tape analysis. Students in the introductory computer skills course, which teaches essential computer applications such as word processing, spreadsheets and web page development, are being used as volunteers in the design study. These students as novice computer users are being asked to participate in the design activities of the HCI course.\r\n\r\nThrough observation and interaction with novice users, the HCI students are developing a user's model of the tasks. They are learning and practicing the methodology and skills of participatory design practice. The project studies the effectiveness of the experience on both groups of students. It is expected that the HCI students will learn how to incorporate participatory design methods into their professional practice and the computer skill students will have reduced computer apprehension and a higher level of performance as a result of the design experience. \r\n\r\nEvaluation efforts include the assessment of performance of the HCI students in their design projects and their ability to analyze the qualitative data they collect. The results of the evaluation as well as the course syllabus, materials, and methodology are being disseminated on the web and at national conferences. A faculty tutorial, to include a videotape illustrating the lab set-up, the HCI design methodology, and actual student interactions as well as written examples of assignments and design projects, is being developed. \r\n",
