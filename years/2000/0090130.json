The National Academy of Engineering has supported this effort and has convened a committee to make the case for teaching technological literacy in schools, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers has convened conferences on this issue. Two year colleges are developing programs to alleviate the major shortages of technologically competent people to work as technicians. Yet the average citizen has little appreciation for the importance of a basic understanding of technology, its development and history and its effect on society and society's effect on technology. This project is collecting information and ideas on the concepts technologically literate citizens should know from a leaders in the technology community. The information will be used to publish a book on technological literacy aimed at a general audience.",
