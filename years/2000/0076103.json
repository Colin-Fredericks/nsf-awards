 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores new strategies and methods for the total synthesis of a variety of structural types of natural products.  The emphasis of the project is on cycloaddition chemistry, and the focus is placed upon those that can be rendered asymmetric.  In this way, polycyclic products will be produced as single enantiomers.  The targets selected for synthesis are taken from the broad palette of naturally occurring structures that includes terpene, alkaloids, and other complex systems containing both carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program (Organic Synthesis) supports the research of Professor James D. White of Oregon State University.  Professor White is involved in the total synthesis of natural products, wherein specific molecules that have been isolated from some natural source are replicated in exact detail through a series of chemical reactions.  The strategies and tactics that one employs in this endeavor determine the efficiency with which these molecules are prepared in a laboratory setting, and this often will determine whether or not a particular substance can be mass-produced for pharmaceutical or other use.",
