In particular this grant supports work involving the development  and application of cluster Monte Carlo algorithms in statistical physics, and the analysis of models in statistical physics from the viewpoint of computational complexity theory.  In the first area, the PI will extend previous work in developing a new invasive cluster approach to simulate the properties of materials described by lattice models.  In the second, the PI will apply computational complexity theory, which classifies problems according to the resources required to simulate them, to related materials theory models such as diffusion limited aggregation and invasion percolation.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports work at the interface of computer science and materials theory, with research proposed in two related areas.  The first area will emphasize the development and application of an innovative cluster Monte Carlo approach in statistical physics to expand current theoretical capabilities in computational modeling of phase transitions in materials.  The second area will emphasize applying developments in computational complexity theory from computer science to mathematically related problems in materials science such as the growth of materials in diffusion limited conditions and fluid flow though porous media.\r\n***\r\n",
