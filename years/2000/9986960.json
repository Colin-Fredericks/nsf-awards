 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships Program (NSF 99-121) at Enterprise State Junior College has as its primary goal to deliver a project designed to inspire motivation in academically talented program participants to complete a college core curriculum and graduate with degrees in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. The goal is for each participant to enter and succeed in these programs of postsecondary education at the two-year college level. These student given the financial assistance and opportunity to study in these fields, are graduating with the two-year terminal degree in these areas, and/or are transfer to four-year colleges or universities and complete their degrees in one of these three programs. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships Program is achieving ten objectives: (1) to recruit, with emphasis on minorities and women, 50 computer science, engineering, or mathematics students and evaluate their eligibility requirements for receiving scholarships from this program; (2) to conduct a student orientation for participants; (3) to assess the academic, educational and communication skills of 100% of selected participants and prepare an Individual Educational Plan each; (4) to advise 100% of the program participants to enroll and to continue in courses in their majors and secure an articulation agreement with a senior university, if transferring; (5) to provide instruction, tutoring, mentoring and other support services to 100% of participants, resulting in 70% achieving a minimum 2.5 grade point average each term; (6) to administer the ACT ASSET placement test to 100% of the program participants with preparatory course work required if necessary; (7) to provide academic and support services to 100% of project participants resulting in 80% of the scholarship recipients being retained in the program until graduation and/or transfer; (8) to graduate 75% of NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships Program in the top 30% of their graduating class; (9) to have program participants intending to transfer complete the application process to a minimum of three universities or four-year colleges, resulting in 85% of them being admitted and declaring the appropriate major at a four-year college or university; and, (10) to conduct formative and summative evaluations throughout the project period, and annual follow-up on 100% of NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships Program students placed in jobs or transferring to senior level institutions; the follow-up will show that 70% of all students placed completed their two-year and /or four year degree program within normal time for their program. \r\n\r\n",
