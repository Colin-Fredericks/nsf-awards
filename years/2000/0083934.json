 "awd_abstract_narration": "Built-in asynchronies between political process and regulated sectors or activities can produce unintended disruptions in rates of economic change and development undermining the original intent of the policy or regulatory action.  Such events sometimes lead to unexpected future disruptions as well.  This incubation research sets out to investigate whether the concept of \"time-ecology\" combined with direct methods for visualizing government/industry interactions, complexity theory, and related computer-based simulation methods might yield a fruitful line of inquiry.\r\n\r\nSuccessful global competition requires political leadership to continuously develop, adapt, and balance its public resources and regulatory activity to support the competitive advantage of its industries.  Regulations and public programs, by prescription and proscription or the provision of resources, limit the scope of decision making by business and other individuals in order to achieve public purposes.  Adaptive governance should guide this process based on an adequate understanding of industry development.  Knowledge of competitive resource patterns of the state and region now and into the near future also can guide development of appropriate public policy interventions.  These findings suggest that a policy approach is needed that adaptively ties the right mix of resources and regulatory activity to the timing of particular stages of economic development associated with a particular industry within a democratic context.  The catch is that the nonlinear nature of economics and politics during development transitions such as those associated with California's emerging new information economy are complex, sensitive to initial conditions, with both elements interacting across time in unknown ways.  This project will lay the groundwork for developing user friendly visualization and simulation tools for policy makers so that they can address such issues.  This incubation activity was funded as part of the FY2000 Biocomplexity Special Competition.\r\n",
