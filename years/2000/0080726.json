This event will also support the participation of these representatives in the next Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), in Washington, DC.  The AAAS Annual Meeting will be the premier scientific event in the US during the year 2000.  Principal outcomes of the proposed activities would be both valuable personal interactions with international scientists and science reporters and an increased visibility for the Interciencia Association and its scientific journal.  Recognizing that these activities would represent a significant contribution to scientific collaboration in the Americas, AAAS and the Organization of American States (OAS) have already made a significant financial commitment to support the event.\r\n\r\n",
