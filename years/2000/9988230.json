 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project, directed by Dr. Neal Evans of the University of Texas, is an improved understanding of how stars form. The primary method used will be to confront the relatively well-developed theories about low-mass star formation with observations that test those theories and distinguish between different theoretical ideas. The resulting improved understanding of low-mass star formation will provide the basis for research on the formation of high-mass stars. \r\n\r\nTwo methods will be emphasized in this research.  First, computer programs will be used to translate the results of theoretical calculations into observable quantities, such as line profiles of different molecular transitions.  Second, extensive observations of molecular spectral lines will be obtained for comparison with the model calculations.  The observational work will be centered at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO).   Other telescopes will be used to supplement the data obtained at the CSO.  In addition to improving our understanding of how stars form, this project will provide the educational focus for a graduate student.  The experience gained by students in working with instruments, computers, and numerical modeling adds to the scientific and technical base of the country.\r\n",
