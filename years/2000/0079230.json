 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 0079230\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the construction of a collective social identity among elite, white Acadians of south Louisiana. There has been a recent surge in efforts of this population to shape a historic heritage and to interpret Acadian history. Yet that process must negotiate unacknowledged contradictions concerning differences in Francophone residents' notions of their history, as well as in African-American participation in that history. The researcher will analyze the social identities and historic sites of one town, seeking to answer questions concerning the relationship between race, class and gender and cultural heritage. Several hypotheses will be tested that focus on the how official histories constitute and reinforce notions of racial difference, and on the co-existence of vernacular histories that challenge official histories. Methods include archival research, structured interviewing, social surveys, and participant observation. This project will contribute to our understanding of the politics of history making, and inform public initiatives in historic preservation and heritage tourism.\r\n\r\n",
