The film, to be produced in collaboration with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), SDA of Canada, and the Science Museum of London, will focus on the daily activities of the human body  --  the simple yet astonishing things that happen throughout one's body on a single day.  Emphasis will be placed on such everyday events as hearing, sneezing, eating, healing, crawling and seeing.  It will be complemented by a range of ancillary educational materials including teachers' guides, a web site, and a small exhibit for placement in theater lobbies.  \r\n\r\nThe co-Executive Producers for the project are James O'Leary and Greg Andorfer, both from the Maryland Science Center; Richard Dale from the British Broadcasting System; Alison Roden from the Science Museum of London; and Andre Picard of SDA Productions.  Michael Ackerman, Assistant Director for High Performance Computing and Communications at the National Library of Medicine of the NIH, and Lord Robert Winston, Professor of Reproductive Medicine at London's Imperial College, will be the project's principal advisors.  Other advisors include:  Harry Chugani, Neurochemistry, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit; Susan Greenfield, Neuropharmacology, Oxford University, London; Chris Firth, Wellcome Institute of Cognitive Neurology, London; Michael Preece, Institute of Child Health, University College, London; John B. West, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego; and Scott Frazer, Head of Biological Imaging, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena.\r\n\r\n",
