 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop particle measurement and control technologies for the thermal spray industry.  Thermal spray is a rapidly growing element of the metals processing industry, which needs process control.  Currently, there are no direct particle condition controls for lack of a sensor to provide real-time measurement of particle temperature and velocity.  A short-exposure imaging spectrometer will be developed for measuring and controlling the particle temperature and velocity in thermal sprays.  The innovation combines the technologies of imaging and\r\nspectroscopy to capture particle data, critical to the coating quality.  The imaging field of view provides spatially resolved measurements in the direction across the particle stream.  With the development of the sensor, the system to control the particle stream conditions in a thermal spray will then be developed.  When particles are sprayed at optimized conditions over long production cycles, the coatings will be of the highest\r\nquality and exhibit excellent bond integrity, strength and density.  Critical elements of the sensor will be modeled in a design study.  Prototype hardware and software will be constructed and an experiment to examine feasibility of the particle measurement and control will be performed in an industrial thermal spray facility.\r\n\r\nCommercial Application The technology for measurement and control of particle conditions in thermal sprays has direct application to a wide range of manufacturing industries, autos, aerospace, energy and heavy equipment. Its use in the long production cycles, typical of these industries, will provide significant improvements in their productivity and competitiveness. Key Words Thermal spray, imaging spectrometer, measurement, control, particles \r\n",
