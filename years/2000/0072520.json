 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0072520 \r\nPhilip Foth \r\n\r\nThe PI will study the topology of certain algebraic \r\nvarieties by methods of Poisson geometry.  Many interesting \r\nvarieties admit Poisson structures such that the closures \r\nof the symplectic leaves for such structures additively \r\ngenerate the homology.  Moreover, one can ask for certain \r\nquite strong invariance and asymptotic properties of those\r\nPoisson structures so that the complete information about \r\nthe (equivariant) cohomology of these varieties may be \r\nobtained by studying the corresponding Poisson harmonic \r\nforms.  In addition, if the algebraic variety in question \r\nis smooth and has an invariant Kaehler structure such that \r\nthe Kaehler form is compatible in a certain sense with \r\nthe Poisson structure, then one can hope to find such \r\nPoisson structures on the GIT quotients of the variety \r\nusing the correspondence between the symplectic and GIT \r\nquotients.  In addition, one can hope to study the Chow \r\nquotients by similar methods.  One also hopes to obtain \r\nnew integrable systems in this context or throw a new \r\nlight on already known ones.  The varieties which fall \r\ninto the scope of interest of this project include (partial) \r\nflag manifolds, the moduli spaces of parabolic bundles, \r\ntoric varieties, and others.  There is also a connection \r\nbetween these topics and formal geometry and deformation \r\nquantization. \r\n\r\nThe PI would like to understand the topology (underlying \r\nstructure) of certain spaces that appear in different \r\nbranches of science such as geometry and theoretical physics. \r\nThe results that PI intends to obtain are likely to \r\nhave applications to topological, conformal, and quantum \r\nfield theories, as well as strings and mirror symmetry. \r\nIn these endeavors the PI plans to apply methods of \r\nalgebraic and differential geometry and the formal \r\nalgebraic apparatus. The spaces under investigation come \r\nnaturally equipped with rich algebraic and geometric \r\nstructures.  Some of these spaces appear as quite \r\nclassical objects (like grassmannians) and some of them \r\nare more sophisticated (like moduli spaces). The PI is \r\nlooking forward to further unveiling these \r\nstructures and relating them to known phenomena \r\nsometimes crossing interdisciplinary borders.\r\n",
