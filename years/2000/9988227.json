Software evolution is of increasing\r\n importance as systems in organizations become longer-lived.  \r\nHowever, empirical studies of software evolution face particular\r\n challenges due to the longitudinal nature of the evolution \r\nphenomenon.  As a result, there is relatively little scientific\r\n knowledge about how software systems actually evolve. \r\nThis research has the objectives of developing and evaluating \r\nmodels of the process of software evolution.  Specifically, \r\nthis research seeks to: (1) Identify typical patterns in the \r\nchanges to software systems over time, (2) Determine the extent \r\nto which the patterns coalesce into distinct evolutionary phases,\r\n (3) Understand why systems follow similar or different \r\nevolutionary paths, and (4) Develop and evaluate models that \r\npredict the evolutionary patterns of software systems.  \r\nThe empirical evaluation involves collecting, coding, and \r\nanalyzing more than 25,000 change events that occurred over \r\n20 years in 23 commercial software systems.  Given the relative \r\npaucity of research on software evolution, this study should yield \r\nunique insights that contribute to theory building.  In addition, \r\nlongitudinal empirical data and databases on software change \r\nhistories will be created that are novel, detailed, and of high \r\nquality. \r\n",
