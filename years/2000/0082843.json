The general subject of Supply Chain Management (SCM) has become a driving force for the betterment of the U.S. economy, as well as it's having strong implications for effective and efficient management of global industrial interactions.  Present day and near-future analytical and information-based technologies are positioned to make this global concept of SCM an actuality.  However, our understanding of current SCM accomplishments indicates that there is a need for determining what can now be accomplished, want needs to be done, and what research and developments are required to make SCM reach its full potential.  To this end, we have enlisted practitioners, researchers and SCM software vendors to address specific topics, with the audience being active SCM participants.  The workshop is scheduled for April 18 and 19, 2001 and will be held at the University of Maryland System Center, Gaithersburg, MD.  The Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland and the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology sponsor the workshop, in association with the Center for Logistics Research, Pennsylvania State University and the Supply Chain Council.\r\n\r\nEach workshop speaker will describe a research agenda for their topic.  These agendas will be combined into a suggested research program for the further improvement of all aspects of SCM.  The workshop papers will be published as proceedings to be distributed to all attendees.  The objectives and scope of the workshop, and the bringing together of SCM practitioners, researchers, and software developers and consultants, will lead to beneficial relationships and projects that will further the improvement of SCM.    \r\n\r\n",
