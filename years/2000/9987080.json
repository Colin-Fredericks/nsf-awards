 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has formed the Technology Leaders Scholarship Program at Youngstown State University. The program is making available $2,500 per year over a two-year period for up to 40 undergraduate and graduate students. The relative number of scholarships to be distributed at each degree level is approximately 25% A.S., 60% B.S., and 15% M.S, although flexibility is built into the program with a minimum recruitment goal in each area. The scholarships is disbursed to students majoring in computer science, mathematics, and engineering, with the ratio of disbursement reflecting the relative population of students currently in those disciplines. Entering students are required to have a minimum ACT score of 23 or be in the top 20% of their academic class. Continuing students are required to maintain at least a 3.2/4.0 GPA. Recruitment efforts are focused on the local service area of YSU, with particular emphasis placed on recruitment of minority populations and women. Retention of students through completion of their degree is achieved through careful selection of candidates, student/student and student/faculty mentoring, tracking, career guidance, and selecting programming aimed at keeping each student focused and maintaining their interest. \r\n",
