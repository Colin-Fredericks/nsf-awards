The research collaboration is aimed at problems in control of oscillations.   Certain nonlinear differential delay equations demonstrate oscillatory and even periodic behavior.  Numerous examples of such systems may be found in biology, chemistry and mechanics.  The investigators propose to consider problems related to analysis and synthesis of multi-dimensional systems with delays and relays.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Engineering (INRIA).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the U.S. investigator.  INRIA will support the French researchers' visits to the United States.  The US investigators are expert in differential delay equations.  This is complemented by French expertise in nonlinear control systems and behavior of systems with delays and period oscillations.  The project will advance our understanding of the use of differential delay equations in industrial applications, for example, in controlling fuel/air ratios in internal combustion engines.\r\n",
