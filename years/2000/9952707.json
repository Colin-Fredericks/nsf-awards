 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Materials Science (57) This project is developing courses, laboratory modules, and a faculty development workshop in support of an interdisciplinary curriculum to educate BS-level process engineers for microelectronics and related industries. This industry is comprised of companies which manufacture and package microelectronics products, semiconductor equipment, data storage devices, flat panel displays, analytical services and equipment, sensors and actuators, and increasingly, companies making microfluidic devices for onchip biological and chemical research. The goal of the project and the curriculum is to meet industry's need for bachelor's level process engineers with an interdisciplinary background. The focus of the curriculum is on process engineering, defined as the engineering resources needed to develop, maintain, monitor and evaluate the fabrication processes used in these industries. The interdisciplinary program draws from traditional materials, chemical, electrical and industrial engineering courses. Tying the program together are courses, internships and projects integrating and synthesizing specialized fabrication methods and manufacturing knowledge.\r\nThe objectives of the project include the development of two interdisciplinary upper division laboratory courses, lower division laboratory module development, and a faculty development program for high school and community college educators. Significant funding collaborations exist with local industry and with the Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC) in Tempe, Arizona. An industry-funded fabrication facility is being designed to support the program. The proposed curriculum fills a niche for BS level process engineers that is not met by any other program in the U.S. and provides a model for programs at other universities in high technology areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
