 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the use of transition metals to assemble highly energetic alkyne precursors which are then subjected to oligocyclizations and subsequent transformations which result in the preparation of phenylenes.  The phenylenes have linear, angular, C3-symmetric, circular, bent and \"zigzag\" topologies and, thus, remarkable physical and chemical properties.  The goals of the current project include the investigation of the chemistry of the phenylenes, in particular: to dissect pi and sigma electronic contributions to strain; to establish redox, charge transfer and self assembly behavior to discover the potential of phenylenes for use as building blocks for magnetic and electronic devices; to investigate fundamental organometallic reactions and unimolecular thermal isomerizations; to prepare novel members in the series and to progress towards larger unique carbon networks; to construct theoretically important hydrocarbons; and to expand the series to include heterocyclic analogs.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. K. Peter C. Vollhardt of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.  Professor Vollhardt  will focus his work on the use of transition metal mediated transformations for the synthesis of a number of highly energetic and topologically interesting benzenoid hydrocarbons.  The research has the potential to exert an impact on the area of magnetic and conducting materials and it also serves as an excellent training ground for the education of graduate students and postdoctoral participants.",
