 "awd_abstract_narration": "NMR is the single most important analysis tool in the Departments of Polymer Science and Chemistry-Biochemistry at the University of Southern Mississippi (USM).  This award will allow upgrade of five existing spectrometers to current technology (new consoles, electronics and probes for 3 solution and 2 solid state instruments) plus allow purchase of a much-needed 500 MHz instrument for determining primary and secondary structures of natural polymers such as peptides and poly(amino acids) that cannot be done now at USM.  These new capabilities will greatly enhance hands-on educational efforts for on-campus and summer students (REU programs in both departments), and those that participate in summer activities and professional development workshops (for industry and for college and K-12 teachers).  Research projects address a broad range of fundamental questions on polymer diffusion and relaxation, morphology, enzyme-substrate interaction and structure-property behavior.  Most important is the capability these upgrades will provide for expanding previous efforts at USM in developing new methods for understanding solid state behavior of synthetic and natural materials using a wide-range of isotopic labels  including carbon, nitrogen and deuterium.\r\n%%%%\r\nPublic Abstract\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how atoms and molecules are joined together, and how they pack and move in solutions and in the solid state, helps solve problems in medicine, and in the aerospace and automotive areas.  One technique that is unique in providing this fundamental knowledge uses NMR or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  This method, which is similar to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) used in looking inside the human body, actually looks at the atoms in plastics and enzymes to provide information on what those atoms are doing undergo strain or when they interact with other molecules like drugs.  This award for upgrading and extending the NMR capabilities at the University of Southern Mississippi makes available state-of-the-art instruments for doing this type of analysis.  Basic problems being addressed with this equipment include, for example, ways of improving the properties of polymers like nylon so it can be used in the automotive and aerospace industries to reduce weight and increase fuel efficiency.  In the biomedical area, studying the natural polymers that make up the human body and keep us healthy will help us understand the problems such aging and cancer.  This information also gives clues on how to develop new drugs and new materials that can repair or replace worn out and diseased organs.    Most important is how the award will help educate students in Mississippi in basic science that will help them in careers in education, technology and medicine that will benefit all of America.\r\n",
