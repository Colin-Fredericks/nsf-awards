Dr. Baldwin will be supported for three months at Saitama University in order to develop new chemical sensors or recognition agents for chiral molecules.  These new agents would be the natural extension of work previously completed in Japan by the host scientist, Dr. Takuji Hirose, and the PI.\r\n\r\nConventional and enzymatic methods will be used to make the target molecules stereoselectively.  The conventional approach will produce a racemic mixture of the target chiral molecules, separated by chiral column technology or as distereomeric salts.  The enzymatic method capitalizes on the American PI's experience with enzymatically promoted organic chemistry, making an artificial enzyme using a natural enzyme.\r\n\r\nMolecular engineering of chemical recognition moieties is crucial for developing new materials having unique properties, molecular devices such as sensors, and stereocontrolled synthesis and separation systems.  Chemists and industries in both the United States and Japan are intensely interested in these systems, so these studies will benefit the chemical knowledge of mutual importance to both countries.  It is expected that the cooperation between these laboratories should foster future collaborations and promote international exchange of scientific resources and ideas.\r\n\r\n",
