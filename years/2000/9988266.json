 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clusters of symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) are emerging as one of the most cost- effective ways for high performance computing. However, delivering their full potential heavily relies on efficient cluster-wide resource management systems. This project focuses on run-time scheduling techniques for irregular applications on SMP clusters. Since an SNIP cluster deploys a hierarchical organization, it is the depth of the memory hierarchy with its different access primitives and costs at each level that makes dynamic scheduling on the cluster challenge.\r\n\r\nThe first objective of this project is to develop scheduling proxy architecture to take advantage of the hierarchical organization of the clusters. The architecture designates one of the processors in each SMP, either statically or dynamically, for scheduling among the nodes. The scheduling proxy balances the workload in proportional to the nodal\r\ncapacities and enhances the communication locality. The scheduling proxy architecture facilitates the use of distributed scheduling algorithms between the nodes. The second objective of this project is to develop parametric algorithms, based on existing ones for massively parallel computers, to reflect the possible heterogeneity of the nodes and the communication links. Major undertaking is a rigid analysis of the adaptivity of the parametric algorithms. The scheduling proxy architecture and adaptive algorithms ease the burden of parallel programming and ensure the efficiency of cluster computing.\r\n",
