A specific objective is to investigate how long-chain branching and low levels of crystallinity influence the rheological and physical properties of polymers.  The rheology of these materials is much more complicated than exhibited by linear, amorphous chains where reptation is the principal mechanism governing the relaxation of orientation.  The experimental approach will combine synthesis with optical birefringence and IR dichroism techniques to investigate the component relaxation dynamics of constrained and partially-constrained polymer chains.  For long-chain branched polymers we plan to address why and how a long-chain branch acts as a molecular constraint on polymer chains subjected to strains.  A further objective is to investigate the relaxation dynamics of semi-crystalline block polymers whose chains are constrained by low levels of crystallinity.\r\n\r\nNarrow molecular weight, long-chain branched polyethylenes represent a new composition of matter that have both excellent physical properties and good processing characteristics.  These materials have recently been introduced into the market on a large scale as a new class of polyethylene films.  The molecular origins of this excellent combination of properties are poorly understood; a better understanding might lead to rational strategies to improve the properties and processing characteristics of this important class of commodity plastics.\r\n",
