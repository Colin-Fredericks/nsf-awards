 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project investigates the feasibility of a novel strain gauge sensing residual strains in composites formed during the manufacturing process. Many factors lead to these residual strains such as poor mold designs, inappropriate temperature and pressure settings, unbalanced ply lay-up, uneven shrinkage of matrix and/or expansion of the fibers and differences in coefficient of thermal expansion between tooling and composite. Residual strains hamper the quality of composites products; the measurement of these strains will yield improved process and quality control.  Quantum Magnetics is proposing a novel nondestructive strain sensor based on the principle of Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR). 1-5 wt% of crystalline additives is blended into the resin during fabrication of the composite structure. Composites will be manufactured with low and high residual strains via changes in manufacturing parameters and raw material variations. For measuring residual strains, the composite is irradiated with radio frequencies to evoke an NQR response from the embedded crystals, which is a function of strain.\r\n\r\nThe Phase I objectives are:  (1) determine relevant NQR characteristics of additive in composite, (2) investigate shift of the NQR frequency as a function of residual strain and (3) develop a preliminary design for a Phase II prototype.\r\n",
