 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n   The general aim of this project is to study the structure of positive \r\nclosed currents supported by topologically thin pseudoconcave sets, focusing \r\nprimarilly on the relationship between properties of currents and their \r\nsupports. Topologically thin sets in two complex dimensions are those fibered \r\nalong  nowhere dense sets by a family of complex lines; their most important \r\nsubclass is formed by pluripolar pseudoconvex ones. The specific questions to \r\nbe considered group around the problems of characterization of supports of \r\npositive closed currents, characterization of positive closed currents in \r\ntopological terms, uniqueness phenomena  for positive closed currents, and \r\nrelated problems of branching structure of thin pseudoconcave sets. Problems \r\ninvolving the branching structure concern analogs of the mondromy group for \r\nthin pseudoconcave sets and properties of the order structure on the reduced \r\nhomology group of the complement of the set in the ambient complex projective \r\nspace.\r\n   In the general context the problems addressed in this project concern the \r\nthe structure of currents with the singular supports. Currents are \r\ngeneralizations of distributions to the geometrical setting and, as such, are\r\nuseful to analize low regularity phenomena that are studied with increasing\r\nfrequency in modern science. The broader aim of this project is to contribute \r\nto the understanding of the notion of current and to increase its applica- \r\nbility.\r\n\r\n",
