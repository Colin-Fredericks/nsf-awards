 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:  DMS-0071454\r\nPI: Wojciech Chacholski\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with the study of  the localization process and\r\nits dual, the  colocalization process, in homotopy theory. One of the \r\ngoals is to develop tools to analyze  the colocalization functors analogous     \r\nto those developed by  Bousfield and Kan to study  completion and\r\nlocalization. Another aspect of the project is to find geometric applications \r\nand interpretations of results on  localization. This is related to\r\ncertain geometric relations between spaces. The key idea is to use a fixed\r\nspace as a basic building block and  use  operations like push-outs and\r\nwedges to construct more complicated spaces (in a similar way as spheres\r\nare used to build CW-complexes). For this purpose the P.I. has been\r\nworking on understanding an invariant called complication. It roughly\r\ngives the minimal number of steps needed  to build a new space out of a\r\ngiven one. There is a close relation between this invariant and the so\r\ncalled Bousfield lattice, the lattice of the localization functors on\r\nspaces. Understanding this relation has been one of the purposes  of the\r\nP.I.'s work.\r\n\r\nHomotopy theory can be perceived as a study of the localization process.\r\nThe idea is to ignore information which is of less interest to us.\r\nIn this way homotopy theory works as a simplifying tool. For example,\r\nin order to simplify spaces, we can think about the unit interval as the\r\npoint. In this way we ignore all the consequences caused by the difference\r\nbetween these two spaces. By doing so we identify for example the \r\nletter A and the letter O. This gives  the standard homotopy theory.\r\nThe P.I.'s research has been about understanding what happens if we treat\r\nother spaces  as points.\r\n\r\n",
