 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\n\r\nThe biology faculty have identified the need to expose all majors to investigative labs and to enhance instruction in traditional lab exercises by introducing students to technologies and approaches that will improve their understanding of biological principles and the scientific method.  Change and adaptation is systemic, with new approaches and technologies introduced into laboratory exercises throughout our curriculum, from first year core courses through upper division animal behavior, physiology, microbiology and marine biology courses. The changes include four overarching goals: 1) Students use an important technology, the preparation and analysis of digital images of microscopic and macroscopic biological materials. 2) Students are introduced to the importance of collection, analysis, and presentation of quantitative data. 3) Students use computers to label digital images to develop a fuller understanding of biological principles. 4) Students clearly present the results of observations and experiments in written reports, posters, and oral presentations.  A number of experiments from the educational literature are being adapted to provide appropriate experiences for undergraduates in a range of courses.  Products derived from this project include laboratory exercises modified from original sources reflecting use of new technologies and faculty submission to education journals of papers detailing useful applications of use and analysis of digital images based on students' experiences.  Majors prepare a portfolio of work reflecting their development; students produce images and reports that can be saved in multiple formats. Graduates are better prepared to use imaging equipment, quantitative methods, and computers, all of which are of increasing importance in university and private-sector laboratories.  It is hoped that the secondary Ed/Biology majors we serve will convey to their future students a keener sense of the process of science.\r\n",
