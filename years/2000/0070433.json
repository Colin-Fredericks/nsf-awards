 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will apply tools from arithmetic \r\ngeometry to study invariants attached to the actions of finite \r\ngroups on schemes.   These invariants are Euler characteristics\r\nassociated to different kinds of cohomology.  Methods\r\nof computing these Euler characteristics will be studied,\r\nalong with their connection to L-series,  Arakelov theory\r\nand the theory of motives.   The principal investigator\r\nwill also work on two other projects.  These are to\r\ncomplete earlier research relating capacity theory\r\nto arithmetic intersections theory, and to study\r\nthe universal deformation rings of representations\r\nof finite groups and their applications to Galois theory.\r\n\r\n    This proposal concerns using geometric ideas to study\r\nthe solutions of systems of algebraic equations.  In geometry,\r\nit is often useful to consider the symmetries of an object,\r\nwhich are the ways the object can be rotated or flipped\r\nback onto itself.  Another geometric idea, which goes back\r\nto the mathematician Euler, is that one can attach certain\r\nnumbers (\"Euler characteristics\") to objects.  These\r\nnumbers provide a measure of complexity, and in simple\r\ncases they count various natural features, such\r\nas the number of holes in the object.  The current proposal\r\nhas to do with studying the symmetries of systems\r\nof equations, and how one can assign natural Euler characteristic\r\nnumbers to them.  The goal of this is to carry over to algebra\r\nsome of the insights gained in geometry from considering\r\nsymmetries and Euler characteristics.  Systems of equations\r\narise from many different mathematical applications.\r\nEuler numbers and symmetries can in many cases be used\r\nto either rule out or count the number of particular\r\nkinds of solutions to such equations.",
