The researchers will be undertaking a study of shimura varieties and automorphic forms.  Shimura varieties comprise the number-theoretical elaboration on the locally-symmetric varieties of complex geometry.  The importance of the later spaces comes from applications to number theory and moduli problems.  Most locally-symmetric varieties are non-compact, so it becomes necessary to study their compactifications.  The goal of the project will be research into the interplay between the various compactifications and automorphic forms.  There will be a series of workshops, one of which will be accessible to graduate students, postdocs and faculty.  They will also arrange for weekly meetings and presentations. They hope to foster interaction between mathematicians working on different aspects of the subject and the communication of recent progress.  \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  This field draws from complex geometry, algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, topology, and number theory (both algebraic and analytic).  According to conjecture of Langlands, the theory of automorphic representations controls a large class of motives.  Therefore, the field holds a rather central place within mathematics as a whole.  The project advances international human resources through the participation of postdocs and graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.   Results of the research will be published in international scientific journals and also presented at scientific meetings in the U.S. and abroad.\r\n",
