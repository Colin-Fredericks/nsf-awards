This U.S.-Romania team benefits from complementary expertise in ESR spectroscopy (Detroit), Spin probes (Bucharest) and block copolymer synthesis (Yassy).  Together, the researchers will seek an explanation for observed yet puzzling characteristics related to macromolecular organization in the membrane material Nafion and the organization in solvents of various polarities of ionic block polymers with strongly hydorphilic segments and strongly hydrophobic segments.\r\n \r\nTo accomplish this, the researchers plan to: 1) use perfluorinated nitroxide spin probes prepared in Bucharest to investigate aggregation of perfluorinated ionomers (Nafion) and 2) apply the methodology of ESR (electron-spin resonance) spectroscopy based on paramagnetic probes and ESR imaging to study self-assembly in and cation binding of block copolymers containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments.  They'll also study polydimethylsiloxane-poly (methyacrylic acid) (PSMS-PMAA) blocks in the presence of toluene as the selective solvent for the PDMS block and water as the selective solvent for the PMAA block.  If successful, results should improve our knowledge of the microstructure of ionomers and provide new quantitative information about the dynamics of the different microstructural regions.  Findings are expected to have potential industrial applications in areas such as fuel cells and biomemetics. \r\n\r\nThis international project in polymer research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. \r\n",
