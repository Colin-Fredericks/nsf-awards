 "awd_abstract_narration": "A conference on \"Arctic Development, Pollution and Biomarkers of Human Health\" will be held in Anchorage, Alaska on May 1-3, 2000.  The conference is being organized by The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences/National Institute of Health (NIEHS/NIH) and the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Prgramme (AMAP).\r\n\r\nBasic environmental health research is important to protect the health of this region and its people.  Pollutants mobilized by ocean streams and air currents move globally and settle in the arctic\" sink\" where low volatilization and entrapment in ice and cold water raise concerns about increasing exposures.  Furthermore, bioconcentration through the food chain of fat-soluble pollutants makes indigenous population diets susceptible to untoward contamination.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this conference are to raise awareness of the environmental health issues confronting the Arctic regions and to bring advanced scientific techniques to bear on the issues of exposure assessment and health effects of exposures to environmental agents.  The ultimate goal is to better the health of arctic populations through scientifically sound studies assessing possible health hazards from environmental contaminants.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
