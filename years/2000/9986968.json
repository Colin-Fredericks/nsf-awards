 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this program is to decrease the time to degree and improve the performance of financially disadvantaged computer science students by providing scholarships that reduce their need to work while in school. Computer science majors who qualify for Federal Pell Grants, have demonstrated the ability to succeed academically and have progressed sufficiently through the degree requirements to be able to complete all requirements within the two year award period will be eligible to receive $1,250 scholarship each semester during that period. Eligible students will submit applications for review by an Advisory Council. The Council will select students to receive awards, review eligibility each semester and oversee program activities in support of the goal. Students will have access to counseling and enrichment through the program as well as assistance in obtaining academic support through well established avenues as needed. They will also receive encouragement and assistance in obtaining internship and research positions during the award period to help maintain a focus on career. The computer science program currently has approximately 100 full time majors and 26 students will receive scholarship support throughout the period of the award. The proportion of under-represented minority students is significantly higher in the cohort currently eligible for these grants (50%) than in the program as a whole (26%). By encouraging and supporting these students to graduation this program will contribute to national and regional efforts to increase the number of computer science graduates generally and to increase the number of underrepresented minority students receiving degrees in this field.",
