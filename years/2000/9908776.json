 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in Ohio and Georgia aims to improve girls' attitude, interest, content knowledge, and career awareness regarding science.  In addition, teachers, parents and school counselors will become knowledgeable about female-friendly ways of teaching and fostering girls' interest in science.\r\n     Sixty girls from the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades of two schools serving many low-income families will participate in after-school science clubs.  They will meet once a week for two hours after school.  During this time, the girls will engage in scientific inquiries on various topics that require them to make connections between science and their own lives.  The girls will visit two female scientists in their laboratories once every month to become familiar with their research programs.  They will discuss their science club projects and careers in science with scientists.  All girls in the program will develop personal career goal maps gradually as they go through the science club experience.\r\n     The teacher component of the program will focus on educating teachers so that they can create and foster an equitable environment in their classrooms, and compensate for subtle textbook biases.  The parent and school counselor component will focus on educating them so that they can nurture the interest of girls that will be generated by the science clubs.\r\n",
