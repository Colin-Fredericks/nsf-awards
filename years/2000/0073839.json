The study of retinoids (vitamin A and its metabolites and analogs) promises to provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of diverse basic cellular processes, including apoptosis, vertebrate development, and transcriptional regulation.  This FASEB conference provides the \"home base\" for a rapidly growing and diversifying international community of scientists who work with retinoids. The interdisciplinary, topically diverse program of this meeting is planned to highlight major developments, foment new ideas, facilitate in-depth collegial interactions, reinforce existing collaborations, and kindle new ones.  Through its length and structure,  the conference provides ample opportunities for more junior investigators to interact with senior scientists from this country and abroad.  All attendees, including speakers, are encouraged to present a poster. Outstanding posters by junior investigators will be selected by a committee; these investigators will be invited to present their research in talks to the conference. The conference will begin with a plenary lecture by Professor Pierre Chambon. There will be nine sessions consisting of 49 invited speakers/participants and approximately 10 oral presenters of posters. Each session chairperson will provide a brief overview. Speakers will be encouraged to present their most recent unpublished work-indeed, one criterion in the selection of speakers was the likelihood of significant unpublished advances at the time of the meeting. Previous conferences have been very successful, judging by the turnout and feedback of the attendees. Thus, this series has an excellent record on which to base theYear 2000 conference.\r\n\r\nThis series of well-attended research meetings has been the sole national and the major international forum that address the full spectrum of retinoid biology.  This award will be used to defray the meeting expenses of junior investigators.\r\n",
