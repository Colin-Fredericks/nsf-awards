The project investigates the extension of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) using novel pump-probe techniques for measuring the unfilled density of states of materials near the Fermi level, complementary to standard ARPES.  This technique gives the momentum-resolved electronic structure of a solid, information that can not be obtained by any other means.  The data should be helpful for formulating theories of the mechanism of the superconductivity in these novel materials.  Integrated with this research is an educational plan that will add to the involvement of students at all levels in coursework and\r\nresearch, enhance student communication activities, and include peer instruction.  The PI will develop a special topics class in analytical techniques.\r\n%%%\r\nThis CAREER award to a young faculty member at the University of Colorado supports research to explore the electronic structure and physics of highly correlated electron systems.  One question that the research will attempt to address is, \"What causes the superconductivity in the high temperature superconductors?\"  Although these materials have been studied for over ten years, the reasons they behave the way they do are still open to debate. The major experimental technique utilized will be angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) which directly gives unique information about the electronic structure of a solid.\r\nIntegrated with this research is an educational plan that includes all types of students: undergraduate, graduate, physics majors, and non-science majors.  Alternate teaching methods including small discussion groups and peer instruction will be implemented at the undergraduate level.  A special topics course in analytical techniques will be developed for graduate students. For all students an emphasis will be placed on developing problem solving and communication skills.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
