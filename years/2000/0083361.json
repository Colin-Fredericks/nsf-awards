 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will pursue research in areas of algebraic geometry,\r\ncommutative algebra, combinatorics, and their computational aspects,\r\nwith emphasis on syzygies and their relevance to geometry.  The PI will\r\nstudy (1) Syzygies of Lawrence toric ideals and their relation to\r\nchromatic numbers of graphs, (2) Syzygies, the rank variety and the\r\ncomplexity of Orlik-Solomon algebras, (3) Syzygies of symmetric\r\nsheaves, and corresponding obstruction classes in derived Witt groups\r\nto the existence of symmetric locally free resolutions of such\r\nsheaves, (4) Natural compactifications of configurations of\r\npoints in projective space and their applications to enumerative\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but\r\none which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. \r\nThe main thrust is towards discovering connections \r\nbetween the geometry of sets defined by the vanishing of\r\npolynomials and the algebraic invariants derived from the defining\r\nequations of these sets, for instance syzygies.  Results in algebraic\r\ngeometry and combinatorics have also found uses in communications, \r\nsecurity and robotics.",
