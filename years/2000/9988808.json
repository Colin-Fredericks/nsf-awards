 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this grant is the preparation of unique novel, potentially useful, polymeric materials by new syntheses employing inexpensive monomers/chemicals and conventional equipment.  The synthesis methods involve living carbocationic polymerizations (LC+Pzn) or a combination of LC+Pzn with other techniques, and are based on recently generated mechanistic insight .  While the emphasis is always on synthesis, the elucidation of structure/property relationships and a measure of mechanical testing to suggest utility are essential parts of the projects.  The proposal consists of four main projects and numerous subordinate projects: 1. Living Cationic Azeotropic Copolymerization of Isobutylene and Styrene, and Isobutylene/Styrene Copolymers Prepared by this Route.  2. Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Stars and Networks by Sol/Gel Chemistry.  3. New Thermoplastic Elastomers by Combination of Living Cationic and Radical Polymerizations.  4. Synthesis and Characterization of Novel Amphiphilic Membranes (two subprojects): A. Chemically Crosslinked Membranes, and B. Physically Crosslinked Membranes.\r\n\r\nThese projects concern the preparation of novel prototype materials and investigations suggesting utility for various engineering and biomaterials applications; therefore the potential impact on advancing knowledge in designed polymeric materials could be significant.  The projects will be carried out by graduate students in polymer science.\r\n",
