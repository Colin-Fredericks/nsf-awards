 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central schemes may serve as universal finite-difference methods\r\nfor numerically solving hyperbolic conservation laws, Hamilton-Jacobi\r\nequations and closely related convection-diffusion equations. Such\r\nschemes are not tied to the specific eigen-structure of the problem,\r\nand hence can be implemented in a straightforward manner as black-box\r\nsolvers for a wide variety of nonlinear equations governing the\r\nspontaneous evolution of large gradient phenomena. The first-order \r\nLax-Friedrichs scheme is the forerunner for suchcentral schemes. The \r\nsecond-order Nessyahu-Tadmor scheme offers high resolution while \r\nretaining the simplicity of Riemann-solver-free approach. In the \r\nconvective regime the improved resolution of the Nessyahu-Tadmor \r\nscheme and its generalizations is achieved by using high-order \r\npiecewise polynomial reconstructions and high-order quadrature \r\nformulas for computing the flux integrals. At the same time, this \r\nfamily of staggered central schemes suffers from excessive\r\nnumerical viscosity when a sufficiently small time step is enforced,\r\ne.g., due to the presence of (degenerate) diffusive term.\r\nRecently Kurganov and Tadmor introduced a new family of central\r\nschemes, which retain the simplicity of staggered central schemes,\r\nyet they enjoy a smaller numerical viscosity. In particular, these\r\nschemes admit a simple semi-discrete formulation. This project aims \r\nto develop new, minimally dissipative fully- and semi-discrete central \r\nschemes for conservation laws. The main ideas behind the construction \r\nof these new schemes is the use of more precise information of the local\r\npropagation speed, and realizing the (non-smooth part of the) approximate\r\nsolution in terms of its cell averages integrated over the nonsymmetric \r\nRiemann fans of varying size.\r\n\r\nHyperbolic conservation laws, Hamilton-Jacobi equations and convection-\r\ndiffusion equations are of great practical importance. They govern a\r\nvariety of physical phenomena that appear in fluid mechanics, gas\r\ndynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, astrophysics, groundwater flow,\r\nmeteorology, semiconductors, reactive flows, two-phase flow in oil\r\nreservoirs, non-Newtonian flows, front propagation and several other\r\nareas. Financial modeling, traffic flow, differential games, optimal\r\ncontrol and image enhancement are among the most recent applications\r\nof the above models.Genuinely multidimensional high-resolution \r\nsemi-discrete central schemes provide a rather simple and universal \r\nmethod for solving these problems. At the same time, the computational\r\nefficiency of central schemes is extremely high. For example, recent \r\nnumerical experiments in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics \r\ndemonstrate that using central schemes allows to achieve the desired \r\nresolution about 25 times faster in comparison with other methods. In \r\ngeneral, the advantage of the new semi-discrete central schemes over \r\nalternative upwind methods is particularly amplified when they are used \r\nto solve complicated multidimensional systems arising in practice.\r\nThe proposed schemes will be also applied to such important problems\r\nas compressible and incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations,\r\nmulti-phase model of geometric optics, multicomponent flow and\r\ncompressible bubbles models, moving boundaries problems, shock\r\nreflection problem for the unsteady transonic small disturbance\r\nequation and others.\r\n",
