Kiehl, University of Minnesota\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of using two-dimensional DNA crystals as a scaffolding for the self-assembly of linear arrays of metallic nanoparticles.  Gold-modified oligonucleotides will be patterned into 2D DNA crystals using the base sequence design procedure previously demonstrated in our team.  Nanoparticles with 1.4 nm diameter Au cores will be covalently attached to hairpin oligonucleotides, which are then assembled into the DNA crystal.  A variety of conjugation chemistries will be examined to covalently attach gold nanoparticles with high attachment yield.  The reaction schemes will result in a variety of tether lengths between the Au and the DNA, and the impact of this length on the spatial arrangement of the nanoparticles within the array will be investigated as well.  The goal is to minimize unwanted interactions between the Au particles and the DNA while optimizing precision of particle spatial orientation.  The 2D DNA crystals will be examined by scanning probe microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to investigate basic scientific issues concerning 1) interaction between the nanogold and DNA, 2) distortion of the 2D DNA crystal due to nanogold, 3) yield of the particle arrays, and 4) precision of the alignment.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the capability to pattern nanometer scale Au particles with nanoscale precision in two dimensions by using DNA crystals in this way would provide an enabling technology for single electron circuitry, which could extend electronics far beyond the limits of conventional technology.  This approach could also open up possibilities for other types of nanoelectronic circuitry based on the precise assembly of molecules and other nanoscale objects.\r\n",
