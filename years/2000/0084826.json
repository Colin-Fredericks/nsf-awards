 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a decision support tool for robust airline crew scheduling.  A model that solves the airline crew-scheduling problem and captures two objectives the crew cost and the number of crews that can be swapped in operations will be devleoped.  The former cost forms the traditional objective function and the latter cost is a measure of robustness since schedules with many swappable crews are likely to be robust. Two methodologies to solve the model are proposed.  A Lagrangian decomposition approach relaxes the 'robustness' constraints and iteratively solves the crew-scheduling problem with different objective coefficients.  A parallel branch-and-cut algorithm for solving these crew-scheduling problems will be developed. The second approach uses subgradient optimization and the new concept of computing a 'dual' of an integer program.  An algorithm for computing such a dual vector will be developed and implemented.\r\n\r\nThe proposed methodology will yield crew schedules that can potentially reduce operational crew cost.  The operational crew cost increases up to seven times due to various disruptions in the flight schedule.  Using robust crew schedules obtained by this research can significantly reduce this factor and hence it can provide substantial benefit to airlines. The proposed methodologies use the concept of 'dual' vectors for integer programs.  In this case they are used as a subgradient but it can also be used for sensitivity analysis, pricing, and producing alternative optimal solution to integer programs.\r\n",
