Current ideas -- including ``classical''\r\nmirror symmetry; Kontsevich's conjecture; the work of Vafa; and\r\nthe conjecture of Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow -- are only loosely\r\nconnected and involve both perturbative and non-perturbative\r\nstring reasoning.  An understanding of how non-perturbative\r\nstring theory relates to the classical mirror symmetry picture\r\nand Gromov-Witten invariants will be an important step towards\r\nunification.  Five projects are proposed towards achieving this\r\ngoal: 1) Developing a mathematical formulation of the new\r\ninvariants obtained by Gopakumar and Vafa from BPS state\r\ncounting.  2) Understanding the multiple-cover formulas which\r\nyield integers from higher-genus Gromov-Witten invariants.  3)\r\nResolving the holomorphic ambiguity by determining it from the\r\nstructure of singularities of Calabi-Yau moduli space.  4)\r\nDeveloping a physical understanding of Kontsevich's enlargement\r\nof Calabi-Yau moduli space to include A-infinity structures.  5)\r\nDefining a geometric Fourier-Mukai-like functor relating\r\nspecial-Lagrangian cycles of one manifold to Hermitian-Yang-Mills\r\nconnections on bundles over the mirror.  This functor could lead\r\nto a geometric proof of Kontsevich's formulation of mirror\r\nsymmetry.  All these projects aim to unify our still disparate\r\napproaches to mirror symmetry.\r\n\r\nThis project is directed towards unifying our mathematical and\r\nphysical understanding of the phenomenon of mirror symmetry,\r\ndiscovered by theoretical physicists working in string theory.\r\nString theory is a proposed physical theory with the promise of\r\nincorporating Einstein's understanding of space and gravity into\r\nthe quantum theory.  Mirror symmetry is a duality symmetry in\r\nstring theory, whereby two very different physical theories are\r\nactually equivalent.  When one of the theories is easily\r\ncomputable and the other hard, this leads to predictions of\r\nanswers to difficult calculations.  From the mathematical point\r\nof view, this can lead to conjectures relating parallel\r\nstructures -- the structures involved in describing the\r\ndifferent, but equivalent, mathematical models of physical\r\ntheories.  The relationships unearthed by mirror symmetry are\r\ndeep and novel.  A unified understanding of them may join not\r\nonly fields of research but different disciplines -- math and\r\nphysics -- as well.  This award is partially funded by the\r\nprogram in Mathematical Physics of the Division of Physics.\r\n",
