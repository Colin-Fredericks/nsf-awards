 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in support of an international conference on Spintronics in the form of a travel grant. Spintronics is the control of electron flow by means of magnetic fields (acting on the spin-magnetic moments of the electrons) rather than by conventional electric fields. Thanks to the spectacular development of growth and fabrication methods, the body of experimental, theoretical and conceptual knowledge of new spin states and coherent spin processes in artificial quantum structures has grown enormously in recent years.  The field has reached a stage where the active control and manipulation of electron spin is possible.  The conference will bring together leading scientists and young researchers working in different areas of spin physics in mesoscopic systems, to stimulate the exchange of ideas and to facilitate the dissemination of the most recent results. The conference covers the most intriguing and innovative aspects of spin effects in systems of reduced physical dimensions. Its aim is the highlighting of general concepts and the exploration of new directions of research.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project is in support of an international conference on Spintronics in the form of a travel grant.

The conference covers the most intriguing and innovative aspects of spin effects in systems of reduced physical dimensions. Its aim is the highlighting of general concepts and the exploration of new directions of research.  The conference is international in scope.  This project will provide funding to support the travel and local expenses of advanced graduate students, postdoctoral research associates and junior faculty from universities and colleges in the United States. The benefits that derive from this support include up-to-date information to our young investigators on the most advanced research conducted in the world in nano-science and technology.\r\n",
