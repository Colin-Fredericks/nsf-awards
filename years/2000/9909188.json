The researchers will be undertaking a study of high precision spectroscopy of Lambda hypernuclei by (e.e.K) reaction and gamma-ray measurement.  The project will consist of both experimentalists and theorists.  The goal of the proposal is to probe the limits of conventional models of elementary interactions or models where these interactions are imbedded within the nuclear medium.  The nucleus is used as a strongly interactive rich hadronic many body system.  The inserted \"impurity\", a strange particle or quark, is the probe to explore the perturbation of a known interaction by this environment.  This is termed \"Hypernuclear Physics\", in which models of higher order interaction forces (such as multi-pion exchange) or of quark and gluon substructure, may be explored more clearly.  Such phenomena are usually described dominantly by a lower order single pion exchange picture in conventional nuclear physics.  Significant knowledge has been gained from all the previous works.  However, high precision experiments and data are extremely important to attack the unresolved issues.  This project will provide systematic information in great detail and precision.  \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. Results of the research have the potential of making a major impact in the field by resolving the long standing unsolved puzzles in understanding the fundamental hyperon-nucleon interaction.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of postdocs and graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research on their web page (HTTP://www.jlab.org/~tangl).\r\n",
