Grant \r\nInstitution: North Carolina State University\r\nProposal Number: 0090083\r\n\r\n\r\nThis grant will provide funding for a workshop aimed increasing the representation of minority faculty in chemical engineering and related disciplines.  The workshop will bring together faculty and advanced Ph.D. candidates and will have two express goals:\r\n1. Provide a forum for aspiring minority faculty currently in Ph.D. programs to network with mid-career minority faculty and to meet program officers at NSF and other agencies in the DC area.\r\n2. Provide a forum for mid-career minority faculty to initiate collaborative research with aspiring minority faculty, with each other, and with various funding agencies.  The workshop will also provide information on career options for mid-career faculty.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that this forum will help alleviate fears and concerns among aspiring minority candidates about the recruiting process and encourage them to pursue careers in academia.  They will also be presented with information about the rigors and trials of an academic career before they start working and the tenure clock starts.  The program is being designed by and for minority faculty so that they can help each other and reduce the disparity between minority and majority faculty at various stages of their careers.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will consist of:\r\n1. Panel discussions\r\n2. Research presentations and poster sections\r\n3. Meetings with NSF and other funding agency program directors\r\n4. Overview presentations of research funding opportunities at NSF and other funding agencies\r\n5. Presentations and discussions of results of a Participant Career Development Survey\r\n6. Structured opportunities for mentoring and collaboration.\r\n\r\n",
