These include the U.S.JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Station (BATS), the Bermuda Testbed Mooring, the Deuser-Conte Ocean Time Series (OTS), and a number or related activities.  These activities collectively constitute one of the most intensive and internationally utilized -- and acclaimed -- ocean observation systems in the world.  Hundreds of scientists at the leading oceanographic institutions in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia have either participated directly in the field activities of these facilities (especially BATS) or else have utilized the open data sources that they provide.\r\n\r\nThe workshop, planned for autumn 2000 in Bermuda, will have several objectives:  (1) to provide the opportunity for the principals of the component activities to meet one another; (2) to identify common needs and goals; (3) to articulate the means for achievement of these goals; (3) to lay the groundwork for a more formalized organization; (5) to develop an organizational and leadership structure; (6) to identify and develop linkages to and methods for data exchange with relevant international marine research activities; and (7) to establish linkages with other time series programs, especially in the North Atlantic.\r\n\r\n",
