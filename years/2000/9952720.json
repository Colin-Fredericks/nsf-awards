 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\nReal-time digital signal processing (DSP) embedded systems are becoming more pervasive throughout the engineering design industry.  DSP is a major tool used in electrical engineering design solutions.  Because of the increased reliance on digital systems in engineering solutions, the demands on signal processing continue to increase.  It is of utmost importance that many of these systems operate in real-time.  However, in most DSP curricula, the importance of real-time is not emphasized.  It is the goal of this project to develop a laboratory that supports the design and implementation of real-time systems.  This laboratory supports a three course sequence in DSP with accompanying hands-on laboratories.  The first course focuses on DSP fundamentals and DSP algorithm implementation.  The second course deals with real-time DSP issues such as real-time operating systems (RTOS), DSP architectures, parallel processors, system and software design issues, optimization, and programming techniques.  The third course extends the fundamentals and real-time issues to adaptive signal processing topics that require real-time processing.  This laboratory also supports the communications curriculum as well as the capstone design courses.  Material developed for the laboratory is being distributed electronically through the internet.\r\n\r\nMaterial adapted in the DSP courses are primarily from three sources: 1) DSP Fundamentals course offered at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, 2) the two courses Real-Time DSP Design and Adaptive Filtering offered at Georgia Institute of Technology and 3) DSP Teaching Kit and Design Workshop notes developed by Texas Instruments.  Course syllabi, notes and laboratory experiments from these three sources are adapted to meet the objectives of the proposed DSP courses.  The DSP Fundamentals course is providing materials for hands-on learning of DSP basics through real-time experimentation.  Real-Time DSP Design provides the methodology to foster team work and real-time system design techniques.  Adaptive Filtering is helping to promote advanced theory at the undergraduate level, and the materials from Texas Instruments is providing the tie to implementing all the systems in a real-time DSP hardware system.\r\n\r\n",
