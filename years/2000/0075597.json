 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI recently found ten complete, well preserved, and perfectly articulated in situ neck vertebrae of a very large Late Cretaceous sauropod dinosaur in Big Bend National Park.  This new find is unprecedented and rivals in size the giant sauropods of the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.  Previously, not even a single complete adult sauropod neck vertebra had been found in North America from Late Cretaceous rocks and no giant Late Cretaceous sauropod had been found anywhere in the world!  Partial excavation revealed individual vertebra estimated to weigh from approximately 400 pounds to 1,200 pounds.  The three smallest vertebrae were removed on stretchers on the shoulders of four strong men.  Five hundred pounds is basically our limit for removal of a vertebra by this method.  The only sensible way to remove the remaining seven vertebrae from the desert is by helicopter and then loading them onto a truck for transportation to UTD where they will be prepared for study and display.  The bones have a calcite-rich concretionary coating, which is up to three inches thick.  This coating can be removed successfully only by time-consuming mechanical means.  It is important that the remaining in situ neck bones be removed as soon as possible to limit the possibility of theft or damage, including weathering, to this unique and important scientific discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
