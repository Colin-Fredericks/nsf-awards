 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes an interactive education program with the International Space Station under the management of Durham Research, Inc.  The Telescience Resource Kit (TReK), a software and hardware package developed at NASA Marshall with the help of AZ Technology, has the potential to be a bridge between research and education.  This technology was originally developed to allow researchers to access payloads on-board the International Space Station from their laboratories and offices.  A web-based add-on component called TOPS was developed and the idea of using the system as an educational tool was born.  TOPS (Teleoperations System) is a Sun Java Studio-based visual program that was designed to be easily learned and manipulated by individuals with little or no computer skills.  A pilot program at Crofton Middle School in Maryland is being developed and research at the University of Alabama-Birmingham is being built into the eighth grade curriculum to meet Maryland State guidelines. Expansion of the program to interested schools will follow upon completion of the pilot program.\r\n\r\nDurham Research proffers technology that will allow students to access payloads on the Space Station in real-time over the Internet and to perform actual research alongside professional researchers from around the world.  This kind of connection between student work in the classroom and on-going space station research has the potential to have a strong positive effect on student interest in, enthusiasm for, and understanding of science.  As the students conduct their own experiments, they will be reinforced by news from the space station.  The results of this work can provide a model for other efforts to connect the world of students with those of scientists.  \r\n",
