 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tPre-election bargaining among ambitious leaders in the Russian Federation influences both the nature of choice presented to voters at the ballot box and the outcome of national elections.  As these winners shape subsequent institutional changes, the effects of elite wrangling prior to elections are likely to be felt far longer than their actual terms in office.  Similarly, elite bargaining within the structure of the party system also influences the nature and durability of linkages between voters and their representatives.  With funding, this project surveys party functionaries across Russia in November 1999 to assess the effects of the pre-election bargaining process on party cohesion and party system formation at this critical juncture in Russia's nascent democracy.  These elite-level data provide an important complement to the mass-level studies conducted at the same time.  Elite data provide a means to test propositions regarding the capacity of party organizations to compete on a programmatic basis.  Finally, the additional data allow the testing of propositions about the effects of institutional structures (such as mixed electoral laws and premier-presidential systems) on party system formation.",
