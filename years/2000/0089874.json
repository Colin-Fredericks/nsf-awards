 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to undertake the first book length study of the ethical and moral dimensions of restoration ecology, the science and technological practice of restoring damaged ecosystems.  Following a detailed study focusing on the value of public participation in such restorations, the objectives of the project are to (1) articulate the moral foundations of restoration practices in opposition to philosophical objections concerning the conceptual foundations of restoration, (2) investigate the relationship between the moral foundations of restoration and the scientific questions involved in restoration such as the necessity of eliminating exotic species to make room for the restoration of native ecosystems, (3) ascertain whether establishment of the moral foundations of restoration assists in resolving ethical quandaries which have arisen over the science and technology involved in restoration, (4) determine whether ethical arguments exist for maintaining, where possible, public participation in restoration activities, and (5) question whether findings from objectives 1-4 should impact the way practitioners are trained to do restorations.  In addition to undertaking a complete survey of work on (1) the role of public participation in environmental decision making in general and (2) the moral foundations of restoration ecology, both in the philosophical literature and in the scientific and social scientific literatures, completion of the project will also involve several site visits to restorations in Chicago, New York City, and several other locations involving substantial restoration activity, such as Madison, Wisconsin.  The role of the site visits will be to test my philosophical intuitions on the benefits and hazards of public participation in restoration projects.  As this will be the first book length treatment of the potentially positive values of restoration, the potential impact of this project is significant for (1) advancing understanding of the complexity of restoration as a scientific and technological practice beyond the current state of knowledge in the field and (2) creating a framework through which future work on the human resource elements of restoration can be understood.  Restoration ecology is arguably one of the most important environmental practices currently engaged in toward the goal of achieving long-term environmental sustainability.  This project will restore an absent moral dimension to discussions of this practice.",
