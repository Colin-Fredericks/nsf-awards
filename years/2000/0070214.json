 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe proposed goal is to produce nanostructured aerosols by room temperature synthesis. Unlike the aerosol flame synthesis procedure, it should produce non-oxidized powders with reasonably large specific surface areas. Such a technique was demonstrated earlier by the PI in the formation of nanostructured titania and silica from mixed vapor streams devoid of the traditional solvents. This \"aero-sol-gel\" reactor can produce continuously meso- and microporous metal oxides, with tunable specific surface areas ranging from 100 to 700 m2/g , for a very limited invested cost. Parallel organic processes are also considered, with a view to produce nanostructured hybrids of organic and metal oxides. Rapid removal of volatile byproducts is expected to accelerate the chemical process and prevent the collapse of the nanopowders pores. A number of applications could replace existing technologies, with better qualities and at lower cost. Two target applications are proposed: one is the organic elastomer reinforcement with \"tuned\" nanostructured silica; the other one is the creation of ultra-violet absorbing nanostructured titania for such chemicals as polymers or paint. The precision in the design and manufacture of such aggregates is essential to their effectiveness; this part of the proposed research will be accomplished in coordination with several important high technology industries.\r\n",
