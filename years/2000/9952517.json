 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\n\tSouth Dakota State University improves and enhances its program in electromechanical energy conversion (EMEC) by adopting a systems-level approach in which electric power generation, power control and conditioning, and end uses of electric power are integrated.  The adoption of this approach recognizes the fundamental shift of power technology toward power electronics, distributed generation, and embedded control.  The system-level approach is implemented in a new 2000 ft sq. energy and power electronics laboratory and classroom that is part of a new 20,000 ft sq.  engineering building addition. The new laboratory and classroom are featuring a design that centers around a Power Workstation Bench (PWB) at which students may design and experiment with power electronics and distributed generation technologies, as well as new, modern electric machines. The two undergraduate \"electric machines\" courses are being converted into \"EMEC systems\" courses. They are being restructured using a system-level approach in which power generation, power processing, and end-use equipment is being integrated. Also, a \"Just-in-time\" strategy that has successfully been developed for \"First Course on Electric Drives\" is being used. Finally, educational technologies is being extensively used throughout the course. Students are using computer-assisted design software to guide their experimentation. Flux2D software is being used to create animated flux distribution within the electric machines.\r\n\r\nAdditional enhancements are being realized through adaptation and implementation of materials from the University of Minnesota-NSF First Course on Electric Drives Project and animation tools developed under the NSF-Greensfield Project.  The new laboratory not only provides a more relevant and multidisciplinary education in electric power engineering, but also stimulates renewed student interest in this area during a time in which power engineers are in short supply.",
