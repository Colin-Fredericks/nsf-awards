 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building upon successful employer-educator partnerships, Valencia Community College, in partnership with the University of Central Florida and Rollins College, is creating a comprehensive Information Technology Workforce Development System aimed at increasing the number of skilled computer programming technicians with maximized advanced education and career options.\r\n\r\nObjectives include (1) demonstrating significant increases in the enrollment, persistence, retention, completion, and placement (into employment or the next level of education) of community college students pursuing an A.S. degree in Computer Programming and Analysis by enhancing relevant curriculum and instructional approaches; (2) maximizing and coordinating shared fiscal and human resources among higher education entities; (3) strengthening the ability of education to meet regional workforce demands; (4) enhancing the relationship among educators at the secondary, community college, and four-year institutional levels; and (5) designing and delivering new and revised curriculum and instructional strategies that incorporate industry-certified content and competencies and that address local and regional economic and workforce development needs.\r\n\r\nActivities include (1) establishing an A.S.-to-B.S. articulation agreement model; (2) enhancing recruitment, academic support, retention, and developmental advisement strategies specifically directed at A.S. computer programming students; and (3) reviewing and updating the computer programming curriculum to better meet the needs of industry and students and to better prepare students for upper division study.\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes are more rigorous academic content for courses and an increase in the number of students who are recruited into and who complete the A.S. degree in computer programming (which also means an increase in the number who are able to continue their education in four-year programs).\r\n",
