 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project will focus on the early learning of foundational skills and study how highly successful 4th and 5th grade teachers help students achieve above predicted rates, an o help close the achievement gap between highest and lowest performing students. We will ascertain if there is consistency among different indicators of teaching quality: nominations, classroom observations, and student learning gains, using multiple criteria (statistical significance, percentile distributions, and effect sizes) to select teachers on two different dimensions of high-quality teaching: academic excellence and equity. \r\n\r\nWe will not presume that teachers who are unusually effective with their students \"on-average\" are the same ones who narrow the achievement gap without holding back high achievers. Nor will we presume that measures of \"effectiveness\" from student gain scores will correspond to measures of effectiveness that are embedded in observation instruments. Two researchers will observe teachers over one or two years using both standardized and open-ended protocols. Teachers and other school-based educators will be interviewed; key lessons in mathematics and reading will be videotaped. The planning grant will be used to refine the research design, questions and methodology; explore the feasibility of a comparative analysis; select the teacher sample through a database analysis; determine the final composition of the research team; collect, modify, and develop observation instruments; and establish a data management system. \r\n",
