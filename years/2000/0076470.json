 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program allows the University of Delaware to establish a state-of-the-art laboratory for the preparation and characterization of polymeric light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and polymeric thin film transistors (TFTs). Both LEDs and TFTs have tremendous commercial potential for applications in the display industry. However, the rapid progress that has occurred in this field, has left many fundamental questions unanswered. The goal is to investigate the structure/property relationships in electroactive polymers for polymer LEDs and TFTs. The instrument will support an NSF funded project to investigate structural property relationships in polymers used in LEDs and TFTs as well as the optimization of polymeric devices. The awardees interact closely with scientists who are researching electroactive polymers at the DuPont Company. Progress is at present, however, hampered by a lack of state-of-the-art equipment necessary for the production of polymeric TPT's and TFTs. Specifically, glovebox systems will be purchased for the manufacture and testing of polymeric devices under inert atmosphere conditions. The equipment will be utilized by the research groups of the two Pls, scientists from DuPont and other faculty. The instruments will be used by students faculty and postdocs from physics chemistry, materials science and electrical engineering departments.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program allows the University of Delaware to establish a state-of-the-art laboratory for the preparation and characterization of polymeric light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and polymeric thin film transistors (TFTs).
