 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  This project is part of an ongoing plan to add new technology and to integrate its use into the chemistry curriculum in a manner that enhances critical thinking and problem solving skills. Past experience in introducing analytical instrumentation in the first and second year courses along with the use of \"real world\" applications has proven to be a valuable tool for keeping students interested in chemistry.  We are integrating the use of two high-pressure liquid chromatograph systems (HPLC) into the chemistry program by adapting some of the experiments and pedagogical methods developed by previous NSF grantees and recommended by an NSF Workshop on Analytical Chemistry, as well as applications described by the manufacturer of the HPLC instruments.  Four department faculty members are participating in the project over a three-year period of development, integration and evaluation.  The instruments are being used at all curricular levels from introductory courses to senior research projects.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this project we expect our students to gain an understanding of the scientific approach to analysis using one of the most common separation tools available. They are gaining competence in applying scientific concepts and principles while using modern analytical instruments. Students work as team members. They gain experience in collaboration with others as they devise procedures to explore interesting examples in environmental science, organic chemistry and biochemistry.\r\n",
