 "awd_abstract_narration": "9979428\r\nRebeiz\r\n\r\nThe PIs propose the development of miniature low-power front-ends for 4.9 GHz (or 5.7 GHz) and 28 GHz applications.  FCC has selected these frequencies for wideband high-data rate communications over relatively short distances (from 30 m inside buildings to 3-5 km for outdoor use).  Currently, the electronics (Si and GaAs devices) for such systems as low-noise amplifiers, balanced mixers, medium power amplifiers, and the voltage-controlled oscillators/phase-locked loop are quite mature.  Actually, it is the off-chip components such as the frequency selection filters for the RF front-end, high-Q resonator structures for the RF oscillators, and the planar high-efficiency antennas which are currently the limiting components in low cost front-ends.  They also propose to investigate novel, and in some cases, revolutionary, approaches to build very high-Q resonators, low-loss filters, and high efficiency antennas.\r\n***\r\n",
