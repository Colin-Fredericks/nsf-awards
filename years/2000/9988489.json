The growing popularity of\r\nembedded computer controllers in devices ranging from airplanes to \r\npacemakers to electric shavers points to the importance of cost-effective\r\nmethods supporting the software they run.  Traditional specification\r\nformalisms have emphasized homogeneous approaches in which all modeling and\r\nanalysis occur within one framework, such as Statecharts or temporal logic;\r\nhowever, heterogeneous methodologies supporting multi-paradigm specifications\r\nhave strong practical motivations, and informal design notations such as UML\r\nalready provide superficial support for them.  To enable heterogeneous systems\r\nspecifications to be analyzed in a mathematically rigorous manner, thereby\r\nproviding designers with feedback in advance of implementation, the project\r\nwill pursue these lines of inquiry: the development of a uniform theory of\r\noperational and logic-based system specifications; the study of mechanisms for\r\ncomposing component models given in disparate formalisms; the implementation\r\nof automated tool support for verifying the correctness of heterogeneous\r\nspecifications; and the investigation of case studies involving avionics\r\nsystems and communication protocols.  This research will enhance greatly the\r\ncapabilities of formal system modeling and analysis by providing a rigorous\r\nbasis for diverse embedded-software specification and verification\r\ntechnologies to ``interoperate''.\r\n",
