 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award is to a professor at Stanford University for a project using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study complex materials with strongly interacting electrons.  These materials have many remarkable properties, such as high temperature superconductivity.  In addition, they provide the opportunity to discover and study novel fundamental phenomena and phases. ARPES has emerged as a major tool in advancing the understanding of these strongly interacting electron systems at the microscopic level.  With the recent significant improvement in resolution and detection efficiency, ARPES has the promise to make greater contributions to the understanding of strongly interacting electron systems, in particular the oxides with novel properties from coupled charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom.  The objective of this project is to bring the experimental sophistication to a qualitatively higher level in order to address the most critical issues in the field, especially the issues related to high-temperature superconductivity.  At the same time, the project will also function as an effective tool to educate and train graduate students and thus enlarge the scientific talent pool.\r\n%%%\r\nThis individual investigator award is to a professor at Stanford University for a project concerned with the understanding of complex oxides that contain many novel phases and properties, including unconventional dielectric insulators and high-temperature superconductors that may lead to important applications.  By directly measuring the motion of individual electrons using a sophisticated spectroscopy, this project tries to reveal the underlying microscopic principles that govern the fascinating properties manifested in these materials.  This process will also train and educate graduate students and thus enlarge the scientific talent pool. \r\n\r\n",
