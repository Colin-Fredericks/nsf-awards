 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nProfessors Rodman, Spitkovsky and Woerdeman will continue their study of a\r\nvariety of problems in operator and matrix analysis and their applications\r\nin science and engineering.  These include: (1) Completion of Triangular\r\nOperators, (2) Interpolation, (3) Indefinite Inner Product Spaces, (4)\r\nAlmost Periodic Factorization, (5) Orthogonal Polynomials of Several\r\nVariables and Generalizations.  For completion problems, invariants and\r\nsemiinvariants of the triangular group action will be studied and then\r\nused in the Jordan form and operator spectrum assignment problems. Normal\r\ncompletions and positive definite 2D Toeplitz completions will also be\r\nlooked into.  Multipoint interpolation for matrix valued functions will be\r\ndeveloped, and further advances in interpolation of matrix and operator\r\nfunctions with symmetries will be obtained. Applications of non-stationary\r\ninterpolation will be explored. Classification of normal operators on\r\nindefinite inner product spaces will be developed, and generalized further\r\nto a spectral theory for sets of commuting J-selfadjoint operators. Study\r\nof polar decomposition and J-spectral factorization will be continued. The\r\nPIs will also continue their research on positive and contractive\r\nextension problems for almost periodic matrix functions in several\r\nvariables, with additional emphasis on the computational aspects.  The\r\nrelated issues include invertibility and Fredholmness criteria for\r\nToeplitz operators with almost periodic matrix symbols, finite section\r\nmethods for these operators on Besikovitch spaces, and explicit\r\nfactorization of almost periodic matrix functions in one and several\r\nvariables. Orthogonal polynomials of several variables, \r\nrelated minimizing polynomials, and their connections with Riemann-Hilbert problems will be investigated with the use of the new band method developed by the PIs recently.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research concerns classical areas of analysis and operator\r\ntheory. The choice of topics is both influenced by and aimed to\r\napplications. For example, the expected results in the theory of\r\northogonal polynomials for several variables and related completion\r\nproblems will be used in filter design, compression and analysis of\r\nimages, texture modeling, and multivariate stochastic processes.  \r\nClassical (Wiener-Hopf) factorization has been used as a powerful tool in\r\nintegral equations, partial differential equations and \r\ndiffraction theory. The PIs will continue their study of its natural generalization \r\nto almost periodic matrix valued functions (of one and several variables) which\r\narises in consideration of integral equations on finite intervals and\r\nrelated problems in inverse scattering and other parts of mathematical\r\nphysics. Another example concerns polar decompositions \r\nof operators acting on Krein spaces motivated by linear optics of polarized light. \r\nInteraction with scientists and engineers is anticipated. In addition, the PIs will\r\nalso involve undergraduate students in their research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
