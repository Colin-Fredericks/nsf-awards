 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n9813823\r\nMitin\r\n\r\nThe PI's propose a collaborative research effort between a device simulation and modeling group at Wayne State University and an experimental device physics group at Brown University to focus on solid state generators of terahertz frequency radiation.  This novel class of devices, based on short ballistic diodes in which current flow is due to carriers with negative effective mass (NEM), was originally proposed and numerically simulated by the Wayne State group over the past three years.  These diodes are predicted to generate electric oscillations in the 0.1-10 THz frequency range (corresponding to freespace wavelengths from 3 mm down to 30 um).  In contrast to other solid-state terahertz generators, the operation of these devices requires neither magnetic nor radiation fields, nor pumping by lower-frequency pulses.  Finally, the radiated frequency is tunable by the voltage applied to the diode.\r\n\r\nThe required NEM dispersions can be realized in a number of semiconductor systems.  The thrust of the experimental research, led by the Brown University team, is to fabricate and characterize short-base ballistic diodes in the most accessible and technologically mature of these systems: p-type modulation-doped GaAs quantum wells with quantized NEM holes.  The high-mobility two-dimensional hole gases will be grown both at Brown and at Princeton (where Mansour Shayegan's group has achieved high-quality hole gases).  For the latter stages of the project, when very high frequency measurements will be required, they have established a collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical effort at Wayne State will focus on further developing the theory of ballistic diode generation for new types of structures.  One proposed device involves the injection of NEM current carriers via an emitter heterojunction, instead of their acceleration in a self-consistent electric field.  Independent control of carrier injection energy will decouple the generation frequency from the voltage applied to the diode, allowing for a markedly higher upper frequency limit on the generated radiation.  Other proposed devices extend the generation mechanism to three-terminal structures, such as ballistic field-effect transistors controlled by an ultrashort gate.  While more difficult to fabricate, such devices would permit separate control over both the amplitude and frequency of the radiation.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
