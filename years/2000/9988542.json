 "awd_abstract_narration": "A composite quantum-dot (QD) microcavity consisting of semiconductor nanocrystals coupling\r\nto a high-Q whispering gallery mode (WGM) of a fused silica microsphere is proposed. This novel\r\nmicrocavity combines unique properties of a fused silica microsphere with 3D electronic confinement in\r\nhigh quality QDs and features a Q-factor exceeding 108, four orders of magnitude greater than that of\r\nother existing semiconductor microcavities. The proposed system allows fabrication, selection, and\r\nassembling of individual electronic and photonic components.\r\n\r\nThe nanocrystal-microsphere system can be used to implement quantum logic gates of Cirac-Zoller\r\ntype. The ground state and a metastable excited state of the nanocrystal are used as a qubit. An\r\nauxiliary dipole transition is used for two-qubit operations. Coherent interactions between qubits are\r\nmediated by a photon in a high-Q WGM and through coherent photon exchange between two\r\nnanocrystals. Quantum confined Stark effects are used to tune a given nanocrystal on- and off-resonance\r\nwith the WGM and to control the coherent photon exchange process.\r\n\r\nResearch efforts in this program are aimed at developing experimental approaches to covalently\r\nattach an array of nanocrystals to the equator of a fused silica microsphere and at achieving coherent\r\nphoton exchange between a nanocrystal and a resonant WGM, two most important steps toward\r\nimplementing the proposed quantum logic gate. New experimental techniques will also be developed to\r\ninvestigate decoherence processes in single nanocrystals.\r\n\r\nTo attach an array of nanocrystals to the equator of a fused silica microsphere, the nanocrystals\r\nwill be covalently linked (chemisorbed) to the sphere surface by exploiting the well-developed surface\r\nchemistry of silica and precedented ligand exchange chemistry. The two primary means to be used for\r\nchemisorption will be peptide bond formation and ligand exchange with surface bound thiols. For a more\r\nprecise control of nanocrystal positions, microcontact printing will be used to achieve localized surface\r\nderivatization. As an alternative, micro-manipulation of nanocrystals by using an atomic force\r\nmicroscope will also be pursued.\r\n\r\nTo achieve strong dipole coupling and the resulting coherent photon exchange between a\r\nnanocrystal and a resonant WGM, a nanocrystal-microsphere system where a high-Q WGM couples\r\nresonantly to a single nanocrystal will be used. Experimental studies will be carried out by using optical\r\ntransitions with the smallest g and the largest ratio of grad / g where g and grad are the total decoherence\r\nrate and the radiative decoherence rate of nanocrystals, respectively.\r\n\r\nA new spectroscopic technique that takes advantage of the extreme sensitivity of a high-Q WGM\r\nto absorption or emission from a single nanocrystal will be developed to measure absorption and\r\nexcitation spectra of a single nanocrystal. Stimulated photon echoes will also be used to obtain\r\ninformation on both decoherence and population relaxation of nanocrystals and especially on pure-dephasing associated with acoustic phonon side bands. Combining results obtained from the single\r\nnanocrystal and the ensemble-average photon echo investigations will enable us to identify optical\r\ntransitions with the smallest g and the largest ratio of grad / g . These studies should also lead to much-needed understanding of decoherence processes in nanocrystals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to accomplishing two most important steps toward realizing quantum logic gates in a\r\nQD system, the proposed research should lead to identification of important issues, both technological\r\nand fundamental, in quantum information devices using a QD system. The achievement of the strong\r\ncoupling regime for a single QD will open up a new frontier of semiconductor quantum optics and will\r\nmake possible devices such as optical switching at the level of a single photon and microlasers at the level\r\nof a single QD. The understanding of decoherence processes in nanocrystals should also be important to\r\nany quantum computing scheme that uses semiconductor nanocrystals or more generally QDs.\r\n",
