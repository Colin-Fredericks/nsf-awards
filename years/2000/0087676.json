The unique aspect of this project is that the transduction of the binding event is accomplished directly on the chip.  The team will develop processes based on redox sensors and electrochemical oligonucleotide sensors.  Technical challenges include confinement of sensing elements to micron dimensions, signal transduction, and device control and signal processing.  The proposed work in electrochemical sensor technology will establish an interface between electronics and electrolytes.  A means to isolate and confine biochemical processes on chips for making amperometric measurements will be developed.  Novel microelectrode configurations, previously developed by the PI, will be utilized in an array format for rapid assay experiments.  The development of an on-chip potentiostat is proposed. Integration of an onboard controller, integrated circuit, and sensor is planned. This effort to provide electrical communication between biochemical processes and integrated-circuit technology may have applications in molecular electronics, biosensors, and bioartificial organs.  The proposed work will complement the NSF Engineering Research Center at their institution.  This project is co-funded by the Engineering Education and Centers Division.\r\n\r\n",
