 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working with his colleagues, the investigator will develop the \r\nformalism of Derived Deformation Theory. This theory aims to \r\nresolve in a systematic fashion many of the difficulties arising \r\nfrom the fact that moduli spaces in algebraic geometry related\r\nto higher dimensional varieties are typically singular. The basic \r\nidea is that the correct object to consider for a moduli problem \r\nis some ``derived moduli space'' which should be manifestly smooth \r\nin an appropriate sense and should carry a differential-graded \r\nstructure sheaf. The usual moduli space is obtained from the derived \r\nversion as the degree-zero truncation, and this explains its singular\r\nnature. In recent work, Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov defined and\r\nstudied the ``right derived category of schemes'', whose objects are \r\ndifferential-graded schemes, and they have constructed the derived  \r\nversion of Grothendieck's Quot scheme. The investigator will extend \r\nthe formalism to a larger category of differential-graded stacks, and \r\nuse it to construct derived versions of some other important moduli \r\nspaces in algebraic geometry (such as moduli of vector bundles, stable \r\nmaps, etc.).  As a first application of the theory, it is proposed to \r\ngive a simpler and more general construction of the virtual fundamental\r\nclasses of Behrend-Fantechi and Li-Tian. This new construction is \r\nexpected to be better suited to investigate the properties of virtual \r\nfundamental classes in the case of moduli of stable maps of higher genus \r\nto a hypersurface in a Fano manifold and to understand mathematically\r\nmirror symmetry at higher genus. The project has also a part dealing\r\nwith some explicit calculations of genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants \r\nof flag manifolds, and applications to mirror symmetry.\r\n\r\nThis is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is one of the \r\noldest branches of modern mathematics. In recent years, the methods and \r\nideas of algebraic geometry, especially the study of moduli spaces, have \r\nbeen employed in string theory, a very active part of theoretical physics. \r\nDevelopments in string theory have  sparked a fruitful interaction between \r\nthe two communities of researchers and have led to the discovery and study \r\nof many striking new phenomena. Mirror symmetry is one example. \r\nIt is expected that a better understanding of moduli spaces in algebraic \r\ngeometry will lead to more applications to string theory.",
