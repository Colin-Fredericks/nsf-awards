 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nDMS-0070823\r\n\r\nUnder this grant, Stefanov plans to work in two areas: (1) Inverse Problems and\r\n(2) Resonances (scattering poles). In the area of Inverse Problems, he plans to\r\nstudy some inverse problems for partial differential equations and related\r\ninverse problems in geometry. Some of the problems of interest are inverse\r\nproblems in anisotropic media. Mathematically, they lead to problems of\r\nrecovering a Riemannian metric from boundary data or scattering data. One\r\nexample is the inverse kinematic problem, where one has to recover a Riemannian\r\nmetric in a bounded domain from the lengths of geodesics connecting each two\r\nboundary points. This problem has natural applications in geophysics and is\r\nclosely connected to the inverse problem of recovering a metric from the\r\nassociated hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map on the boundary. The PI\r\nplans to study this problem for larger classes of metrics than already known and\r\nto prove also stability estimates. The related linearized problem - recovery of\r\ntensors from integrals along geodesics will also be studied. The PI will also\r\nwork on the (elliptic) anisotropic inverse boundary value problem. The\r\npossibility of developing an abstract approach to obtaining conditional\r\nstability estimates will be also studied and the PI plans to find sufficient\r\nconditions that would guarantee that one can derive a stability estimate (and\r\ntherefore uniqueness) directly from the injectivity of the linearized problem.\r\nThe PI will also conduct research in the area of resonances (scattering poles).\r\nThe PI plans to study some physical systems where one can construct non-real\r\nquasimodes and to show that those quasimodes are close to resonances not\r\nconverging to the real axis. Two such systems are the transmission problem and\r\nscattering by a strictly convex obstacle.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this project comes from its possible applications. Inverse\r\nProblems have numerous applications to geology, medicine, non-destructive\r\nevaluation of materials, etc. The anisotropic inverse problems are related to\r\nrecovering parameters of media with properties (conductivity, wave speed, etc.)\r\ndepending not only on the position but also on the direction. Conditional\r\nstability estimates show that small changes of the parameters of the system lead\r\nto small changes in the measured data under additional assumptions usually\r\nrequiring sufficient smoothness of the coefficients. This demonstrates that the\r\ncorresponding inverse problem is conditionally well-posed. Resonances arise\r\nnaturally as resonance frequencies for systems in unbounded domains. They\r\ncorrespond to peaks in the measured data. For some systems, we plan to describe\r\nthe asymptotic distribution of the resonances in some neighborhood of the real\r\naxis, which provides computational and qualitative tools for understanding those\r\nsystems.\r\n",
