 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31), Engineering - Other (59), Mathematical Sciences (21) The NSF/CCNY CSEM Scholars Program, aims to educate and support talented, financially disadvantaged students leading them to earn either a baccalaureate or a master's degree, and preparing them to assume leadership positions in the fields of computer science, engineering, or mathematical sciences. Besides financial assistance through scholarships, the program adds critical supports for student learning, growth of self-confidence, career motivation, and long-term success. Four objectives guide this project: (1) enable all NSF/CSEM Scholars to enroll as fulltime, rather than part-time students; (2) improve the quality of the Scholars' education through participation in out-of-class enrichment activities.; (3) enhance overall retention and graduation rates so that all NSF/CSEM Scholars maintain continuing enrollment and achieve their degrees within the two-year project period; and (4) motivate all NSF/CSEM Scholars for graduate study with a minimum of 60% of the undergraduate Scholars enrolling in graduate programs. Because of the character of the City College student population, the project is also serving to increase the number of minorities who are trained in these technical fields and prepared to fill key management positions. The project is supporting forty scholars per year for the two-year project period, at $2500/each. Thirty of the scholarship recipients are undergraduates and ten are master's students.",
