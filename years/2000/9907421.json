Immigration now accounts for one-third of U.S. population growth, and the U.S. takes in more immigrants than all other countries combines-and immigration policy continue to be the subject of much political and scientific debate. Yet, there is a large gap between information needs and existing data.  In it more than 200-year history the U.S. has never had a nationally representative survey of immigrants and their children.    To remedy this, the investigators had designed The New Immigrant Survey (NIS).  The NIS has a prospective-retrospective design in which large (N=11,000) probability samples are drawn from new cohorts of legal permanent resident aliens, using the administrative records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Sampled immigrants will be interviewed immediately after admission to permanent resident status and re-interviewed periodically thereafter; information will be obtained about and from their children, both the immigrant children they brought with them and the U.S. citizen children born to them in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe project is being jointly funded by several Federal agencies (i.e., National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute on Aging, and the Department of Health and Human Services).  The support from NSF will primarily support the collection of detailed information about immigrant American scientists.  While, it is well known that immigrants supply a significant part of the skilled high technology human resources for the country, much less is known about their specific skills, how these translate into the American labor market and how well immigrants with high level scientific training do over time.  Data will be collected on immigrants schooling histories, including field of degree, and all work related scientific experiences both abroad and in the United States, and the experiences of immigrant scientists over time.\r\n",
