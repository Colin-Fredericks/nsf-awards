 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. William Watson of the University of Illinois will calculate the creation and transport of spectral line radiation in the molecular gas in astronomical environments-mainly in the gas of star forming regions and in the gas of accretion disks. Specific goals of this research include the following: (1) delineating the spatial and spectral variations of the polarization characteristics of\r\nradiation at radio and millimeter wavelengths from potential star-forming molecular clouds due to turbulent magnetic fields; (2) examining the dynamical changes in the images and spectra of masers in a Keplerian disk to assess possible systematic uncertainties in the maser distance to NGC4258, and hence in the recalibration of the extragalactic distance scale based on Cepheids; and (3) relating the polarization characteristics of observed maser radiation to the magnetic fields in a clumpy, Keplerian disk to better understand the structure of accretion disks.\r\n\r\nDelineating the consequences of turbulent magnetic fields for the radiation from\r\nmolecular clouds will provide a basis for observational efforts to identify an irregular component of the magnetic field that is presumed to be present and provide a pressure that supports molecular clouds. A unifying theme in Dr. Watson's research is the transport of radiation in an irregular medium. The calculations are especially needed because of the lack of a definitive theory for magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the relevant environments. The calculations will provide a framework for extracting key parameters that are used to describe theories for turbulence. Because of the highly refined data that are available and the broad importance of the issues, masing in the circumnuclear disk of the galaxy NGC4258 serves as a focus for the research on astrophysical masers. It will provide a basis for research on the transport of maser radiation in other types of astrophysical disks and on related aspects of the theory of astrophysical masers.\r\n",
