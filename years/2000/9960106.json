There are very few colors currently used in construction glass because there is no method to color glass without distorting the color of the view through it.  A new method for producing aesthetically pleasing colors of glass is expected to foster a multi-million dollar industry.  To reach this end, a new holographic method to make images of a uniform field of color will be developed.  This property will differentiate the holographic product from most other current applications.  The color-producing holograms will be fragmented into small pieces, which can be mixed into liquid laminating resins.  Resin will be used to laminate sheets of glass.  The color of the hologram will be visible when looking at the glass, however when looking through the glass, the view will not be colored.  Using standard holographic techniques, Phase I will optimize the appearance of the color and produce a small piece of laminated glass colored using this method.\r\n\r\nThe product will be a glass colorant with commercial applications in the construction/glazing industry, decorative trades, and automotive glass manufacture.  It also has potential applications in surface coatings for safety signs.\r\n",
