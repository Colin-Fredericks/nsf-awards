 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gravitational wave forms from the final plunge and coalescence of black-hole and neutron-star binaries are primary targets for LIGO and other gravitational wave interferometers.  These wave forms can only be predicted by large-scale numerical computations.  If such simulated wave forms are to be made available to the LIGO community in a timely fashion, a significant effort to compute them must be continued now.  Such an effort is beyond the scope of a single-investigator project, and requires a collaboration among a dedicated team of researchers.  Important theoretical and algorithmic issues remain to be solved before successful simulations of compact binary mergers can be achieved. \r\n\r\nA code for evolving Einstein's equations in three spatial dimensions and with no special symmetries assumed is needed to produce binary coalescence simulations.  This code must be stable and accurate.  Achieving stability will require theoretical advances in understanding how evolution schemes interact with boundary conditions when the spacetime is evolving dynamically.  It will require the development of coordinate gauge choices that ensure that the coordinates do not behave pathologically.  Evolving neutron stars require incorporating matter sources into the Einstein equation solver and developing stable and accurate methods for evolving the matter.  Dr. Cook will construct such a code to solve the problem of coalescing compact binaries, combining theory and computation in a symbiotic fashion to make the most rapid progress possible toward the goal of producing gravitational wave forms.",
