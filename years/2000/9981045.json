 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)   \r\nThis project adapts four recommendations by the 1995 First National Conference on the Education Applications of GIS in the implementation of our Virtual GIS Laboratory by making specific improvements in curriculum materials, equitable access to data, teacher training, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Curriculum revisions and technological improvements have occurred through the integration of GIS into the classroom by introducing a four-course sequence within the Geography Department.  This shifts the focus toward the interdisciplinary development of GIS problem-solving applications by adapting recent pedagogical innovations including: 1) WEBGIS as conceptualized by Kenneth E. Foote and Anthony P. Kirvan, 2) the virtual classrooms illustrated by the Virtual Geography Department developed by the University of Texas at Austin, 3) the NCGIA home page that forms part of the revised Core Curriculum, and 4) project-oriented GIS.  A newly instituted state-wide site license with the ESRI Corporation guarantees all students and faculty easy access to GIS software.  Faculty workshops presented in this project aid faculty across campus in incorporating GIS technology and Virtual GIS Laboratory products into their curricula.  The equipment is used to adapt the existing GIS laboratory, housed in the Geography Department, to host a web server for a Virtual GIS Laboratory home page and to enable GIS students to make available data sets using ARC/INFO and ArcView software.  From the Virtual GIS Laboratory home page, users can request (1) advanced GIS data collection and analysis in the form of a finished product ready for classroom use and (2) GIS data access and consulting support for those already working on their own GIS projects.  The home page also includes additional local data sets, a FAQ appropriate to university concerns, a discussion list, and sample GIS demonstrations.  A GIS Advisory Panel oversees management, use, and assessment of the Virtual GIS Laboratory.  This project is a pedagogical model for interdisciplinary GIS education adaptable at regional comprehensive universities nationally.",
