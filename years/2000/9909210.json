However, the timing of these events relative to compressional phases and the relationship of uplift to preexisting faults is unclear.  This project will examine the uplift, erosion and post-orogenic reactivation faulting in a portion of the New England Appalachians where preliminary data has indicated Cretaceous uplift and erosion with a suggestion that differential uplift is spatially associated with older, compressional faults.  Results are expected to clarify the pattern of post-orogenic uplift and erosion and may provide insight into the general processers of regional tectonic transition from compressional to extensional environments.\r\n",
