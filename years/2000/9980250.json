 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the formation mechanisms of self-assembled monolayer thin films.  Professor Daniel Schwartz and his group in the Department of Chemistry at Tulane University use a combination of methods to examine the detailed microscopic mechanism of monolayer growth, including two and three dimensional transport of molecules, the structure of the growing film, and the aggregation of molecules in the layer.  Scanning probe microscopy is used to monitor the morphology of the growing monolayer, and reflection absorption infrared and X-ray scattering methods are used to provide molecular structure information.  Phosphonic, sulfonic and carboxylic acid monolayers growing on mica and sapphire substrates are examined under a systematic variation of growth conditions.  The overall goal of the research is to develop a detailed and quantitative model of the formation of self-assembled monolayers from solution.  \r\n\r\nOrganic thin films have important applications in material surface modification and as models for biological membrane systems.  The detailed understanding of the mechanisms of growth of these self-assembled monolayer materials is the goal of this research project, carried out in the Tulane University laboratories of Professor Daniel Schwartz.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the goal of this research project is to obtain molecular level information about the growth of a range of molecular acid monolayers on oxide substrates, and to develop a detailed model of the growth process.  The results of this research will be useful in the understanding of these technologically important model systems, and in their subsequent design and application for the modification of material surfaces. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
