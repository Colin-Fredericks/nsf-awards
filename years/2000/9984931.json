 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER research project entitled \"Nanostructure and Low Energy Dynamics at Aqueous-Oxide Interfaces \" will be carried out by Dr. Carol Hirschmugl at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Division.  The purpose of the research is to study and structurally characterize oxide surfaces, and in particular, how those surfaces interact with adsorbates such as water, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and halogenated hydrocarbons.  Dr. Hirschmugl will utilize the advanced spectroscopic and structure characterization techniques of far-IR and pico-ampere LEED in this research.\r\n\r\nThe educational component of this research includes incorporation of the instrumental techniques in both graduate and undergraduate education.  The proximity of the synchrotron facility to the University makes it possible to effectively include undergraduates.  It is significant that undergraduates will be exposed to these state of the art techniques.\r\n\r\nThis research will involve novel experiments aimed at fundamental studies of surface interactions.  This research will impact the areas of surface science, catalyst design, environmental geochemistry and geophysics.  The reactants chosen; water, nitric oxide, and carbon dioxide are of environmental importance.  Understanding their interactions with minerals could ultimately have an impact on society as well.\r\n",
