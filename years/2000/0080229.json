 "awd_abstract_narration": "00-80229 - Natalia Lozovsky (University of Colorado at Boulder) - \"Geographical Studies in Early Modern Europe:  The Manuscript Transmission of Latin Geographical Texts and Commentaries, ca. 800 - 1100\"\r\n\r\nObjectives:  The traditional story represents the early Middle Ages in the Latin West as a period of scientific decline. Contrary to traditional assumptions, geography occupied an important place in medieval thought and education and developed following its own rules and norms, like all early medieval sciences. Parallel evidence of such disciplines as astronomy and calendric computation reinforces the case for reconsidering our picture of science in the period immediately preceding what the traditional story has termed \"the Renaissance of the twelfth century.\"\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the vigorous geographical tradition of the early Middle Ages, which survived in numerous manuscripts transmitting authoritative classical geographical texts written by Martianus Capella, Macrobius, Pomponius Mela, Pliny, and Solinus. Often accompanied by commentaries and diagrams that clarified their meaning and expanded their ideas, these texts provide unique evidence about both intellectual and social parameters of medieval geography. The project will analyze the content, methods, and functions of early medieval geographical knowledge and demonstrate how a reconstruction of this historical variety of scientific knowledge enriches and changes our picture of scientific development.\r\n\r\nUsing the results of the primary research as a foundation, the project will also aim at creating a conceptual framework appropriate for the study of medieval science and potentially applicable to pre-modern sciences in general.\r\n\r\nMethods:  The project is based on the study of medieval Latin manuscripts preserved in the libraries of Europe. The principal objects of research will be scholarly explanations of the classical texts as well as the variations in the text transmitted in different manuscripts. All these reveal how the understanding of classical tradition developed at different times and places. Therefore, at the first stage the method will be close reading of Latin manuscripts, which aims at: 1) identification of variations in the text from one manuscript copy to another; 2) identification and transcription of interlinear and marginal explanations and diagrams.\r\n\r\nAt the second stage, the project will test the methods and conceptual apparatus used by scholars in other historical disciplines for their applicability to medieval material.\r\n\r\nSignificance:  The analysis of this important and previously neglected category of sources will provide our study of early sciences with a primary research foundation and a conceptual framework, both largely missing at present. Thus not only will the project open a new perspective on the development and meaning of geography in the early Middle Ages, but, in a broader sense, it will be a new contribution to the history of pre-modern sciences, since medieval geography may serve as a useful model in other areas of study.\r\n",
