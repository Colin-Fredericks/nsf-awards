 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will develop integral resistors for high performance applications. Arkansas Microelectronics Development Corporation (AMDC) and the University of Arkansas . A novel fabrication technique involving amorphous silicon deposition followed by aluminum assisted crystallization and doping at low temperature will be used in order to achieve resistances ranging from 1 - 10 ohm-cm, an important range in high performance applications. Since this poly-microsilicon deposition process was developed at the University of Arkansas'Photovoltaics Center, the University of Arkansas (U of A) will act as the research institution. This patent pending deposition process will allow AMDC and the U of A to design and fabricate 0.1- 0.5 MW integral resistors which will, in turn, result in smaller, more reliable electronic packaging operating with greater overall substrate efficiency. Electrical substrates with integral passive components will not only provide a reduction in size, weight, power, and cost, but they will also improve electrical performance. Phase II will incorporate integral resistors with AMDC's proven integral capacitors. Space Electronics Inc (SEi), of San Diego, CA, will participate as a subcontractor in order to provide product demonstrations applicable to the current market. Matching funds from the Arkansas Science and Technology Authority (ASTA) will also be pursued.\r\n\r\nPotential commercial applications are in the wireless industries (pagers and cell phones) where product miniaturization and weight reduction are essential.\r\n",
