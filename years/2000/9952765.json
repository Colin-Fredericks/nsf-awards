In order to assist engineering faculty with developing skills to create suitable classroom and computer-based modules that incorporate the business and ethics components of technical problems, this project is compiling a resource guide, offering an intensive, \"hands-on\" workshop. The PIs have adapted the approach of short, focused faculty workshops on integrating ethics in technical courses from the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at the Illinois Institute of Technology followed by ongoing support, which was developed by the project's external consultant. The implementation of the two models will produce educational materials that weave business and ethics into mainstream engineering courses.\r\n\r\nThis project is also providing ongoing support and conducting follow-up sessions. The main goal of the project is to help students become aware of the business and ethical dimensions of technical problems and use business and ethics frameworks in engineering decision making. To achieve this goal, engineering faculty will develop educational modules based on case studies, which are being incorporated into selected existing engineering courses. This project is targeting three introductory engineering courses, with an audience of about 180 students per academic year (for maximum impact), as well as engineering courses in later semesters (to reinforce the concepts), with an audience of about 20 students per academic year each. Ultimately, this effort is creating a model for educational material development and faculty enhancement, which is being applied to additional engineering courses. This project addresses educational material development, faculty development and integration of technology in education.\r\n\r\n",
