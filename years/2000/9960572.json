 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Workplace Technologies Research Inc. (WTRI) will explore the basic principles of learning revealed by one of the firm's more highly successful technology implementations in which user knowledge and performance with the system were found to be critical.  The data involved were collected on 3500 shopfloor personnel who were given an activity-based training exercise on a complex computer technology.  WTRI's training was based on research showing that experienced adults learn complex concepts in the context of solving problems at work.  The trainees' acceptance and rapid development as 'expert' users suggest that a particular set of principles used to design the training may be a key element in learning complex technologies.  Further,  the later high performance of highly 'resistant' workers may indicate an important role of resistance in innovation.  The project seeks to identify the important mechanisms of learning and to find ways to broaden their application.  In particular, the project seeks to provide the foundation for designing methods of accelerating learning that can be part of the context of the actual work activity and that will not require the considerable expense and lost productivity incurred with off-line training.  At the same time, the model also has significant potential for enhancing our understanding of 'construction/deconstruction' and the role of resistance in accelerated learning.\r\n\r\nWRTI has conceived of a model, Iterative Technology Implementation Model (ITIM(TM)), to increase technology deployment success rates as measured by time to adoption by the workers and long term retention. The model has great potential for generalizing the facilitation of the process of technology adoption/ replacement, if the principles that have made the approach to training for change and technology adoption so successful can be distilled from the large, rich data set at hand.  This distillation can in turn facilitate appropriate training selection and design and faster implementation of change, thus making needed assistance more affordable to a broader spectrum of companies.",
