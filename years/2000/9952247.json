 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) This project develops applied, interdisciplinary laboratory clusters exploring questions for non-science majors emphasizing scientific methodology in geology, biology and physics.  The clusters include the creation and testing of both observational and experimental models, multiple approaches to the testing of models, examination of assumptions inherent in some models, use of basic statistics, Internet research, and experimental design. Teamwork and discussion among students occurs with writing a group report and a group presentation of results.  Project development includes two laboratory clusters for the development of a Dinosaur Paleoecology Laboratory Manual.  Cluster 1: Dinosaur Weight Estimates, allows students to make weight estimates through volume estimation, calculation of bone cross-sectional area, and static bone fracture strength.  Students evaluate the procedures used to determine weight of various dinosaurs and the variables, which control the accuracy of estimates.  These evaluations and estimations compare and test against the measurements of live animals, examine data from literature, compute linear regression for predictive purposes, and test actual fracture strengths.  Cluster 2, How Fast Did They Run, illustrates two approaches to the same problem by allowing students to experiment with estimating speed from a) stride length, and b) dynamic bone fracture strength.  The two clusters exemplify the interconnectedness of the weight and running speed questions through the evaluation of bone fracture strength in both clusters. Assessment of the clusters is based on student performance and laboratory experience.  The students' performance assessment procedures for evaluation of the resulting clusters focus on three aspects of the their performance: 1) an individual laboratory notebook, 2) a collaborative group report, and 3) a collaborative group presentation and distribution plan for identification of potential test sites.  Assessment of the on-campus laboratory experience is based on feedback in the laboratory and biweekly critical thinking exercises, and a comparison of two student populations taking the introductory Dinosaur Lecture class and their understanding of scientific methodology between one group taking the optional laboratory exercises and the other group not taking the optional laboratory exercises.  Faculty at institutions currently teaching introductory Dinosaur Lecture courses have access to the exercises and will are involved in the assessment.",
