The workshop is being organized on the European side by Mario Pezze of the Polytechnic University in Milan, Italy.  US researchers will join with scientists from all over Europe to discuss the use of Petri nets and other formal methods for the construction of software systems.  Petri nets are a well-established method for modeling concurrent systems, and they are widely taught.  The organizers are taking a broader view, though, and will focus attention on the application of their formal models to the building of real software systems.  The workshop is being held in conjunction with the 21st International Conference on Application and theory of Petri Nets.\r\n",
