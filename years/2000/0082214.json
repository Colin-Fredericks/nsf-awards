 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has previously developed several variants of a new statistical framework based on the principle of maximum entropy (ME) for learning the joint probability mass function associated with a discrete (possibly high-dimensional) feature space.   Although excellent results which surpass those attainable with competing approaches have been obtained, the PI is currently limited to handling small-to-intermediate feature spaces (up to 30 dimensions), and has only considered artificial general inference problems.  The main objective in this project is to develop a large-scale extension of the new methods capable of handling hundreds, or even thousands, rather than tens of features, and to then apply the approach to emerging domains such as multiple topic retrieval from document databases and collaborative filtering.    Applications to diagnosis and marketing will also be explored.    Successful completion of this work will result in a practical set of ME tools that outperform existing methods and thus have a significant impact on large-scale inference tasks.   The work will also develop principled methods within the ME framework for treating mixed continuous/categorical data and arbitrary patterns of missing features.   By attacking large-scale problems, heterogeneous data, and missing features, the work addresses some key challenges encountered in machine learning in practice.",
