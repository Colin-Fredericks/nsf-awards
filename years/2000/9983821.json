 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program focuses on the investigation of 3-dimensional optical imaging to capture, store, represent and communicate visual information. The technical approach is based on a novel interferometric and volume holographic architectures for high performance imaging of three or higher dimensional objects. The research effort includes the development of shear interferometers based on light splitting due to double refraction on curved surfaces of varying shapes, volume holographic modal design for imaging modalities aimed at maximizing performance in information extraction, and a novel correlator design for three dimensional objects.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award program will provide the foundation for the advancement and uti-\r\nlization of  Hybrid Optical-Electronic Imaging (HopEI) systems focusing on visual sensing applications such as 3D imaging and microscopy. The research and education parts of the program will be combined to enhance the analysis and design of optical fields and elements, and their harmonious integration with cooperative technologies. Since 3D native spaces are ubiquitous in areas as diverse as biology, medicine, multimedia, entertainment, and advertisement, the effort will focus on making the most of state-of-the-art technologies in providing novel visual tools for these application areas, while answering fundamental questions about the information properties of imaging operations. Through the collection of optical tools and design methods the program attempts to advocate the  concept  of  \"3D optical engineering\". The program will examine the convergence of several technologies, optical, mechanical, electronic, and algorithmic, for exploiting the 3D nature of optical fields which should  lead to new insights reaching far beyond the intersection of these disciplines. \r\n",
