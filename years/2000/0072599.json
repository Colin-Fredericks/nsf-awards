 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Chemical Society Symposium on  New Synthetic Methods in Solid-State Chemistry will be held in San Francisco, CA March 26-31, 2000.  The goal of the conference is to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions and information exchange within a broad spectrum of researchers, to include CAREER  grantees, and top post doctoral scholars and graduate students working in priority areas of the broad field of solid-state chemistry. The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of young Pi's,  graduate students and post doctoral scholars. \r\n%%% \r\nThe Solid State Chemistry community continues to have direct impact on important  technological areas  that are crucial to advancing society through the design, synthesis and application new materials. Examples include porous solids for catalysis,  thin films for electronics and electrooptic devices, and nanostructured materials for high-strength composite structural materials.  Since these technical areas are of very high priority to industry,  students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary areas involving solid-state chemistry compete very well in the job market and go on  to contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.\r\n",
