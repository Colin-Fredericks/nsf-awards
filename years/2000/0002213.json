The program's awards \r\nprovide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or\r\ncomplementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Tomas Hrbek with support for\r\ntwenty-four months to work with Dr. Axel Meyer at the University of Konstanz in \r\nGermany on a project entitled \"Testing the Temporal Assumption of Mayr's Geographic \r\nSpeciation Model.\"\r\n\r\nThis project will use the killifish genus Aphanius as a model system to test distributional \r\nand speciational hypotheses as impacted by the Plio-Pleistocene Mediterranean Sea level \r\nfluctuations, the Messinian salinity crisis, orogenic events associated with closing of the \r\nTethys Sea, and the drying of the central Anatolian plateau.  Mayr's model of speciation \r\npostulates that the range of a single species must be broken up into discontinuous regions, \r\nwith little or no gene flow between them, in order for speciation to occur.  Dr. Hrbek will \r\nuse molecular data to generate a phylogeny of Aphanius and will do a population genetic \r\nstudy of the Aphanius anatoliae species complex.  A detailed molecular analyses will \r\nallow him to test temporal and spatial processes leading to patterns of diversification and \r\nspeciation which are exemplified in that genus.  Such an analysis will also aid \r\nconservation efforts of this group of fishes, which appear to be endangered in many areas \r\nof their distribution.\r\n\r\nThe host lab is especially well suited for this project, having a very active research group \r\nand an extensive professional contact with the European evolutionary community.  The \r\nlab also has an extensive infrastructure and knowledge base.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
