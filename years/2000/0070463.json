 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sensing actions, which when executed change the state of an agent's knowledge without changing the world. are necessary when planning in the presence of incomplete knowledge about the world. The initial aim of this research is to develop a formal characterization of reasoning and planning with sensing actions.   Questions to be addressed include:  What kind of plans are necessary when planning with incomplete information?   When is such a plan correct?   What is the state-space in this case?   How do we compactly represent states?    How do we characterize noise in sensing? How do we specify goals?    What is the complexity of planning with sensing?   The answers to these questions will be used to develop planning algorithms and planners that are more tractable, and which use a sound (but not necessarily complete) reasoning about sensing actions.\r\n\r\nAnother thrust of this research is to use sensing actions for diagnostic problem solving in dynamic domains.   The PI will formulate the notion of a diagnosis, given a set of observations about different time points.   Since a particular set of observations may lead to multiple diagnoses, the PI will develop the notion of a diagnostic plan which when executed will lead the reasoner to a unique (or a smaller set of) diagnoses.  He will then study the complexity of finding a diagnosis and constructing diagnostic plans, and develop and implement corresponding algorithms for tractable subclasses.\r\n\r\nThis project will lead to a theory of actions that allows sensing actions, which will allow us to: develop sound and complete planners as well as sound, but incomplete, but more tractable planners.   It will extend applications such as agent control and diagnosis to the incomplete world, impacting diverse areas of computer science including the high-level control aspects of mobile robots, active databases, and program verification.\r\n\r\n",
