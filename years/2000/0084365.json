 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for a core computer network that will serve as the \"central nervous system\" for the new Field Research Station of The University of Montana located at Fort Missoula. The station is located on 100 hectares of land about 15 minutes away from the main University campus, and will provide a bridge between the existing University research facilities and the largest expanse of wilderness surrounding any university in the lower 48 states. The facility currently lacks computers, and thus is not fully functional. The computer network to be established with the aid of this award consists of a central high-power and high-speed server, which will run a local area network (LAN) at the field facility, and allow backup and storage of large data files. This central computer will be linked to a network of workstations that will allow different users to simultaneously collect, store, retrieve, and analyze massive data sets. A second computer server will allow researchers throughout the world access to several data sets on the distribution, nesting habitat, and reproductive success of birds in North America. These databases are among the largest and most important sources of such information in the world. \r\n\r\nThe principal investigators share interests in avian biology, and their research programs span a diverse set of disciplines that includes behavior, flight biomechanics, life history strategy, community ecology, physiology, communication and signaling, and conservation biology. In addition to significantly enhancing these investigators' research, the computer network will allow unprecedented, innovative, multi-disciplinary collaborations on a wide range of questions pertaining generally to animal design, life history, and behavioral activity patterns. Moreover, this facility and associated faculty is expected to serve as a magnet for attracting sabbatical professorships, summer researchers, post-doctoral associates, and outstanding graduate students. The computer network and associated research facility will also enhance the already existing collaborations between the faculty, private industry and governmental organizations, as well as broad community outreach programs and developing educational collaborations with regional K- 12 science teachers. With the aid of the equipment to be purchase with these funds, the Field Research Station will be fully integrated into the University of Montana's educational priorities to provide student-directed research opportunities. \r\n",
