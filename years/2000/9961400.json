 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate that a fully functional internet seismic processing system (INSP) can be developed and smoothly operated.  The use of large-scale parallel computers for seismic processing has achieved such technical and economical success that the oil and gas industry is the largest commercial market for scientific high-performance computing; however, the vast majority of exploration organizations have no direct access to high-end seismic imaging technologies because they lack the resources to acquire and maintain the necessary hardware and software.  The objective of this project is to take advantage of high-speed networks and recent advances in architecture-independent programming languages to provide a seamless internet/intranet seismic computing solution.  The research will attempt to build the software infrastructure that will enable geologists to have direct control of depth-imaging projects and to have access to remote large-scale parallel computers, as effortlessly and effectively as if they were employing a workstation linked to their local-area network. This will overcome the economical and operational obstacles that today prevent the vast majority of exploration projects in difficult areas to fully benefit from the rapid progress in high-performance computing.\r\n\r\nThe commercial potential of the technology is significant because it makes seismic depth imaging and other compute-intensive technologies accessible to a large heretofore untapped client base, while providing an efficient resource distribution and allocation to all potential clients requiring access to high performance computing facilities and state-of-the-art software.  The resulting product will allow greatly increased interaction between the client and contractor, thereby increasing the quality of the final seismic image and in turn reducing exploration risk and offsetting the high costs of exploratory drilling and failed reservoir management projects.  \r\n\r\nKEYWORDS\r\nInternet, intranet, Java programming language, high performance computing, super computing, seismic imaging, oil and gas exploration",
