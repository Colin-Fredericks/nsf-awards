 "awd_abstract_narration": "A coupled materials processing - experimental \r\ntesting - mathematical modeling program will study how variations in \r\nprocessing time-temperature conditions effect the strength of the \r\nself thermal-plastic response of NiTi shape memory alloy fiber \r\nactuated aluminum metal matrix composites, and will investigate how \r\nthe development of very high internal stresses in the material \r\ninfluence mechanical fatigue behavior.  Preliminary results have \r\nshown that a properly processed and prepared NiTi shape memory alloy \r\nfiber actuated aluminum metal matrix composite (SMA-MMC) will exhibit \r\nvery large, self imposed thermal-plastic compressive deformation \r\nunder heating.  Unfortunately, very little is presently known about \r\nthe processing sensitivity and thermo-mechanical-fatigue behavior of \r\nthe material.  We therefore propose the following three major tasks: \r\nTask 1: Systematically measure how controlled variations in high \r\ntemperature hot press consolidation processing conditions effect the \r\nshape recovery of the resulting SMA-MMC, and determine the \r\nmechanism(s) responsible for the material performance changes.  Task \r\n2: Perform a tensile cycle fatigue endurance study, identifying the \r\nfatigue damage development process in the material.  Task 3: \r\nMathematically model the self thermal plastic response of the \r\nmaterial accommodating general variations in matrix strength, matrix \r\nflow properties, fiber volume fraction, fiber transformation \r\nproperties, and temperature histories.  The overall goal of the \r\nprogram is to provide a quantitative design tool for the scientific \r\ndevelopment of safety and cost critical commercial and military \r\napplications.\r\n\r\n",
