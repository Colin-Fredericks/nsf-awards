 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Dickson of the Georgia Institute of Technology will be supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program as a CAREER awardee.  He will study heterogeneous polymer structures utilizing a method he has invented to detect fluorescence from very dilute single molecule probes embedded in polymers.  This is an advance over previous single molecule methods such as near field which suffer from tip interactions with the surface.  Among the topics studied will be orientations of polymer-bound molecules, rotational mobility of the probe in the polymer, polymer melting and aging.   Single molecule studies afford the opportunity to teach students about quantum mechanics.  Starting with demonstrations of single molecule phenomena in general chemistry, then introducing experiments in physical chemistry laboratory, Professor Dickson will incorporate his research into the curriculum in an approachable manner and motivate students to learn the quantum chemistry that can explain what they observe.\r\n\r\nAlthough plastics are ubiquitous, their material properties are poorly understood and can lead to device failure over long times and upon exposure to harsh conditions.  Understanding molecular features of plastics will allow scientists to overcome these instabilities and produce polymers suited for special applications such as molecular electronics and drug delivery.  Professor Dickson's research will contribute to these goals.  His education plan to integrate single molecule work into the curriculum will stimulate and motivate students to learn quantum chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
