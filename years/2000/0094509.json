This project will utilize WGBH's extensive broadcast, video and interactive programming resources to support teacher education and student learning in science at the K-12 grade levels.  As currently conceived, the result will be a searchable, Web-based repository of no-cost, high-quality materials that teachers can easily access for their own professional development as well as to support classroom activities with students.  They are seeking immediate support to study the viability, usefulness, and functionality of the proposed model. \r\n\r\nThe Principal investigator reports that they  have made significant progress in developing the concept over the past year.  With NSF support they will be able to complete the design of a prototype, test its component parts with target users, and explore options to keep the resources free of commercial agendas.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
