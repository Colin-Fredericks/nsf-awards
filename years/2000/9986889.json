 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CSEMS scholarship program that is being proposed will provide the participating students with two valuable resources. First of all, the CSEMS scholarship program allows the student to focus more on their educational environment. Secondly, this environment will be greatly improved by the active participation of the PIs. Students will be connected to the career/advising/mentoring services of this university through their designated CSEMS scholarship advisors. Each one of the five PIs on this grant will work with a small group of scholarship recipients to ensure that the students are making progress towards their career goals and that they are taking advantage of the career services that are already in place. \r\n\r\nStudents who are completing their degrees are at a point of transition and the PIs recognize the importance of providing timely information to the students to aid them in making important decisions. The PIs will work with the students to investigate career options, including placement into graduate or professional schools or entering the workforce. \r\n\r\nThe University of Arizona is much more than simply a Research I university. It has shown itself to be vitally interested in undergraduate and graduate education. The CSEMS scholars, working with their assigned PI, will be able to take advantage of the research experience of the faculty to increase their career goals. The many educational opportunities will further enhance their experience and prepare them for an exciting technological career. \r\n",
