 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to identify process-structure-property relationships and conduct process planning in order to permit efficient operation of the newly developed laser-jet chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) rapid prototyping (RP) system and demonstrate the usefulness of this system by fabricating advanced electronic devices and structural materials.  The LCVD-RP system, which began operation in August 1999, was specifically designed by this research team to permit rapid prototyping and manufacture of complex shaped, 3-D, composite electronic/photonic devices and structural material components.  Visualize a laser and gas jet positioned above a substrate whose movement is computer-controlled.  At any instant, the laser heats a spot on the substrate, which is simultaneously flooded by a localized jet of CVD reagent gases.  Only the spot heated by the laser becomes coated as a result of the thermally activated CVD reaction.  The combination of laser CVD with gas jets offers significant advantages in terms of facilitating the deposition of multiple materials, maximizing deposition rate, and conserving reagent.  Prior research has focused on producing simple structures such as fiber arrays and solenoids because the process control utilized was not sophisticated.  The LCVD-RP system utilizes hardware, computer control, and on-line dimensional equipment that will permit growth of intricate, useful composite devices and components.   \r\n\r\nThe LCVD-RP system possesses the following novel features:  (1) three modes of operation, two of which utilize a high velocity gas jet that increases the deposition rate,  (2) a rotating/translating stage that facilitates rapid movement of the stage relative to the laser and/or gas-jet,  (3) an on-line dimensional control system, and  (4) on-line temperature monitoring and control.  The system enables fabrication of novel devices and material microstructures that are impossible to fabricate by conventional methods.  For example, the research will demonstrate the fabrication of an advanced electron beam source, and either a g-sensor or fiber-reinforced nanolaminate composite materials.\r\n",
