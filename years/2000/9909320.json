 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Michael Moseley, Mr. Richard Smailes will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Mr. Smailes has a background in construction contracting and is familiar with modern computer assisted techniques to aid in design, cost estimation and scheduling. These provide the framework within which modern building takes place. In this highly innovative project he will take this set of techniques, adapt them and apply the retrospectively to the construction of a prehistoric royal compound at the site of Chan Chan Peru. This ancient city located on Peru's arid North Coast contains a number of monumental structures consisting of walled enclosures which surround multiple buildings and storerooms. Archaeologists believe that early compounds were occupied by multiple successive rules while later ones served only one: each king constructed his own which was abandoned after his death. It is unclear however how long such a compound took to build given available construction techniques and methods of labor organization. Previous attempts in both Peru and other regions of the world to estimate labor involved in monumental construction have been rudimentary and based solely on amount of earth and other material involved in construction. Issues of the types of tasks involved, crew size and scheduling have not been considered. Modern contractors have computer based techniques which assist in planning and managing construction and in estimating costs. Mr. Smailes will use these to analyze a Chan Chan royal compound. The site has been carefully mapped and Mr. Smailes will use these data to construct a three dimensional computer model of the compound. This will provide the basis from which estimation will proceed. He will also conduct ethnoarchaeological research in Peru to gain insight into traditional construction practices such as adobe brick making.\r\n\r\nArchaeologists not unreasonably assume that a correlation exists between the size and complexity of a construction and the level of complexity and social organization of the society which built it. Therefore they often attempt to estimate the amount of labor required for a particular monumental structure and use this to speculate about other aspects of the society. Mr. Smailes' research will constitute a significant improvement to the methodologies employed to date and, if successful will likely be applied in many archaeological situations in many parts of the world. Thus its methodological impact will likely be significant. This research will increase our understanding of one of the cradles of civilization and assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
