 "awd_abstract_narration": "In pursuit of the primary objective of increasing the number of Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) graduates who enroll in SEM graduate degree programs, Xavier University has given considerable attention in Phase I of the Model Institutions for Excellence (MIE) Program to the development of capacity  building; particularly in the area of physical facilities. This effort has resulted in the completion of major portions of the University communications and information technology network infrastructure. As a consequence, all faculty, students and staff now have electronic mail accounts and access to the Internet and the World Wide Web. Additionally, an open student computer lab; the Resource and Mentoring Center; with over 70 computing stations and 4 group study areas has been established in the University library with extended operating hours (of 8:00am to 12 midnight). And, a major undertaking, the construction of a 100,000 square foot addition to the Academic Science building was completed with occupancy initiated in late 1998. The building houses the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Sciences and Computer Engineering, and Physics/Engineering.\r\n\r\nModerate success in student outcomes is already beginning to be realized as a result of the ever-evolving strategies designed to create an environment within the University community to attract increasing numbers of SEM students to a \"corporate\" mindset that leads them to take into consideration the pursuit of a graduate degree. There are currently over 75 more students now (than there were at the beginning of the MIE program in 1995) who are actively involved in activities designed to prepare them for graduate school.   As a snapshot of SEM student outcomes of those who have been directly affected by MIE through the first four years of the program, it is noted that the MIE program has financially supported approximately 130 students. Of that number, 43 students are still enrolled as SEM undergraduates, 62 have graduated with SEM degrees, of which 49 (79%) subsequently enrolled in graduate school. The remaining numbers include those who are recent graduates (11), and those who have chosen employment (9 in SEM areas) subsequent to graduation. As the program progresses, it is expected that student outcomes will become more plentiful and apparent as those students who have been exposed to the opportunities provided by the MIE program (including access to enhanc\r\ned facilities, and the equally important expanded support for undergraduate research) complete their undergraduate training.\r\n\r\nAcademically, the University achieved a major milestone by successfully completing all (including Board of Trustees) approvals for initiation of a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Engineering to begin with the Fall 2000 Semester. This will be the only such program at an independent HBCU in the country. This effort is in addition to the many activities of curriculum development and enhancement that has been performed by over 15 faculty in equally as many courses during the past four years.\r\n\r\nA major administrative initiative has been the efforts to develop the XU Center for Undergraduate Research - which is now in the process of being established with the national search in progress for a Center Direct\r\nor. In addition, the movement by the University to the SCT Banner 2000 data management system will ensure that it has an integrated management system that is not only year 2000 compliant, but will also support its efforts to become a model institution in the use of information technology in the administrative processes of the University. A corollary to this development has been the establishment of a new University position - Associate Vice President for Technology Administration, who, as the Chief Information Officer, is now responsible for oversight and implementation of all electronic technology in the University. \r\n\r\nThe above noted developments clearly establish the resolve and commitment of the University to the long-term development and institutionalization of MIE initiatives into all aspects of the academic process. In so doing, the University expects to achieve the ultimate MIE objective of significantly increasing the number of Xavier graduates who enroll in SEM related graduate degree programs.",
