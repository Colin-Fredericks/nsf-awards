The brain contains high levels of gangliosides, natural compounds that are important constituents of the cell membranes.  However, the physiological role of gangliosides in the brain is not fully understood.  Experimental data have shown that GM1, the prototype of gangliosides found in the brain, promotes neuronal differentiation, maturation and growth.  The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the molecular mechanisms by which gangliosides influence structure and function of neurons.  The properties of GM1 demonstrate striking similarities to neurotrophic factors, especially the neurotrophins, endogenous substances that are required for an appropriate brain development and function.  This proposal main working hypothesis is that gangliosides enhance neuronal function by interacting with the neurotrophins and in particular their receptors.  Using cell lines which express each of the neurotrophin receptors, this proposal will investigate: 1) which neurotrophin receptor subtype is activated, 2) which portion of the ganglioside molecule is involved in this activation, and 3) which region of the receptor is activated by gangliosides.  This proposal will provide new discoveries in the field of ganglioside biology and brain function.\r\n",
