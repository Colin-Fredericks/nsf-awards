 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Mechanical (56)\r\nThe most important purpose of a college education is to learn how to learn. To produce better scientists and engineers these skills need to be integrated into upper level courses and interdisciplinary studies. This project is adapting collaborative, inquiry-based learning developed at the Biology Department at the University of Portland and the Department of Biology and Wildlife at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.  These techniques are being implemented in courses in Engineering Physics and in other departments on campus by allowing for exploratory and interdisciplinary experimentation using wind and water tunnels, and on a full-scale prototype crew shell. The objective is to improve learning in these courses by giving students more control in designing experimental activities. It is hoped that as a result of this experience students will have a higher degree of self-confidence and awareness of their own learning processes. Contemplation, questioning, listening, searching the literature, and team participation are used to develop the critical thinking skills that will serve students well in research and design careers.  This project involves the design of appropriate experiments using wind and water tunnels and developing an instrumented crew shell in order to reach its objective.  Project teams in the Senior Design course are developing innovations to rowing equipment and techniques. Students are involved in interdisciplinary groups to study biomechanical aspects. Collaborations with the University of Kentucky at Paducah Community College are allowing for further wind tunnel studies and project evaluation. Participation with women's crew and a \"Physics at the Lake\" program will promote careers in science and technology to women.  In addition, an experimental module is being developed by engineering and education majors which focuses on middle or secondary school audiences and is introduced in courses for education majors.",
