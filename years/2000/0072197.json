Bell\r\n\r\nProf. Bell has shown that the Bergman, Szego, and Poisson kernels\r\nassociated to a finitely connected region in the plane are\r\nelementary combinations of only three, and sometimes even two,\r\nanalytic functions of one complex variable related to geometric\r\nconstructions associated to the domain.  Bell will study deeper\r\nquestions about complexity in potential theory posed by his\r\nrecent findings and he will extend these results to finite\r\nRiemann surfaces.  Bell has also formulated a unique continuation\r\nproperty for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations that he\r\nhas shown yields information about the behavior of holomorphic\r\nmappings between domains in complex space.  He will attempt to\r\nverify the property on important classes of domains such as the\r\nstrictly pseudoconvex domains.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical objects of potential theory and conformal\r\nmapping are ubiquitous in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering.\r\nThey carry encoded within them a vast amount of information about\r\ngeometric properties of regions in the plane.  Although these\r\nobjects are familiar and well studied, they continue to be a\r\nsource of interesting and applicable new mathematics.  Professor\r\nBell will express the classical objects of potential theory\r\nassociated to a two dimensional region with holes in terms of\r\nmuch simpler analytic objects.  These results will give rise to\r\nnew and practical methods for understanding the solutions to many\r\nclassical problems in differential equations, conformal mapping,\r\nand potential theory that should be of interest to scientists and\r\nengineers.  Bell will explore applications of his ideas to more\r\ncomplicated constructions in the subject and he and his students\r\nwill test the efficacy of the numerical methods stemming from the\r\nwork.  Because humans best perceive higher dimensional objects by\r\ntaking a series of two dimensional slices, the tools developed by\r\nBell could find many applications.\r\n",
