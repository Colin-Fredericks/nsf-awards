 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research offers advancements in the accurate representation of natural hazard loads for application in structural reliability assessment. The focus is on the modeling and simulation of highly correlated non-Gaussian extreme wind loads on building components. Modeling efforts will focus on the probability content, spatial and temporal coherence, integral effects over large areas, transient, and higher-order phenomena associated with extreme wind forces in the building envelope. Robust simulation methods will adopt these models, and provide a consistent frame-work for applications in reliability analysis. This will enhance the impact of reliability methods on hazard resistant design through a more realistic treatment of severe loading. Concurrent efforts in full-scale hurricane wind measurement near ground level will provide necessary data to advance this research. The educational goals are to produce engineers prepared to design against natural hazards, and to provide a medium for graduate work in this emerging field.",
