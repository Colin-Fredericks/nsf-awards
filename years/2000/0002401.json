A concept paper has been developed for a Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE).  The workshop will be developed by a broadly represented steering committee that will 1) set the content agenda for a national workshop; 2) implement a three-day workshop attended by approximately 70 ocean science educators and researchers; and 3) prepare a Workshop Report based on discussions and input from the workshop participants. The workshop will facilitate and encourage involvement by diverse participants from a wide variety of institutions undertaking ocean science education and research.  The report will be published in an issue of Current, the quarterly journal of the National Marine Educators Association, or other appropriate journal.  \r\n\r\n",
