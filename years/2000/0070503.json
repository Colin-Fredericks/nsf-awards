 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the cooperative research project is to apply categorical \r\nmethods of modern representation theory to classification problems of \r\nlinear algebra.  Professors V.V. Sergeichuk (Ukraine) and R.A. Horn \r\n(Utah) will develop a universal method for reducing the problem of \r\nclassifying systems of forms and linear mappings to the problem of \r\nclassifying systems of linear mappings, and will apply this new method to \r\nknown canonical form problems.  They will also give miniversal \r\ndeformations of the canonical matrices that they obtain;  that is, they \r\nwill find a simplest possible normal form, to which not only a given \r\nmatrix, but also an arbitrary family of matrices close to it, can be \r\nreduced by means of an admissible transformation that depends smoothly \r\non the entries of the matrix entries.\r\n\r\nElaboration of general methods for solving classification problems of \r\nlinear algebra is of great practical importance since matrix problems \r\nunderlie most methods of modern computational mathematics.  Students in \r\nscience and engineering first meet matrix problems when they study \r\nsystems of linear equations.  An investigation of miniversal deformations \r\nof matrices is important for applications in which one has matrices that \r\narise from physical measurements, which means that their entries are \r\nknown only approximately.  Thus, one is compelled to study the structure, \r\nnot only of a given matrix, but also of all matrices close to it.",
