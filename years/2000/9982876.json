These specialized cells are organized together into veins, and the veins interconnect all parts of the plant. The transport functions of  vascular tissue are vital to plant survival, and the patterning of these tissues is believed to provide limits to plant growth.  Despite the critical functions provided by vascular tissue, almost nothing is known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms that control vein pattern.\r\n\r\nGenes that function in leaf vein pattern in Arabidopsis have already been identified by EMS-induced mutations.  Homozygous plants bearing these mutations show a variety of vein patterns defects, including vascular discontinuities, losses of veins, disorganized veins, and excess numbers of veins.\r\n\r\nFive leaf vein pattern mutants will be characterized phenotypically, genetically, and molecularly.  Phenotypic studies will reveal whether other developmental defects accompany the vein pattern defects and whether auxin mediated processes are disrupted.  Genetic studies will include characterization of double mutants to assess whether the leaf development or hormone mutants.  Molecular characterization will focus on identification of the affected genes.\r\n\r\n",
