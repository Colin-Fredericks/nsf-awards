The International Conferences on Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations have been during their five-year history an excellent platform for worldwide communication and interchange of ideas in the fields of Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations. This year, ten well-known mathematicians from six countries will give plenary lectures.  Fifteen top mathematicians have organized thirteen special sessions with more than 120 speakers. It is anticipated that more than two hundred mathematicians from more than thirty countries will participate in this conference, which also includes many contributed talks. The lectures will highlight current areas of research, and the participants will identify important problems for future investigation.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this conference is an area that has seen rapid expansion in the last two decades, partly due to the advancement of computational technology.  Differential equations provide the fundamental paradigm for mathematical models of motion, from weather phenomena and ariplane flight to the flow of blood through the human heart.  The theory of dynamical systems provides means to formulate and to understand the implications of models of such systems.  Together, the theories of dynamical systems and differential equations form the language of mathematics that is used to describe changes in the world around us.  This meeting will bring together leading established workers, junior researchers, and advanced graduate students to discuss the state of the art and to assess approaches to open problems.\r\n",
