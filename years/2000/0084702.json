IFES-2000 focuses on both the scientific and technological uses of field-emission microscopy, atom-probe microscopy, and three-dimensional atom-probe microscopy for studying a wide range of problems. The major topics covered are: (1) field emission: processes and theory; (2) new methods and instrumentation; (3) liquid metal ion sources; (4) scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy and field- ion microscopy in surface science; (5) surface science, oxidation, and nanostructures; (6) atom-probe techniques; (7) atom-probe microanalysis and materials science; and (8) vacuum microelectronics. The tentative list of invited speakers includes scientists from Japan, Germany, Jordan, Sweden, Britain, France, Belgium, and the United States. \r\n%%%\r\nThe IFES Symposia bring together scientists who utilize field emission, field-ion, atom-probe field-ion, and/or three-dimensional atom-probe field-ion microscopy for part of or all of their research efforts. The IFES Symposia is unique in that it is the only symposium that brings this eclectic group of scientists together for four days once every one to two years. The focus is on how these instruments can be used to solve a wide range of significant physical and technological problems. This symposium is important to researchers who use these experimental techniques because it is the only conference where the focus is primarily on these research tools and their applications to a\r\nwide range of physical problems.\r\n***\r\n",
