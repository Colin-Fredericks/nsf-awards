 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flow towards noncircular wells is asymmetrical; however, this asymmetrical flow is often approximated as symmetrical flow to aid in design calculations. For example, the rectangular cross section of a prefabricated vertical drain (PVD) is often converted to a circular cross section during design. Unfortunately, the impact of this conversion is not fully understood. Regardless of whether PVDs are used for soil improvement or remediation, the rectangular cross section is converted to a circle regardless of the application. Many different formulations for this conversion have been developed; yet no definitive research exists that clearly shows one formulation to be superior to the others. An experimental program is proposed to study the hypothesis that equivalent diameter formulations should be based upon equivalent flow rates instead of equipotentials. It is anticipated that the equivalent diameter well with the cross-sectional area closest to that of the PVD will yield the most similar flow rates. The results of this proposed research can be used in future research efforts of interest to this researcher and others. For example, studies on the use of PVDs to remediate soils in the vadose zone and the impact of heterogeneities on PVD remediation systems are planned. Selecting the appropriate equivalent diameter will be an important part of these studies, and will be especially important when performing mathematical modeling. In addition to being of use to researchers, engineers can use the information provided by this study when using PVDs for soil improvement and remediation.",
