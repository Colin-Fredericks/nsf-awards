 "awd_abstract_narration": "Legumes, such as clover, alfalfa, and soybean, are important in agriculture\r\nand in nature.  Soil bacteria known as rhizobia can benefit legumes when\r\nthey infect their roots, because they can take up atmospheric nitrogen and\r\nsupply it to the plant.  This extra nitrogen increases plant\r\nphotosynthesis, thereby indirectly increasing the energy supply to the\r\nrhizobia.  Thus, symbiosis between legume and rhizobium seems beneficial to\r\nboth.  But what if, as often happens, two or more different strains of\r\nrhizobia infect the same plant?  An initially rare strain that uses plant\r\nresources for its own reproduction, rather than for nitrogen fixation,\r\ncould increase in numbers at the expense of both the plant and the more\r\ncooperative rhizobial strain.  Although most rhizobia seem to be\r\npredominantly beneficial, such \"parasitic\" strains do exist.\r\n\r\nThis research will determine whether plant responses to rhizobia that fail\r\nto fix nitrogen can select for more beneficial rhizobia.  Previous research\r\nshows that legumes can control the oxygen supply to rhizobia inside their\r\nroot nodules.  The PIs will determine how this oxygen supply changes with\r\nchanges in nitrogen fixation by rhizobia, and how this legume response\r\naffects the survival and reproduction of the rhizobia.  Most of the\r\nresearch will be conducted under controlled laboratory conditions, but a\r\nfield test will determine whether legumes alter the frequency of\r\ncooperative vs. parasitic rhizobia in soil.  In addition to possible\r\npractical applications in agriculture, the research will contribute to\r\noverall understanding of the general problem of cooperation between\r\nspecies.  Such cooperation is critical to the pollination of flowers, the\r\nsurvival and growth of coral reefs, plant growth in phosphorus-poor soils,\r\nand many other natural systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
