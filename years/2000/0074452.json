 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDr. Sarah M. Boomer at Western Oregon University is establishing a \"Red Layer\" Microbial  Observatory (RLMO) in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.  This  observatory will enable undergraduate students to study several similar bacterial communities  (\"mats\") that thrive in alkaline hot springs.  All mats in this observatory contain an unusual red layer of yet-unidentified bacteria, usually beneath top layers of known green bacteria  (Cyanobacteria).  Preliminary data has demonstrated that some  of these red bacteria are unique but related to a known genus of ancient bacteria called Heliothrix.   A dozen distinct red layer mats have been identified to date.  A key goal of this research is to survey additional regions of Yellowstone during an extensive  summer undergraduate research program established by this grant.   While in the park, research teams will survey and  document new RLMO habitats using a variety of technologies  (global positioning systems, pH and temperature measuring  devices and digital cameras).  In the laboratory following these trips, undergraduates will use microscopy, biochemical analysis of red  pigments, and DNA sequence information to further characterize  these novel bacteria.   RLMO materials will also be used as the backbone project in Dr. Boomer's research-based  undergraduate course, Molecular Biology.   In both contexts,  undergraduates will isolate a specific identification gene (16S ribosomal RNA gene) from various bacterial samples, and determine the DNA sequences of  these genes using an automated DNA sequencer acquired through prior NSF  support.  Using computer programs and internet-based databases, students will use sequence information to infer how  red layer bacteria compare from site to site within the RLMO  and how they compare with other known bacteria.  Original  sequence data will also provide raw data for a new  undergraduate course in computational biology.  Many biology  majors at Western Oregon University are bound for careers  teaching science; thus, research students specifically interested  in education will have methods, materials, and credit-based opportunities to develop and deliver education outreach modules  and web-distributed curricula as part of this Yellowstone  RLMO.  \r\n",
