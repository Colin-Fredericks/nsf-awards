 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clark Atlanta University (CAU) is establishing a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) Program for students pursuing degree programs in computer science, engineering and mathematics. Since its inception, Clark Atlanta University has been vitally concerned with ameliorating the acute underrepresentation of African Americans and other minorities in technical fields such as science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET). Over the past ten years, the University has made a significant, positive impact on this important issue through implementation of a variety of research initiatives and educational programs. Clark Atlanta University has set a goal to play a major role in reversing the decline in African American and minority enrollment in undergraduate and graduate SMET programs. Over the past ten years, an undergraduate program in general engineering was added to the SEM curriculum and the Department of Computer and Information Sciences was spun off from the Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, creating six undergraduate majors in physical sciences, mathematics, computer science, and engineering. Each of these departments has been successful in securing major multi-year funding from the private and public sectors that has resulted in the creation of six research centers and institutes. \r\n\r\nThe University's goals and outcomes for SMET education by the year 2004 are as follows: \r\n\r\nIncrease the total enrollment of SMET students from 930 to 1500;\r\nIncrease the retention rate of SMET freshman students to 80%;\r\nIncrease the annual SMET graduation rate from 100 to 250; \r\nIncrease the percentage of SMET students entering research institutions for advanced degrees by 60%; and\r\nIncrease the number of SMET students who successfully bridge the transition from high school/undergraduate, undergraduate/graduate and graduate/job market by 15% per year.\r\n \r\nThis project will assist the University in achieving these goals by significantly increasing the number of scholarship opportunities available to undergraduate SEM students. Additionally, the grant award will act as a catalyst to reinforce other SMET curricula enhancement programs at the University.",
