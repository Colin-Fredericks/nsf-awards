 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r Undergraduate students in the physical and life sciences and engineering are participating in courses that have been modified to take advantage of INVSEE (Interactive Nano-Visualization in Science and Engineering Education), developed at Arizona State University. INVSEE allows users to have remote access to research-grade scanning probe microscopes in a cost-effective way. This technology is being used as the basis for a novel project in which faculty in 5 other institutions are adapting and implementing web-based modules to incorporate INVSEE over the web into their courses. Participating institutions are Cornell University, the University of Wisconsin, and 3 community colleges: Arizona Western College, Glendale College, and Mesa College. ARRIVE is helping faculty and students to realize the full potential of INVSEE through adaptations that had not been envisioned earlier, in settings different from those proposed during the INVSEE project. INVSEE created an interactive web site and a consortium of university and industry scientists, community college and high school science faculty, and museum educators to develop a new dimension in science and engineering education that allows the remote operation of advanced microscopes and nanofabrication tools coupled to powerful surface characterization methods. This educational product can be accessed by any classroom that is linked the web. ARRIVE is assisting teachers and faculty to adapt and implement this technology in local courses through the development of interactive educational modules. ARRIVE is also assisting faculty and students to incorporate INVSEE into undergraduate research projects. ARRIVE is intended to serve as a national model that demonstrates how the integration of technology and research instrumentation can be coupled asynchronously to undergraduate education to support student participation and thereby improved knowledge of research grade equipment. \r\n",
