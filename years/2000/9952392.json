 "awd_abstract_narration": "nterdisciplinary (99)\r\nThis project is adapting and implementing visualization techniques and computational methods to enhance the undergraduate natural science and mathematics curriculum. The computation and visualization laboratory (CVL) is being constructed and used to incorporate inquiry-based classroom modules and laboratory experiments into existing courses in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics.  Computational methods are the common thread that runs through the curriculum of each department.  In addition, two new courses in computational techniques and bioinformatics are being developed, addressing the increasing use of advanced computational methods in the physical and life sciences. \r\n\r\nComputer visualization techniques are capable of enhancing student understanding of abstract concepts in both introductory and advanced coursework.  This project is first concentrating on adapting these methods into introductory courses, where the greatest number of non-science majors and future elementary and secondary school teachers are being educated.  The following course areas are being modified with the listed software tools: \r\n o  In general chemistry:  \"Periodic Table Live,\" and \"Spartan.\"\r\n o  In organic chemistry:  \"Spartan.\"\r\n o  In introductory biology:  \"Genetics Computer Group Wisconsin Package.\"\r\n o  In introductory physics: \"Physlets,\" \"EM Field,\" and \"Electronics \r\n            Workbench.\"\r\n o  In introductory astronomy: \"Hands-On Universe\" and \"Megastar.\"\r\n o  In introductory calculus:  \"Mathematica.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the later stages of this project, these tools will also be incorporated into more advanced undergraduate courses, such as physical chemistry and differential equations, and also will adapt additional software tools:\r\n o  In physics:  \"CUPS\" and \"Mathematica.\"\r\n o  In biology:  \"Rasmol,\" \"CN3D,\" \"Alchemy 2000,\" and \"SciProtein Module.\"\r\n o  In biochemistry:  \"SciProtein Module.\"\r\n\r\nThe laboratory is being shared by high school teachers and students in the Kenosha Unified School District (KUSD) as part of a project in which Carthage College faculty and students work with KUSD to implement a new four-year math/science curriculum. \r\n\r\nMultiple qualitative and quantitative methods are being used to assess student learning outcomes at the high school and undergraduate levels. Implementation effectiveness for high school teachers are also being assessed. Finally, results are being disseminated through divisional poster sessions and Web-based publications.\r\n\r\n",
