 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe PI intends to pursue and amplify his investigations of the\r\nrelationships between spectral and fractal geometry.  We plan to study the\r\nvibrations of \"fractal drums\", both \"drums with fractal boundary\"\r\n(Laplacians on open sets with very irregular boundary) and \"drums with\r\nfractal membrane\" (Laplacians on fractals themselves).  The proposed\r\nproblems are closely connected to Kac's question \"Can one hear the shape of\r\na drum?\" and to its beautiful extensions from the \"smooth\" to the \"fractal\"\r\ndomain by the physicist Michael Berry.  Although the proposed theory is\r\nmathematically rigorous, it is also naturally physically motivated (with,\r\nfor example, applications to the scattering of waves by fractal surfaces\r\nand the study of porous media), and has recently drawn some of its impetus\r\nfrom the use of computer graphics.  Moreover, we propose to use and extend\r\nthe theory of \"complex dimensions\" of \"fractal strings\" (one-dimensional\r\ndrums with fractal boundary)-recently developed extensively by the PI and\r\nMachiel van Frankenhuysen in the research monograph [La-vF2] on \"Fractal\r\nGeometry and Number Theory\" and motivated in part by the PI's earlier joint \r\nwork with Carl Pomerance [LaPo] and Helmut Maier [LaMa] on (direct and)\r\ninverse spectral problems for fractal strings and the Riemann hypothesis-in\r\norder to study the fascinating oscillatory phenomena occurring in the\r\ngeometry and in the spectrum of \"drums with fractal boundary\" and of \"drums\r\nwith fractal membrane\".  (\"Complex dimensions\" are defined as the poles of\r\na suitable geometric zeta function.  Further, in [La-vF], a detailed study\r\nof their structure is given, for example, in the case of self-similar fractal strings.)\r\n\r\nWe plan to further develop analysis and spectral theory on fractals and on\r\nregions with fractal boundary, as well as to investigate problems of a\r\n'dynamical nature', of physical significance in condensed matter and solid\r\nstate physics; for example, in the study of mechanical or electrical\r\ntransport in porous or in random media, as well as of heat diffusions on\r\nfractals and in disordered systems.  We also intend to pursue our\r\nmathematical and computer graphics-aided study ([LaPa], [LaNRG]) of partial\r\ndifferential equations (PDEs)-such as the Laplace, heat and (linear or\r\nnonlinear) wave equations-on regions with fractal boundary or on fractals\r\nthemselves.  According to appealing experiments and interpretations by the\r\nphysicist Bernard Sapoval, this work may help understand the formation of\r\nfractal structures (for example, coastlines, trees and blood vessels) in\r\nnature.  In the long term, it is hoped that the tools and results developed\r\nin this project (and in the PI's earlier investigations) will help us to\r\nprobe more deeply than has been so far possible the fine geometric\r\nstructure of fractals and of related 'objects' occurring in mathematics\r\nand in physics.\r\n\r\n",
