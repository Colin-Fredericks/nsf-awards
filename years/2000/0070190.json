 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the most abstract concepts of theoretical physics to the\r\ncryptosystems used by millions of people every day (often without realizing it) , \r\nalgebraic geometry and number\r\ntheory have a genuine and vital presence in twenty-first century life.  \r\nThis proposal seeks to develop tools of algebraic geometry with a view\r\ntoward number theoretic applications.  Of central importance is the \r\nproblem of finding rational or whole number solutions to polynomial\r\nequations, the most famous example of which is Fermat's Last Theorem\r\nrecently established by Wiles.   The new geometric techniques developed under this \r\nproposal will be applied to limit the number of rational solutions of a more general\r\npolynomial equation.\r\n\r\nMany situations in diophantine approximation produce a linear series on a\r\nsmooth projective variety.   Often there are arguments employing vanishing theorems and intersection theory that force the series to move, showing the base locus to be empty.  On the other hand, varous hypothetical assumptions-for example, assuming that there are infinitely many rational points on a curve of genus at least two, or assuming that there are good rational approximations of an algebraic irrational number-- \r\nforce the linear series in question to have a non-empty base locus.  The resulting contradiction \r\nshows the hypothetical assumption to be false.  This line or reasoning has been used to \r\nestablish Mordell's conjecture and Roth's theorem respectively, and\r\nwill be applied in this project to study higher dimensional problems, such as the\r\nSchmidt subspace theorem and Faltings' theorem on rational points of\r\nsubvarieties of abelian varieties, with a long term goal of extending and\r\nor strengthening these theorems.  The key algebro-geometric background\r\nrequired in these arguments is a detailed study of numerical properties of\r\nthe base locus of a linear series.  In particular, a key question is\r\nwhether or not Seshadri constants control the existence of global sections\r\nof a line bundle even when the bundle is not positive.",
