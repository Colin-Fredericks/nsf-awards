 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: DMS-0072853\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nThe investigators propose to explore 3-dimensional topology via\r\ncontact structures, based on new techniques in the classification\r\nof tight contact structures on various 3-dimensional manifolds.  Our\r\nmain goal is to develop the 3-dimensional cut-and-paste techniques\r\ninvolving convex surfaces and ``bypasses\" into a largely\r\ncombinatorial one. The investigators propose to import ideas and\r\nconstructions from the theory of foliations and laminations (in\r\njoint work with J. Etnyre and W. Kazez). Convex surfaces and\r\nbypasses aid the decomposition of a tight contact manifold\r\n(eventually) into balls, similar to the `` sutured manifold\r\ndecomposition\", due to Gabai.  The ``dividing curves on the\r\nsurfaces along which the cuttings take place determine the tight\r\ncontact structure.  A project which is currently under way is to\r\ncarefully follow the sutured manifold decompositions of Gabai in\r\nconstructing taut foliations on most 3-manifolds, and to construct\r\ntight contact structures by gluing in much the same way as Gabai's\r\nconstruction.  We hope to produce an effective gluing theorem for\r\ntight contact structures.  Another direction of research is\r\nLegendrian knot theory. Using the classification of tight contact\r\nstructures on solid tori, Etnyre and Honda propose to classify\r\nLegendrian torus knots and Legendrian figure eight knots. \r\n\r\nThe investigators propose a study of 3-dimensional spaces.  The\r\n3-dimensional spaces we study will locally be similar to the\r\nstandard Euclidean 3-dimensional space.  These objects may be very\r\ncomplicated globally, but a local observer cannot tell the\r\ndifference, just as an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a\r\nflat plane or a very large sphere.  `Finite' 2-dimensional spaces\r\nhave been classified and understood for a long time - they are the\r\n2-dimensional sphere, the doughnut, the doughnut with 2 holes, the doughnut\r\nwith 3 holes, etc., and are distinguished by the number of holes. \r\nHowever, in spite of work by numerous mathematicians this century,\r\na complete classification of 3-dimensional spaces is far from\r\nunderstood.  In our work we seek to better understand 3-dimensional\r\nspaces by imposing an additional structure, called a contact\r\nstructure, which, very loosely speaking, amounts to choosing a\r\npreferred direction (or a spinning axis) at every point in the\r\n3-dimensional space.  Contact structures have intimate connections\r\nwith 4-dimensional geometry, quantum physics, and dynamics (such as\r\nfluid dynamics), and we hope to gain better understanding of\r\n3-dimensional spaces through contact structures. \r\n",
