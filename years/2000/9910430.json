 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charles Parmenter of Indiana University is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform experiments on vibrational and rotational energy transfer from large polyatomic molecules to atoms and diatomic molecules in the gas phase.  Laser pumping will be used to produce the internal excitation with state to state resolution while dispersed fluorescence will follow the important energy transfer channels.  The systems to be studied are: (1) collisions of laser aligned glyoxal and deuterated formaldehyde with hydrogen, helium and deuterium to investigate the effects of orientation; and (2) collisional activation/deactivation by gases such as argon of large molecules (p-difluorobenzene is a prime example) where there is enough internal energy for dissociation and isomerization to occur.  This latter study involves the determination of absolute reaction cross sections for highly excited molecules which has not previously been possible.\r\n\r\nThe proposed studies will have a major impact on our understanding of how energy is transferred from large molecules to other atoms and smaller molecules, especially the conversion of internal energy into energy of motion.  These sophisticated and very fundamental studies will determine the efficiency of the processes and how the energy transfer process is influenced by orientation.  They have relevance to highly excited species associated with atmospheric chemistry.\r\n",
