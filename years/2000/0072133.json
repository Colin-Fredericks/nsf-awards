The principal investigators, Professors R.L. Cohen, S.P. Kerckhoff, and R.J. Milgram are senior topologists whose research interests cover a large\r\nnumber of areas of topology and related fields.     The postdoctoral  researchers on this grant also represent a broad range of research interests.  J. Brock works in low dimensional topology and dynamics, and C. Schlictkrull works in homotopy theory and algebraic  K-theory.  Included in these projects are the study of core topological questions\r\nsuch as the study of 3 - dimensional geometry, the study of the topology of complex and related structures on manifolds, and topological invariants of finite groups.  In addition it includes applications of topological methods to engineering questions in the field of Robotics.\r\n\r\nThe topology of 3-dimensional manifolds is intimately connected to differential geometry, particularly to homogeneous structures like Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry.  Of these, hyperbolic geometry is the most prevalent.  On a closed 3-manifold a hyperbolic structure, if it exists, is unique by the Mostow Rigidity Theorem.  Thus, any geometric invariant is a topological invariant and can be used to distinguish different 3-manifolds.  When the 3-manifold has boundary, it can have a large parameter space of hyperbolic structures; in this case, the qualitative properties of the structures as one varies over the parameter space are of particular interest.   Kerckhoff and Brock are studying hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds, trying to describe the behavior of these geometric structures under a topological procedure, called Dehn surgery.  For manifolds with boundary, \r\nthey are also trying to understand the limiting behavior of the structures as one moves to the limits of the parameter space.  R.L. Cohen is pursuing several projects that involve studying algebraic topological aspects  of questons stemming from geometry.    \r\nThese projects lie under the following general headings.   \r\n1. The topology of moduli spaces of holomorphic curves in complex and symplectic manifolds.  2. The homotopy type of the stable mapping class group and the Mumford Conjecture.  3. Properties and applications of  holomorphic K-theory.   C. Schlichtkrull's project involves studying the topology of the stable diffeomorphism groups   Diff(X),  when X is either a point or the circle.  To do this he  will use techniques from Algebraic K -\r\ntheory and homotopy theory.  R.J. Milgram will pursue questions involving the\r\ncohomology of finite simple groups, as well as applications of the topology of configuration spaces to questions in the design and behavior of robotic arms. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
