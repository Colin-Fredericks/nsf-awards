 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r Configuration Management (CM) is the discipline of identifying the components of a continuously evolving system (taking into account relevant system interfaces) for the purpose of controlling changes to these components and maintaining integrity and traceability throughout the system life cycle. The importance of CM has been well-documented in the defense and aerospace industries and is now gaining attention in general manufacturing firms.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing innovative, high-quality CM educational materials that incorporate effective educational practices to improve student learning in engineering and management. At its completion the project will have developed a CM Overview Module and an accompanying Teacher's Guide for use as part of regularly scheduled courses in engineering and business curricula. The CM Overview Module will provide 1-2 weeks of undergraduate college-level coursework covering the importance of CM, the need for CM, components of CM, and CM case studies. The module educational materials will be made available to interested individuals in print form (word-processing files), through the World Wide Web, and possibly as a CD-ROM (supplied at production cost).\r\n\r\nThe CM Overview Module and Teacher's Guide are being developed, tested, and assessed by engineering and management faculty and students at Clemson University. The PI team is also engaged in efforts to promote the effective implementation of these materials in institutions across the United States. By way of its dissemination efforts, the project team will work to make available and encourage the use of the CM educational materials by engineering and management colleagues across the nation.\r\n",
