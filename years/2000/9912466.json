The Blue Fin is a 72 ft. vessel, constructed in 1972 and refitted in 1976, and owned and operated by Board of Regents University System of Georgia.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 91 operational days during 2000, of which 53 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support Navy, NOAA, and NASA projects.  The projects scheduled on the Blue Fin primarily support research programs in biological, physical and chemical oceanography on the US Southeast Continental Shelf, sounds, and estuaries between Capes Hatteras and Canaveral.\r\n\r\nThe Blue fin is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
