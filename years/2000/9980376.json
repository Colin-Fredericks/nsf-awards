The traditional view is that East Gondwana, consisting\r\nof India, Australia and Antarctica collided with the combined African\r\ncratons (Kalahari and Congo) as one block sometime during the late\r\nNeoproterozoic. An alternative model suggests that the accretion of East\r\nGondwana to the African craton was a two part process. In this model, India\r\nbroke off from Australia and Antarctic, swept across the Mozambique Ocean,\r\nand collided with the African craton at approximately 680 Ma. This was\r\npurportedly followed sometime later by collision of Australia/Antarctica\r\naround 550 to 530 Ma. Our study of the Tethyan Himalaya will test tectonic\r\nmodels of the assembly of core Gondwanaland using a combined stratigraphic,\r\nmacrofaunal and sedimentological approach. Of primary importance is the\r\nstratigraphic signature of sediment input from adjacent orogenic belts. A\r\nrecord of major increases of siliclastic sediment, with abrupt changes in\r\npaleocurrents would accompany orogenesis. A key component of the proposed\r\nmodels is that they have predictable patterns of detrital zircon ages. A\r\nLate Cambrian-Early Ordovician tectonic event is recorded in the Tethyan\r\nHimalaya and in other places in East Gondwanaland. The nature of this event\r\nis unclear, but two possibilities include: (1) it represents a somewhat\r\ndelayed expression of the Australia/Antarctica collision in the two-stage\r\nmodel, or (2) it represents the docking of an outboard microcontinent\r\n(e.g., the Lhasa Block of Tibet) subsequent to the formation of core\r\nGondwanaland. The biostratigraphic patterns of trilobites provide the basis\r\nof testable predictions of these hypotheses. In the first case, we expect\r\nto find a stratigraphic increase in similarity in faunas between India and\r\nthe rest of East Antarctica throughout the Cambrian. If faunal similarity\r\nwith the rest of East Gondwana was constant throughout the\r\ntrilobite-bearing Cambrian, we may infer that Gondwanan construction was\r\ncomplete prior to 520 Ma. In addition, if the ~500 Ma tectonic event in the\r\nTethyan Himalaya records microcontinental collision, then the\r\nidentification of the outboard terrane may be approached through\r\nbiogeographic patterns established in this study. Myrow's RUI proposal will\r\ninvolve undergraduates at Colorado College as junior collaborators in all\r\ncomponents of the research. This will provide a much-needed opportunity for\r\nstudents to experience scientific research in diverse geographical and\r\ncultural environments. A key aspect of this proposal is the close research\r\ncollaboration with Indian and Chinese scientists.\r\n\r\n",
