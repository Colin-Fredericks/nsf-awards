 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on diving physiology of aquatic birds and mammals began as early as the mid-1800's, but major advances in the field were not made until the late 1930's and early 1940's. Since that time, there has been an intense interest in the field, with studies focused on the physiology, biochemistry, behavior and ecology of this group of organisms. Most of the research has focused on seabirds and marine mammals, while fewer studies have been conducted on turtles, crocodiles and sea snakes. Gerald Kooyman has been a pioneer in developing techniques to study diving animals in the wild. His studies of the physiological adaptation and biochemical mechanisms of diving in Antarctic penguins and seals resulted in landmark papers. This symposium in his honor will bring together a distinguished group of international scientists to discuss to their work in the fields of physiology, behavior, ecology, biochemistry, and conservation. Topics to be discussed include be the diving physiology of dolphins, the feeding ecology of baleen whales, the diving behavior of leatherback sea turtles, the behavior of sea lions, the ecological energetics of fur seals and the biomedical significance and application of diving ecology. The symposium's schedule will provide time for interactions between the speakers and students. Papers presented at the symposium will be made available to the scientific community through publication in the journal Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology.",
