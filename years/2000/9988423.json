Polychronopoulos\r\nUniversity of Illinois\r\n\r\nCISE Next Generation Software:  Workshop on Active Services\r\n\r\nThe dramatic increase of internet-based applications and the proliferation of networking technologies has been transforming most areas of computer science and engineering as well as computational science and commercial application areas.  We feel strongly that this provides an outstanding opportunity to explore new, internet-oriented software technologies that will open new research and application opportunities for a range of constituencies, from the high-performance computing to the commercial multimedia and end-user communities.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we propose the organization of an NSF-sponsored workshop on Active Services in conjunction with the 1999 Grids Forum Workshop to be held at Northwestern University.  By \"Active Services\" we mean a new software paradigm which will support the operating environment, network support, control and communication protocols, development and application environments for intelligent software agents which we refer to as software scouts.  Scouts could be used for a variety of new scientific applications, intelligent network and systems software, and end-user applications.\r\n\r\nWe would like to request NSF sponsorship of the proposed workshop which will facilitate the participation of 30-35 of the most active and accomplished researchers in related areas.  The workshop will be open to the entire community.  However, we rely primarily on the participation and contribution of the most active researchers in relevant fields and as such it will be an invitation-based workshop.  We have already contacted several of the proposed participants who have already agreed to participate in the discussions and also contribute short presentations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
