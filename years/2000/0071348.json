The Point Sur is a 135 ft. vessel, constructed in 1981, and owned by NSF and operated by MLML.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 162 operational days during 2000, of which 65 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support Navy, USCOE, NOPP, and other Federal and private projects.  The projects scheduled on the Point Sur represent several oceanographic disciplines, including physical and biological oceanography, geology, ichthyology, benthic ecology and marine mammal behavior, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel. The vessel will be used for a variety of projects such as maintaining moored arrays, providing a platform for instructional training and curriculum support, and supporting collaborative interagency research. Operations will take place regionally around Moss Landing.\r\n\r\nThe Point Sur is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
