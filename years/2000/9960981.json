 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to perfect a method using\r\npeptide aptamers expressed in plants that appears to work to control certain bacterial\r\nplant pathogens in the genus Xanthomonas. The aptamers block function of critical\r\npathogenicity (Pth) proteins that are literally injected by the pathogens into plant\r\ncells. The objectives are to 1) select better aptamers for capacity to block disease\r\ndevelopment by screening for binding to predicted critical regions on the Pth protein and\r\n2) create transgenic citrus plants that express the aptamers for later testing for\r\nresistance to citrus canker disease. Phase II funding will be sought to produce and test\r\ntransgenic rice and common bean plants genetically engineered to produce the aptamers.\r\nThree diseases of economic importance to the U.S. are likely to be controlled by this\r\nnovel genetic mechanism: citrus canker, common bean blight and rice blight. There are no\r\ncures, no stable genetic resistance, nor even satisfactory controls for these diseases.\r\nThe citrus industry and state regulators consider canker control methods to be a top\r\npriority. Localized losses of citrus, bean and rice due to these three diseases can be up\r\nto 50%, 20% and 100%, respectively. Applications to other diseases are likely by this new\r\ngene engineering technology.\r\n",
