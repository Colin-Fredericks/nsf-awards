 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from IDZAP, LLC seeks to investigate technologies for anonymous bi-directional communication, and explore the feasibility of using such technology in Internet applications.  A major problem in using the Internet resides in the protection of privacy of individuals.  Just about every activity that people perform (such as web browsing, news posting and email) is logged.  Commercial organizations frequently analyze the log to extract information to build profiles of users. Often this information is sold to third party marketers.  IDZAP is in the business of providing anonymous web services to protect privacy.  Anonymous web browsing and email services exist today.  However, there is still no practical way to provide bi-directional anonymous Internet services.  For example, one who sends an anonymous email to the consultant of a medical web site will want to hear back from that consultant. The problem is that the user may not want the consultant to know his/her identity.  There are many similar problems that require solutions that are not available today.  The proposed research on bi-directional anonymous communication will provide a basis for the solution to this type of problems.\r\n\r\nBased on the importance of internet privacy as reported in the mainstream media as well as on the feedback that IDZAP receives in the course of providing anonymous and secure web access services (i.e., anonymous one-directional communication) through its web browsing service, there is significant overall commercial potential for anonymous query and response communications.\r\n",
