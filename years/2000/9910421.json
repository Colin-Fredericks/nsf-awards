 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Elizabeth Stone and her\r\ncolleagues will conduct archaeological research in the settlement area\r\nsurrounding the Urartian fortress of Ayanis, located on the shore of Lake\r\nVan in Eastern Turkey.  Occupied for only a single generation around 650\r\nB.C., this city covers at least 80 ha.  Prior work on the citadel has\r\nrevealed extensive fortifications, large scale storage facilities and a\r\npillared hall/temple complex, of the kind associated with the\r\nadministrative elite at other Urartian centers.  Ayanis is the only\r\nUrartian site that currently offers an opportunity to investigate the\r\ngoverned as well as the rulers, and an investigation of the outer town,\r\nthrough mapping, shovel test survey, magnetometry and selected excavation,\r\ncommenced in 1997.  With NSF support Dr. Stone's team will extend and\r\nrefine its study of the relationship between the denizens of the fortress\r\nand those of the outer town.  Shovel testing will define the limits of the\r\nsettlement and extended magnetic field gradient survey will reveal\r\nsubsurface architectural patterning over a substantial portion.\r\nExcavations will be conducted in areas within the outer town that exhibit\r\ndifferential patterning in the magnetometry.  Analysis will focus primarily\r\non high status materials such as red polished ceramics and bronzes that may\r\nindicate interactions between the central government and the larger\r\npopulation, and on economic reconstruction.  Specific methods to be\r\nemployed include: ceramic petrography; radography of ceramics to determine\r\nwhether they were wheel-made or hand-made; neutron activation analyses of\r\nceramics and bronzes to determine chemical composition; analysis of faunal\r\nremains; phytolith analysis; micromorphological analysis; statistical and\r\nspatial analyses of domestic artifact assemblages; the use of GIS to\r\nexamine the spatial distribution of activities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to determine whether the principles used by\r\nmodern city planners can be modified to help identify key organizational\r\ndistinctions in ancient cities and states.  The variable distribution of\r\npeople and institutions within the urban framework may be understood to\r\nreflect fundamental differences in the structure of ancient societies,\r\nbetween hierarchically organized territorial states and more\r\nheterarchically organized city states, but as yet too little work has been\r\nconducted on urban organization in different archaic states  to be certain\r\nof this.  The data generated by this project will make clear the\r\norganization of an urban center in an archetypical territorial state.  This\r\nresearch is important for several reasons.  It will provide data of\r\ninterest to many archaeologists and students of urbanism on urban planning\r\nand its relationship to social organizationm, and a paradigm of the\r\nmaterial imprint of a state that is known to be highly centralized.  It\r\nwill foster Turkish-American academic cooperation, and its results should\r\nhelp in the understanding of early complex societies that were either not\r\nliterate, or whose writing has yet to be deciphered.\r\n",
