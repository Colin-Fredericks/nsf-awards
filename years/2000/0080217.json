 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for senior and junior researchers to participate in a conference on the role of values in science.  The conference goal is to promote systematic new research on the different kinds of values that are involved in science, on how and where values are involved, and on the consequences that involvement has for science and its interpretation.  More specifically, the conference seeks to bring together historical and social science work with research in the traditional analytic philosophy of science and to promote discussion of the place of values in the second tradition.  Over thirty people have agreed to participate as speakers and session moderators; they include experts in history and philosophy of science, social studies of science, economics, cognitive neuroscience, psychology and biology.  Submitted papers will be solicited, and interaction promoted through a webpage and email discussion list.  The webpage will continue after the conference, and organizers will seek to publish a volume of papers.",
