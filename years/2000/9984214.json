 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports the development of process simulations and the application of these simulations to planning and optimization of CNC manufacturing processes. A new thrust area in process planning for\r\nelectrical discharge machining (EDM) is proposed, to compliment ongoing efforts in simulation and planning of traditional machining processes. A discrete graphical representation will be used at selective resolution\r\nlevels to provide efficient geometric querying ability. Image processing transformations will be exploited to aid in electrode selection and accessibility concerns. The geometric simulation is to be coupled with a\r\nphysical process simulation for optimization of instantaneous process parameters. The educational component of this project comprises efforts at both the undergraduate and graduate level to effectively integrate\r\nfundamental process knowledge and analysis with the background necessary to develop and utilize computer-aided simulation tools to support planning decisions. These simulations will be made accessible to students in manufacturing coursework at all levels to facilitate discovery-oriented learning.\r\n\r\nNumerical simulations are often the only viable means for dealing with the geometric complexities inherent in practical manufacturing problems.  Process planning stands to benefit greatly by capitalizing on the enhanced predictive capabilities afforded by numerical simulation. In the domain of EDM, it is anticipated that a systematic simulation-based approach to process planning is an important step towards fully exploiting the\r\nflexibility and reducing the costs of this under utilized technology.   An educated ability to map design attributes and cost constraints into process selection decisions is as invaluable an asset to the designer as it\r\nis to the manufacturing engineer. It is believed that an increased emphasis on process planning within the manufacturing coursework, and the accessibility of simulation tools to facilitate learning will contribute substantively to the educational curriculum in manufacturing.",
