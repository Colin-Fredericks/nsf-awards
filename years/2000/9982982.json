 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enormous quantities of wood and other woody plant materials\r\n(including leaves, bark, shoots, stems and nuts) are produced annually in\r\nthe environment.  In fact, cellulose, the major component of woody\r\nmaterials, is thought to be the most abundant biological material on earth.\r\nThis remarkably strong and enduring molecule is a polymer of glucose\r\n(sugar) linked by a type of chemical bond that makes it indigestible to\r\nmost living organisms.  Therefore, this rich source of food energy is\r\navailable to only a few animals (e.g., termites and ruminants) that can\r\ndigest cellulose with the aid of microbes living in their guts.\r\n\tSurprisingly, some marine animals can also digest wood.  The most\r\nimportant group is the wood-boring clams, commonly known as shipworms.  Unlike\r\ntermites and ruminants, these animals lack microorganisms in their gut.\r\nInstead they harbor enormous numbers of symbiotic bacteria inside the cells\r\nof their gills.  These bacteria fall into at least four closely related\r\nfamilies based on DNA analyses.  The PIs have proposed that these bacteria\r\nproduce cellulolytic enzymes that are transported from the gills to the\r\ngut.\r\n\tThe purpose of this investigation is to explore the diversity and\r\ndistribution of symbiont types in the shipworm gills, to determine if each\r\nsymbiont type contributes different cellulolytic enzymes, and to discover\r\nhow the host uses these bacterial products to exploit cellulose as a food\r\nsource.  These investigations should result in the discovery of new\r\ncellulolytic enzymes that may have industrial applications in such areas as\r\npaper and textile processing and fuel (ethanol) production via biomass\r\nconversion of agricultural wastes.  These efforts will also help the PIs to\r\nunderstand the physiology of symbiotic bacterial infections that are\r\nbeneficial rather than harmful to their hosts.",
