 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators study asymptotic and algorithmic properties of groups. The area of research includes Dehn functions and relative Dehn functions of groups, the complexity of algorithmic problems of groups, Burnside problems for groups.  Many papers published during the last forty years showed deep connection between asymptotic invariants of groups and topology, geometry, amenability, dynamical systems, etc.  Quite\r\nrecently, the proposers (jointly with Rips and Birget) discovered a close\r\nrelationship between the asymptotics of isoperimetric functions, on the one\r\nhand, and the complexity of the word problem for groups, on the other hand.\r\nThe investigators are developing their method, combining geometric and\r\ncomputational approaches. One of their goals is to obtain the solution\r\nof other algorithmic problems using geometric group theory. In particular\r\nthe investigators believe they will be able to prove that every recursively presented\r\nfinitely generated group can be embedded into a finitely presented group\r\nwith the same degree of unsolvability of the conjugacy problem. This would\r\nsolve a problem formulated by Collins in 1976.\r\nThe computational-geometric methods of the investigators also show promise of being able to be fruitfully applied to the  Burnside-type  problems.\r\nThe investigators are close to constructing non-amenable finitely presented\r\ngroups having no non-cyclic free subgroups. This will solve the\r\ncorresponding well-known problem which goes back to von Neumann's 1929\r\npaper. Since the group in question is a finitely presented extension of a\r\ntorsion group of finite exponent by a cyclic group, this example will be\r\na breakthrough in the search for a finitely presented torsion\r\ngroup (one of the main open problem in the theory of infinite groups).\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is a well known point of view after Klein, Hilbert, Einstein and Weil\r\nthat fundamental laws describe symmetries occurring in the nature. The\r\nsymmetry of an object can be measured by the group corresponding to the\r\nobject. Groups can be defined as groups of symmetries or abstractly by an\r\nalgorithmic description (generators and relations). In the second approach,\r\nthe investigators choose some basic symmetries (generators) so that all other symmetries\r\nare compositions (words) of the basic symmetries, and describe certain\r\nrelations between the basic symmetries such that all other relations follow\r\nfrom the chosen relations. One of the main problems about a group given by\r\ngenerators and relations and relations is the word problem: when are two\r\ncompositions of generators the same?  In some exotic cases this problem can\r\nbe undecidable, that is there are groups for which there are no automatic\r\nprocedures to recognize if two words of generators are equal. but even\r\nin cases when this problem is decidable, the automatic procedure can be very\r\ncomplicated.  In recent years the investigators discovered a deep\r\nrelationship between the word problem of a group and the global geometry of\r\nthe group. The geometry of a group is described in terms of certain\r\nasymptotic invariants. The invariants have been known since the pioneering\r\nworks of M. Dehn at the beginning of the 20th century but the investigators\r\ndiscovered deep relationship between these invariants and algorithmic\r\nproblems. The investigators are developing their geometric method solving\r\nold mathematical problems of algorithmic nature and corresponding algebraic problems about groups.",
