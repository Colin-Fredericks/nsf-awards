 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's Internet owes its great success to the simple, \"hour-glass\" IP network protocol architecture laid\r\nout twenty-five years ago. With rapid advances in networking technologies and explosive growth of rich\r\nmultimedia content in recent years, the networking community finds itself at an important crossroads: what\r\nshould be the next generation Internet architecture for controlling network resources and provide the quality\r\nof service (QoS) needed by emerging multimedia applications? There is a multidimensional spectrum of\r\npossible approaches to providing QoS guarantees. The choice of a QoS solution for the next generation\r\nInternet will have a substantial impact on both the evolution of the Internet itself, and on what it enables.\r\nMaking the \"right\" choices requires the development of a fundamental understanding of the scalability of\r\nQoS controls and the impact of these controls on the efficacy of QoS provisioning.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to develop a comprehensive, quantitative understanding of the\r\nfundamental trade-offs involved in various approaches toward providing scalable QoS guarantees. To this\r\nend, the researchers  will develop coherent theories to systematically address the issue of scalability in QoS controls.  The research program divides broadly into four areas:\r\n\r\nAggregate network calculus for guaranteed flows: To gain a thorough understanding of the fine time-scale\r\n(e.g., packet-level) behavior of a network system in providing QoS performance guarantees, the researchers\r\nwill develop an aggregate network calculus to study the impact of aggregate QoS control mechanisms\r\non the performance and complexity of data plane operations. This theory is developed for guaranteed\r\nflows - flows which require the network to commit, either at a per-flow or an aggregate level, a\r\ncertain amount of resources (e.g., bandwidth and buffer) throughout their life time, regardless of the\r\nnetwork congestion status. The aggregate network calculus will provide a mathematical framework\r\nto quantify the impact of aggregate QoS controls on the fundamental trade-offs in QoS provisioning.\r\nIt will also yield insights into the design of scalable data plane QoS control mechanisms.\r\n\r\nEnd-to-end QoS controls for responsive flows: The researchers  will develop fluid models to study the impact of aggregate QoS control mechanisms on the end-to-end performance of responsive flows. A responsive\r\nflow responds to signs of network congestion, such as loss, by adapting its transmission rate. These\r\nmodels will enable us to develop a better understanding of the behavior of responsive flows such as\r\nTCP coupled with different aggregate QoS mechanisms and to design end-to-end QoS services for\r\nresponsive flows.\r\n\r\nQoS control laws and control plane aggregation rules.  The researchers  will develop QoS control laws for capturing the slow time-scale, system-wide behavior of a network and aggregation rules that address the performance and complexity of control plane operations under aggregate QoS controls. These QoS control\r\nlaws and aggregation rules will lead us to the design of distributed and centralized algorithms for\r\nscalable control plane operations.\r\n\r\nScalable QoS mechanisms and service architectures as an integral part in developing these theories, the researchers will also design effective and scalable QoS mechanisms, and tools and techniques for quantifying and evaluating the trade-offs of various QoS solutions. Based on the results from these efforts, the researchers  will study how various QoS solutions can be combined to construct meaningful end-to-end services.\r\n\r\nThe research will blend formal modeling/analysis, experimentation/implementation, and evaluation. The\r\nunderstanding and insights gained as a result of the research will lead to the establishment of the theory,\r\ndesign principles, and guidelines for building scalable QoS controls for the future Internet. This, in turn,\r\nwill allow reasoned and informed choices to be made as the next generation Internet takes shape.\r\n",
