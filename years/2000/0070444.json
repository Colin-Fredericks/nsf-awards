In particular, he will pursue a parametric wavelength interchanging cross-connect incorporating difference-frequency wavelength converters with integrated pump sources.  The resulting wavelength interchanging cross-connect has the following unique properties:\r\n\r\n\r\naccommodates signals of any protocol and format,\r\ncrossconnects subcarrier multiplexed optical header and baseband data payload,\r\noffers scalability of Benes architecture,\r\nutilizes multichannel wavelength conversion for reduced architecture,\r\nachieves polarization insensitivity and wavelength independent filtering.\r\n\r\nThe proposed effort makes comprehensive studies of the Wavelength Interchanging Cross-Connect covering architecture, simulation, design, fabrication and systems integration issues.  Specifically, he will pursue an integrated effort of the following research activities:\r\n\r\n1. Wavelength Interchanging Cross-connect Architecture Studies, which will pursue a transparent and scalable architecture suited for Next Generation Network applications,\r\n2. Wavelength Conversion Technology Studies, which will design, fabricate, and prototype wavelength converters supporting transparent multichannel wavelength conversion, and\r\n3. Cross-connect Integration, which will bring space switches and wavelength converters together to form a wavelength interchanging cross-connect.  The designed architecture and network elements will be put to test at this step and the simulation results will be experimentally verified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
