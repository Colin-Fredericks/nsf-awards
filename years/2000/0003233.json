 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present study, which continues a postdoctoral research project into the third year, investigates the parental socialization of African-American children, their social behavior and the social judgments of African-American children and early adolescents. There are two studies associated with this project. The first study investigates the relationship between parental socialization, behavioral observation and African-American first and fourth-grade children's disposition, liking/disliking, moral and reward judgments. The second study investigates the disposition, liking/disliking, moral and cross-situational judgments of African-American preschool, second-, fifth- -and eighth-graders' regarding hypothetical black boy and girl actors engaged in prosocial and aggressive behavior. Most of the child interviews for both parts of the project and behavioral observation will be conducted by July 2000. The third year will involve parent interviews, data coding and data analyses. The Fellow anticipates that these activities will be completed by January, 2001.",
