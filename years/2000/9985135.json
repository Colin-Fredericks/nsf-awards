 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall scientific objective of this CAREER development project is to dissect genetically the signaling pathway of a family of cell wall-associated protein kinases (WAKs) in the plant, Arabidopsis.  The extracellular cell wall serves a vital role in plant development and survival.  Despite its importance, however, it is not well understood how the wall interacts with the intracellular compartment.  Preliminary studies have identified a family of five WAKs.  All members have an extracellular domain tightly linked to the cell wall, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase.  WAKs are required for normal plant development and play an important role during pathogen responses.  More recent results have shown that transgenic suppression of WAKs results in the inhibition of cell elongation, a complete arrest in development, and cell death.  In these studies extragenic suppressor screening will be used to identify and characterize components in the signaling pathway mediated by WAKs.  The specific scientific aims are (1) to create an inducible transgenic line that will be used for suppressor screening, (2) to identify and characterize extragenic suppressor mutants, and (3) to analyze the interactions between suppressors and specific WAKs.  The overall educational goal for this project is to integrate this research with a teaching program that will educate students in plant molecular genetics.  Part of this goal will be to foster the excitement of scientific discovery in undergraduate and graduate students at San Francisco State University, and to provide them with tools to pursue a successful career in science.   Specific educational aims are (1) to incorporate modern molecular genetic techniques into a plant physiology laboratory course, (2) to develop a new course in plant molecular biology, (3) to recruit and mentor minority students in the fields of plant molecular biology and genetics.  This last aim will include participation in institutional and community outreach programs for minorities, and the mentoring of minority students undertaking independent research. These objectives are firmly supported by both the faculty in the department of biology and the university administration.  Both believe strongly that an active research program provides students with opportunities to gain first hand experience in how science operates and gives them skills not attainable in a traditional classroom setting.  In addition, the university at large is committed to the education of the ethnically diverse Bay Area population.",
