 "awd_abstract_narration": "9980469\r\nYaghi\r\n\r\nMetal-organic materials with open framework structures have recently been much discussed in the chemistry literature for their promise as materials with designed pore architecture and function, and their consequent importance in molecular recognition, sorption and gas storage applications.  Strategies for the design of stable open framework that support permanent porosity and in particular that do not collapse in the absence of guests, have so far been largely unexplored thus limiting further progress in the field. This proposal is aimed at establishing synthetic strategies that utilize the well-established chemistry of metal carboxylate clusters for the design of extended-structure analogues.  Specifically, examples of how divergent dicarboxylate linkers such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) can be used instead extended porous ligands such as acetate to polymerize multinuclear zinc carboxylate clusters into stable extended porous frameworks.  The rigid, planar, and divergent attributes of such linkers, when coupled with the rigidity and core bulk of the metal carboxylate clusters allow the design of non interpenetrating and rigid frameworks.\r\n\r\nThe stability of the proposed materials that provide opportunities for the full exploitation and study of the molecular recognition properties of the channels will be pursued using gas and liquid sorption techniques.  An understanding of these aspects of the chemistry is expected to pave the way for their use as sensors, gas storage materials, and as highly specific membranes for separations of polar organic molecules.  On the fundamental level, the proposed research ultimately will lead to synthetic strategies that allow the translation of molecular structure and reactivity into extended solid-state materials.  This is regarded as an area of priority for the integration of research and education for the training of students and postdoctoral scholars in areas of high interest to industry.\r\n",
