 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award is made under the Exploratory Research on Engineering the Transport Industries (ETD program solicitation.\r\n\r\nWith the emerging restructured nature of the power industry, there is a need to look at new approaches to modeling as well as tools of analysis. Among the transport industries, the power industry can both profit from the experience of other deregulated industries, as well as offer new ideas in terms of modeling and analysis.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, discrete events affect the performance of systems in real time. Such events are common in the physical system, for example relays, tap changing transformers, and FACTS devices. However the rules underlying the market layer also introduce discrete events. System performance under these conditions, where continuous dynamics and discrete events interact, is the principal focus of the proposal,\r\n\r\nA major theme is to map formal languages that describe hybrid systems, such as Petri nets and finite state automata, into a differential-algebraic model structure. A linking strategy will be exploited to maximize model flexibility. We shall also focus on trajectory sensitivity analysis of hybrid systems. Application areas that build upon trajectory sensitivities will be investigated. Trajectory sensitivity analysis entails a heavy computational burden. Hence new numerical analysis approaches such as iterative solver techniques will be considered. Finally the interaction of the market layer with the physical system will be explored,\r\n\r\nThe results of the research will be in the form of formulating new areas of research for the restructured power industry.\r\n",
