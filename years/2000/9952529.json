 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) To enhance undergraduate learning of science inquiry skills utilizing field equipment and laboratory exercises and to retain science content in geology, we have adapted several NSF-funded physics (SCAMPI) and seismology (IRIS, SCEC) curricula into an integrated lecture/laboratory format.  This project integrates seismic refraction/ reflection, earthquake, and Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment with inquiry-based pedagogy into our programs for three categories of student population: 1)  geology majors (including pre-service secondary students), 2)  non-majors in general education, and 3)  pre-service (K-6) students.  The main applications of the equipment involve investigations of seismic-wave propagation associated with local earthquake recordings and seismic profiling of local faults and geologic structures, plate tectonic motions, and topographic and geologic mapping exercises. \r\nThe equipment/curriculum objective includes the coordination of inquiry-based science instruction for the three categories of student populations, with a major emphasis on technical training for our undergraduate majors and a renovated science curriculum for the elementary education major.  The project results are assessed by a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the effect our program has on the student's conceptual understanding of geologic principles.  Approximately 400-425 students per year are involved from introductory utilization of the equipment to extensive training for the geotechnical and environmental disciplines associated with industry-based employment.",
