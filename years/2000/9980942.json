 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry  (12)\r\nThe goals of this project are to advance instruction in sophomore, junior, and senior-level chemistry courses by adaptation and implementation of modern NMR experiments from recent chemical literature.  In the sophomore level organic chemistry courses, students are introduced to NMR as a structure determination tool using simple 1D and 2D experiments.  In physical chemistry, advanced experiments using the nuclear Overhouser effect (NOE) to study binding activity for several known ligands are introduced.  Descriptive inorganic chemistry is adapting and implementing experiments which use variable temperature and multinuclear NMR for the study of fluxional molecules.  Biochemistry courses are offering peptide conformation studies and implementing experiments which use F-17 as a tool for the study of enzyme kinetics.  A special topics course on NMR is also adapting experiments taken from chemical literature.  Several of these courses are undertaking kinetics experiments using the variable temperature unit and using the LAN network as well as the WWW to transfer data to workstations in the computer labs for off-line data processing.  The 400 MHz NMR spectrometer is also contributing to the success of many ongoing undergraduate research projects and enabling student-faculty research collaborations on projects which were not possible previously.  These capabilities are improving the University's ability to attract talented young faculty and students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
