 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Project that addresses new materials and manufacturing techniques for fiber lasers.  Fiber lasers have emerged as the most energy efficient, diode-pumped, solid-state lasers demonstrated to date. There have been concomitant advances in fiber laser spectral coherence and power scaling. However, less effort has been directed towards developing an integrated manufacturing process for wavelength tuning and spectral coherence control, both of which are crucial to applications such as laser spectroscopy, rugged industrial optical sensors and optical communications.  Coherent Technologies, Inc. and Cornell University propose to jointly develop innovative Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MOEMS) devices to provide these capabilities in fiber lasers.  When compared to competing optical technologies, these devices achieve unprecedented wide-band tuning, variable outcoupling, longitudinal mode selection and optical phase control with servo bandwidths >100 kKhz.  Stringent wavelength requirements inhibit large scale manufacturing with conventional technology.  The MOEMS tuners relieve the issues of process yield.\r\n\r\nThe Phase I theory and proof-of-principle demonstrator will establish technical viability for the Phase II program.  The Phase II goal is to build a first-of-kind frequency-agile phase-locked fiber laser oscillator/amplifier that is suitable for commercialization.  The devices developed with this technology will operate in hostile environments, as might be encountered in industrial process plants and telecommunications, in programmable wavelength division multiplexing and in reconfigurable optical drop/add switches.\r\n",
