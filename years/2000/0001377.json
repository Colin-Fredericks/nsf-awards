This work began under grant #9619168.  The COMPASS structure incorporates a Central Site together with five Satellite Sites, one for each curriculum program.  The primary functions of the Central Site are to inform various constituencies about these innovative curricula, aid school districts in the first general phases of curriculum selection and implementation, and coordinate requests for additional information and assistance from the Satellite Sites.  The primary goals of the Satellite Sites are to provide curriculum program-specific information to various constituencies and to assist school districts with program-specific implementation strategies including professional development.  This effort involves working with policy makers at the school, district, regional or state level as well as with parents, businesses and community leaders, the higher education community, and others.  As one component of this work, COMPASS hosts an annual national conference for secondary school decision-makers focusing on curriculum awareness, selection and implementation.\r\n",
