The meeting is a technical conference presenting talks by successful women in the computing field, short technical presentations by a range of conference participants, as well as panels, workshops, and birds-of-a-feather sessions.  This grant provides travel costs and registration expenses for approximately eighty people in computing and related fields who otherwise would be unlikely to attend.  The awards are made to selected advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and people early in their professional careers.  Cost sharing by the institutions represented covers part of the costs for many of the participants.\r\n",
