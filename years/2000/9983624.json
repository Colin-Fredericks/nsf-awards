It has been hypothesized that neurons in this region and their specific connections within the brain are important in the ability to produce a fever in response to an infection. The goal of this research project is to characterize the inherent activity of these neurons and their responses to the chemical messenger prostaglandin E2, which is produced by the brain during an infection and may trigger fevers. Thin slices of brain tissue from the hypothalamus of laboratory rats will be tested in a small temperature chamber. Neurons will also be color stained to show their connections and identify specific chemical messengers. In addition, this project will involve students in all research efforts and bring neuroscience research into the classroom through the use of new forms of education technology.\r\n\tThis project will result in the development of an integrated research and educational program, allowing students to conduct investigations in the field of neurobiology. Specific projects will focus on the ability of the brain to control body temperature during normal conditions and in response to an infection, when temperature rises in a response known as a fever. While the production of a fever is a natural defense mechanism designed to enhance the ability to fight infection, extreme elevations in temperature can cause permanent damage to internal organs and even death. With the advent of modern clinical medicine, it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in the production of a fever, so that this response can be controlled, resulting in enhanced benefits and limited risk.\r\n\r\n",
