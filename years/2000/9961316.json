 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a unique, cost-effective and low-friction/low-wear tribological coating.  This will be accomplished using an electrolytic codeposition process employing a colloidal solution of nanophase WC/Co in a standard nickel or cobalt sulphamate bath. This has not been demonstrated previously.  The current effort is directed toward metallic seals and pneumatic ducting components for aerospace and power generation gas turbine engines, and high performance automobile cylinders and piston rings to reduce life-cycle costs.  The coating is expected to contain an extremely fine dispersion of metallurgically bonded nanophase WC particles in a nickel or cobalt matrix, which will offer a unique combination of low friction/low wear.  Unlike hard chrome, this coating process is environmentally friendly and easily integrated within current operations, thereby facilitating its commercialization.  The process will also generate near-net shape coatings with superior surface finish and thickness uniformity.  These coatings will require little or no mechanical polishing, therefore, resulting in reducing the overall component cost. The selection flexibility of colloidal nanophase particles and electrolytic bathes will offer the possibility of a new surface engineering tool.  This has the potential of filling the gap between thermal spray and vapor deposited coatings and have broader applications of national interest.\r\n\r\nCommercial potential of the proposed technology includes:  aerospace and power generation metallic seals, pneumatic ducting, high performance automotive cylinder linings and piston rings, bearings, and other tribological surfaces.\r\n\r\n",
