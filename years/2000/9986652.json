 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Oregon CSEM Scholar program provides extensive support to students, aimed at increasing their retention through graduation, encouraging their enrollment in advanced degree programs, and ultimately securing their desired employment outcomes in Oregon's changing economy. Much of the support will be gleaned from services already available within the University: services provided by Academic Learning Services, the Career Center, the Information Technology Curriculum, the Teaching Effectiveness Program, and the Office of Multicultural Affairs. The support will be delivered in the form of a required, integrated five quarter seminar sequence. The sequence will be organized and taught by the PI, with the liberal use of guest speakers to increase the students' contact with mentors, role models, and research advisers. In addition, the students will be required to take independent research or internship credit for at least one quarter. The goals of these curricular requirements are fourfold: (1) to introduce students to research and graduate school options; (2) to assist the students in career planning, internship placement, and securing post graduate employment; (3) to broaden the students' perspectives on Mathematics and Computer Science; and (4) to allow the students to develop presentation skills while providing outreach to other students potentially interested in pursuing math and computer science degrees. \r\n\r\nThe sequence will include two new courses -- a Mentoring course and a Great Ideas course -- that could become a permanent part of the UO curriculum. The Mentoring course (cotaught with staff from the Careers Center) will introduce students to the use of informational interviews. The students will conduct interviews with professionals in their chosen field to assess their interest in specific careers and to \"size up\" organizations. Students can use the information they get to promote themselves to a prospective employer or to network, opening the door to future contacts and job possibilities. The course also gives students practice in presenting their findings and it gives them a chance to hear reports on all of the interviews, expanding their knowledge of related career paths. The Great Ideas course aims to broaden the students' view of Computer Science and Mathematics beyond the content of their required departmental courses. The course will consist of a series of distinguished, guest lectures from the Math and Computer Science faculty discussing the truly great ideas of the field. Topics will come from Computer Science, from Math, and from the bridges between the two fields. \r\n",
