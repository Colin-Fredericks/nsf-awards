The PI has previously documented the\r\norigin and persistence of high mutation rates caused by mutator genes in\r\npopulations of Escherichia coli  that have been propagated in the\r\nlaboratory. The three goals of the current project are: 1) to understand\r\nwhy mutator genes are successful; 2) to study the dynamics of mutator genes\r\nin populations; and 3) to document the DNA sequence changes that give rise\r\nto mutator genes in these populations. Goals 1 and 2 will be achieved\r\nthrough laboratory experiments in which E. coli cells bearing mutator genes\r\nare competed against their normal counterparts. Goal 3 will be achieved by\r\nDNA sequencing of mutator genes.\r\n \r\nBecause mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation,\r\nelucidating how mutation rates are established and maintained is of\r\nfundamental importance to our understanding of genetics and evolution. But\r\nsubstantial societal implications exist as well: Mutator genes have been\r\nassociated with pathogenicity in bacteria and with cancer in humans. The PI\r\nhas shown that these mutator genes and the mutators in his study system\r\narise from defects in the same general genetic pathway, and further\r\nresearch has suggested that similar population-level processes are likely\r\nto be involved in the laboratory and in nature. This project is therefore\r\nlikely to contribute significant insights in these areas of societal\r\nimportance.\r\n",
