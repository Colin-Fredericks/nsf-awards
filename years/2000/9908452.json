 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this meeting is to provide a forum for the discussion of\r\nrecent work on historical change in syntactic systems in the context of\r\ngenerative grammar.  Historical change constitutes a particular form of\r\nvariation.  One can find cases where grammars vary only minimally: there\r\nmay be just a single difference in two abstract systems.  If one can\r\nisolate points of variation in this way, one can then ask why the new\r\nsystem should have emerged in children at a certain point in time, and\r\nthis may illuminate the way in which children acquire their syntactic\r\ncapacities.  Within this perspective, the study of language change is\r\nfused with work on language variation and the acquisition of language.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will focus on the syntactic effects of changes in\r\ninflectional systems, for example examining the effects of the loss of\r\nmorphological case systems.  It is an old intuition that languages with\r\nrich inflection have a different kind of syntax from languages with poor\r\ninflection.  Now work within the Minimalist Program posits a tight\r\nconnection between syntactic operations and morphological features:\r\nmovement of any element (head or phrasal category) to any functional\r\nposition takes place only when required to check morphological features.\r\nThis raises the question of how strong/weak distinctions match\r\nmorphological properties.  This question will constitute the central focus\r\nof the meeting.\r\n\r\nIn summary,  the meeting will address a major question in syntactic theory and\r\nextend the dialogue between historical linguists and acquisitionists, on\r\nthe assumption that their work is mutually enlightening.",
