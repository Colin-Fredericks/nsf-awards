 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project involves the development of\r\na diabetic small animal model for in vivo testing of a minimally invasive glucose\r\nsensor. Diabetes is an increasingly common lifelong disease and is associated with\r\nmany complications. It is responsible for an estimated 10-15% of all health care\r\nexpenditures. Effective treatment has been shown to prevent or delay many of the\r\nassociated complications. The most common current treatments include diet,\r\nexercise, and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). An improvement to the\r\ncurrent SMBG method would enable and encourage patients to monitor their glucose\r\nlevels more closely and thus improve the the general health and quality of life of\r\nthe diabetic population. This technology is based on a small optical sensor implant\r\nthat is fluorescent and detectable through the skin. In order to bring this novel\r\nglucose sensor closer to clinical trials, animal efficacy trials must be performed.\r\nThe diabetic, immune reconstituted nude rat model will be developed to test the in\r\nvivo performance of the glucose sensor. Data will be collected to demonstrate that\r\nthe sensor measures glucose changes in insulin and glucose tolerance tests. The\r\nlife-time and biocompatibility of the sensor will also be studied.    \r\n\r\nAn improvement to the current method of measuring glucose levels would enable and\r\nencourage diabetic patients to measure glucose levels more frequently at home. An\r\nadvance in glucose measurement technology would greatly impact the diabetes market.\r\nA large commercial market currently exists for innovative improvements to the\r\ncurrent fingerstick method, such as the minimally invasive glucose sensor described\r\nin this proposal.",
