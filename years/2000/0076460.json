 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development of low temperature methasis routes to new and novel metastable superlattices containing alternating layers such as metal sulfide/metal oxide, metal nitride/metal oxide or metal oxide/metal oxide composites.  The primary goal is to develop a generic rational synthetic strategy for preparing composite superlattice materials with interesting phenomena that include metallic/magnetic superlattices as magnetic memory or magnetoresistive materials, dielectric/superconducting superlattices exhibiting interlayer tunneling behavior and proximity effects, and ferrimagnetic/superconducting superlattices.  Strategies to be developed include:  1) Metal Oxide/Metal Chacogenide Superlattices through Soft Chemistry, and 2) Metathesis Chemistry with Layered Nitride Halide Compounds.  Collaborations with the Center for Suerconductivity Research at the University of Maryland will provide a wealth of new structure-property correlations that will be of interest to the solid state/condensed matter community as a whole.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project involves the development of new materials synthesis and processing tools to optimize the search for high performance materials such as electronic and magnetic materials.  Due to the strong collaborations that have been arranged with the Center for Superconductivity Research at the University of Maryland, the education component of this project is particularly strong in that it will provide excellent training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral fellows interested in working in industry.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
