 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will design and test a hybrid Raman spectrometer suitable for 'on-demand' or continuous process monitoring.  This will be accomplished by employing an innovative design that overcomes the limitations traditionally associated with Raman spectroscopy:  (1) long-term instrument stability, (2) fluorescence interference, (3) wavelength reproducibility, and (4) sensitivity.  A unique combination of components and internal diagnostics will allow greater than 1000 hours of unattended operation.  The instrument will be rugged, compact, low-maintenance, require minimum power, and as such, suitable for numerous industrial applications.  Phase I will demonstrate the ability of the proposed instrument to overcome all of the listed limitations.  The Phase I results will be used to build a prototype during Phase II suitable for customer testing in Phase III.\r\n\r\nRaman spectroscopy is a very general technique and fiber optic probes will allow integration into a broad range of applications.  The long-term stability of the proposed Raman system would make it ideal for process monitoring and control in the following industries: chemical, petrochemical, polymer, composites, pharmaceutical, food processing, environmental and semiconductor industries.  It would also be ideal for health monitoring and fieldwork.\r\n",
