Her accomplishments include the establishment in 1986 of the Greensboro Area Mathematics and Science Education Center.  The Center's pre-college component serves 450 7th through 12th grade students annually through a school-based academic enrichment program; a Saturday Academy in the sciences and mathematics for minority youth; mentored research experiences during summer; and, a parental involvement program.  Ninety-seven percent of the pre-college program graduates have matriculated to college and 75% percent have majored in science, mathematics or engineering.  Dr. Guthrie also coordinated the North Carolina State Science Fair for fourteen years.  She is presently a member of the faculty at North Carolina A&T State University.",
