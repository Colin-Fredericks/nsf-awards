 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe measurement of ultrashort laser pulses remains an arduous task.  Theautocorrelator, the device of choice for decades, is complex, comprising many components.  The pulse must be split into two; the two pulses must then be spatially and temporally overlapped in a carefully aligned\r\nsecond-harmonic-generation (SHG) crystal; and the pulse relative delay must be scanned while maintaining alignment.  Alignment involves four sensitive degrees of freedom and has great potential for error.  Worse, bandwidth considerations require a very thin SHG crystal, which severely limits device sensitivity.\r\n\r\nFrequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG), which yields the full time-dependent pulse intensity and phase, requires adding a spectrometer to an autocorrelator apparatus, further complicating an already complicated apparatus.  And FROG is the simplest proven intensity-and-phase measurement device.  As a result, we have developed a remarkably simple,\r\nfull-intensity-and-phase pulse-measurement device that 1) uses no spectrometer, 2) uses no beam-splitter or delay line, 3) avoids the thin crystal and instead uses a more convenient, thick SHG crystal, 4) is considerably more sensitive, 5) involves no sensitive alignment parameters,\r\n6) can measure a single pulse, and 7) comprises only a few simple optical components.  It yields traces identical to those of SHG FROG, and hence yields the full time-dependent pulse intensity and phase.  This device incorporates two key innovations: 1) a Fresnel biprism (a prism with a 170 apex angle), which replaces the beam splitter and delay line, and 2) a thick\r\nnonlinear crystal, whose output light is angularly resolved, yielding spectral resolution (as well as improved sensitivity and the usual time-gating), and which replaces the thin crystal and spectrometer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
