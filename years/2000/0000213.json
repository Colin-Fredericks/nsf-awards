L. Yen of the National Taiwan University.  This project seeks to develop 3-D models to forecast river floods by integrating state-of-the-art prediction methods for typhoons, rainfall, watershed run-off and river flows and using advanced computer and communication technology.  Both U.S. and Taiwan groups are complimentary in resources and know-how.   The U.S. team (IIHR) has a powerful computer model and the know-how to make it work in real-world applications.  The NCHC has the computing resources in both hardware and manpower.  Developing a flood forecast system for a river system such as  the Tan Sui River is important since this river is characteristic of subtropical rivers on island environments.  Flash floods are a major issue and are difficult to forecast. This project could help us to understand the nature of the river-flooding in subtropical areas and how to mitigate it.  This project is jointly supported by the NSF and the National Science Council of Taiwan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
