This project will focus on combining\r\nand extending the results from two areas which address\r\nthis problem: 1) specification languages and 2) automated\r\nverification methods for reactive systems. Building on the\r\nrecent results in these areas the goal of this project\r\nis to develop verifiable specification languages. This\r\nwill involve research from two directions: 1) From the\r\nverification side the goal is to extend the scope of\r\ntechniques such as model checking to make them applicable\r\nto a wider set of systems. 2) From the specification side\r\nthe goal is to restrict the specification languages as much\r\nas possible (without reducing their ability to specify\r\ncomplex systems) in order to make their automated verification\r\nfeasible. This project will address both theoretical issues\r\nsuch as complexity and efficiency of model checking\r\ntechniques, and practical issues such as investigating\r\nusability of software specification languages and automated\r\nverification techniques in practice. Automated verification\r\ntools developed based on the results of this project will\r\nalso be used as educational tools in both graduate and\r\nundergraduate courses on formal methods and programming\r\nlanguages.",
