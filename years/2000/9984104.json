 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Zheng - 9984104\r\n\r\nMost chemical process are nonlinear.  In the past, process control techniques based on linear models had been adequate largely due to relatively loose environmental regulations and industry's ability (e.g., via process over-design) to design processes to operate in regions where assumptions of linearity are valid.  However, a combination of stiff global economic competition and strict environmental regulations is pushing process operational windows into regions where assumptions of linearity break down and where operating constraints (e.g., equipment, environmental, safety, etc.) must be satisfied.  Furthermore, today's processes are large-scale in nature as they are becoming more integrated to improve capital productivity.  Consequently, these trends have driven the process industry's need for improved control technologies, which can deal effectively with large-scale nonlinear processes subject to operating constraints.  The rapid development in computational hardware and software has provided the opportunity for developing advanced control techniques, which optimize process profitability in real time.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the planned research is to develop a novel nonlinear model predictive control (NLMPC) technology which addresses practical concerns (e.g., low on-line computational demand) and is theoretically sound (e.g., robust stability and performance guarantees) for control of large-scale constrained non-linear systems.  The research involves a combination of theory, simulation studies, and industrial applications and, specifically, consists of the following projects: \r\n(1) Develop a computationally efficient MPC algorithm which can be implemented on nonlinear systems with tens of inputs and outputs.\r\n(2) (2) Prove that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable in the presence of both model uncertainty and constraints\r\n(3) (3) Derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the robust stabilization of constrained nonlinear systems.\r\n(4) Develop a first-principles based model for a terephthalonitrile (TPN) plant, a large-scale chemical process, and carry out simulation studies on it.\r\n(5) Implement the algorithm on a methyl acetate reactive distillation column where it is known that linear controllers would fail in some operating regions.\r\n(6) Develop educational software based on the theoretical results and disseminate via CACHE.\r\n\r\nSeveral educational innovations are planned:\r\n(1) Develop interactive-learning modules, which allow the instructor to focus more on the \"discovery-based\" teaching method than the traditional \"I-talk-you-listen\" teaching method.  The modules would transform the students from passive listeners to active participants.\r\n(2) Develop open-ended problems which require not only engineering know-how, but also other aspects of the decision-making process.\r\n(3) Develop projects to get selected undergraduate students more involved with frontier engineering research.\r\n(4) Have the PI's students take industrial assignments.\r\n",
