 "awd_abstract_narration": "Color vision is an aspect of the visual world of humans and many animals but our understanding of the neural processes mediating color vision remains incomplete. Normal humans, rhesus monkey, and goldfish all have three cone types (trichromacy) and can discriminate the color of light at detection threshold intensity. Dichromatic ('color blind') humans have only two cone types (dichromacy) and cannot discriminate the color of light at detection threshold intensity. This suggests that either trichromacy is necessary for high color vision sensitivity or that dichromatic humans have a deficit in color vision sensitivity because dichromacy is an abnormal condition in humans. To decide between these two possibilities behavioral color discrimination thresholds will be measured in normally dichromatic ground squirrels using food reward. If ground squirrels cannot discriminate the color of spectral lights at threshold intensities this will suggest that trichromacy is necessary for high color vision sensitivity. On the other hand if ground squirrels can discriminate the color of spectral lights at threshold intensities this will suggest that dichromatic humans have a post-receptoral color vision deficit and that high sensitivity is one of color vision's evolutionary advantages in both normal dichromats and trichromats.",
