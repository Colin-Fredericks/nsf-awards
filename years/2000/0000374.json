 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Conference is designed to address issues to inspire and prepare women in engineering to assume leadership positions in academic institutions from the department chair level through higher leadership positions such a provost.  The conference goals are:  (1) to explore and define various models of leadership; (2) to establish a vertical network of alliances; (3) to identify the skills needed for various leadership roles; and, (4) to disseminate the results of the conference to women in academia.\r\n \r\nThe conference will be organized with a conference chair and co-chair, a steering committee of nationally renowned academic leaders, and will be limited to 40 participants to encourage personal contact, team interaction, and active participation in the sessions.  Topics will include institutional skill building (i.e., budget preparation and management), and personal skill development (i.e., leadership styles and conflict resolution methods).  Evaluations will be conducted and a Webster will be created to disseminate the findings/experiences of the conference, with continued networking established via the web.  This \r\nConference addresses key issues identified by the NAE workshop on women in science and engineering.\r\n",
