 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allyl ethers are a class of compounds that can be very easily prepared using readily available and inexpensive starting materials.  However, this class of compounds has found very little practical or commercial use since they cannot be effectively polymerized by existing techniques.  Employing a newly discovered metal catalyst system, allyl ethers can be readily and efficiently polymerized to high molecular weight polymers that have potential uses for a variety of plastics applications.  The goals of this proposal are to conduct studies to understand the mechanism by which the present catalyst system functions with a view towards further improving it as well as for the development of even more effective catalysts.  In addition, the range of the scope of this new polymerization will be extended to other classes of potentially attractive monomers.  Using the present catalyst system, films and castings of high molecular weight poly(allyl ethers) will be made and characterized.  The PI hopes to attract industrial interest in these materials and to assist in their commercial development.  During the course of the project, several graduate students and postdoctoral coworkers will be trained in this new area of polymer technology.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant is in the growing area of new synthetic techniques for preparation of new polymeric materials of potential technological importance. \r\n*** \r\n",
