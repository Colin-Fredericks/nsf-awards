 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to initiate a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center.  The two-year pilot program will sponsor six to eight undergraduate students in an eleven-week internship that includes seminars and a research project. Mentors chosen by the students will help the students formulate and conduct a research project.  Students will receive instruction in scientific methodology and related skills that are common to all fields of science (hypothesis formulation and testing, elementary statistics, experimental and sampling design, scientific writing, and data presentation). They will also participate in a seminar focussed on careers in marine science and will present results of their research at the end of the program. The program is open to all U.S. citizens and permanent residents attending any college or university. Applications from women and under-represented minorities are particularly encouraged. Matching funds from the University of Maine are also included in this proposal.\r\n\r\n",
