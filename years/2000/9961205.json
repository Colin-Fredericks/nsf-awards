 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I from Reata Computing Services, Inc. project will develop a computer interface product, StickMouse, that will represent a significant advance in surmounting the limitations of current assistive devices.  There are millions of disabled people in the United States who do not have normal use of their hands or arms due to paralysis or disease.  These individuals cannot utilize a computer fully because they cannot manipulate both the mouse and keyboard with an integrated device.  The educational and economic impact of these disabilities becomes more and more severe as technology-enabled, Internet-based products, services, and education become more prevalent.  This situation not only has an impact on each individual's economic and personal well being, but also it has implications for our national productivity as well.  StickMouse will enable keyboard entry as well as simulate mouse manipulation within constraints of ease of use; comfort; cost effectiveness; material suitability; and reliability, durability, and maintainability.  Because StickMouse is a general user interface device, it will be enabling for any type of computer use, including education, creation of job opportunities, and enhancing personal life and independence.  StickMouse will facilitate the use of the computer so that physically disabled individuals will have much greater access to and interaction with computer applications, including web interface and programming skills.\r\n\r\nThe technology proffered by Reata Computing Services will increase employment opportunities and enhance educational development, financial independence and quality of life for disabled individuals through their access to software requiring the mouse.\r\n",
