 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)  Despite recognition that environmental problems exert a disproportionate impact on minority communities, of the almost 100 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), only 19 have majors in environmental areas and most are not in Liberal Arts programs. Since most minority student training occurs at HBCUs, the lack of environmental exposure and training has resulted in few African American environmentally-trained decision-makers and in reduced participation in the environmental decision-making process. The obvious way to address these issues is to increase student exposure and training in environmental sciences at HBCUs.\r\n\r\nWhile our participation in Second Nature workshops illustrated how environmental themes could be infused throughout the undergraduate curriculum, we recognized that this alone would be insufficient. We knew that it would be crucial to develop an environmental curriculum that would address the issues and concerns of students of color. Haynes' (1998) paper applying stream analysis as a thematic construct for an environmental science program provided us with an approach that we adapted using an environmental justice theme.\r\n\r\nWe are developing an environmental studies curriculum that will attract and train students at Howard University, and we believe our approach may serve as a template that could be adopted by other HBCUs. Our two-semester sequence in Environmental Studies blends traditional environmental themes with environmental justice issues, thereby engaging and attracting students of color. Faculty development workshops on teaching and learning strategies and instructional technology will allow us to enhance teaching effectiveness. The development of minor and major programs in Environmental Studies will complete the full implementation of this project.\r\n",
