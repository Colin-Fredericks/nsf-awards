Gordon\r\n\r\nInverse spectral geometry is the study of the extent to which the\r\ngeometry of a surface or, more generally, of a Riemannian\r\nmanifold can be extracted from spectral data.  The primary\r\nspectral data associated to a compact Riemannian manifold are the\r\neigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.  The investigators\r\npropose to apply recently developed methods to study the extent\r\nto which the eigenvalue spectrum determines the local geometry of\r\na compact Riemannian manifold.  They will also ask the extent to\r\nwhich additional spectral data such as the spectrum of the\r\nLaplacian acting on differential forms of various degrees\r\ndetermines the geometry of the manifold.  Inverse spectral\r\nproblems will be considered on Riemannian orbifolds as well as on\r\nmanifolds; orbifolds are the most tractable singular spaces.  For\r\nthe Schrodinger operator \"Laplacian plus potential\", the problem\r\nof recovering the potential from spectral data will be studied in\r\nthe case of line bundles over tori.  In analogy to the case of\r\nplanar domains, the lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a\r\ncompact Riemannian manifold may be viewed as the fundamental\r\ntone.  The question of whether random Riemann surfaces have large\r\nfirst eigenvalue will be studied using connections between\r\nspectra of Riemann surfaces and spectra of graphs.  For\r\nnoncompact Riemannian manifolds, the primary spectral data are\r\nthe scattering poles; the investigators expect to exhibit\r\ncontinuous families of isopolar metrics.\r\n\r\nIn spectroscopy, one attempts to recover the chemical composition\r\nor the shape of an object from the characteristic frequencies of\r\nlight or sound emitted.  In the case of a vibrating membrane such\r\nas a drumhead, viewed mathematically as a bounded region in the\r\nplane, the spectrum of characteristic frequencies corresponds to\r\nthe mathematical notion of the Laplace spectrum.  The Laplace\r\nspectrum is also defined for other geometric objects called\r\nmanifolds which arise in mathematics and physics.  The\r\ninvestigators, along with Scott Wolpert, earlier constructed the\r\nfirst examples of differently shaped drumheads (planar regions)\r\nwith the same spectrum.  Planar regions can differ in their\r\nglobal shape but locally are identical; i.e., if you look at a\r\nsmall piece cut out from one of the regions, you can not tell\r\nwhich region it came from.  Recently, the principal investigator\r\ndeveloped methods for constructing geometric objects with the\r\nsame Laplace spectrum but which differ in their local as well as\r\nglobal shape.  These methods will be used to investigate which\r\nlocal geometric properties of manifolds are not spectrally\r\ndetermined.  Additional spectral problems will also be considered\r\nsuch as the construction of surfaces of arbitrarily large volume\r\nbut having bounded fundamental tone.\r\n",
