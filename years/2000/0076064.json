This is particularly true of habitat fragmentation, which is a dominant feature of global change. A long-term experiment on habitat fragmentation is underway in the prairie-forest ecotone of eastern Kansas aimed at examining the impact of fragmentation on secondary succession, defined broadly to include key consumer groups, as well as plant dynamics. The physical layout of the experiment (initiated in 1984) is an archipelago of habitat patches in a large mown field. During the first phases of the project, there wre dramatic patch size effects on the distribution of small mammals, but no overall effect of patch size on succession. By 1993, colonization of woody plants was beginning to accelerate. It was hypothesized that this would lead to patch size effects on succession. This hypothesis has been borne out: the rate of succession towards woody vegetation has increased with patch size and decreased with distance from woodland source pools. There has been corresponding succession and spatial shifts in the small mammal community, and small mammals have been shown to inflict considerable damage on woody seedlings. In 1998 there was a serendipitous emergence of 17-year periodical cicadas, which imposed high levels of damage, with more damage in large patches. Monitoring of plant and small mammal dynamics will continue to determine the persistence of patch size and distance effects on successional trajectories. Because a large number of individually marked woody samplings exists, the demographic consequences of succession on woody species can be characterized, including the potential impact of the cicada emergence event on sapling demography. This project is unique in that no experimental studies of succession exist in which patch size effects on plant and animal dynamics have been measured.\r\n",
