The project integrates research in computer and network security into upper level undergraduate and introductory graduate engineering and computer and information science curricula. The project involves the creation of an instructional laboratory where students have access to and experiment with authentication methods, anti-virus software, encryption algorithms and protocols, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, and the development of network security topics in several courses including Introduction to Networks and Security and Computer Network Security. This project speaks to the widespread concern about security issues on intranets and the Internet, including: privacy policy, security design, security risk assessment, authentication techniques, encryption, incident management, and network architectures for security enforcement. In particular, this project focuses on the development of high-confidence software systems and it is also relevant to several areas of industrial and national importance including wireless information technology, IT research, and scalable information infrastructures. The transfer of this material into undergraduate and graduate courses is important for educating practitioners who develop applications and manage facilities that provide seamless availability of networks.\r\n",
