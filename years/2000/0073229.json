 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wild animals are often well-equipped to handle variable, harsh environments.  Interestingly, most wild animals also will acquire parasites during their lives.  Some parasites kill their host, but others cause a chronic, sub-lethal infection.  The PIs goal is to determine if chronic, sub-lethal parasite infection affects host physiology and consequently host reproduction.  The PIs will examine 1) host intestinal physiology and energy allocation (glucose absorption, fat and lean masses), 2) host reproduction (litter production, offspring masses), and 3) growth and survival of host offspring (linear growth measures, body mass).\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of this project spans several research areas.  First, this project has implications for the field of life-history evolution because it will determine if an infected host's reproduction is constrained by its ability to acquire or process energy.  Second, because this research uses wild, rather than laboratory, mice it will aid in the understanding of how wild animals cope with chronic infections that may alter multiple aspects of reproduction. Third, this research will provide much needed empirical data for mathematical models of how sub-lethal parasites affect host reproduction.  Finally, because chronic parasite infection of humans is common in third world countries, this research may help understand the effects of sub-lethal parasites on human reproduction.\r\n",
