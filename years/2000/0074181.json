Due to low seismicity levels, the location of this fault has been inferred only indirectly from the locations of earthquakes occurring within the subducted oceanic plate that have uncertainties of about 3-5 km.  The PI will use recent improvements in earthquake relocation techniques, as well as a larger dataset to map out the location and shape of the trust interface with relocated earthquakes of potential accuracy on the order of ~100 m.  The catalog of extremely accurate relative earthquake locations will provide the basis for studies of the mechanical properties of the fault, involving repeating earthquakes, space-time rupture inversions of moderate size events, and possibly geodetic imaging of slip transients in the region.  This combination of studies should improve estimates of the seismic hazard in the Kanto-Tokai region as well as our understanding of earthquake rupture and fault mechanics.\r\n",
