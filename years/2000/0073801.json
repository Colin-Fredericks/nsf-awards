 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe PIs form a research group whose work emphasizes the connections between model theory (a branch of mathematical logic) and other parts of mathematics. They have established a successful, coordinated research program and an excellent environment for postdocs, graduate students, and visitors. They plan to build on that current level of activity by adding one postdoc and by providing research support for three graduate students, as well as by bringing in some more established researchers for shorter periods of time and by organizing meetings for dissemination of new developments. \r\n\r\nThe general aim of the PIs and the group working around them is to increase the effectiveness of model theory as a tool in mathematics, and to use feedback from these interactions to guide the further development of model theory itself. The work that would be supported by this grant covers most areas of model theory and its applications.\r\n",
