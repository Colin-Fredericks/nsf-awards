 "awd_abstract_narration": "A strong component of the drive for K-12 educational reform have been concerns about the capacity of Americans to compete successfully in a rapidly changing context defined by intense international competition in global markets and swift technological change.  The desire to improve American global and technological competitiveness has led to calls for enhancements in the use of modern technologies at all stages of the educational process.  This development coincides with increasing interest in the development of critical thinking skills that enable individuals to conceptualize problems, acquire and analyze relevant information, and use advanced technologies like geographic information systems (GISs) to make effective spatial decisions.  To address these related problems, this award will provide partial support for a special study committee established by the National Research Council (NRC) to study the use of GIS and related technologies and the emerging concepts and principles of geographic information science (GIScience) across the K-12 curriculum in the U.S.  The review will focus on two related questions:  (1) How can current software versions of GIS and theoretical approaches of GIScience be incorporated into standards-based instruction in knowledge domains across the breadth of the curriculum?  (2) How can cognitive development and educational theory be used to design age-appropriate versions of GIS software and age-appropriate GIScience curricula?  The project will include a review of knowledge and current practice regarding the use of GIS and GIScience in K-12 curricula in geography, mathematics, and science.  It will develop guidelines and recommendations for pre-service and in-service training programs as well as curricula for GIS and GIScience programs.  It also will identify and follow through on small-scale, highly focused studies of key issues in pre-collegiate GIS and GIScience education, such as the role of collaborative learning models in instruction, patterns of GIS use as a function of gender and cognitive development levels, and interface designs to facilitate cognitive development.  The review will result in a book-length final report, with additional information disseminated via the Internet.  The project will contribute to the development of application guidelines and outline research needs and strategies to meet future needs for student learning, teacher training, and software development.  The study will provide short-term guidance for incorporating GIS and GIScience into American schools, and it will identify longer-term research issues associated with improved design of GISs and enhanced GIScience-related instruction.\r\n",
