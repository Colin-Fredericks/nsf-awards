The program has several aspects: (1) Use of the VLA to identify ~ 10 additional strong lenses in the south. 2) use of the VLA and VLBA to monitor several lenses to measure time delays, and thus constrain Ho (and with statistics on 10 or more sources) also constrain lambda (3) modeling of galaxy mass distributions, using new modeling techniques based on Taylor expansions of the gravitational potential and (4) searching for supermassive black holes in the centers of lensing galaxies intermediate z galaxies by imaging the expected faint second images of extended background radio galaxies with the VLBA. The lensing technique provides a  method for determining Ho and lambda which is independent of the more classical magnitude distance methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nGravitational lensing occurs when radiation from a background astrophysical source passes by a foreground massive object. A special case is \"strong lensing\" where more than one image of the background source is produced. Strong lensing provides a unique laboratory for probing mass distributions, the geometry of the space between the source and the observer (cosmology) This work will carry out studies of gravitational lensing with the goal of measuring the distance scale and probing the geometry of the universe, investigating the mass distribution in galaxies, and determining whether intermediate-redshift galaxies harbor supermassive black holes at their centers. To do this we need a large, well understood, sample of lenses. A large radio survey of the southern sky, aimed at identifying new gravitational lens systems, we expect to identify between 5 and 10 new lens systems. Applying lens systems to the astrophysics problems listed above requires several related observational and theoretical programs. With the goal of measuring time delays, monitoring observations of newly identified lens systems, and of some known systems for which time delays have not yet been measured, will be carried out. These time delay measurements provide distance estimates, which in turn provide information on the distance scale in the universe and constrain cosmological models. In particular, gravitational lens distance measurements may be used to test the recent claim, based on Type Ia Supernova measurements, that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Mass distributions in lensing galaxies will be studied by applying a recently developed multipole-Taylor expansion of the gravitational potential to all lens systems, and by searching for faint second images of background sources that should be present if there are supermassive black holes at the galaxies' centers. Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
