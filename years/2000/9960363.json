 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an imaging instrument to measure the temperature distribution in epitaxial wafers grown on Galium Arsenide, GaAs, or Indium Phosphide, InP, substrates during Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) processing. Many world class companies are involved in GaAs manufacturing to target the wireless satellite and fiber optic communication market.  As fabrication facilities incorporate larger (6') and multiple wafer processing technology, the importance of temperature uniformity control becomes an increasingly critical issue.  High temperature uniformity is required to achieve electrical and optical quality of the epilayer and substrate temperature is one of the key process parameters during epitaxial growth. Models will be developed of the instrument and its application to GaAs temperature monitoring.  A prototype will be designed and constructed.  The response of the instrument will be examined in a furnace.  Additional requirements related to the detailed design of MBE chambers will be identified to establish a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of system integration as a monitor for real-time process control.  This technology will provide MBE and Metal-Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) process developers with a tool to determine the temperature uniformity produced in new process chambers. \r\n      Over the past three decades, compound semiconductors have evolved from research laboratories and niche military applications to high volume commercial applications in wireless, satellite and fiber optic communications.  As a result of the rapid increase in demand in the 90's, the wafer size has increased from 2' to 4', and currently 6' wafer fabrication lines are being introduced in a number of facilities across the world.\r\n\r\n",
