 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jason Halfen of the University of Wisconsin--Eau Claire is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for Research in an Undergraduate Institution dealing with development of novel catalysts (involving coordination compounds of copper) for the aziridination of olefins. Main aims of the research include:examination of effects of ligand structure on the ability of catalysts to transfer nitrene groups to olefins; spectroscopic and structural characterization of a high-valent copper-nitrene complex (a putative intermediate in the reaction of interest); exploration of novel protecting groups; detailed mechanistic analysis of the reaction.\r\n\r\nAziridines, the end products of the reactions being studied in this project, are strained, nitrogen-containing heterocycles that are finding increasingly wide use in organic synthesis. Aziridines are also present in several naturally occurring drugs that are potent anticancer agents. This research will facilitate synthetic use of aziridines and also contribute to increased understanding of their function in complex systems, including biological activity and medicinal uses.\r\n",
