 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) As part of a multiyear campus-wide curriculum reform effort, the Physics Department at the Colorado School of Mines is implementing a new curriculum and instruction for the calculus-based introductory physics core sequence for its engineering majors which is aligned with the ABET 2000 criteria. This project addresses the second semester of the introductory sequence (electromagnetism and optics, or Physics II) which has been undergoing development over the past two years culminating in a pilot offering in the spring 1999 semester. While the integration of the learning activities in the new curriculum design cannot be overemphasized, the focus of this project is the laboratory component which adapts the MlT/Caltech \"ZAP!\" approach to fit a more traditional curriculum emphasis and delivery mode. The novel ZAP! approach places significant emphasis on design and fabrication of electronic circuits which is highly experiential and well aligned with these ABET 2000 criteria. However, in its current form, ZAP! is not deliverable within the time traditionally allocated to laboratories in the introductory physics sequence. In the modified Physics II laboratories the design/fabrication goals of ZAP! are adapted to fit traditional resource constraints, delivery modes, and curriculum emphasis. Limited prototype models of specialized equipment;\tand circuits for these laboratories have been designed, fabricated, and tested in the pilot course. This project involves the implementation in the entire course. In their modified form these novel laboratory experiences could be readily adopted by other physics departments serving engineering programs.\r\n",
