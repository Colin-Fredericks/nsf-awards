 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oriented Strandboard (OSB) is a structural wood composite widely used in house construction as sheathing, flooring, and I-joist materials.  As a biological material, OSB is subject to attack from Formosan termites, which nationwide cause over $2 billion a year in damages to homes. Borate-based systems have been shown to provide adequate termite protection for OSB. However, the addition of the chemical often leads to a significant reduction in the strength and durability of OSB.  The goal of this project is to pursue an overall understanding of the influence of borate addition on OSB's strength and long-term durability.  The specific objectives are: (1) To develop pressing technology for manufacturing OSB with borate-modified flakes; (2) To determine the effects of borate addition on panel stiffness, strength, and stability; (3) To determine contents and micro-distribution of zinc-borate within wood flakes; and (4) To measure and model the creep behavior of the OSB.  In this work, borate-modified OSB panels will be manufactured.  Panel strength, chemical content and distribution, swelling and creep properties will be determined.  Mathematical models will be developed to describe observed creep and durability behavior.  The work will lead to the development of processing technology and fundamental durability information information for the manufacture of durable OSB with sound biological performance. \r\n",
