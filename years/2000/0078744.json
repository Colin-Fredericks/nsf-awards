 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allocation of time and energy to reproduction influences both sexes.  In this research, the causes and consequences of patterns of sperm allocation in males will be investigated.  Historically, most research in this field has concentrated on egg production because an egg is more costly to produce than a sperm is.  However, although sperm are smaller than eggs, each ejaculate of a male may contain enormous numbers of sperm.  Recent research has revealed that reproductive resources for gamete production can be limited for males as well as for females in many species. Critical to patterns of sperm investment by males is the degree to which females mate with multiple males.  Such multiple mating sets up intense competition among sperm of different males to fertilize the same egg.  One consequence of such sperm competition is the production of large ejaculates.  A dynamic program model developed by W. E. Harris has provided predictions for sperm allocation in the salamander, Ambystoma texanum.  This species is highly suitable for such a study because within any breeding aggregation, each male may deposit 60+ sperm packets each containing many thousand sperm, and each female may induct 20+ sperm packets into her reproductive tract before she lays any eggs.  Predictions from the dynamic program model will be tested using controlled laboratory experiments. \r\n\r\n\r\nVariation in sperm allocation is a key but understudied aspect of the reproductive pattern of most species.  Previously, males of most species were thought to produce large ejaculates because most sperm were defective.  More recent theory suggests that sperm allocation may be one of several adaptations of males to maximize their chances of siring offspring if females have multiple mating partners.  The goal of this study is to test several predictions of this body of theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
