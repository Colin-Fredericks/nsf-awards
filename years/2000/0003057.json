WISC is a two-year program to encourage U.S. women scientists to develop new international cooperative research projects and partners.  WISC will allow U.S. women scientists to travel to Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia and stay up to four weeks in order to develop a formal research proposal to conduct basic research in an international environment.  WISC is open to women scientists in the following fields: archeology; anthropology; biology; chemistry; earth sciences; economics; environmental sciences; geography and demography; linguistics; political science; non-clinically oriented psychology; and sociology.  WISC especially encourages interdisciplinary research projects.  If there is a U.S. research team, up to two female members of that team can apply for WISC grants as long as at least one of them is a principal investigator.   The grants, up to a maximum of $4,000, will cover travel and living expenses for the U.S. investigator to go abroad.  Any excess funds can also be used for supplies and equipment needed during the planning period for a second visit - either for the U.S. scientist or for her partner to come to the U.S.  Three rounds of competition will be offered between October 2000 and October 2002 for a total of twenty grants.  \r\n\r\nThe AAAS WISC Program fulfills the NSF program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n***\r\n \r\n",
