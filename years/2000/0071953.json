 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an individual investigator award to a young professor at Montana State University for research into the ground-state properties of a variety of low dimensional conductors and superconductors.  The project focuses on organic charge transfer salts and inorganic layered oxides.  The three main parts of the project are 1) to study the fermiology of these quasi 1- and 2-d materials using a cyclotron resonance technique ; 2) to study the collective modes in the Sr2RuO4 system, a potential triplet pairing superconductor; and 3) to study the Josephson plasma resonance in the organic and layered superconductors.  A GHz cavity perturbation method will be used for all of the measurements.  The unifying goal of the studies is to probe how the various ground states of these unusual materials evolve from their respective metallic states, whether conventional or unconventional.  The students working on the project will develop skills that will help them find jobs in academia, government or industrial laboratories.\r\n%%%\r\nLow dimensional materials possess a variety of interesting characteristics, some of which hold a potential for use in future technologies.  These materials also form an interesting laboratory in which studies of novel physical phenomena can be made.  This is an individual investigator award to a young professor at Montana State University for a project to study the ground state properties of low dimensional conductors and superconductors.  In particular molecular conductors and layered superconductors will be studied using a high frequency technique.  The goal of the project is to probe how the various ground states in these materials evolve from their respective metallic states.  The research will increase our understanding of these interesting materials.  The students working on the project will develop skills that will help them find jobs in academia, government or industrial laboratories.\r\n",
