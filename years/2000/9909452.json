This proposal will focus on the key iron-rich amphibole ferro-actinolite (Ca2Fe5Si8O22(OH)2) using two complementary approaches: (1) investigation of ferro-actinolite stability and chemistry in the chemical system CaO-FeO-SiO2-H2O, and (2) investigation of the ferro-actinolite component in solid solution with the magnesium-rich amphibole tremolite.  One particular goal of this research is to synthesize pure iron-bearing amphiboles under known pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacities.  These amphiboles will be studied by X-ray diffraction for the purpose of determining the distribution of iron and magnesium in the crystal structure of amphibole using Rietveld structure analysis and will be studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy to further characterize the cation distribution and to see if ferric iron is present.  Additional characterization of these extremely fine-grained synthetic amphiboles will include analytical transmission electron microscopy to obtain direct chemical analyses of individual grains and to assess the amount of defects, if any, that are present in their crystal structure.  From this study we will gain important insights into the thermodynamic properties of the end-member ferro-actinolite, test the hypothesis that ferric iron may greatly increase its thermal stability, and determine how iron influences the properties of magnesium-rich amphiboles.  This study will provide a valuable point of reference for understanding chemically complex amphiboles.\r\n\r\n",
