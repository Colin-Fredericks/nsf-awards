The school is for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral associates in condensed matter physics, materials science and related fields.  There is presently no comparable school in the United States.  The objective of the school is, within the context of a well defined subject, to expose students to a range of concepts, techniques, and applications which is much broader than any one graduate department can provide. The vitality of this branch of science was recently emphasized in the decadal study by the National Research Council entitled Condensed-Matter and Materials Physics: Basic Research for Tomorrow's Technology (National Academy Press, 1999).  Each year the school will focus on a different area of current interest chosen for its scientific importance and interdisciplinary character by an advisory board of leading scientists.  This will help prepare the students to work independently at the forefront of science.  In particular, many of the most important and exciting scientific and technological advances have come from bringing concepts and techniques from one area to bear on issues arising in another.  The summer school will put students in a better position to make these connections.  The school will run for approximately four weeks and would be comprised of about fifty students, fifteen lecturers and two-three scientifc organizers.\r\n",
