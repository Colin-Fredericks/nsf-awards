 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nBroadband wireless communications has been identified as a national\r\nimperative; it is deemed essential for maintaining the country's\r\npremier position in information technology and accelerating the\r\nadvance of the information age.  This research is aimed at enhancing\r\nthe performance of wideband wireless multiaccess systems by optimizing\r\ntradeoffs between coding and spreading, capitalizing on advantages\r\nafforded by spatial diversity, and developing techniques for\r\naccommodating multirate users.\r\n\r\nA goal of this research is to establish, through a careful modeling of\r\ntime dispersion and angular dispersion effects in wideband channels,\r\nthat signals spread continuously over the available time interval and\r\nfrequency band can send data with high reliability.  When spatial\r\nmacrodiversity also is available, the investigators contend that\r\nsignals should be coded over spatial and spectral dimensions and their\r\nenergy spread \"continuously\" over time, frequency and space.\r\n\r\nLinear signal space separation schemes have received considerable\r\nattention as approaches for providing good tradeoffs\r\nbetween throughput and system complexity in single-cell multiuser\r\nenvironments.  The efficacy of linear signal space separation schemes\r\ndiminishes substantially, however, when one generalizes to\r\nmultiple-cell environments.  The goal in such realistic multicell\r\ninterference channels is to maximize a certain extension of classical\r\nspectral efficiency herein called area-spectral efficiency.  This research\r\ninvestigates the validity of the contention that signals widely\r\ndispersed in time, frequency and space (TFS-wide signals) are nearly\r\noptimum in such environments and do not require the use of linear\r\nsignal separation at the receiver.\r\n\r\nThe investigators study various techniques for creating \r\nTFS-wide signals in the wideband wireless environment, with an\r\nemphasis on multicarrier signaling approaches. Provided the\r\nforward channel does not fade quickly relative to the capacity of the\r\nchannel available for feeding back information from the receiver(s) to\r\nthe transmitter(s), DMT (discrete multitone) with dynamic bit loading\r\nshould prove to be a viable data transmission technique.  Combined\r\nwith spreading that enables multiple access, DMT can be made to\r\nprovide both user separation and Shannon-optimal power distribution\r\nrelative to the short-term spectrum of the wideband channel with\r\nfading and interference seen by each user. For cases where dynamic bit\r\nloading proves infeasible, OFDM (i.e., DMT with an equal number of\r\nbits in each subchannel) is being explored as a candidate modulation\r\nscheme for broadband wireless signaling.\r\n",
