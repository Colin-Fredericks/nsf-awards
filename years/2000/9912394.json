The conference purposes are to disseminate current knowledge and trends in the social sciences to teacher educators, curriculum and staff development specialists, and publishers.  In addition a second purpose is to inform efforts to reform and revitalize the teaching and learning of the social sciences in U.S. schools.  These discussions will be based upon the current literature and experiences of the attendees.   The conference will cover the areas of political science, economics, and the behavioral sciences.  The participants will be approximately 60 in number.  Special consideration is given to include younger scholars in these areas.  There will be a publication in the form of a CD-ROM for others to have access to the conclusions reached by the conference.\r\n\r\n",
