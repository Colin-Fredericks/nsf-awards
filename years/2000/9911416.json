 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCharacterization of world river fluxes for global geochemical models is a major goal of geochemistry.  It is important to understand the input ofnutrients, trace elements, and organic carbon into the coastal ocean.  In addition, by studying the composition of pristine rivers, itis possible to understand the products of weathering, and ultimately, the long-term stabilization of climate by the effect of weathering on the atmospheric CO2 concentration.  This project will extend previous work on the geochemistry of rivers in China to hitherto inaccessible areas of western China from which little data has beeen obtained.  The proposed work would involve study of the dissolved chemistry of these rivers as they evolve from pristine source regions to more heavily populated areas, collection of suspended and bed-load material, and establishment of a base-line against which on-going very large hydrologic manipulation projects can be referred.  Aspects of this work will address the influence of tectonics on climate via weathering and associated stabilization of atmospheric CO2.  This work would be done in collaboration with Chinese scientists.",
