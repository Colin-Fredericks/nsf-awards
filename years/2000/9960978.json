 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the development of algorithms for active control of blade vibration and engine stability (stall and surge) using the General Dynamics Advanced Technology Systems (GDATS) eddy current sensor (ECS) array. The increased demand for aircraft maneuverability and efficiency drive the engine designers to produce lighter engines that will have to operate in the presence of increased levels of steady-state and dynamic engine-face distortion. Such engines demand active control systems for safe operation. Working closely with GDATS, the proposer has been actively involved in the development of signal analysis and diagnostic tools for the detection of engine faults. We shall leverage this ongoing development of diagnostics tools for the ECS in the development of active control algorithms.  Current ECS diagnostic tools are already able to provide tip clearance profiles, as well as vibration and stall indicators. We propose to extend the functionality of the ECS system beyond diagnostics to active and automatic real-time control of gas turbine engines.\r\n        From this project we expect to develop algorithms for active control of gas turbine engine blade vibration and stability that make use of the GDATS ECS array. The GDATS ECS array is currently the favored sensor system for installation on the Joint Strike Fighter. A software system upgrade capable of using ECS data to compute the necessary indicators and estimate the disturbances needed for active vibration and engine stability control will be highly desirable. If this can be accomplished it will reduce the number of new sensors needed for active control, thus potentially saving millions of dollars.",
