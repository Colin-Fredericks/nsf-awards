 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Scholarship Program is: To encourage high achieving, low-income students, particularly of groups underrepresented in science, mathematics, engineering and technology, to pursue and attain degrees in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics by providing sufficient scholarship funding to allow full-time enrollment in those disciplines. \r\n\r\nAlthough applications of all students who meet the guidelines of financial need and a strong interest in the eligible disciplines will be welcomed, aggressive efforts will be made to recruit minorities under represented in Mathematics, Science and Engineering, and females. The Division of Sciences and Engineering will lead the effort to recruit and retain the eligible students, with the assistance of the several offices within the Student Services area, including the Financial Aid Office, the Advising and Counseling, Peer Tutoring, and the Accessibility Offices. \r\n\r\nThe scholarship recipients will be encouraged to take of advantage of the institution's Cooperative Education Program to gain hands on experiences in their areas of interest. Each student will be assigned a mentor within their discipline and will meet with that mentor periodically for academic advice as well as those concerning transfer and employment possibilities. The final report of the project will evaluate its success by number of Associate of Science (traditional transfer curriculum), Associate of Applied Science (technical employment readiness) degrees, and successful transfer and/or employment.\r\n",
