 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), a multidisciplinary field experiment was conducted from January to March, 1999 over the Indian Ocean.  A follow-up requirement of such a multi-platform experiment is to develop an integrated database and coherent analysis of various observations that can be utilized by different participating groups and future investigators.  The main objective of this project is to integrate and analyze the lower troposphere meteorological observations taken from different platforms such as ships, aircraft, satellites and land-based stations and investigate the role of land-ocean-atmosphere interactions on the atmospheric transport of aerosols and gases.\r\n\r\nThese observations will be used to: 1) evaluate and provide a consistent data set of boundary layer/meteorological observations, and 2) develop a detailed analysis of the role of aerosol-rich land plume and its interaction with the Marine Boundary Layer during INDOEX.  This study will have a positive impact on the analysis of the various components of INDOEX observations by different groups, and will add to our knowledge of the influence of man-made atmospheric chemical constituents on the climate of South Asia and the Indian Ocean.\r\n",
