The history of the Read Conference, and now the Electrodeposition GRC, has involved the formation of metals: Cu, Ag, Au, Cr and Ni, for car bumpers, contacts, electroforming, etc. The present organizers seek to change the focus of the conference from what is, to what could be. That is, the organizers feel the conference will have more impact if we can open up electrodeposition and investigate new, frontier, areas instead of discussing better ways to do what is already being done.  Understanding of electrodeposition at the atomic scale has increased dramatically in recent years, as new analytical methods like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) have been developed. This has resulted in improved control over processes, and the ability to use electrodeposition in areas where control over the nanometer scale is required. The present topic areas for the conference include copper electrodeposition in VLSI, magnetic materials, micro electromechanical systems (MEMS), semiconductors, surface characterization, and nanostructures. Under these headings, fundamental aspects of electrocrystallization, the effects of additives on morphological evolution of electrodeposited films, autocatalytic processes, and functional coatings which show promising wear and/or corrosion behavior will be discussed. The conference has seen dramatic growth from the first to the second, and we would like to develop it into a premier materials conference. The NSF funds are used to subsidize the travel and fixed fees of students and young faculty who would not be able to participate without financial support. \r\n%%%\r\nThe Electrodeposition Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is relatively new, having started in 1996. It grew out of the Read Conference, one of the primary scientific forums for the electrodeposition community since the early 50's. Electrodeposition is becoming accepted as a standard thin film synthesis methodology in new areas. A clear example is the adoption of electrodeposition by the electronics industries to form Cu interconnects in VLSI. In addition, it is gaining importance in the formation of magnetic materials, alloys, and the formation of micromachined parts. New areas where it may play a roll include nanofabrication and the formation of compound semiconductor thin films.\r\n***\r\n",
