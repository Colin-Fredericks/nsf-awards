A model reaction will be the hydroformylation reaction catalyzed by rhodium phosphine complexes.  To avoid computationally intensive quantum chemical calculations, the PIs plan to screen homogeneous catalysts using a neural network model based on selectivity data obtained from data on several different ligands.  Catalyst ligand characteristics will be related to selectivity.  Through model predictions additional catalysts can be screened without using ab initio calculations.  Solvent effects on catalytic reactions will also be modeled using several approaches.  The PIs will develop a model for predicting distribution coefficients for a fluorous solvent and supercritical carbon dioxide.   These efforts will complement experimental work currently being carried out in homogeneous catalysis.  This work may lead to an improved methodology for catalyst design and accelerate the use of homogeneous catalysts in industrial processes.\r\n\r\n",
