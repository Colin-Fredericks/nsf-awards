 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis proposal contains several open problems in Geometrical Functional Analysis. \r\nFurthermore it is intended to applyconcepts of Functional Analysis to solve\r\nquestions in Financial Mathematics, in particularin the theory of option  \r\npricing. A long standing open question in Operator Theory asks whether or\r\nnot there exist Banach spaces on which every operator has an invariant subspace.   \r\nIn order to solve this problem the author intends to use and to extend methods \r\nwhich led to the construction of spaces on which every operator is a singular \r\nperturbation of a multiple of the identity.  In recent years the notion of \r\nasymptotic properties of Banach spaces  and their connection to isomorphic \r\nproperties gained increasing attention.  Such properties are  for example the \r\nrecently introduced notion of uniform asymptotic convexity and \r\nuniform asymptotic smoothness. The author of this proposal intends\r\nto find sufficient and necessary isomorphic properties admitting\r\nuniform asymptotic convex and smooth renormings. In a joint work with R. Gardner \r\nand  A. Koldobsky the author applied concepts of Harmonic Analysis to find \r\nconnections between certain extremal properties of convex bodies and higher \r\nderivatives of their section functions.  The author intends to explore this path \r\nfurther to get more inside on other extremal problems.  A central question in \r\nFinance is to find fair prices of options contingent to an underlying security. \r\nMany results in this area  rely on tools developed in Stochastic Calculus as \r\nwell as Functional Analysis. The author intends to investigate the problem of \r\nrobustness of option pricing, i.e. the continuous dependence of the option\r\nprice on the underlying stock model.\r\n\r\n\r\nBanach spaces and their geometry are studied since they provide the natural \r\nframework for studying dynamical systems, differential equations, and,\r\nas discovered recently,  the pricing of financial assets. The proposed projects  \r\ndeal with problems on the geometry of Banach spaces, operators between them, and \r\napplications to the mathematical understanding of finance.\r\n\r\n",
