Exploratory experiments using existing facilities at the NSF Center for Thermal Spray Research at Stony Brook will be conducted for three types of powder materials: ceramic (Al2O3), cermet (WC-Co) and metal (Co).  The particle velocity, temperature and size during in-flight and the evolution of the coating layers will be acquired and data will be used for validating the model.  Thus the model can be further developed and applied to designing and controlling thermal spray processes in the future.  The PI will visit national laboratories and other institutes to establish the collaborative relationship and explore advanced non-intrusive diagnostic techniques for thermal spray research such as Rayleigh and Coherent Thomson Scattering and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy.\r\nThe main objective of the proposed educational activities is to attract student to science and engineering, to motivate them for advanced studies and multidisciplinary research, and to prepare them for career advancement in engineering.\r\n",
