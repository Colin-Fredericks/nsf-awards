 "awd_abstract_narration": "0086643\r\nMcEnery\r\nIn the past few years, several inherited neurological disorders in mice and human have been identified as arising from mutations in voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) subunits. VDCC are assembled from component alpha1, gamma and other accessory subunits and impart temporal and spatial specificity to the influx of calcium across the membrane in response to changes in the transmembrane potential.  The goal of this project is to expand our fundamental knowledge of how alterations in calcium expression and hence, calcium homeostasis, lead to disease. The information derived from this research will contribute to the identification of perturbations in calcium dynamics within neurons and so will aid in the identification of new therapeutic targets in the management of these diseases in human populations.  At the foundation of this study is our detailed biochemical and immunohistochemical diagnosis of epileptic (petit mal seizures) and ataxic stargazer (gamma-2 null), tottering (alpha1A point mutation) and engineered mice that have had the alpha1A gene eliminated (alpha1A knock-out mice). We have identified a reoccurring pattern of cellular defects in hippocampal neurons of these three strains of mice.  The altered expression and localization of gamma and alpha1A subunits evidence this defect.  Hence, we have, as a fundamental starting point, the hypothesis that calcium entry will be altered in hippocampal neurons of these animals compared to controls.  An important aspect of our proposal is the quantitative modeling of the calcium dynamics in mutant neurons.  This will give the localization of the sites of calcium flux, the magnitudes of calcium influx, the degree of calcium buttering, and the assessment of calcium diffusion.  The experimental data to be used in the quantitative modeling will be obtained by employing a variety of techniques (biochemical, immunohistochemical, and optical) analyzed by contemporary fluorescent microscopic instrumentation (fluorescent microscopy, confocal microscopy, and two-photon microscopy).  For calcium imaging studies, we will employ conventional small-molecule calcium indicators with different calcium affinity (Oregon green 488 BAPTA-5N (20 uM), fura-2 (high affinity 145 nM) indo-1 (230 nM) and compare these results with those obtained using a novel calcium indicator, termed cameleon YC3.1 (4 uM).  Cameleons are proteins can be expressed in neurons and have the advantage of functioning as cytosolic calcium indicators when expressed as soluble proteins or functioning as strategically placed calcium indicators when attached, by molecular cloning techniques, to VDCC subunits.  A long term objective is to mate mice that have been engineered to express cameleon YC3.1 as transgenes with our experimental animals (control, stargazer, tottering and the alpha1A knock-out) to establish strains of mice that offer the opportunity to visualize possible defects in calcium homeostasis in living animals.\r\n\r\n",
