 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will be used to support the annual meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM).  The mission of the OHBM is to promote the field of structural and functional brain mapping.  In particular, OHBM emphasizes non-invasive, image-based investigation of the functional organization of the human brain.  The principal activity of the OHBM is to organize an annual, international meeting.  For meetings inside the US, funding will be used for 100 student stipends.  For international venues, funding will be used to pay the cost of invited US speakers.\r\n\r\nThe meetings are relevant to the Human Brain Project in that the presentations relate to the function and structure of the human brain, one-sixth of the scientific program is devoted to the latest methods for image acquisition, and the entire educational program is devoted exclusively to the methods used to study the brain, with a strong emphasis of image analysis and other aspects of nueroinformatics.\r\n\r\nThis research is funded in part by the National Science Foundation through its participation in the Human Brain Project, which is a Federal interagency research initiative, mandated by Congress as part of the \"Decade of the Brain\".\r\n\r\n",
