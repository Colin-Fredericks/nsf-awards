 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\nThis is a proof-of-concept project to demonstrate the feasibility of a Hypermedia approach to materials for undergraduate engineering education.  Highly visual multimedia materials will be developed in the upper-division undergraduate topic area of compressible fluid flow, with strong emphasis on experimental flow visualization.  A prototype CD-ROM is being developed that can be used by instructors and students as a visual supplement to any of the standard textbooks, and that points the way for future development of this educational approach.   The future development may include collaboration with a similar project for development of a CD-ROM for incompressible flow.  This project makes use of the low-cost and ease of use of CD-ROM technology, which is also suitable for national dissemination.  Faculty development is enhanced by providing faculty with an new supplementary teaching tool, while integration of technology is addressed through exercising student use of computers and multimedia in the learning process.  The materials developed here are designed to convey a sense of the laboratory experience, and that of the actual physical appearance of real flow patterns beyond standard text line drawings.  The project is meant to supplement, not replace textbook treatment with highly visual, research-grade material without intimidating the student or sidetracking the standard objectives of an introductory class.  Learning outcomes from the prototype CD-ROM are being evaluated at Penn State University and other institutions.",
