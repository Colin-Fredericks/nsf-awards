Steven de Belle\r\n\r\n\tNeural structures and cellular components participating in associative (Pavlovian) odor learning and memory have been identified by genetic, transgenic and cell ablation studies in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  Anatomical defects in brain structures called mushroom bodies (MBs) and biochemical defects in signal transduction have each (separately) been linked with reduced learning and memory.  Investigations here are divided in two parts and focus on a collection of five Drosophila mutants that have reduced MB phenotypes (mbm, mbmB, mbmC, mbr and smu).  The first goal is to correlate anatomical and memory defects in these mutants with gene expression patterns in MBs.  This will test the hypothesis that genetically defined MB subdivisions are sites of specific biochemical processes underlying one or more sequential phases of memory consolidation.  The second goal is to establish an accurate genetic map for each of the MB structure genes and to isolate new transposon-tagged mutant alleles.  These new alleles will facilitate rapid entry to molecular analyses of MB structure genes.  The long-term hypothesis is that MB structural gene products function in MB development, memory consolidation, or common aspects of both.  The overall significance of the proposed work is an integration of neuroanatomical and biochemical mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity\r\n",
