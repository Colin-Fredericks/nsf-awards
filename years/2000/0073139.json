Using semiarid pinon-juniper woodlands as a study system, this dissertation research will examine the constraints and drivers of woodland dynamics in the context of long-term climatic variation. The research focuses specifically on climatic water balance as a constraint on woodland tree distribution, and seed production and bird-mediated dispersal as processes driving tree migration. The investigators will use remotely sensed tree cover estimates with a spatially explicit water balance model to test the hypothesis that climatic water balance constrains tree distributions. Using tree-ring data, the research will test whether seed production in a dominant woodland tree, Pinus edulis, is triggered by climatic fluctuations associated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. Finally, the links between pinon seedling establishment and caching behavior of its primary disperser, the Pinon Jay, will be investigated. Together, these studies will inform the development of a model of woodland dynamics. This research will increase our understanding of the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of ecosystems and potential responses to climate change\r\n",
