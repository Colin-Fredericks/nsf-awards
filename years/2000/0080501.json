It will consider ways in which scientific, educational, and other interested professional organizations can work together to improve the quality of and accessibility to materials that support the teaching of evolution.  The meeting will be held at the University of California Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley and focus on developing an action plan to ensure that evolutionary principles are taught in pre-college, college, and teacher-preparation classrooms as well as in the informal science environment.  \r\n\r\nEvolution is not an esoteric concept, but rather the unifying concept in biology.  It affects our lives in countless ways, from the food we eat to our view of health.  There remain grave misunderstandings about evolution among both teachers and the general public.  This is of great concern to scientists and educators alike.  There is a need for further support and professional development for teachers on the nature of science, the patterns and processes of evolution, and classroom strategies.  The problem is a complex one and its solution requires a united and proactive effort by the scientific community.  We cannot hope to develop strategies to enhance the delivery of evolution education without involving all constituencies with a vested interest in science education. \r\n",
