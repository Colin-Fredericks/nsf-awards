It is projected that multicast will be increasingly used to support various interactive applications such as video-on-demand, teleconferencing, web servers and E-commerce on the Internet. Many of these applications require not only multicast capability but also predictable performance, such as guaranteed multicast latency and bandwidth, called quality-of-service (QoS). The objective of this research is to design a QoS capable multicast architecture based on multicast networks with built-in QoS functions to support multicast communication. Specially, the research focuses on:\r\n(1) design of basic building-block multicast networks with better QoS functions and lower network cost;\r\n(2) establishing analytical models on performance metrics of statistical QoS-capable multicast architectures;\r\n(3) study of efficient schemes to schedule multicast for different QoS requirements;\r\n(4) building simulation tools for validating theoretical results, and making them available to research community and system designers.\r\n\r\nThis research combines algorithmic, probabilistic, combinatorial, and simulation techniques to conduct comprehensive studies. The proposed research has a significant impact on scalable and high-performance parallel/distributed computing as efficient support for multicast communication can significantly reduce the communication latency and simplify the design and implementation of numerous parallel/distributed applications.\r\n",
