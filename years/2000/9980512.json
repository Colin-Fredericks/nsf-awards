 "awd_abstract_narration": "9980512\r\nJohnson\r\nSeventy-five to eighty percent of the new crust that is generated at the \r\nworld's orogenic arcs in  the Cenozoic can be considered to belong to \r\n\"juvenile\" island or continental arcs, and such settings likely represent \r\nthe major environments where new material is added to the crustal inventory \r\nof the Earth.  However, intracrustal recycling through re-melting of \r\njuvenile arc basement is virtually undetectable in such settings because \r\nthere is virtually no isotopic contrast using traditional isotopic tracers \r\nsuch as O, Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopes.  Assessment of the role of intracrustal \r\nrecycling is critical for calculation of net crustal growth rates.  This \r\nwork will focus on the Re-Os isotope system, which offers an exceptional \r\nmeans to evaluate intracrustal processing in juvenile arcs.  The motivation \r\nfor the proposed research lies in the recognition that basaltic magmas \r\ndevelop extreme fractionations in Re/Os ratios, which will produce \r\nradiogenic 187Os/188Os ratios that far exceed those of the mantle, over \r\nperiods of several to 10's of m.y.  The initial target of the proposed \r\nresearch is the Cascade Arc, NW USA, which is an ideal place to test our \r\nthis hypothesis because the Quaternary centers are constructed on \r\nvoluminous Miocene to Pliocene mafic sequences, and interpretation of the \r\nRe-Os isotope data will not be confused by a) the presence of old \r\n(pre-Cenozoic) sources of Os, b) significant subducted sediment input,\r\nand c) subduction of old oceanic crust.\r\n",
