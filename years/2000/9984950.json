 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a CAREER award to a young member of the faculty at the Louisiana State University.  The PI plans to study morphological instabilities and evolution of microstructures in thin films and ceramics.  There is a second project on diffusion controlled growth of a compound phase AnB between two parallel thin films of material A and B.  Furthermore, following LSU's interest in starting an education and research program in materials science and engineering, the PI proposes to intiate a virtual Materials Center on Internet.  The virtual center will serve to: (1) Introduce and attract undergraduate students to materials science and engineering, (2) Provide a teaching tool for undergraduate laboratory instruction, (3) Coordinate education and research efforts in the state of Louisiana and (4) Schedule equipment use at LSU.  The PI is also planning to introduce two courses, focusing on analytical and numerical techniques applied to real materials related problems, for graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n%%%\r\nThin films are an integral part of the current high technology.  There are a number of issues related to the role of defects in the processing of thin films.  How are the defects formed and how do they grow.   These are critical to a number of materials related precesses such as preparation of electronic materials, healing of cracks in ceramics and the compacting involved during sintering.  This PI plans to develop an academic career supported by this CAREER grant and consisting of research on these areas.  The education plan includes two courses, each involving a judicious mix of mathematics and computers for undergraduate and graduate students in materials.  In addition the PI has proposed to setup a webpage to inform and attract young undergraduates to LSU's materials program.\r\n***  \r\n",
