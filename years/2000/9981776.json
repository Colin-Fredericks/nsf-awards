 "awd_abstract_narration": "9981776  Cooper  This is an award to provide support for preliminary research to evaluate the possible use of enzymatic oxidation for inactivation of microorganisms that are resistant to inactivation by us of processes in current use in environmental engineering practice.  This preliminary work will be aimed at testing the hypothesis that a peroxidase enzyme and an oxidizing agent in combination with an appropriate non-halogenic substrate can function as a disinfection process for domestic wastewater.  Objectives of the planning grant phase will include identification of appropriate substrates, evaluation of the feasibility of the concept and comparison with potential alternatives.  The proposal leading to this award was submitted in accord with Program Announcement NSF 94-147, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Minority Scientists and Engineers.  The proposed research is exploratory in nature.  It addresses the potential use of a concept for disinfection that would complement processes now used in environmental engineering practice and is likely to provide this investigator with the basis for a proposal to obtain sufficient additional knowledge for use in engineering design of disinfection processes and systems.  ***",
