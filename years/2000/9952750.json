 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\nAs decision-makers, engineers must be knowledgeable and competent in multiple aspects of design. Engineering is more than a problem solving activity focusing on simply the expected performance of designed artifacts. Consideration must also be given to the economic consequences of design decisions on life-cycle issues. A major challenge to undergraduate engineering education is to increase student competency in the economic elements that are such a critical part of the engineering process. To succeed, the fundamentals of economics needs to be introduced early and reinforced throughout the undergraduate program.\r\nThe objective of this project is to conduct an experiment to determine whether a virtual classroom environment is improving proficiency in the economic principles of engineering design. As envisioned, the virtual classroom is providing the basic introduction to economics for engineers. Also, it serve as a continuing resource for undergraduates and for practicing professionals. Farther reaching, this research is an integral part of a longer-term and broader vision to build an undergraduate program for selected core courses in the engineering curriculum. It is anticipated that through computer-based learning methods utilized at the undergraduate level, higher quality core engineering courses can be offered to more students in a very cost-effective manner.\r\nThis project is a collaborative effort. At the conclusion of this research, an electronic version of the course will be made available via the Internet and will include modularized course notes, software, materials for testing/assessment, and industrial case studies. The Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) themes directly addressed by this research include faculty development, diversity, and integration of technology in education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
