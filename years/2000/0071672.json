 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at providing Native American undergraduate chemistry and physics majors opportunities to carry out research on the synthesis, characterization, and applications of composite materials formed from solventless reactions of layered silicates with organic monomers and biomolecules.  Three specific research topics will be addressed: synthesis of novel layered silicate clay/polymer composite materials as the active components in chemical sensors; the interaction of biological molecules with layered silicate clay materials.  The educational goals of this project are to train up to five Native American chemistry or physics majors by providing one-on-one faculty mentoring (up through graduation) on research experiences that include all aspects of the research process from project inception to the final reporting of results.\r\n\r\nNew inorganic-organic hybrid composite materials are increasing viewed as important technological materials because of uses that include coatings for chemical sensors, and for biomedical applications such as bone cement and optial implants.  These are excellent areas in which to train students because of the strong job markets due to high industrial relevance.\r\n",
