The Wecoma is a 185 ft. vessel, constructed in 1975, and is owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by Oregon State University.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 187operational days during 2000, of which 101 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support Navy and NOAA projects.  The projects scheduled on the Wecoma represent several oceanographic disciplines, including HOME and GLOBEC projects, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel. Operations in 2000 will mainly take place in the Pacific Ocean between Newport and Honolulu.  An open scheduled period in February and March will be used for maintenance, repairs, and crew training.\r\n\r\nThe Wecoma is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
