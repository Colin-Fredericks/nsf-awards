Organizers are Dr. James D. Stasheff, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Dr. Roberto Trinchero, Centro Atomico Bariloche, Argentina, and Dr. Robert Coquereaux of Centre de Physique Theorique, Marseille, France.  The workshop is designed to introduce participants to aspects of the theory of quantum groups (Hopf algebras) and their applications in theoretical physics and mathematics.  This workshop is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences together with the Division of Physics, the Division of Mathematical Sciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nSymmetries in theoretical physics have long been important and have provided one of the major techniques for investigating the quantum realm.  Besides stimulating interactions between scientists, and strengthening international scientific collaboration, this workshop will enable US and Latin American scientists and students to become aware of the newer developments in this area of research and will help maintain cross-fertilization between the fields of mathematics and physics.  In addition to the US and Latin American participants, the workshop will also bring together leading scientists in the field from Europe.\r\n***\r\n",
