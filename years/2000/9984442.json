 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emphasis of this CAREER project is on improved insulating materials suitable for replacing silicon dioxide in conventional devices/circuits. The structure and electrical characteristics of new insulating films deposited by both conventional and the newly developed methods will be determined.  New real-time interrogation tools will also be developed for monitoring oxide layer growth. These methods stem from extracting information from the inelastically scattered portion of a reflected/diffracted high-energy electron beam; the inelastic portion of the reflected beam carries important information on the chemical composition and short-range order of a growing surface. Real-time access to that information is expected to significantly enhance control over the growth of complex materials like oxides, which can form with a range of stoichiometries and crystal structures. Combining the diffractive and spectroscopic information is expected to lead to a probe that is sensitive to the short-range order of the subset of surface atoms participating in a reconstruction. Interwoven with these efforts in electronic materials, the PI will develop a new laboratory course in Modern Electronics in which students will replicate a Nobel-prize-winning experiment. In addition to assimilating the behavior and uses of discrete electronic components, digital circuits, and computer interface and control techniques,  students will actively explore electronic materials as they re-create the first transistor. Additionally, a laboratory will be revitalized by the PI under the aegis of the present proposal. The experiments and pedagogical style of the lab accompanying calculus-based Electricity and Magnetism will be revised to better serve the educational needs of its students. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in original. Non-science students will also be touched by these activities.  The PI will develop a seminar course to bolster positive representation of scientific inquiry early in students' careers. Students who may become future teachers will be exposed to an in-depth look at the process and results of science, beyond introductory physics courses.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science, physics, and engineering knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic materials and advanced devices/circuits. The scope of the project will expose students to challenges in materials synthesis, processing, and characterization. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and education.\r\n***\r\n",
