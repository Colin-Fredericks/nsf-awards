The models will be derived \r\nsystematically from the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy \r\nby means of asymptotic methods and analyzed using analytical and \r\nnumerical methods. It is proposed to identify mathematical models that \r\ncontain enough details of the real combustion systems and analyze these \r\nmodels in order to gain basic understanding on how the physical and \r\nchemical processes interact in the simpler circumstances. Comparison \r\nwith the experimental record will be performed in order to test the models \r\nand their predictions. The mathematical problems involve nonlinear \r\nevolution equations and nonlinear aspects of flame instabilities.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed work is to gain fundamental understanding \r\nin the complex processes occurring in combustion problems, problems that \r\nare encountered in various engineering applications. Improving our \r\nfundamental understanding of combustion phenomena could suggest new \r\ndirections for applied research and lead to a better design of combustion \r\nsystems. The problems that will be investigated are related to phenomena \r\nthat have been observed in the laboratory but are not yet completely \r\nunderstood. The proposed work will address three classes of problems: \r\nThe first class is concerned with the evolution of premixed flames in open \r\nspace and in confined environments, where the coupled effects between \r\nthe flame and the hydrodynamic field is of primary interest. Studies of \r\npremixed flames have significant technological importance and are \r\ndirectly applicable to internal combustion engines processes. The second \r\nclass of problems is concerned with instabilities in non-premixed \r\ncombustion, or diffusion flames, for which theoretical studies are only \r\nnow emerging. Non-premixed conditions are favored in furnaces for safety \r\nreasons and in diesel engines here the liquid fuel evaporates in the \r\ncombustion chamber providing the necessary fuel vapor that burns with \r\nair. The third class of problems is concerned with flame spread over \r\nflammable liquids, where the combined behaviors in the liquid and gas \r\nphases determine the flame dynamics. Flame spread over an accidental \r\nspillage of a flammable liquid, or a \"running liquid fire\" encountered in \r\npetrochemical industries, can become a fire hazard.\r\n",
