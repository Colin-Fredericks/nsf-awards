 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nCore models are generalizations of Godel's Constructible Universe.\r\nJensen's pioneering work on the fine structure of core models and on\r\ntechniques for constructing core models with large cardinals has led to\r\nmany applications in diverse parts of set theory.  More recently, Martin,\r\nMitchell, Steel, and others have extended earlier work on core models to\r\nthe level of Woodin cardinals.  The investigator's questions concern 1)\r\nthe combinatorial structure of core models, 2) the application of core\r\nmodel techniques in determining the large cardinal consistency strength of\r\nvarious set theoretic statements, 3) the application of core model\r\ntechniques in descriptive set theory, 4) problems in infinitary\r\ncombinatorics, forcing, and model theory that were in part inspired by his\r\nearlier work on core models.\r\n\r\nThe most widely accepted theory (system of axioms) of sets is known as\r\nZFC.  Kurt Godel is famous for having shown that if ZFC is consistent,\r\nthen ZFC is incomplete in the sense that there are statements which are\r\nneither provable nor refutable in ZFC.  This is particularly striking\r\nsince all of mathematics can be expressed in the language of sets and most\r\nmathematicians work exclusively within ZFC.  There are important open\r\nquestions that are not decided by ZFC.  The most famous example is Georg\r\nCantor's Continuum Problem, which Godel showed cannot be answered\r\nnegatively in ZFC and Paul Cohen showed cannot be answered positively in\r\nZFC.  (Cohen received a Fields Medal for this work.) There are many\r\ninteresting extensions of ZFC and the relationships between them are quite\r\ncomplicated.  The investigator's project has to do with a natural\r\nhierarchy of axioms known as the ``large cardinals''.  Many beautiful\r\nresults, including some longstanding conjectures, were proved by a number\r\nof researchers using ZFC and large cardinals in the 1980's and 90's;  \r\nfurther success is anticipated.  And, also, details of how the various\r\ntheories of sets are related have been discovered by comparing these\r\ntheories with the large cardinal hierarchy.\r\n",
