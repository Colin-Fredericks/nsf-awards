 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subdivision was initially conceived as an extension of splines to control meshes of\r\narbitrary topology. Subdivision algorithms, while being more flexible and general,\r\nretain a number of useful properties of splines. Most importantly, the surfaces generated\r\nby these algorithms have a natural hierarchical structure and are computed\r\nusing simple local rules. This allows the design of efficient hierarchical, local, and\r\nadaptive algorithms for rendering, manipulation, collision detection and intersection\r\nof such surfaces. Subdivision surfaces are rapidly gaining wide acceptance in\r\nthe industry. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in understanding\r\nthe properties of the subdivision surfaces, especially smoothness properties. However,\r\nsubdivision still lacks the body of well understood and reliable algorithms\r\navailable for splines and a few practically important aspects of subdivision, such\r\nas subdivision rules for boundaries and singular features, do not have a rigorous\r\ntheoretical foundation. Aside from smoothness, no other property of subdivision\r\nsurfaces has been studied in detail. At the same time, some fundamental limitations\r\nof the commonly used stationary subdivision schemes became apparent. For example,\r\npractical curvature-continuous subdivision surfaces necessarily have a \"flat.\"\r\nspot near extraordinary vertices, and the surfaces acquire ripples near vertices of\r\nhigh valence. The proposed research has three main objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvance the theory of stationary subdivision to include all important practical\r\ncases, and develop the theory necessary to understand fairness, mesh\r\nquality, and approximation properties of subdivision.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelop robust algorithms for common geometric operations such as com-putting\r\ncollisions and intersections of subdivision surfaces;\r\n\r\n\r\nExplore nonstationary subdivision schemes which retain locality, and identify\r\nways to improve the quality of the resulting surfaces without sacrificing\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\nThe three components are unified by a common goal: the development of a\r\nsurface representation supporting highly efficient, local, hierarchical and adaptive\r\nalgorithms for geometric modeling.",
