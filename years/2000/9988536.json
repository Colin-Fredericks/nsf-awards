(HBOI) and supported by the University of Miami RSMAS Marine Technical Support Group under a Cooperative Marine Operations Program (CMOP).  Research vessels involved include the R/Vs Edwin Link, Seward Johnson, and Sea Diver which are operated by HBOI, and the R/V Walton Smith operated by RSMAS; all vessels are dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.  The Project Director, Timothy Askew, is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.  This project will allow the institution to acquire Counter-Balanced Trawl Block, Slip Rings, Markey CTD Winch, ARPA Radar, Rigid Hull Inflatable with Motor, Outboard Motors, and Glosten Stability Program.  \r\n***\r\n",
