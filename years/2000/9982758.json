 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abscisic acid (ABA), like other plant growth substances, has multiple\r\nfunctions in plant growth and development. It is involved in such diverse\r\nphysiological processes as closure of stomata, and seed maturation,\r\ndormancy, and germination. ABA also functions in response to environmental\r\nstresses, such as drought, cold, heat, and salinity through its ability to\r\ninduce expression of specific genes whose products ameliorate the effects\r\nof such stresses. Biosynthesis of ABA is stimulated during water stress, so\r\nthere is a large increase in ABA content during drought. Following\r\nrehydration, ABA is rapidly degraded to phaseic acid (PA). To understand\r\nthe many roles of ABA in plants, it is essential to know how its\r\nconcentration is regulated at the tissue and cellular levels. ABA is\r\nsynthesized from epoxy-carotenoids (C40) by oxidative cleavage to form\r\nxanthoxin (C15) and C25-apo-aldehydes. Xanthoxin is further converted via\r\nABA-aldehyde to ABA. In previous work, a gene encoding the cleavage enzyme,\r\n9-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), was cloned from bean and\r\navocado. Analysis of expression of this gene at the mRNA and protein levels\r\nshowed that the cleavage reaction is the limiting step in ABA biosynthesis,\r\nbeing strongly induced in dehydrated bean leaves and ripening avocado\r\nfruit. At present, the endogenous carotenoid substrate of the cleavage\r\nreaction is not known. Carotenoids are part of the pigment-protein\r\ncomplexes in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. In future work,\r\nthylakoid membranes will be fractionated and analyzed to determine which\r\ncomponent provides the substrate for the cleavage reaction, and to isolate\r\nnative cleavage enzyme from dehydrated leaves. The promoter of the NCED\r\ngene from bean will be fused to the reporter gene encoding\r\ngreen-fluorescent protein and introduced into Arabidopsis. In these\r\ntransgenic plants, expression of the cleavage enzyme will be monitored at\r\nthe organ and cellular levels to determine when and where the cleavage\r\nenzyme is expressed. In further work, the gene encoding the cleavage enzyme\r\nwill be expressed in transgenic plants under the control of a constitutive\r\nor inducible promoter to determine whether the ABA level can be increased\r\npermanently with a constitutive promoter, or transiently with an inducible\r\npromoter. Manipulation of ABA metabolism may produce plants with raised ABA\r\nlevels that are better adapted than normal plants to grow under stressful\r\nconditions. However, ABA causes its own deactivation by inducing ABA\r\n8'-hydroxylase activity, which converts ABA to PA. It is conceivable,\r\ntherefore, that in plants overexpressing NCED, ABA homeostasis is\r\nmaintained due to ABA deactivation. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
