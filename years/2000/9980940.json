 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) Computational Science is a developing interdisciplinary field that combines science, mathematics, and computer science to solve realistic and often complex problems. Computational Physics is a sub-field of both Computational Science and Physics, with the computational techniques and problem-solving orientation giving it a broader viewpoint than normally found in physics. This project builds on a computational physics laboratory and web-enhanced course to develop a four-year undergraduate curriculum in Computational Physics. The computational courses, texts, and seminars are research- and Web-rich, and culminate in a Senior Computational Laboratory derived from graduate thesis work in physics and engineering, and from application priority areas of the National Partnership for Computational Infrastructure. Because the research laboratory for computational physics is actually a virtual world created by the computer, it is easier and quicker to have undergraduates start working in this \"lab\" and involved with research than if they were in \"wet\" labs. This new degree reflects the integrated nature of the program, helps motivate students for the serious commitment needed for interdisciplinary study, and advances the integration of high performance computation and communication into undergraduate education. By leading to a better awareness of the strengths within the Physics Department, this degree can attract students who are best suited to this program, and provide recognition by professional schools and employers of their extraordinary achievement. In addition, this undergraduate program can be used as a stepping stone for further interdisciplinary programs at the graduate and undergraduate levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
