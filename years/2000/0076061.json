 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division and the Electronic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research supports the work of Professors Gregory Girolami and John Abelson of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  The focus of the research is the synthesis of transition metal and lanthanide borohydride complexes and deposition of thin films from them using remote hydrogen-plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. The efficiency and mechanism of thin layer deposition and physical properties of the films prepared are being investigated.  These studies will provide scientific information on bulk diffusion properties and limits of metal borides as diffusion barriers in microelectronic integrated circuits.  In addition, the research provides training to students in an important interdisciplinary area of materials science.\r\n\r\nPure metal borohydrides, which contain only the metal, boron, and hydrogen, are being synthesized and characterized.  Thin films for applications in integrated electronic circuits as barrier materials are being prepared by vapor deposition methods.  In addition, the interdisciplinary approaches of this project provide knowledge and training to students in materials chemistry, synthesis, characterization, and thin film deposition.  The knowledge gained from these studies will have applications in the design and fabrication of integrated circuits for electronic and photonic devices.",
