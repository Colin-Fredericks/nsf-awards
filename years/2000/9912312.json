 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Stony Brook Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Physics brings 13 students to the Stony Brook campus each summer for participation in an 8-week program of forefront research in the laboratories of Stony Brook Physics and Astronomy faculty members. The aim of the program is to encourage interest in careers in physics by the actual doing of research in a collegial setting at facilities at Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory, by weekly seminars on current topics in physics, and finally by oral presentations of student research results in a formal symposium and written reports at the conclusion of the program. Outstanding projects are submitted for presentation at national student research symposia. The program offers research in the areas of astronomy, atmospheric physics, high-energy particles, instructional laboratory instrumentation, lasers and optics, nuclear physics and condensed matter physics. Recruiting efforts concentrate on sophomore and junior level physics majors of high academic standing and promise, many from colleges in which research opportunities are limited. Particular efforts are made to attract women and under-represented minority students.",
