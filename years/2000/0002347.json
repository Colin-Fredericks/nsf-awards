 "awd_abstract_narration": "During recent decades, transnational corporations (TNCs) have rapidly implement new forms of business operation throughout the world.  The impact of TNCs has been especially profound in developing nations, where previous locally oriented economies have been transformed by the influx of foreign capital and managerial control.  An increasingly important question across many nations is the degree to which TNCs impact on local development and on the livelihoods of the people who inhabit regions where they establish new facilities.  This doctoral dissertation research project will evaluate how new transnational corporation business activities are affecting the human, natural, and social resources used by households in the northern Peruvian Andes.  The project will evaluate if and how changing access to resources has affected household livelihoods and intra-household access to resources, especially as differential access is based on gender.  In order to address these questions, three different sets of intensive, semi-structured interviews and focus groups based on intentional and random sampling procedures will be conducted in three communities over the course of eight months in the Cajamarca region of Peru.  In addition, both qualitative text-based of  archival material and analyses of data collected in a geographic information system will be used to evaluate the nature of the relationships between TNCs and livelihood transformation.  The study will generate new basic data on household livelihood production strategies in the Peruvian Andes and how TNCs are contributing to livelihood transformation.  The project also will generate data rgearding how TNC activities are affecting intra-household access to resources based on gender differences.  The project will contribute to a framework of analysis that seeks to understand the different dimensions of local resource change and the links between international economic actors and the local scale.  The field research will contribute to theoretical development in geographic political ecology and feminist political ecology studies, business and economic development research, and Latin American geographic studies.  Furthermore, the project will contribute to academic and policy debates as it will identify and assess the impacts of international corporate mining activities on local capital resources through qualitative and GIS-based methodologies.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
