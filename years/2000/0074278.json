 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will develop new algorithms, mathematical foundations, and a new\r\nprogramming methodology for the fast parallel solution of elliptic\r\nproblems with aspects that are crucial in practice but present serious\r\ndifficulties to existing methods. We will investigate new robust iterative\r\nsubstructuring methods that perform well even in the presence of interface\r\nroughness on element scale. The performance of existing methods\r\ndeteriorates in this case, but smooth decompositions are typically not\r\navailable in practice. We also propose to investigate fast methods for the\r\ndiscretization and iterative solution of high frequency wave propagation\r\nand scattering problems by representing the solution locally as a\r\ncombination of waves on a coarse mesh and exploiting connections with the\r\nfast multipole method. Finally, we propose to develop new programming\r\napproaches and prototype tools for latency tolerant implementation on\r\nparallel machines, transforming a high level program with new directives\r\ninto multiple independent tasks queued on processors.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance the state of the art in modeling complicated\r\nproblems in Mechanical Engineering with irregular geometries on\r\nhigh-performance computers with high accuracy and efficiency, improve the\r\ntechnology underlying radar, sonar, and ultrasound imaging, and create a\r\nnew highly efficient methodology and prototype tools for High-Performance\r\nComputing. Potential applications include computational analysis and\r\nmodeling of automobiles and aircrafts and accurate high resolution\r\nultrasound imaging. It is expected that the new methodology for\r\nHigh-Performance Computing will be important for futuristic technologies,\r\nwhere the speed of light is the limiting factor of communication between\r\nthe processors, as well as for more immediate distributed computing on\r\nnetworks of computers.\r\n",
