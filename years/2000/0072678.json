 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theorems and algorithms for Cooperative \r\nand Dynamic Games:\r\n\r\nT.E.S. Raghavan, University of Illinois at Chicago\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the main problems of the proposal in \r\ncooperative game theory is to find efficient \r\nalgorithms to solve for the nucleolus of \r\ncombinatorial TU games, based on the successful \r\nalgorithms for assignment and interval games.  \r\nA second problem is to study games with stable \r\ncores. In particular to study core stability for \r\ncombinatorial games such as assignment games. \r\nIn coalitional bargaining we will look for subgame \r\nperfect stationary Nash equilibria of perfect \r\ninformation games which approximate in its payoff \r\nthe nucleolus payoff.  In the area of dynamic games, \r\nwe would like to extend the policy improvement \r\nalgorithm for  undiscounted stochastic games \r\nof perfect information. We would formulate models \r\nof tax evasion as dynamic games and study their \r\nequilibria.\r\n\r\nThe  problems in cooperative games posed above \r\nare physically motivated by the following questions. \r\nFederal and state governments undertake costly construction \r\nfacilities like bridges, freeways,  water and sewer pipes,  \r\nrailroads and airports.  Often   the critical  decision \r\nfacing the government is to distribute the total cost \r\namong the users in an equitable way.  The algorithms to \r\nbe developed will help to arrive at such equitable costs \r\nafter properly modeling the problems as cooperative games.  \r\nTax offices are flooded with tax returns;  Indutrial \r\ncorporations are flooded with  vouchers for payment \r\napproval; automobile manufacturers are supplied with large \r\nconsignment of automobile parts for quick acceptance. \r\nAuditors are few in number to audit all tax returns; \r\naccountants are few to check all vouchers; laborataries \r\nand manpower are limited to test for all defective items.  \r\nOne can classify the tax returns or vouchers or suppliers \r\ninto various categories and make decisions on which items \r\nin the tax return or voucher to audit; what percent of \r\ndefective items in a sample require acceptance or more \r\ntesting. Depending on the outcome of auditing, or sequential \r\nsampling one can  make new decisions on  how frequently \r\none should audit the future returns and vouchers from \r\nthe specific class of violators.  In polluting the \r\nenvironment, the violators are often big manufacturers. \r\nIf the pollutants are distinct, then polluters are some \r\nwhat identifiable and the cost of cleaning can be \r\ndecentralized. If the pollutants are of a few type, then \r\none knows roughly which  groups of polluters could have \r\ncontributed to which type. The levels of violation would \r\nrequire sporadic or systematic inspection.  In a way \r\nthe total cost has to be collected by suitable taxing \r\npolicies that could vary depending on the levels of \r\npollution. For an ordinary home owner sewer charges are \r\nsimply tied to the water usage.  When the polluters are \r\nconfounded one has to identify polluters by sending  \r\ninspectors now and then to make spot check for \r\nenvironmental violations and punish violators by \r\nvarious penalties.  In such problems the algorithms \r\nto be developed will show the formal ways of arriving at \r\ncost figures or inspection strategies that are both \r\nintuitively and scientifically defendable. \r\n",
