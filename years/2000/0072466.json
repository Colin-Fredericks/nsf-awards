The theoretical description of the process of meson decay results in one of the most accurate predictions in QCD, the quantum field theory that describes the properties of the strong interaction between quarks.  The present experiment will measure the lifetime with an accuracy of ~1.4% which is consistent with the theoretical uncertainties. It is one of the fundamental experiments in nuclear physics.\r\n\tThe neutron is an electrically neutral particle. Nevertheless it \r\npossesses an electromagnetic structure. The \"Gen\" experiments address the fundamental issue of the electromagnetic structure of the neutron by performing precise measurements of the neutron electric and magnetic form factors, Gen and Gmn. The knowledge of the internal structure of the neutron is needed for benchmark calculations in nuclear structure and QCD. Despite its fundamental importance, Gen is still poorly known, and stands as a significant challenge for the experimentalists.\r\n\tBesides its scientific importance the proposed research  program will provide our students with unique research opportunities in experimental nuclear physics, and therefore will have a very strong impact on their training and education.\r\n",
