 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nAn extension of a meshless method for the numerical solution of\r\npartial differential equations based on radial basis functions is\r\nproposed. In particular, the combination of (1) radial\r\nbasis functions, (2) compact support, and (3) multilevel algorithms is\r\nsuggested for the collocation solution of nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations. In this manner accurate and computationally \r\nefficient algorithms can be designed. The research focuses on the\r\nimplementation of these algorithms, as well as the investigation of\r\nsome related theoretical issues such as convergence rates and\r\nwell-posedness. \r\n\r\nPartial differential equations play an important role in many areas of\r\nscience and engineering. They are at the core of many mathematical\r\nmodels used, e.g., meteorological models, molecular simulations in\r\nchemistry and physics, simulations in such areas as semiconductor\r\nmodeling, study of materials, fluid dynamics, etc.. In this project we\r\nfocus on the design of algorithms potentially applicable to any of\r\nthese areas. Algorithms for high-performance parallel hardware are\r\nalso considered. The tools employed (radial basis functions) are of\r\nfairly recent origin (1980s), but are slowly being accepted by a\r\ngrowing number of scientists and engineers. Their main advantage is\r\nthat no complicated (and expensive) underlying mesh structure is\r\nrequired as is for the standard finite element or finite volume\r\ntechniques. \r\n",
