 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis research program will develop and investigate the fundamental physics of the operation of two classes of novel modelocked semiconductor lasers: 1) a compact, high average power femtosecond modelocked diode laser, and 2) a multi-wavelength modelocked semiconductor diode laser.  The salient feature of these new modelocked diode lasers is that it has the potential to exploit intracavity filtering techniques, to control both the spectral amplitude and phase of the output, and as a result, precisely control the output temporal electric field characteristics of the laser.  The successful completion of this program may allow for controllable output optical pulse shapes directly from a modelocked diode laser, and may potentially realize an \"arbitrary optical waveform generator\".\r\n\r\nNovel applications of the laser system will be developed with interactions from industrial participants, in order to facilitate technology transfer.  Applications will be focused on photonic network and instrumentation applications using a hybrid WDM-TDM technology architecture, such as terabit optical links, THz analog optical links, 100 Gsps optical analog to digital converters, and arbitrary optical waveform generation, real time nonlinear multi-wavelength signal processing, and real-time recording and retrieval of high density, massively parallel, multilayer-multiwavelength compact disc optical memories. \r\n\r\nThe success of this type of opto-electronics and photonics program will enable the training of students in technically vital areas of optics, communications, and signal processing.  In addition to outstanding academic training, fundamental processing, packaging and manufacturing skills will be obtained by participating graduate students, thus enabling students to provide timely impact to prospective employers upon their graduation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
