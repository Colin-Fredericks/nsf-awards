The project will consist of three studies.  Study 1 uses a test-retest experiment to assess the impact of female IT role models on stereotypes and level of knowledge about IT.  Study 2 is longitudinal; undeclared students' course taking patterns in IT will be followed from their first semester to the end of their third year.  Study 3 is also longitudinal and examines predictors of undergraduate women's retention in IT.  This research will look at interest in IT along a continuum ranging from complete lack of interest, to lukewarm interest (taking a general level course which does not carry credit toward the major), to more serious interest (taking an introductory course designed for potential majors), to committed interest (declaring the major).  Likewise, the study of attrition will look not only at female IT majors who drop out of IT but also at women who leave the IT pipeline after taking only one or two courses.  This project has the potential to provide significant insights about the recruitment and retention of women in IT majors.\r\n",
