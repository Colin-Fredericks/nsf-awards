 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-supported research will be on the grammar of Northern\r\nPaiute (Numic, Uto-Aztecan).  The dissertation, Aspects of Northern Paiute\r\nGrammar, will be an exploration of word-formation processes, syntax, and\r\ndiscourse-related topics surrounding referent-tracking and topicality and\r\nwill include a body of analyzed texts.  The dissertation topic was chosen\r\nto accomplish two interconnected aims:  1)  present a thorough description\r\nof the major aspects of Northern Paiute grammar and 2)  provide the\r\nlinguistics community with information for theoretical and comparative\r\npurposes on a language about which very little has ever been published.\r\n\r\nThe project includes text collection and analysis as the basis for\r\nexploring various aspects of Northern Paiute grammar.  Texts of various\r\ngenres -- traditional, ethno-historical, and autobiographical narrative as\r\nwell as the recounting of daily experiences and conversation in the\r\nlanguage -- will be recorded, analyzed, and entered into a computer\r\ndatabase; this will ensure a variety of grammatical forms and styles in\r\ncontext for this and future studies as well as provide the community with\r\ndocumentation of the language for the purpose of preservation.  Members of\r\nthe Burns Paiute community will assist in this project both in the role of\r\nconsultants and, through training, in the process of transcription and\r\ntranslation.  This will help to ensure that tribal members will be able to\r\ncontinue their involvement in documentation and preservation efforts.\r\n\r\nBesides using audio tape to record texts, video recordings will\r\nalso be made.  From the point of view of text analysis, video provides\r\ninsight into the text in ways that audio cannot--most notably by including\r\ngestural content.  From the perspective of the community, video is often\r\nmore accessible, particularly to younger generations, and can be more\r\neasily utilized in language teaching situations.  This project is\r\nspecifically designed to benefit two communities:  1) the scientific\r\ncommunity in linguistics, by providing important data on a\r\nlittle-documented and endangered human language, and 2) the Northern\r\nPaiute communities who wish to have more information\r\non their language of heritage.",
