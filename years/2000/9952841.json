 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nPeople who make technical decisions must be educated to make good ethical decisions. Many computer science departments do not explicitly teach computer ethics, professional ethics, or computers and society issues. Not enough CS faculty are willing and able to teach such courses. Another glaring problem in computer science education is the discipline's poor record for attracting and retaining women students and faculty. This project educates and supports computer science faculty who want to teach computer ethics and who are concerned about the gender imbalance in the field of computer science.\r\n.\r\nWeb-based materials for teaching computer ethics to undergraduate computer science majors are being developed.  The materials are being closely integrated with the upcoming third edition of Computer Ethics by Deborah Johnson. The materials are designed for classes that are online or face to face, semester or quarter, and at any undergraduate level. The materials emphasize computer ethics theory and analytical skills, professional ethics, and gender issues. These materials do not duplicate existing materials, but, with permission, link to existing materials.  This project is working collaboratively with DUE 9980768, which is developing case studies based upon the ImpactCS Project guidelines for learning objectives.\r\n\r\nEach summer for three years, a week long summer workshop is being conducted to enable participants to use the Web materials and WebCT to prepare their computer ethics class. Faculty participants are learning ethical theory and practice skills in ethics teaching, online education, and evaluation and assessment techniques. During the academic year, faculty have access to the investigators. Faculty participants are using materials provided by the investigators and materials they develop themselves. The investigators and faculty participants are collaborating in evaluation of materials as they are used with students.  \r\n\r\nFormative and summative evaluations are being conducted by an evaluation expert to assess the ease of use of web-based materials developed on a common platform, the integration of materials with the textbook, the level of confidence of faculty to teach the new material, and the student learning as measured by tests, projects and ethical attitude surveys.  Dissemination is being accomplished through the faculty workshops, the web site, and commercial publication of the materials in conjunction with the textbook.  \r\n",
