 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract.\r\n\r\nThe project outlines  scientific activity in three directions. The first \r\nis the theory of coupled map lattices (CML) where research is focused \r\non the thermodynamical limit for infinite-dimensional SRB measures \r\n(in the sense of Sinai); stability of traveling wave solutions, and \r\ntransition from CMLs to PDEs via traveling waves.\r\nIt also includes the study of some well-known PDEs (for example, \r\nSwift-Hohenberg equation which is of great interest in neurobiology).  \r\nThe second direction is concerned with the dimension theory of dynamical \r\nsystems and includes the multifractal analysis of Birkhoff averages \r\nwith applications to some problems in number theory as well as\r\nthe multifractal rigidity phenomenon for conformal expanding maps. \r\nThe third direction of research deals with some recent advantages \r\nin smooth ergodic theory. In particular, it is proposed to construct \r\nsome new examples of volume preserving diffeomorphisms\r\nwith non-zero Lyapunov exponents (on any Riemannian manifold and \r\nwith countable number of ergodic components). It is also proposed \r\nto effect a multifractal formalism for two-dimensional hyperbolic \r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the proposed research is to develop further the \r\nmathematical theory of chaos.  It deals with various aspects of \r\nthis theory including the appearance of chaotic motions in dynamical \r\nsystems (which are mathematical models of various phenomena in \r\nphysics, biology, economics, etc. ) and the interplay between chaotic \r\nregimes and fractal geometric structure of the space. It is proposed \r\nto study some macro-characteristics of chaotic behavior (such as \r\nentropy and Lyapunov exponents) and relate them to fractal dimension \r\nof the space. It is also proposed to construct some new examples of \r\nchaotic systems both conservative and dissipative, finite-dimensional \r\nas well as infinite-dimensional. These examples may serve as models \r\nof such extremely complicated phenomena as turbulence in hydrodynamics, \r\nneuron and memory activity in neuroscience, plant growth in plant biology, etc.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
