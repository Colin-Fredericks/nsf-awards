 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to the University of California-San Diego under the direction of Dr. Ahmed-W.M Elgamal, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, \"Interactive Web-Based Experimental and Computational Learning Environments for Earthquake Engineering Research and Education.\"  This project will integrate state-of-the-art earthquake engineering experimental and computational research into the undergraduate and graduate educational process.  The proposed developments will employ Internet web-based technologies to allow for real-time video monitoring, control, and execution of appropriate cutting-edge experimental research efforts in earthquake engineering.  Such setups include large shake-table earthquake experiments, centrifuge geomechanics tests, and dynamic tests of actual large buildings. Course modules will be developed to incorporate these unique experiments and associated computational-simulation codes at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Appropriate quantitative instructional measures will be employed to dictate the direction and achieve the most effective educational goals.  A multi-disciplinary approach will involve researchers from Earthquake Engineering, and appropriate Internet Networking and Instructional Technology experts.  UCSD and Caltech conduct major earthquake experimentaion efforts, and constitutes an optimal environment for development of the proposed education and research objectives.  Signicant collaboration opportunities will be facilitated through interaction between earthquake engineering and ongoing Internet-based research at the UCSD San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC).  On the national scene, dissemination will be facilitated through the the three US national earthquake centers (PEER, MAE, and MCEER).",
