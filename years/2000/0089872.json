Zanutto\r\nTitle:  Collaborative Research: Statistical Methodology for Studying Women and Minorities in Information Technology Careers Using CPS and SESTAT Data\r\n\r\n\r\nThis CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to find a statistical methodology for dealing with the limitations of data sets with small sample sizes for special subgroups of interest.  The data sets to be used for the study are the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the NSF's SESTAT database.  The researchers propose to study, develop, and demonstrate methods of statistical inference that will provide improved inferential conclusions than currently appear in the literature.  These methods will address questions of whether or not, after taking into account all the relevant background characteristics such as education and experience, there are disparities in salary, promotion rates, and job responsibilities among women and underrepresented minorities in IT.  They will also attempt to identify unique characteristics of successful women and underrepresented minorities in IT careers. This project has the potential to provide improved methodology for researchers using the CPS and SESTAT data sets as well as insights about women and underrepresented minorities who pursue IT careers.\r\n",
