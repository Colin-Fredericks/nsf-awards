One of MESA's pre-college initiatives uses culture-based mathematics activities to reach hundreds of American Indian students in remote rural areas. MESA's community college program offers tutoring and collaborative group learning to help underrepresented minority science and mathematics majors successfully transfer to four-year institutions.  In 1999, 244 MESA community college students transferred to four-year universities.  At the undergraduate level, MESA supports engineering and computer science majors through scholarships, internship opportunities, tutoring and group study.  Over 12% of the nation's underrepresented engineering baccalaureate recipients are MESA graduates.",
