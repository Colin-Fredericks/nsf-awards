 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of a methodological and an auction-theoretic section. The former extends\r\nthe literature on the foundational theory of extensive games by introducing the notion of\r\nepistemic priorities and analyzing its implications. The latter applies the foundational approach\r\nto game theory to the study of standard and novel auction mechanisms; hence, it helps clarify the\r\nconnections between the predictions of auction theory, and its underlying behavioral and\r\nepistemic assumptions.\r\n\r\nThe notion of epistemic priority reflects the idea that players may entertain various hypotheses\r\nabout their opponents, and rank them according to their plausibility. Epistemically prioritized\r\nhypotheses form the basis for an axiomatization of solution concepts incorporating forward\r\ninduction, but are also useful in understanding the role of belief consistency in equilibrium\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of auctions employs normal- and extensive-form rationalizability, augmented with\r\nappropriate assumptions on bidders' mutual beliefs. This project develops general techniques to\r\nsolve a variety of \"standard\" auction mechanism under different assumptions about payoffs and\r\ninformation. This methodology is then employed to assess the robustness of \"classical\" results in\r\nauction theory, such as revenue equivalence / revenue ranking of different auction formats, bid\r\nshading in first-price auctions, and demand reduction in uniform-price auctions.\r\n",
