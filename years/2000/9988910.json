There is a new and \r\ngrowing effort to understand complex systems and complexity \r\nthat has stimulated widespread interest in the scientific \r\ncommunity. Scientific sessions will focus on unified \r\nconceptual and mathematical strategies and their applications \r\nto physical, biological and social systems. The conference \r\nincludes pedagogical sessions for students and topics of \r\ninterest and concern to the public that will serve as \r\nvehicles of education and communication for a broader \r\naudience. Various conferences and workshops have addressed \r\naspects of these growing efforts to understand complex \r\nsystems. However, the ICCS is the only major international \r\nconference series to bring the wide diversity of research \r\ntogether, demonstrating the interdisciplinary yet \r\nintegrative and coherent nature of these efforts. This \r\nconference series is organized by the New England Complex \r\nSystems Institute (NECSI).\r\n\r\n",
