Although many questions in hydrology, hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry can be addressed by detailed spatial mapping and time series measurements of the chemical and isotopic composition of water, field logistics of large sampling programs prohibit collection of sufficient number of samples to answer those questions.  Commercially available automatic samplers are relatively expensive and are designed for use in developed water systems, limiting their utility in many studies of natural systems.  The sampler will be housed in a water tight case and deployed directly within the body of water to be sampled (e.g. rivers, lakes, springs, caves, estuaries).  The sampler will consist of individual spring loaded syringes that are sealed by solenoid valves operated by a microprocessor.  When a valve opens, the spring expands and pulls a water sample into the syringe.  The valve then closes, sealing the water in the syringe.  The sampler as planned will be inexpensive (~$500) and simple to construct and operate.  The sampler will be used initially for on-going studies of karst hydrogeology.  Its design will be described in publications and diagrams of the system will be made available on the world wide web, thereby insuring a wide distribution, continued technical development, and addition of new applications.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
