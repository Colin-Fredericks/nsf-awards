This is a timely and very important project, as universities and other deliveries of training and education struggle to re-define their teaching methods given the extraordinary changes just beginning due to ubiquitous high-performance computing and networking.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is related to an overall effort by NSF and others to foster the development of the Learning Federation (LF), a fledgling research organization designed to undertake research in this area.  As envisioned by the organizers, the Learning Federation will model itself after consortia such as Sematech in the semiconductor industry; it will support pre-competitive, not-for-profit research among a consortium of industry, government, foundations and universities and will be managed and governed by the consortium members.  The LF goal is to achieve a critical mass of projects by providing long-term, stable, \"large-grain\" funding for interdisciplinary research teams.  The LF will fund basis learning science and technology as well as appropriate uses of technology and experimental content such as libraries of learning objects and courses.  The focus will initially be on undergraduate, graduate, and life-long learning.  The result will be a next generation of learning environments suited to a network context\r\n.",
