The organizers wish to have broad international representation and to have participation by both acknowledged leaders and promising newcomers to this field.  A special effort is made to support and include junior faculty amongst the invited speakers and to promote contributions from graduate students and postdocs.\r\n%%%\r\nThe primary sponsor of the sponsor of the symposium is the Division of Polymeric Materials Science  & Engineering (PMSE) of the American Chemical Society (ACS) with secondary sponsorship by the Division of Polymer Chemistry (POLY) of the SCS and the Optical Society of America (OSA).  The principal objective of this symposium is to promulgate the science and technology of organic and polymeric materials with novel and useful optical and electronic properties.  This symposium is designed to bring together organic chemists, polymer scientists, optical physicists and device specialists to discuss materials science capabilities and photonic and optoelectronic device requirements so that their combined efforts may lead to new advances.\r\n",
