 "awd_abstract_narration": "Programs written in non-object-oriented languages often include conceptual objects.  Making the objects explicit makes the program easier to understand and to maintain, and increases opportunities for code reuse.  However, manually transforming a non-objected -oriented program into an object-oriented one is a difficult and time-consuming task.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is the design and implementation of a software-reengineering tool that will improve legacy code by making it more object-oriented.  In particular, given a set of variables that are to become the fields of a class, the tool will identify code segments that should be \"extracted out\" to become methods of the class.  This process will be guided by a set of heuristics for identifying candidate code segments, a set of correctness criteria for determining which candidates are feasible (i.e., can be extracted into methods while preserving program semantics), and a set of evaluation criteria for choosing the best candidates.\r\n",
