The project focuses on three specific systems: the\r\nbacterial flagellar motor, the motor protein dynein, and protein\r\ntranslocation systems found in membranes of the endoplasmic\r\nreticulum and mitochondria.  While the biology involved in these\r\nsystems is very different, the same mathematical techniques are\r\napplicable for analyzing theoretical models of all three.  To\r\nmodel these systems requires the use of Langevin or stochastic\r\ndifferential equations.  The randomness in these equations comes\r\nfrom two sources, thermal diffusion and chemical kinetics.\r\nThermal fluctuations are characterized by the diffusion\r\ncoefficient, which can be measured experimentally, and many of\r\nthe important reaction rates are known from biochemical studies.\r\nIn addition to molecular collisions, electrostatic interactions\r\nare the other dominant forces involved in these transport\r\nsystems.  If available, structural data are used to determine the\r\nrelevant electrostatic potentials.  Once model equations for the\r\nsystems have been developed, numerical and analytical techniques\r\nare used to compare their behavior with experimental data.  The\r\nfinal phase of the analysis is to use the mathematical models to\r\nproduce experimentally testable predictions.\r\n     Biological molecular motors are nanometer-sized engines that\r\nuse chemical energy to generate force.  A well known molecular\r\nmotor is myosin, which is the protein responsible for muscle\r\ncontraction.  Other examples include the flagellar motor, which is\r\nused by bacteria for swimming, and dynein, which produces the\r\nforce necessary for cilia motion.  The broad goal of this project\r\nis to gain a mechanistic understanding of force generation in\r\nboth these systems.  Current experimental techniques are allowing\r\nbiophysicists to study molecular motors at the single molecule\r\nlevel, thereby allowing the mechanical properties of motor\r\nproteins to be measured.  These new physical data in conjunction\r\nwith structural data provide the impetus for renewed theoretical\r\ninvestigations into molecular motor function.  An important reason\r\nfor performing a mathematical analysis of force generation is\r\nthat it allows a quantitative comparison between experimental\r\ndata and model behavior to be made.  The results of such a\r\ncomparison not only are important for model validation, but also\r\ncan be used to uncover errors in the assumptions underlying the\r\nmodel.  However, the significance of mathematical modeling goes\r\nbeyond model validation and lies in its predictive power.  Once a\r\ntheoretical model has been developed that is consistent with\r\ncurrent experimental data, it is straightforward to extend the\r\nanalysis to include situations that have not yet been\r\ninvestigated in the laboratory.  If model predictions are borne\r\nout by experiment, further confidence in the reality of the model\r\nis gained.  For the systems under consideration in this project,\r\nthis means a mechanistic understanding of force generation has\r\nbeen achieved.  From a technological standpoint, the results of\r\nthese investigations should be relevant for designing and\r\nfabricating manmade nanomachines.\r\n",
