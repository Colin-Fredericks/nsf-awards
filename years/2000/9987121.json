 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) is an independent, non-sectarian, not-for-profit co-educational university which serves culturally diverse students pursuing degrees in a number of  disciplines, including aerospace engineering, computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering, all disciplines which NSF seeks to support under this Program Announcement (NSF 99-121).  The applicant in this case is the Prescott campus of the University and is referred to as ERAU-Prescott.\r\n\r\n\tThe NSF is offering to fund scholarships to low income students, who may also be ethnic minorities, in  pursuing degrees in the fields mentioned above.  ERAU-Prescott believes that it is perfectly positioned to offer these NSF scholarships for a number of reasons:  1)  Arizona and New Mexico are at or near the bottom of the 'poverty' level meaning that there are many financially-disadvantaged students, particularly ethnic minorities, who are in the  'target' population which the NSF Program seeks to help;  2). ERAU-Prescott is a relatively small private 'teaching' University, dedicated to preparing undergraduates for entry into industry or graduate school; it has a history of helping students to become successful;  3).  a number of current students in the relevant degree programs are 'Pell Grant' eligible;  4).  the applicant has a positive relationship with a number of aerospace and electronics firms,  which affords special opportunities for its students for summer research, co-operative assignments, and new graduate hiring;   5).  the applicant has made a substantial financial commitment to the NSF program, agreeing to augment the NSF funds with major institutional  scholarships, offering material leverage to NSF funding\r\n\r\nThe proposal seeks to accomplish the Outcome Objectives of having the NSF scholarship recipients: 1).   complete their chosen undergraduate degree at the rate of 85%; 2) gain employment in their chosen fields upon graduation at the rate of  95%; and,  3). gain entry into graduate school at the rate of 90% of those who apply.  It undertakes to achieve these Outcome Objectives by using a series of Process Objectives which include: a).  aggressive recruitment, primarily at community colleges, of academically superior, low-income students; b).  a plan to orient, motivate and ready the students for rigorous academic performance; c). a plan to support the students through a professor-Mentor and advising program and, d). a plan to help them gain employment in their degree fields, or be accepted in graduate school.\r\n\r\n\tThe Plan of Operation sets forth how and where recruitment will be done, how individual students will be assessed, monitored and assisted, how high quality scholarly activities will be incorporated in their experience, what type of faculty will be involved in mentoring and providing guidance for the students to prepare for the rigors of industry or graduate school, including research and project preparation and presentation, and how ERAU-Prescott plans to inform industry about the NSF program. \r\n\r\nHighly qualified personnel have been selected as personnel to carry out the Project and a plan is in place to ensure proper and efficient management of the Project.  An Evaluation Plan, which includes both formative and summative evaluations, write-ups,  and reports on the quantified measures selected, will help the applicant and NSF to properly evaluate the success of the Project.\r\n\r\n",
