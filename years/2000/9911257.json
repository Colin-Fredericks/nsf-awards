 "awd_abstract_narration": "SES-9911257\r\nPresser\r\n\r\nThis study examines, for the first time, the relationship between disability and nonstandard hours of employment among employed Americans.  Two basic hypotheses are addressed: (1) disabled workers are more likely than other workers to be employed evenings, nights or on rotating shifts; and (2) disabled workers are more likely to receive lower wages and less fringe benefits than other workers, particularly if they are working nonstandard hours, and if they are disabled.  It is expected that these relationships will hold true in when multivariate analyses that control for differences in social and demographic factors are performed.  It is also expected that there will be significant interaction effects showing that the nature of these relationships is conditional upon, race, ethnicity, and gender.\r\n\r\nA nationally representative survey, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 1996 Household Component, will be used to test these hypotheses.  For the purposes of this study, the sample is limited to individuals aged 18 and over (approximately 14,800 individuals), and will focus primarily on the subset of those employed.  This is the first time this federal survey has included information on which hours Americans are employed as well as how many hours.  Such data allow for exploratory research to test the proposed hypotheses and lay the groundwork for future sociological research in this area.  By considering disability jointly with issues of race, ethnicity, and gender, all in the context of employment during nonstandard work hours, the research will increase our understanding of the nature of social inequality and social stratification-areas central to sociological theory and analysis.  Further, the study should better inform public policy seeking to improve the employment situation of disabled persons.\r\n",
