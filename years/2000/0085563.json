In order to assess the habitability of Europa, Dr. Richard Greenberg and colleagues at the University of Arizona will investigate the character of its surface, with particular attention to testing whether and how a liquid water ocean interacts with the surface through the ice crust.  He will test models of crustal processes by continuing quantitative assessments of spacecraft data and theoretical studies of the mechanics of the underlying processes involved. From those results, the research team will describe the character, locations and time changes of Europan environments most benevolent to life. The goal is to characterize the physical conditions, diversity, and variability of potentially habitable settings on Europa. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses issues raised by a model of Europa's crustal processes in which much of the geology of the surface is governed by interaction with an ocean under only a very thin crust, thus providing a variety of evolving environmental niches. Dr. Greenberg and his team have constructed that model based on quantitative analysis of observations, combined with calculations of the effects of tidal processes, which control heat, stress, and rotation. They have confirmed that surface lineaments are correlated with global stress patterns, demonstrating that they form by lithospheric cracking, but only if a substantial ocean is present to give adequate tidal amplitude.  While the evidence for this broad picture is compelling, the model is not proven and important issues remain unresolved. This project is aimed at testing the thin-ice model by an interdisciplinary range of investigations and comparing it with alternative possibilities, such as a model of a thicker ice crust in which surface processes are governed by solid-state viscous flow. This work will define and constrain the range of possible habitable environments, because of the implications regarding linkage of the crust to the ocean.  This project is funded through the Division of Astronomical Sciences for the NSF's Life in Extreme Environments program.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
