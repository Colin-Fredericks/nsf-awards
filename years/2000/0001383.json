 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nWith National Science Foundation support Dr. Sharon Steadman and her \r\ncolleagues will conduct two field seasons of archaeological research in the Yozgat province of \r\ncentral Turkey  (Anatolia), at the site of Cadir Hoyuk. The team consists of \r\nfield archaeologists, specialists in faunal analysis, paleobotany, lithics analysis, and ceramic \r\nanalysis. Investigation will concentrate on the prehistoric occupation at the site of \r\nCadir Hoyuk in the north central Anatolian plateau, primarily on the Chalcolithic and Early \r\nBronze I periods (ca. 5000-3000 B.C.) prior to the rise of the early second millennium state-level \r\nsocieties. The lack of extensive prehistoric remains in this region has left a large gap in the \r\nunderstanding of the transition in the north central plateau culture history from the early \r\nfarming/herding settlements in the fifth/fourth millennia to the rise of the Hittite Empire/State in the \r\nearly second millennium B.C.\r\n\t \r\nPrevious work in this region has demonstrated that the Chalcolithic and \r\nEarly Bronze periods  witnessed extensive socio-economic changes, including \r\nthe rise of long-distance (\"international\") trade, the influx of a new, migratory, population, and the \r\ndevelopment of increasingly complex society (culminating in the second millennium Hittite \r\nempire). However, previously excavated sites were lacking in continuous occupation, making the \r\ndocumentation of a lengthy and coherent occupational sequence impossible. Dr. Steadman's previous work at Cadir Hoyuk has demonstrated that this is a multi-period site, with a long occupational sequence.The NSF-funded research program will focus on the following three \r\ninvestigative goals:\r\n\r\n 1. What was the nature of the indigenous Chalcolithic/EB occupation in this \r\nregion of\r\n Anatolia? \r\n 2. What was the nature and extent of long-distance trade in the north central \r\nplateau region?\r\n  3. What impact did the Late Chalcolithic arrival of a new population (later \r\nto become the second millennium Hittite State) have on the indigenous Anatolian \r\nsocio-economic\r\n organization? \r\n \r\nThe proposed fieldwork provides previously unavailable insight into the north \r\ncentral plateau occupational history before, during, and after two important events in this \r\nregion's prehistoric sequence: the florescence of long-distance exchange, and the arrival of \r\nimmigrants who forever after changed the nature of central Anatolian demographics. The site \r\nof Cadir Hoyuk has the utmost potential to provide answers to the proposed research \r\nquestions and will go far in enabling us to establish a secure prehistoric cultural sequence for this \r\nlittle understood region of the Anatolian plateau.\r\n\r\n",
