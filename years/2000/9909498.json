 "awd_abstract_narration": "9909498\r\nBarros\r\n\r\nOne of the most provocative - yet largely untested - recent hypotheses concerning orogenic evolution is that regional variations in climate strongly influence spatial variations in the style and magnitude of deformation across an actively deforming orogen.  Recent progress in quantifying rates of both tectonic and geomorphic processes and in modeling surface and lithospheric processes sets the stage for an integrated, quantitative, field-and model- based investigation of the interactions and feedbacks between geomorphic, climatic, and tectonic processes.  This project involves an examination of these interactions where they are likely to be most clearly expressed:  the Nepalese Himalaya.  Not only is this the quintessential colloisional orogenic belt, but its topographic growth and erosional history have been suggested as key controls on global climatic changes.  The integrated study focuses on a major transverse catchment, stretching from the edge of the Tibetan Plateau to the foreland and traversing some of the highest topography in the world.  This transect spans the major structural elements of the Himalaya, as well as monsoon-to-rainshadow climatic conditions.  The Principal Investigators bring together expertise in process-based geomorphology, glaciology, climatology, structural geology, thermochronology, cosmogenic radionuclide dating, modeling, and documentary film making for a multi-pronged approach intended to evaluate one overarching, but largely untested hypothesis:  Rates of erosion vary spatially as a function of climate and this spatial variability in erosion controls the partitioning of deformation within an orogen.\r\n*** \r\n\r\n",
