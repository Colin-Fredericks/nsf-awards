 "awd_abstract_narration": "0000395\r\nFurse\r\n\r\nThe 2000 IEEE-AP/URSI Conference on Antennas and Propagation is an annual international conference co-sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), and the Union of Radio Science international (URSI).  The conference regularly draws about one thousand participants representing academia and industry.  The Antennas and Propagation Society of the IEEE along with several subgroups of URSI will meet in Salt Lake City, Utah in July 2000.\r\n\r\nEach year, the Antennas and Propagation Society promotes student participation in the conference through a number of mechanisms.  One of the most important is the Student Paper Competition at the conference.  This selective program brings the world's best students together in an integrated program in which they present their work to a technical audience including a group of judges.  The program helps develop the students' technical audience as well as their communication and presentation skills.  It also helps introduce them to the international technical community and helps to build a community of students who will lead the next generation of antenna engineers.\r\n\r\nThe AP provides financial support of various forms including assistance in low cost housing, but does not reimburse travel expenses.  Travel support from NSF will ensure that the program is open to the widest range of interested applicants from the U.S. Universities.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests travel support to defray the travel expenses for young investigators whose papers have been selected for presentation at the Conference, but who lack funds and might not be able to attend without travel support.  It is proposed that the AP Technical Program Committee select those to receive the support.  The total amount requested is $15,000 on the basis of an average travel grant of S700 for 20 participants.  Plus 2 weeks of secretarial help.  The secretary will collect papers, mail them out for review, collect reviews, and mail travel reimbursements after the conference.\r\n***\r\n",
