 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nBlackadar\r\n\r\n\r\nBlackadar will study a range of questions concerning the structure of various\r\nclasses of operator algebras and their relation to noncommutative topology.\r\nTopics will include generalized inductive limits of finite-dimensional\r\nC*-algebras and the structure of nuclear C*-algebras, semiprojectivity,\r\nnonstable K-theory and the Universal Coefficient Theorem, and bivariant\r\ncohomology theories on C*-algebras and their dense subalgebras.\r\n\r\nAn idea which has revolutionized the study of operator algebras in recent\r\nyears, and which has led to some spectacular applications throughout\r\nmathematics and mathematical physics, is to view operator algebras as\r\ngeneralizations of topological spaces, or more precisely the set of\r\ncontinuous functions on a topological space; the principal new feature\r\nis that the multiplication of \"functions\" is no longer assumed to be\r\ncommutative.  It has long been recognized that operator algebras provide the \"right\" framework for the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, and it has been increasingly recognized\r\nrecently that noncommutative \"function spaces\" (operator algebras)\r\narise naturally in problems in subjects as diverse as knot theory\r\n(with applications to the structure of DNA and other molecules, as well\r\nas mathematical physics), dynamical systems, and even mathematical logic.\r\nIt has become apparent that it will be possible to give an explicit\r\ndescription of all operator algebras in large classes, including most\r\nalgebras arising in applications, far beyond what was thought possible\r\nonly a few years ago.  This project concerns some of the central\r\nremaining problems in the classification of one particularly important\r\nclass, the nuclear C*-algebras.  Understanding the mathematical structures\r\nthat can occur will give great insight into the nature and behavior of\r\nthe associated applied problems.\r\n\r\n",
