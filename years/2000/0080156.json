Seventeen faculty mentors are\r\ncommitted to work with seven community collaborators to recruit, train and\r\npromote talented students for careers in environmental biology. Strong\r\nemphasis is placed on recruitment of Native Americans and Hispanic\r\nAmericans. Selected students gain support and training through stipends,\r\ncoursework, advising and mentoring. This program provides students\r\nopportunities to participate in cutting-edge research related to human\r\nimpacts on ecosystems of the Colorado Plateau. Students work closely with\r\nfaculty mentors to pose hypotheses, design experiments, complete research\r\nprojects, and disseminate results thorough oral presentations and published\r\nworks. Cohorts of UMEB seniors share their training with incoming cohorts\r\nand also act as mentors themselves to high school students involved in the\r\nGLOBE program and other NAU outreach activities. \r\n\r\nWhat are the impacts of climate change on the carbon balance of Colorado\r\nPlateau ecosystems?  How does livestock management influence productivity\r\nand diversity of Southwestern grasslands?  Do mycorrhizae function\r\ndifferently in traditional Native American maize and high-input maize?\r\nResearch on these questions and many more are being advanced by UMEB\r\nstudents and their faculty mentors. Another important outcome of this\r\nprogram is that it increases the number of Native American and Hispanic\r\nAmerican environmental biologists. These professionals will be particularly well\r\nqualified to contribute expertise towards ameliorating many of the complex\r\nenvironmental problems on the Colorado Plateau and throughout the nation. \r\n\r\n",
