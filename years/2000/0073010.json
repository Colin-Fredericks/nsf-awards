The Catamaran is a 96 ft. vessel, constructed in 1999/2000, and is owned and operated by University of Miami.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 146 operational days during 2000, of which 36 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support NOAA, Navy, and other private projects.  Additional days may be added on to the schedule during the year.  The projects scheduled on the Catamaran represent a wide variety of oceanographic disciplines and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel. Cruises include biological work in the Bahamas; geological and swath bathymetry work in the Florida Straits and Florida Keys; chemistry and ocean optics work in the Bahamas, Florida Keys, and Florida Bay; physical oceanography in the Florida Keys and Florida Bay; and equipment/instrumentation testing in Florida Bay and the Bahamas.\r\n\r\nThe R/V Catamaran is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions around the country.\r\n***\r\n",
