 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chicago Public Schools, formerly an Urban Systemic Initiative site funded by the National Science Foundation for five years (1994-1999), proposes to increase significantly K-12 student achievement in mathematics and science by noticeably improving the level of performance of the current science and mathematics teachers through a Citywide Professional Development University Partnership.  By means of the proposed partnerships, the Chicago Urban Systemic Program plans: (1) to increase the competency and diversity of the science and mathematics instructional workforce; (2) to advance the implementation of K-12 standards-based mathematics and science curricula; (3) to increase student achievement as measured by standardized assessments; and (4) to promote and sustain collaborations with colleges, universities, and museums.\r\n\r\nThe proposed model encompasses four major initiatives to upgrade the standards of mathematics and science teaching via new university courses and the creation of a community of teacher professionals: (1) the K-4 Specialization in Mathematics and Science; (2) the Grades 5-8 Mathematics and Science Endorsement Program; (3) the Grades 9-12 High School Science and Mathematics Certification Courses; and (4) the Professional Development Networks.  The Northwestern University's Center for Learning Technologies in Urban Schools (LeTUS) will engage as a major partner to create innovative professional development course models that will typify the linkage of content to pedagogy and field-based experiences to practice.  By strengthening professional development as an essential component of systemic reform, and aligning it with other elements of the system, such as standards-based curricula, instruction, student assessment, and policies, the District will be able to sustain its systemic effort aimed at improved student achievement.  Furthermore, it is anticipated that all of Chicago's major collaborating universities continue to use the USP model and reform their teacher education programs.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Education Alliance will coordinate the participation of ten universities that comprise this partnership.   The CUSP will gather formative feedback on the connection between professional development and student achievement by using the research capacity of LeTUS.\r\n",
