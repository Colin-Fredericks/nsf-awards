The educational component introduces into the civil engineering undergraduate and graduate curriculum the following: data analysis tools, modeling techniques (ranging from simple models to complex computer simulations), and case studies of physical and analytical model development.\r\n\r\nThe analysis and modeling of massive geotechnical and foundation-building systems under extreme dynamic loading and failure conditions can rarely be conducted using full-scale experiments.  Indeed, the cost of destructive experiments of such systems is usually prohibitive, in addition to being impractical.  Response mechanisms and system properties for large deformations are therefore inferred from one or more of the following: laboratory investigations on small soil samples, scaled model experiments, and records of the response to extreme environmental loading conditions. Each one of these sources has provided valuable information over a distinct range of loading and system conditions, but in some instances the results are inconsistent.  This research project uses experimental field and laboratory data, and data recorded during major earthquakes to: (1) evaluate the dynamic response mechanisms at large deformation and failure and to elucidate the associated damping mechanisms, (2) develop improved and calibrated computational models, and (3) propose new experimentation strategies that maximize the outcome of model calibration analyses. This will provide models for computational simulations, elucidate a number of salient response mechanisms of geotechnical systems, and provide recommend guidelines for data gathering and experimentation for effective modeling and simulation analyses. \r\n\r\nThe educational plan introduces data analysis tools, modeling techniques, and computer simulations into the undergraduate and graduate programs, giving students hands-on experience in: (1) analyzing experimental data of full scale and model tests, as well as records of the response of civil systems to environmental loading, (2) building and validating models (ranging from simplified to complex), and (3) developing and analyzing computer simulations. The students have access to a multidisciplinary set of field and laboratory experimental data, and data recorded during major earthquakes. The curriculum development integrates research and education, and sets up an interactive learning environment through the use of the studio classroom approach.  (Sudio classrooms integrate lecture, laboratory and recitation sessions, and thus provide an appropriate discovery-based learning environment.)  This project will contribute to the development of a paradigm for an integrated approach to the teaching of physical modeling and computational simulations.\r\n",
