 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe problems that are to be addressed in this project involve, \r\non one hand,  dynamics of  flows on homogeneous spaces of Lie \r\ngroups, and, on the other hand, the multi-dimensional theory \r\nof Diophantine approximations. Various connections between \r\nthese two fields have been found in the last two decades, \r\nwhich significantly stimulated progress in both fields. During \r\nrecent years, the proposer's research has been centered on \r\ndeveloping new links between homogeneous dynamics and number \r\ntheory, which has resulted in solving many important problems, \r\nas well as in creating new directions for further research. \r\nThe investigator is to continue his work on bounded trajectories,\r\ngrowth rate of orbits, Diophantine approximation with weights \r\nand Khintchine-type theorems on manifolds. \r\n\r\nThis project deals with algebraic dynamical systems and their \r\napplications to number theory. Many problems concerning \r\nsimultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers \r\ncan be cast in terms of the behavior of certain orbits. \r\nDynamical systems in the present context deal with how points \r\nin a system move over time, given a set of differential equations \r\n(or laws of nature) governing the system. It turns out that various \r\nnumerical approximations used in the theory of integer equations \r\ncan be better calculated once they are phrased in dynamical systems \r\nlanguage. \r\n",
