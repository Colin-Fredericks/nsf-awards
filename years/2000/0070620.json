 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe principal investigators propose to study quantum dots (QDs) in the group III-nitride\r\nmaterials system. The objectives are three-fold: 1) to improve the quality of the material\r\nby using the dot layers to decouple the active layers of structure from the substrate; 2) to\r\nproduce a QD laser that has a lower threshold and is more efficient than present nitride\r\nlasers; and 3) to produce efficient nitride light emitting diodes (LEDs) that span the\r\nelectromagnetic spectrum from the blue to the red and that can be made to emit white\r\nlight. Both of the PIs are carrying out extensive research in the nitrides, and this project\r\nwill be integral part of their programs. The activity will be largely crystal growth in\r\nnature, but work on structure and device processing and materials characterization will\r\nalso be carried out. Both molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal organic chemical\r\nvapor deposition (MOCVD) will be used. This is one of the few projects in the world\r\nwhere both techniques are employed by one research group for the nitrides and will give\r\nthe researchers the flexibility to choose to best method for each part of the growth\r\nprocess. The PIs propose to produce the dots by two novel techniques which they expect\r\nwill produce more uniform dots. The first is a crystal growth technique whereby the dot\r\nlayer is grown pseudomorphically on a nitride layer of smaller lattice constant at low\r\nenough temperature so that two dimensional growth occurs. The layer is then annealed to\r\nform a layer of self-assembled dots. In the second technique, the growth is stopped just\r\nbelow the dot-forming layer. The sample is then removed from the growth apparatus. It\r\nis patterned on a nanoscale with a uniformly spaced array of dimples or hillocks. The\r\nsample is then returned to the growth apparatus, and the growth is continued. The pattern\r\nserves as a template to form the dots and helps make them more uniform. Partial laser\r\nstructures will be fabricated from samples made by both methods that will permit the\r\ndetermination of whether the dot size is uniform enough to produce a narrower\r\nspontaneous linewidth and, hence, a lower threshold, improved laser. Other\r\ncharacterization measurements, including photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence,\r\natomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) will be\r\ncarried out. Single color LEDs from blue to red and white LEDs will fabricated and\r\ncharacterized.\r\n",
