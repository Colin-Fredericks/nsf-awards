 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Arthur R. Smith\r\nINST: Ohio University\r\nVerne\r\n\r\n9983816\r\nSmith\r\n\r\nThis is an Electronic Materials CAREER grant; during its second year the grant was converted to a PECASE award. The aim of the project is to investigate the structural, chemical, electronic, optical, and magnetoelectronic properties of nitride semiconductors. Thin films will be grown in a molecular beam epitaxy chamber which is coupled directly to a dedicated analysis chamber. The films will be investigated in-situ using: 1) reflection high energy electron diffraction; 2) real-time electron energy loss spectroscopy; 3) in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy; 4) in-situ atomic and magnetic force microscopy); 5) in-situ auger electron spectroscopy; and 6) in-situ cathodoluminescence and STM tip-induced luminescence. It is planned to investigate a wide variety of thin film phenomena, including surface structure, chemical composition, surface diffusion processes, and surface magnetism. Educational activities address both University and local area K-12 educational needs. The primary emphasis is on the training of graduate and undergraduate students in experimental science, and to develop a new course in electronic materials and surface analysis techniques which is oriented toward integrating research and education. To stimulate interest in science among local K-12 students, a program is planned which brings a scanning tunneling microscope into K-12 science classes. To facilitate this program, a Summer training experience is planned for K-12 science teachers to learn the fundamentals of scanning tunneling microscopy, learn to use the unique educational microscope, and to make plans to integrate the microscopy activities into their curriculum. Faculty visitation hours are also planned to discuss science and technology career opportunities with local K-12 students. \r\n%%%\r\nThis is an Electronic Materials CAREER grant; during its second year the grant was converted to a PECASE award. The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science and physics knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic materials. The scope of the project will expose students to challenges in materials synthesis, processing, and characterization. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and education.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
