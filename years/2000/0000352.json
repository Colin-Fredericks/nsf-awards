 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michigan Rural Systemic Initiative\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Rural Systemic Initiative (MIRSI) to Improve Science, Mathematics and Technical Education seeks to organize a consortium of seventeen school districts and two Native American academies in isolated rural school districts in northern Michigan. \r\n\r\nThe Michigan RSI is working collaboratively with universities, community colleges, Tribal Colleges and other agencies to promote local capacity for systemic reform.  The initiative will promote standards-base MST by enhancing teacher knowledge of content and technology processes to increase student achievement.  Regional coordinators located in the school districts will make available technical assistance, professional development activities and a web-based technology venue to increase access to information and innovations in mathematics, science, and technology education. Web-based technologies will allow rural educators, students, parents, and stakeholders to participate in learning communities for investigations, communications, collaborations, and publications.  The RSI will assist districts in the re-alignment and leveraging of resources and to institute the policy changes necessary for true systemic change.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the proposal are to: \r\n\r\n(1) improve support for the development of a reform agenda for rural schools by forming new regional and statewide collaborations among the rural districts, Michigan State University, North Central Regional Education Laboratory, and other institutions or agencies; \r\n\r\n(2) to increase community and business involvement in the schools to support the rural agenda in mathematics, science and technology; \r\n\r\n(3) enhance the understanding of the rural communities and cultures by gathering base-line data from self-studies that examine the contextual variables within the communities and that support the reform agenda; \r\n\r\n(4) to generate a comprehensive and sustainable implementation plan for systemic reform in mathematics, science, and technology education that transcends levels, and addresses a local and regional vision, seeks a commitment to policy, fiscal and instructional reform, a comparison of programmatic strengths and weaknesses, a secure level of resources to promote change and an expedited reform through state and local policy changes.  This proposal aligns with the Michigan School Improvement Plan.   \r\n",
