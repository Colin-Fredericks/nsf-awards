 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop an undergraduate curriculum in neuroinformatics at UCLA.  Neuroinformatics brings together the methods and concepts of neuroscience, informatics, and computation that are necessary to understand the human brain and all its complexity.  Neuroinformatics offers neuroscience new opportunities for extracting understanding from data and meaning from measurements. The new curriculum will prepare a new generation of informatically oriented neuroscientists by specifically introducing them to neuoroinformatic methods and principles while they are still undergraduates.  This curriculum will be made freely available to colleges and universities throughout the nation.  This program will be empirically evaluated and modified based upon the evaluations and all instructional protocols will be carefully and complete documented.   Neuroinformatics, although a young science, holds great promise for deepening our knowledge of the human brain and its function.\r\n\r\nThis research is funded in part by the National Science Foundation through its participation in the Human Brain Project, which is a Federal interagency research initiative, mandated by Congress as part of the \"Decade of the Brain\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
