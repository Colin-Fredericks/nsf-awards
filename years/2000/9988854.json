 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nKrantz proposes to study the groups of holomorphic self-mappings\r\n(automorphism groups) of domains in complex space using techniques of real\r\nand complex analysis, differential geometry, Lie theory, and partial\r\ndifferential equations.  The goal is to identify invariants that will help\r\nto classify domains up to biholomorphic equivalence.  In another\r\ndirection, Krantz will study real-variable Hardy spaces on domains,\r\npursuant to earlier collaborative work with Chang and Stein. Finally,\r\nKrantz will collaborate with Marco Peloso in his continuing study of the\r\ninhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations in the Sobolev topology.\r\nApplications to mapping theory and the study of the worm domain are being\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nProfessor Krantz will study aspects of complex analysis related to\r\nsymmetry.  The notion of symmetry is measured by means of mappings of\r\ndomains.  The set of such mappings of a region in space to itself has\r\nan algebraic structure which is called a ``group''.  The properties of\r\nthis group reveal geometric structure of the region under study and\r\nvice versa.  This idea of attaching an algebraic invariant to a\r\ngeometric object is one of the big thrusts in twentieth-century\r\nmathematics, and uncovers new depth and texture in the subject.\r\nKrantz's study of these ``automorphism groups'' complements his\r\ncontinuing study of certain partial differential equations on these\r\nspatial regions.  The partial differential equations can be used to\r\nconstruct mappings, and to calculate their regularity properties.  As\r\nan ancillary to these two projects, Krantz will study certain spaces\r\nof functions and mappings which are called Hardy spaces, and whose\r\nexistence was inspired by the mapping questions.  The geometric study\r\nof complex function theory in several variables has applications in\r\ncosmology (thanks to work of Penrose) and in geophysics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
