 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) have been examined as a convenient and cost-effective means of strengthening unreinforced masonry (URM) structures.  However, seismic design in the U.S. is based almost entirely on the assumption that the structural system provides a ductile failure mode.  One alternative is to combine the desirable traits of conventional steel systems with those of the new FRP systems.\r\nThe proposed research includes investigating and defining the failure modes associated with a combined FRP/Ductile connection at the pier interface.  Several connection methods are proposed for use with both concrete and clay masonry.  A predictive model based on experimental and analytical work for the pullout capacity of the ductile anchor will be developed.  A series of connection tests will be conducted on proposed techniques.  Furthermore, a series of sixteen pier tests are proposed with eight concrete masonry specimens and eight clay masonry specimens.  From the experimental work, a predictive analytical model for the in-plane strength and ductility of the hybrid FRP/Ductile connection will be developed.  A predictive model for in-plane shear strength of FRP strengthened piers will be defined.  This will include a review of existing experimental work and analytical modeling of various aspect ratios.\r\n\r\n",
