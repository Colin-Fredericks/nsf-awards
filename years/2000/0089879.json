The Role of Social Networks in the Underrepresentation of Women in IT\r\n\r\nThis CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds for a large-scale study of the role of social networks in the underrepresentation of women in the IT workforce.  Multiple cohorts of undergraduate and master's degree students in a leading MIS program will be surveyed at five points in time to identify their patterns of communication, trust, advice, friendship, and voluntary association in organizations.  Their work roles on project teams, in student organizations, and in first jobs after graduation will be tracked.  Background information will also be collected.  The differential positions of women students in the networks, roles, and job placements will be analyzed using the techniques of network analysis as well as standard techniques of statistical inference.  The influence of background characteristics, such as work experience and prior organizational affiliations will also be investigated.  This project has the potential to provide significant insights about the degree to which personal networks contribute to the success of women in IT education and employment.\r\n",
