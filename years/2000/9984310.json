 "awd_abstract_narration": "GOTTLIEB: \r\n\r\nThis research will emphasize two scientific projects that demonstrate the fundamentals of virological research for a wide range of students, including those scientifically advanced in High School, undergraduates, and graduate students.  \"Hands-on\" laboratory experience that provides students with the opportunity to develop and test hypotheses and to acquire rigorous scientific methodologies will best reinforce the lessons of the classroom.  In this regard, the research includes the following two projects.  The three-segmented dsRNA containing Cystoviridae is a non-pathogenic model for the Reoviridae.  The goal of the Cystoviridae research is to establish an in vitro RNA replication and packaging system for phi12, one of the newly discovered cystoviruses.  Embarking upon a comparative study of these viruses will result in understanding the role of genetic and structural variation on their replicative mechanisms and evolution and answer extant questions in reovirus biology.  The aim of the second portion of the project is to test the hypothesis that the alteration of a self antigen by interaction with a viral antigen can render the self antigen immunogenic.  The self-antigen to be studied in this case is dsDNA which is proposed to be rendered immunogenic by binding with the EBNA-1 protein of the Epstein-Barr Virus.  Integrating teaching with active student research in the molecular biology of viruses, this project centers on developing a virology program for undergraduate, graduate, and advanced high school students.\r\n",
