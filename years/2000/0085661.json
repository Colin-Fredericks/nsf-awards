 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effective operation of power systems in the present and the future depends to a large extent on how well several emerging challenges are met today.  Power systems continue to be stressed as they are operated in many instances at or near their full capacities.  Addition of new transmission lines to relieve this stress is often very difficult and is mired in regulatory procedure.  The new deregulated environment has the potential of exacerbating this stress as more power is shipped from longer distances.  At the same time, new flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices are being commissioned in various locations.  While these devices can offer significant performance improvements and may help alleviate some of the problems alluded to; they do have unique dynamic properties that are less familiar than those of existing devices.  In addition proper design and analysis of control systems for FACTS is crucial for efficient operation.  The resulting dynamic behavior of the overall system that incorporates these FACTS devices is not well understood.  Consequently, the potential benefits of these devices may not be fully realized.  The market mechanisms in the future will have a bearing on the operating conditions and the transaction contracts that are established.  Since the market would be geared to fully utilizing efficient generation, additional stress would be imposed on the transmission grid in certain locations.  New technology involving distributed generation is being rapidly introduced in the system to meet growing demand.  As a result several important technical issues related to system interconnection, reliability, and location need to be addressed.  These important issues call for work in the areas of real time control, sensing, communication, economics, modeling, and analysis of large scale systems.\r\n\r\nWe propose to conduct a workshop that will bring together researchers, scientist, and federal agency participants in the areas described above.  Selected participants will present position papers and discussions that address key research issues will be conducted.  The workshop will focus on identifying emerging problem in power systems that can benefit from the system and control theoretic developments as well as presenting new research ideas in the control, operation, and economics of large networks and their application to power systems.  The outcomes of the presentations and discussions will be used as the basis to identify future research needs in the area of large-scale power systems and the means by which such needs can be met.  The presentations, discussions, and recommendations for future research will be published in the workshop proceedings.\r\n",
