 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the development of a novel combinatorial technique for the discovery of natural gas combustion catalysts. The technique enables rapid parallel screening of multiple catalyst formulations in a realistic combustion environment, thereby greatly accelerating the speed and accuracy with which catalysts can be evaluated. Many existing combinatorial techniques are not suitable for combustion catalyst development because the catalyst screening element does not adequately mimic a combustion environment. The technique discussed in this proposal addresses this issue by using a catalytic reactor design that closely represents designs that are used in the practice of catalytic combustion in gas turbine engine applications. The aim of the proposed work is to demonstrate this technique and apply it to developing more durable, better performing natural gas combustion catalysts. If successful, this combinatorial approach could be used to aid in the discovery of catalysts for other high temperature applications. \r\n\r\n Successful development of this technique could greatly accelerate the development of durable catalysts for high temperature catalytic combustion of natural gas. This would result in greater acceptance and application of this technology in areas such as gas turbines for ground based power generation. Catalytic combustion offers the promise for reduction of greenhouse gas and toxic gas (e.g. NOx) emissions. Other spinout applications would include application of this combinatorial technique to other areas of high temperature catalyst development.",
