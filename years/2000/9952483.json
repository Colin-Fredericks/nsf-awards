 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nIn this Workshop Precalculus project, the principal investigators are working closely with an outside evaluation expert and faculty associates from two and four-year institutions and public and private high schools, to design pedagogical powerful instructional materials that seek to help students develop a firm understanding of the function concept and the interplay between functions and data analysis, modeling, and problem solving.  The materials are being tested at model adopter sites representing a variety of institutions, both public and private and small and large, using a variety of teaching formats, from small group activities to interactive lecture demonstrations.  A comprehensive national dissemination program is being launched, which includes conducting summer seminars and workshops for college and university faculty and for high school teachers, augmented by a school year support program.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop Precalculus materials are intended for use by education majors (who are experiencing an effective pedagogical model, while learning fundamental mathematical concepts and skills) and by high school, community college, four-year college, and university students (who are developing a firm mathematical foundation for further study in the social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics.)\r\n\r\nDistinctive features of the materials include:\r\n(a) replacement of formal lectures with student observations, computer or graphing calculator work, and interactive discussions (i.e., implementation of the \"workshop\" approach);\r\n(b) motivation of underserved populations, especially students who have an anxiety about studying mathematics or do not respond to traditional modes of instruction;\r\n(c) use of real world problems - \"Interdisciplinary Lively Application Projects\" (ILAPs) - as an essential vehicle for motivating underlying mathematical ideas;\r\n(d) integration of data analysis and probabilistic concepts throughout the materials;\r\n(e) innovative use of technology, such as the Microcomputer-Based and Calculator-Based Laboratory (MBL/CBL) tools and VideoPoint, to enhance student learning; and\r\n(f) close attention to the outcomes of educational research in mathematics and science and to the outcomes of assessment activities.",
