 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethylene has been known since the beginning of the century to be used by plants as a signaling molecule for regulating a variety of developmental processes and stress responses, including seed germination, leaf and flower senescence, fruit ripening, cell elongation, nodulation and wound and pathogen responses.  In the last few years, it has become evident that the diversity and specificity of the ethylene responses are reflected in the complexity of its biosynthesis and perception.  The enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic(ACC) synthase converts S-adenosylmethionine to ACC, the precursor of ethylene, and methylthioadenosine.  The specific aims of this proposal are to initiate and study the biochemical characterization of the Arabidopsis ACC polypeptides and characterize their expression patterns by RNA hybridization analysis or microarray technology.\r\n\r\nEthylene is a unique plant signaling molecule.  Its synthesis is regulated by a diverse array of inducers.  Clearly characterization of the polypeptides involved in that synthesis will have both fundamental and practical importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
