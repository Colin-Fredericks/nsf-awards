 "awd_abstract_narration": "Females of many species are selective when choosing a mate, possibly in an attempt to obtain the best genes for their offspring. In support of this idea, recent studies have found that the offspring of more attractive fathers are generally in better condition. Although this appears to support the notion that attractiveness signals an inheritable paternal quality, another possibility exists. A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that mothers may increase investment in reproduction when mated to an attractive male. Therefore, the offspring of an attractive male could be in better condition because its mother, responding to the attractiveness of her mate, provided extra investment. Using artificial insemination, this study experimentally separates paternal genetic effects from maternal investment effects to assess the relative roles of these two factors in determining offspring condition in red junglefowl.\r\n\r\n\tMany patterns of mate selection and attraction are found throughout the animal kingdom, and the study of animals is not complete without consideration of these important phenomena. In recent years, great strides have been made in understanding when and why animals are selective in their mate choice. This project seeks to add important components to this understanding by filling gaps in our knowledge of the benefits to females in being choosy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
