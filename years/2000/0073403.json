 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the continuation of the PI's research toward the\r\ndevelopment, implementation, and application of efficient numerical methods\r\nfor interface problems especially with moving interfaces and/or free\r\nboundaries. Specific projects include development of the immersed interface\r\nmethod for the Navier Stokes equations modeling incompressible viscous two\r\nphase flow with fixed or moving interfaces. Related to this topic, some\r\nimportant projects include development of new projection and/or gauge\r\nmethods so that the second order accuracy can be preserved even with the\r\npresence of interfaces; second order elliptic solvers that can satisfy the\r\nmaximum principle for interface problems in two and three dimensions; the\r\nfinite element methods using Cartesian and/or adaptive Cartesian grids for\r\ninterface problems. Another application which will be studied in depth is\r\nthe simulation of electro-migration of voids in integrated circuits with\r\nthe presence of grain boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is about developing efficient (fast, accurate, and in real\r\ntime) methods to simulate some important moving interface/free boundary \r\nproblems. Applications include the simulation of the interface between \r\nwater and oil in petroleum industry; simulation of contaminated bubbles \r\nin water for environmental science; simulation of crystal growth of pattern \r\nformulation in material science;  simulation of cell deformation and motion \r\nof biofilm in medical and biology sciences; and simulation of \r\nelectro-migration of voids in an integrated circuit in semi-conductor \r\nindustry. Over the years, we have developed advanced methods for solving \r\nthese interface problems and we believe we are the leaders in this area. \r\nTherefore we are very confident in the success of the proposal and can\r\nmaintain the edge in this area over other countries. Economically, the \r\nsuccess of this proposal can save millions of dollars that are\r\nneeded to carry out real experiments. \r\n",
