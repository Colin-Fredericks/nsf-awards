 "awd_abstract_narration": "The occurrence of hypoxia/anoxia in coastal waters has been increasing in frequency and duration. Studies of the impact of hypoxia/anoxia on the biota of estuarine and coastal waters have typically focused on commercially important benthic or demersal fauna. The impact on zooplankton has received little attention yet micro- and meso- zooplankton are important elements in marine food webs. Copepods in particular constitute a critical component of the diet of larval fish in these regions. This research is concerned with the population -level consequences of hypoxia and anoxia for marine copepods. Because copepods are one of the most abundant zooplankton groups in pelagic marine systems, the detrimental effects of low oxygen levels on copepods can have a sizable impact on their many predators. These studies will combine experimental manipulations with matrix population models constructed from laboratory results. The final product will allow an examination of how hypoxia/anoxia affects copepod populations and by association, the juvenile fish that rely on these organisms for food during this critical life stage.",
