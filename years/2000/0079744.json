Professors Sean Meyn, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and A. Krishnamoorty of Cochin University of Science and Technology will hold a workshop on stochastic optimization and adaptive control.  Its purpose is to bring researchers from diverse fields together to learn of new methods for analyzing and controlling complex systems; to advance the mathematical foundations of systems theory; and to learn more about current related technological problems in the information sciences.      \r\n\r\nScope:  Participants include scientists and engineers from Government and Industry, Academia in India and the U.S., and students.  The workshop is hosted by the University of Cochin with support from the Government of India agencies including the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Council on Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).   The workshop is designed to foster future bilateral collaborations.  The Division of Electrical and Communications Systems has provided joint funding for this workshop with the Division of International Programs.   \r\n",
