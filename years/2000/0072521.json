Moreover, domes often have a relatively low aspect ratio\r\nand evolve slowly.  These observations can be used as ingredients\r\nin building simple mathematical models of expanding and cooling\r\nfluid domes; this proposal surrounds the development of such\r\nmodels.  In particular, lava is considered as a solidifying,\r\nnon-Newtonian fluid with strongly temperature-dependent material\r\nqualities and an intrinsic yield stress.  The wide array of\r\nphysical ingredients to the problem make the mathematical\r\nmodelling especially challenging.  The project exploits the simple\r\ngeometry, slow evolution and low aspect ratio of the dome to\r\nasymptotically reduce the governing equations to a simpler form.\r\nThe reduction furnishes \"shallow-lava equations,\" in much the\r\nsame way that the \"shallow-ice equations\" are derived and\r\nextensively used to model ice sheets and glaciers.  Differences\r\narise because of the viscoplastic nature of silicic lava, and\r\nbecause solidification creates a solid crust overlying the dome\r\nthat can contribute significantly to the balance of forces,\r\nespecially at the disk's edge.  The mathematical approach are\r\ncomplemented with an experimental one in which laboratory fluids\r\nare used as analogue models of the lava.  Both approaches are used\r\nto explore the structure and evolution of the dome, partly with\r\nthe aim of learning more about how lava behaves as a fluid.  For\r\nexample, some domes lose axisymmetry in what might be an\r\nintrinsic morphological instability; this pattern formation\r\nprocess is explored in that light.\r\n     Lava domes occur in many geological settings both on Earth\r\nand on many other planets and moons of the solar system.  These\r\nstructures form when crystal-rich silicic magma is pushed up\r\nthrough vents onto roughly horizontal surfaces, and often occur\r\ninside the craters created by volcanic eruptions.  The shape of a\r\nlava dome is especially simple in comparison to most other lava\r\nflows.  Hence, a first step in understanding lava flows in general\r\nis to explore those domes.  Moreover, despite their slow growth,\r\ndomes are natural hazards because they can be the setting of\r\nviolent and dangerous events: domes can rupture and release\r\nconfined gas in a pyroclastic outflow (an extremely hot and\r\nfast-moving current of air and ash), or collapse at their\r\nperipheries to create landslides and debris flows.  The proposal\r\noutlines a mathematical and experimental approach to the\r\nmodelling of lava domes.  The purpose is to build models of the\r\ndome's structure and evolution, and compare these models with the\r\nreal geological structures.  By modelling the domes in this way,\r\nmore will be learned about how lava flows, and ultimately this\r\nmay provide insight into the hazards associated with them.\r\n",
