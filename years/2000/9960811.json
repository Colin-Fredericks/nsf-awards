 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing a key technology-high conductivity, transparent anode electrode for high information density, large size, emissive polymer displays.  Flat-panel, liquid crystal displays are currently used for portable displays such as laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants or Navigation Guiding Systems.  There are several drawbacks and limitations with LCDs (including limited view angle, limited contrast and relatively slow response speed).  Backlight is needed for LCDs to be used under weak light conditions.   Polymer emissive displays have emerged as promising technology for next generation displays with many novel features. Their processing advantages also allow them to be used for fabricating large area, light weight, emissive displays on flat, non-flat, or even flexible substrates.  This technology is currently limited for finite size and the limited number of pixels due to low surface conductivity of Indium Tin Oxide anode.\r\n\r\nSuccess in developing a high conductivity, high effective transparency anode will allow the polymer Light Emitting Diodes to be used for large size, high information density displays.   Single pixel and model display devices will also be fabricated and characterized during Phase I.   Large area (3'-4'), high information density (1/4 VGA or higher), graphic displays will be developed in the Phase II based on the demands from market feedback.",
