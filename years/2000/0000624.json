During this three-year phase of the project, the project will broaden the range of science content by deepening the connections of weather and climate with other scientific disciplines, especially earth systems science.  The project also hopes to double the size of the listening audience by increasing the number of stations carrying the series.  In addition, they will produce Spanish-language versions of the programs and distribute them through the Hispanic Radio Network.  In response to listeners' requests for longer programs, the project will produce 20 to 30 approximately five-minute modules that will be broadcast in existing radio series such as \"Marketplace\" and \"The Cultivated Gardener.\"   Ancillary educational materials will be provided for students, teachers, families and others interested in further learning about topics included in the broadcast programs.\r\n\r\n",
