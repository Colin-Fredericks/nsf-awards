The research collaboration is aimed at the development and analysis of discretization methods and solvers based on multiscale and multiresolution algorithms; efficient implementation of the new discretization and solvers on advanced computing architectures; and applications to computational fluid dynamics and structural mechanics. \r\n\r\nThis award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Engineering (INRIA).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the U.S. investigators, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students.  INRIA will support the French researchers' visits to the United States.  The collaboration is interdisciplinary.  The US investigators are expert in the theory and analysis of multigrid methods for both elliptic and hyperbolic problems.   This is complemented by French expertise in computational fluid dynamics and on multiresolutional algorithms for hyperbolic problems.  The project will advance understanding of the proposed methods and algorithms and their applications to problems in particle physics, fluid dynamics, and cosmology. \r\n",
