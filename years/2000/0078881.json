 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, a variety of functional group transformations such as cleavage of epoxides, rearrangement of epoxides to carbonyl compounds and cyclization of epoxy-polyenes will be attempted using various bismuth compounds.  These reactions will exploit the Lewis acidity of several bismuth(III) compounds as well as the oxidizing power of bismuth(V) reagents.  In light of increased awareness of environmental issues and the low toxicity of bismuth compounds, the successful completion of this project will make a significant contribution to this end.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Synthesis Program supports the research of Professor Ram S. Mohan of Illinois Wesleyan University.  Professor Mohan and his undergraduate students of chemistry will undertake a systematic investigation of the applications of bismuth compounds in synthetic organic chemistry.  Bismuth compounds are attractive candidates for use as reagents in organic synthesis because of their low toxicity and ready availability at low cost.  \r\n",
