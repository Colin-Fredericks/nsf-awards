 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nNorthwest Indian College (NWIC) proposes a Developmental effort  to maintain a\r\ncomprehensive and sustainable systemic reform effort in mathematics, science, and\r\ntechnology for its service area. In doing so, NWIC will utilize the lessons learned from\r\nTCRSI Phase I activities and will continue to promote the NSF drivers while at the same\r\ntime seeking current strategies to assist in their effort to have a comprehensive program\r\nthat will catapult the surrounding schools and their students to meet the National\r\nstandards. Special emphasis will be placed on a holistic approach to community reform\r\nusing RSI activities as a springboard for a comprehensive reform effort.\r\nThe primarily goals of the Northwest Indian College RSI program is to establish a center\r\nfor surrounding schools that will provide comprehensive services in systemic reform of\r\nmathematics, science and technology.\r\n\r\nThe NWIC proposes to develop a system in which the following will be promoted:\r\n1.  Promote school- and district-based mathematics and science education reform.\r\n2.  Provide comprehensive professional development for school-wide, rather than\r\n     individual teacher, participation.\r\n3.  Advocate for opportunities that foster systemic reform.\r\n4.  Serve as a catalyst for educational, business/industry and parent communities to\r\n     work together to advance science and mathematics education for all students.\r\n5.  Reach large numbers of schools, including those with high minority/low income\r\n     populations, through regional and statewide networking.\r\n6.  Create site-based leadership capacity.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals are:\r\nTo prepare citizens who value critical thinking, mathematics, science and  life-long learning.\r\nTo increase the numbers of students appropriately prepare in mathematics and science\r\nin this rapidly change age of technology and information.\r\nTo foster public understanding and support of mathematics, science and technology by\r\nall stakeholders.\r\nTo help NWIC site schools to meet local, state and federal requirements and provide\r\nall their students with the best possible education.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
