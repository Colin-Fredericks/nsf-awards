 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of Equipment for Fabrication of Quantum Cellular Automata\r\n\r\nD.W. Greve\r\nECS-0079485\r\n\r\nCurrent interest in nanostructures and nanoelectronics is in part motivated by the perceived limits to scaling of current electronic devices. One critical barrier to the development of future nanoelectric technology is the development of techniques for patterning and the integration of patterning with device fabrication.  In this project we will develop equipment for fabrication of one of the highly promising structures for future nanoelectronics. Quantum cellular automata are organized arrays of quantum dots which implement interconnection lines and logical operations. We will develop equipment for fabrication of quantum dot arrays which implement all the essential features of a digital electronic circuit. Quantum dot arrays will be fabricated on silicon substrates using silicon-compatible materials. The arrays will have a quantum dot size suitable for demonstration of operation at cryogenic temperatures (4-77 K) and the techniques used will have the potential for scaling to quantum dot sizes which will permit operation at room temperature.  The apparatus we will develop integrates quantum dot lithography, growth of quantum dots and an overlayer, and in situ characterization facilities.  This equipment will make possible development of a broad research program directed at future digital electronics. It will provide a focus for future semiconductor device and technology research, with strong potential for interactions with researchers both within and outside the university. This research will be highly interdisciplinary, and will also impact the education of undergraduate students through involvement in research projects and also through the develoment of new course materials specifically related to our nanostructure research.\r\n",
