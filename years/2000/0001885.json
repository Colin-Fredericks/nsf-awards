Uncertainty in the configuration of this major ice sheet and the adjoining Barents Sea Ice Sheet has made it difficult to create reliable boundary conditions for global climate model simulations.  A successful solution to this problem must involve focussed geomorphic, stratigraphic, and geochronologic studies of Severnaya Zemlya.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigators will evaluate the limits and timing of glacial and deglacial events and associated changes in relative sea level on Severnaya Zemlya since the LGM.  A collaborative American-Russian-Swedish field program will focus on two key areas where earlier researchers found rich deposits of glacial, marine, and terrestrial deposits associated with the last glacial/interglacial cycle.  The researchers will: 1) determine the magnitude and timing of the LGM glacial-isostatic response; 2) define the age and timing of LGM glaciation and deglaciation; and 3) assess the flow direction of the LGM.  They will determine if the LGM was a 10-20 km-scale expansion of existing ice caps, at least one km-thick ice sheet, or an intermediate complex.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigators will collaborate with the glaciological and Earth-rheological modeling communities to improve their understanding of climatic, sea-level and intrinsic glaciologic controls on LGM glaciation in the High Arctic.  To help reconstruct ice-sheet thickness and thinning rates, they will also provide their glacioisostatic data to the Earth-rheological modeling community.\r\n",
