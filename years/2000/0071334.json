 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic program supports research on the synthesis and study of small molecule magnets (SMMs) by Professor George Christou of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Indiana-Bloomington. These molecules behave macroscopically as magnets at low temperature but exhibit quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) which is responsible for loss of magnetic behavior at increasing temperature. A series of new SMMs will be produced from carboxylic acid derivatives of polynuclear manganese complexes as well as from some iron compounds. Supramolecular aggregates of  SMMs will be synthesized in order to raise the barrier to QTM and allow them to operate as magnets at temperatures higher than a few degrees Kelvin.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop molecular magnets which ultimately can operate at practical temperatures, analogous to the development of higher-temperature superconductors. The results of this research will lead to an enhanced understanding of the factors which produce magnetic behavior in these molecules, as well as to the factors controlling its loss at higher temperatures. The students involved in this multidisciplinary project will receive broad training which will prepare them for careers in both industry and academia.\r\n",
