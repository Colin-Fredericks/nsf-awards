Joseph, University of Minnesota\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to investigate the process of liquid fragmentation when submitted to gas flow induced stresses or to cavitation related vapor states.  These effects are expected to be associated to high Weber number or very low-density conditions.  Several additional contributing factors to the liquid breakup mechanism will be investigated, such as morphology, molecular weights and viscoelastic properties.  In particular, the instabilities already identified as Rayleigh-Taylor in shock tube studies, will be now be considered from the Kelvin Helmhoz viewpoint, for such phenomena as stripping the side of the drop, the capillary instability of a filament pulled out of the drop, cavitation and outgassing. The focus of this part of the research is to explain the eventual droplet distribution as validated by high-speed movies and still photographs.  Also, the breakup of polymer-thickened liquids under low-pressure conditions has been shown to be very dependent on thickener concentration.  It is proposed to examined the dependence of such a process on polymer type, concentration and other related properties.\r\n",
