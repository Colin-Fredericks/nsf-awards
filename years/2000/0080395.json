 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will leverage online education for the benefit of diversity in the software profession.  Its goal is to enhance the ability of educational institutions to recruit, retain and graduate increased numbers of female and minority students in the areas of software design, creation and maintenance.\r\nThe project is based at Carnegie Technology Education, a nonprofit subsidiary of Carnegie Technology Education, a nonprofit subsidiary of Carnegie Mellon University, which offers Internet-based learning and certification for software developers.  The team will modify ten courses developed for 2 and 4 year undergraduate institutions.  The courses will be modified to make them more appealing, accessible, and effective for diverse learners.  Pilot sites will be selected among institutions already subscribing to the courses from Carnegie Technology Education.  The  sites will receive special assistance in recruiting diverse students and in gender equity training for faculty.  Thus the project will produce new materials and new practices for recruiting, teaching, and cirriculum in software development.\r\n\r\n",
