 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gibberellin (GA) group of plant hormones controls many processes and developmental events in plants, such as seed germination, stem growth, flowering and fruit development. These processes are often not controlled by GAs alone, but by an interplay of GAs with other hormones. The proposed research will investigate whether auxin can exert a regulatory effect on GA biosynthesis, and thus provide one mechanism for cross-talk between these two types of growth promoting hormones. \r\nPrevious work in the principal investigator's laboratory led to the isolation of a mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (previously known as 10.3 or ga6) which had reduced stem growth, delayed flowering and reduced fruit size.  These symptoms could be overcome by treatment of mutant plants with certain GAs, leading to the hypothesis that biosynthesis of active GA hormone was blocked in this mutant. It has now known that this mutation is allelic to the transport inhibitor3 (tir3) mutation, which leads to an alteration in polar transport of auxin. The proposed research will examine whether auxins exert control at two stages in the GA biosynthetic pathway, namely 20-oxidation and 3b-hydroxylation.  Since the genes encoding these biosynthetic enzymes have been cloned, the possible effect of auxins on GA biosynthesis will be examined at the level of gene expression.  It is proposed to compare the expression of these genes in wildtype and tir3 plants by RNA blotting, and by using reporter gene fusions.  The altered auxin response 1 (axr1) mutant will also be examined to see if this mutation, which dramatically reduces the sensitivity of plants to auxin, also affects the expression of genes encoding these GA biosynthetic enzymes.  Finally, the auxin status of wildtype plants will be perturbed pharmacologically, and possible effects on GA response and expression of genes for GA biosynthetic enzymes will be examined.\r\nThe work will be carried out at the University of Texas at San Antonio. This University is one in which the majority of students are undergraduates from ethnic minorities.  The research program presents an opportunity to provide training in practical aspects of plant physiology and biochemistry to undergraduates from groups who are historically under-represented in science and technology.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
