 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\n\r\nA teaching tool for the programming languages course which enhance the students' grasp of fundamental programming language concepts, constructs, and paradigms that contribute to the students' appreciation of the relationship between language features and their implementation, is now in development.  The tool is a software environment, MULE, supporting interpreter-based projects for multiple programming language paradigms (e.g. OOP, procedural, functional, logic programming). An incomplete implementation of MULE, whose shortcomings are being addressed in this project, is being scrutinized. These shortcomings are technical barriers to widespread adoption of MULE. Removing these barriers is demonstrating whether MULE stands on its own merit as an effective part of a programming language course. First, MULE was implemented in a commercial version of Scheme (Ed Scheme) which limits the usability of MULE 's graphical user interface and runs only on the Macintosh (the necessary graphical interfaces are missing in the Windows version of Ed Scheme).  This redesigning MULE in Dr. Scheme a completely free (GNU Public License) version of Scheme which runs on Windows (95/98, NT), UNIX, and Macintosh, has strong graphical support for GUI development. Second, good software engineering principles and software quality assurance practices are used to develop a robust MULE implementation. Finally, MULE offers simple demonstration languages, which are being used to teach by counter-example.  This method involves keeping all aspects of the simple languages constant while one particular feature is changed to explore the effect of that design on the expressive power and efficiency of the language. As part of the standard MULE package, a number of counter-example modules are being implemented.\r\n",
