Such defects \r\nare fundamental structures since steps--as sinks and sources for atoms--\r\ninfluence mass transport at surfaces and therefore influence fundamental \r\nmultidimensional surface processes such as nucleation and growth, facet \r\nformation and thermal roughening in crystals and their applications. \r\nConsequently these defects have been studied since the 1950's and fairly \r\nsuccessful macroscopic models to describe behavior in most materials \r\nhave been developed. These models express the energy of an isothermally \r\nwandering step as the integral of the (generally orientation dependent) step \r\nenergy per unit length. However in the limit of vanishing step free energy, \r\nnew physics [e.g. higher-order elastic interactions and step-to-step \r\ninteractions] enters the picture. These higher-order effects can lead to the \r\nspontaneous development of highly periodic step structures. Such novel \r\nstep morphologies are members of an increasingly important class of self-\r\norganizing systems: systems that spontaneously form atomic scale \r\nperiodic patterns.  A recent (1997) pathbreaking experiment on Boron-\r\ndoped Silicon in which the isothermal wanderings in question, contrary to \r\nthe simple models cited, are periodic and increase with a decrease of the \r\nsteady state temperature in an interval presents a significant challenge to \r\nthe development of appropriate macroscopic models for this branch of \r\ncrystal theory. It reveals that there is a major gap in the current technical \r\nunderstanding of defects in crystals of this nature, since detailed analysis \r\nof the dynamics of these fluctuating step edges is incompatible with \r\ncurrent theories of step energetics.  Resolving this issue is important for \r\nnear term attainment of non-routine applications involving crystals with \r\nsmall step free energy, since it has direct impact on understanding the \r\natomic-scale structures they develop. In turn, this understanding is needed \r\nfor the development of materials with uniformly closely spaced and nearly \r\ncongruent self-organized [quantum dot] defects--such self-organizing \r\nmaterials being crucial to the development of monochromatic lasers and \r\nquantum wires, for example, as device scales shrink. The goal of that part \r\nof the present proposal involving orthodox materials is focussed on \r\nclarifying an as yet unresolved issue in the theory of nonlinearly elastic \r\nmaterials.  Equilibria for such materials subjected to specified boundary \r\ndisplacements correspond to deformations which minimize a stored energy \r\nintegral whose integrand associates to each deformation a nonnegative real \r\nvalued function.  Such stored energy integrands are subject to various \r\nconstraints in order to correctly represent possible physical materials.  In \r\nthe last decade a previously unnoticed issue has been raised. Namely in \r\nview of a little known one-dimensional variational phenomenon \r\n(originally established in 1926) that for certain variational integrands the \r\nminimizing functions can differ depending on the smoothness of the class \r\nof deformations under consideration -- even though the smoother class of \r\nfunctions is dense in the larger class. In fact there can be a nonzero \r\ndifference between the infima of the integrals associated with such classes \r\n[Lavrentiev's gap phenomenon].  A corresponding gap between classes of \r\ncontinuous deformations in three dimensional nonlinear elasticity would \r\nimply that the global equilibrium deformation in the larger class would be \r\nenergy minimizing and more singular than the energy minimizing global \r\ndeformation in the smaller class--whereby structures devised on the basis \r\nof the less singular deformations could develop flaws [fractures], contrary \r\nto the evidence provided by calculations based on standard methods. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, the PI proposes in the case of the unorthodox type of \r\ncrystalline material exemplified by Boron doped Silicon to devise \r\nvariational models that will shed light on the entirely nonstandard physical \r\nbehavior of such materials.  Such models will involve devising what are \r\nknown as Landau-de Gennes type order parameter terms for the free \r\nenergy of such materials to reflect the particularly delicate atomic \r\ninteractions governing the nanatomic structure of such crystals. On the \r\nother hand, in the case of orthodox materials the PI intends to clarify \r\nwhether in the well-established theory of nonlinear elasticity there can \r\noccur materials which for certain classes of boundary conditions can \r\nexhibit an energy gap between the minimum energy on one class of \r\ncontinuous smooth deformations and the minimum energy on a smaller \r\nclass.  The occurrence of such an energy gap could lead to cases in which \r\nstructures devised on the basis of computations associated with the smaller \r\nclass could develop flaws because the actual energy minimizing \r\ndeformation is more singular than the computations suggest.\r\n",
