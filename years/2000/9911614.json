The materials are developed by first choosing the learning goals, then providing assessments to determine that the learning goals are achieved.  For the ninth grade, rigorous science is learned through the use of cross-cutting themes with different integrating vehicles:  energy through personal and social perspectives, the material world through science and technology, cycles through history and nature of science, and evolution through science as a human endeavor.  In the tenth grade, modules concentrate on experiences from each discipline with connections to the others.  After this course, students should be able to continue taking other disciplinary or multidisciplinary standard or honors courses.  In addition to the student materials, there is a teachers' guide providing content and strategies for teaching the activities and two implementation guides addressing awareness and planning for change and ongoing implementation needs of the teachers of integrated science.  A professional development program is also developed.  Field testing is in eight sites nationally.  \r\n\r\n",
