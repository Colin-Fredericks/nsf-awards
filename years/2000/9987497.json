There will be approximately 225 participants, mostly from the United States, but also from other nations, such as those represented in the European Community, as well as Japan and Russia. Both experimental and theoretical research areas will be covered. Topics include Two-Dimensional Quantum Fluids, Superfluidity, Bose-Einstein Condensates, Microgravity Physics, Phase Transitions, etc. The NSF support will provide meeting expenses for approximately 25 graduate students, post-doctoral associates or young faculty. The Symposium provides opportunities for graduate students to make presentations at both oral and poster sessions. Dissemination of scientific results on an international level is another positive feature of this project.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project provides partial support for the International Symposium on Quantum Fluids and Solids that will be held at the University of Minnesota, June 6-11, 2000. There will be approximately 225 participants, mostly from the United States, but also from other nations, such as those represented by the European Community, as well as Japan and Russia. Both experimental and theoretical research areas will be covered. Fundamental research, applied research and instrument development will be included among the topics at the Symposium. The research is in the field of Low Temperature Physics, which focuses on phenomena occurring near 'absolute zero'. This includes superfluidity and superconductivity. The NSF support will provide meeting expenses for approximately 25 graduate students, post-doctoral associates or young faculty. The Symposium provides opportunities for graduate students to make presentations at both oral and poster sessions.
