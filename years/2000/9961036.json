 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical performance of ultracapacitors based on consolidated powders such as carbon powders is often limited by interparticle electrical resistance.  As a consequence, this requires the addition of conductivity enhancing additives or specialized processing steps. Transition metal carbide/nitride are known for their intrinsic high electronic conductance. To reduce the interparticle resistance, in this Phase I program, we are going to make transition metal carbide/nitride fiber electrodes using sol-gel technology.  The microstructure of fibers will be tailored to obtain a uniform pore size distribution and high accessible surface area.  The resulting power density of an ultracapacitor made of this material is expected to be notably impoved due to a much lower eqivalent series resistance (ESR).\r\n\r\nAnticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research or Developement Load leveling for electric vehicle or as power source for automotive sub-systems such as starter, regenerative braking and air bag. In addition, portable electronic devices such as notebook computers, cellular phones will also be able to use it as primary or secondary power sources.\r\n\r\nKeywords:\r\nTransition metal carbide/nitride, Sol-gel process, fiber, high power density, high accessible surface area, low ESR",
