 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study the cohomology theory and K-theory of partial\r\nflag varieties and quiver varieties.  In particular he will look for\r\nK-theory parallels of known results in cohomology.  A first target is the\r\ncohomology and Grothendieck rings of a partial flag variety.  Since any\r\npartial flag variety has a cell decomposition into Schubert cells, its\r\ncohomology ring has a basis consisting of the cohomology classes of\r\nSchubert varieties.  Likewise the Grothendieck ring of algebraic vector\r\nbundles has a basis of structure sheaves of Schubert varieties.  The\r\ninvestigator will study the structure constants for these rings with\r\nrespect to their bases indexed by Schubert varieties.  The main goal is to\r\nfind explicit formula for these constants, but also positivity questions\r\nare of interest.  In cohomology the structure constants are known to be\r\npositive for geometric reasons, but no combinatorial proof of this fact is\r\nknown.  In K-theory the investigator has conjectured that the structure\r\nconstants have alternating signs, i.e. they are non-negative in even\r\ndegrees and non-positive in odd degrees.  Finding a proof of this would be\r\nvery interesting.  An additional goal is to find efficient computer\r\nalgorithms for calculating these structure constants.  The investigator\r\nwill also try to find a formula for the K-theory class of the structure\r\nsheaf of a general quiver variety.  Such a formula will generalize a\r\nformula for the cohomology class of a quiver variety, which the\r\ninvestigator has proved earlier with Fulton.  The investigator hopes that\r\nproving such a formula will be of help for constructing an explicit\r\nresolution of the structure sheaf of a quiver variety.  This would\r\ngeneralize classical constructions such as the Koszul complex, which is of\r\nfundamental importance in homological algebra.\r\n\r\nThe development of cohomology theory was motivated in part by the problem\r\nof classifying topological spaces.  This is important for addressing\r\nquestions such as \"what is the shape of our universe?\".  Cohomology theory\r\nis also an important tool for solving problems in enumerative geometry, in\r\nwhich one seeks to determine and count all the solutions to a geometric\r\nproblem.  For example, if the geometric problem is to find lines which\r\nintersect or are tangent to a given collection of fixed geometric figures,\r\nthen the number of such lines is desired.  A very powerful technique for\r\nsolving this type of problems is to construct a space consisting of all\r\nobjects which could potentially be a solution.  Counting the number of\r\nsolutions to a problem is often equivalent to performing a calculation in\r\nthe cohomology ring of this space of potential solutions.  The objects to\r\nbe counted can in many situations be identified with flags of subspaces in\r\na given vector space.  Flag varieties, whose points correspond to such\r\nflags of subspaces, are therefore typical candidates to act as the space of\r\npotential solutions.  This makes it important to be able to do efficient\r\ncomputations within the cohomology ring of a flag variety, and gives the\r\nreason why the structure constants for this ring has been wanted by\r\ngeometers and combinatorialists for decades.  The K-theory or Grothendieck\r\nring of a variety can be seen as a generalization of the cohomology ring.\r\nA good understanding of K-theory will therefore give a more complete\r\npicture of cohomology theory.  At the same time K-theory is important for\r\nthe study of vector bundles on a variety and for homological algebra.  This\r\nmakes it very natural to try to generalize the known results about\r\ncohomology theory to K-theory.",
