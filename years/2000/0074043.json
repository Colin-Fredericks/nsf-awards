 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Investigator and his colleagues study new active\r\nmaterials and their possible use in micro-electro-mechanical\r\nsystems (MEMS) for biomedical applications.  The research project\r\nis motivated by the biomedical revolution based on the use of\r\nemerging materials and emerging mathematical methods of analysis\r\nand simulation for applications to noninvasive surgery and drug\r\ndelivery at nanoscale to milliscale.  The work concerns the use of\r\nsmall scale actuators based on smart materials, especially\r\nshape-memory and magnetostrictive materials.  They study the\r\ngrowth of tissue on materials and the interactions with\r\nsurrounding tissue and biological fluids, as well as novel\r\ndesigns of actuator systems.  They consider remote actuation\r\nbased on the use of a magnetic field applied external to the\r\nbody, and they explore the possible use of MRI.\r\n     New active materials --- materials that can change shape\r\nunder moderate stimuli, for example --- hold great promise for\r\nbuilding MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) for a variety of\r\napplications.  Opportunities in biomedical applications are\r\nparticularly intriguing; they include noninvasive surgery and\r\ndrug delivery at nanoscale to milliscale lengths.  This project is\r\naimed at biomedical MEMS based on the use of new active\r\nmaterials.  The investigators study the properties of active\r\nmaterials, the behaviors of MEMS that could be built with them,\r\nand the interactions between the materials and surrounding\r\nbiological tissues and fluids.  The work requires new mathematical\r\nmethods of analysis and simulation.  Investigators focus on the\r\nuse of small scale actuators based on shape-memory and emerging\r\nferromagnetic shape-memory materials, energized by a remotely\r\napplied magnetic field.  They study the growth of tissue on the\r\nmaterials and materials interactions with the elastoviscous\r\nsurrounding tissue, as well as novel designs of actuator systems\r\nbased on molecular beam epitaxial growth of films.  The use of\r\nMRI for simultaneous imaging and actuation is explored.",
