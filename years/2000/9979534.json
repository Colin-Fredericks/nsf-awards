 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fifth World Congress of the Bernoulli Society will take place in Guanajuato, Mexico, 15-21 May, 2000, joint with the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. The last such joint meeting occurred in 1994 at Chapel Hill. These meetings constitute a basic component of the infrastructure for scholarly exchange of ideas on an international level in the fields of Probability and Mathematical Statistics. They are the natural forum where to discuss and present the most important advances in these fields occurred during the previous five years. In particular, the Invited Program for this Congress consists of (1) twelve invited one hour lectures, including the IMS Wald Lectures, given by worldwide leaders in several of the\r\nsubfields, ranging from statistical applications in Genetics and probabilistic applications in Finance to the most theoretical areas of Statistics and Stochastic Processes; and (2) thirty nine Invited Paper Sessions representing a large variety of areas where substantial progress has recently occurred. An special effort has been made by the Program Committee to balance Probability, Statistics and their Applications. Given the\r\nworldwide scope of the Congress and the quality of the Program, its attendance by young researchers will be specially useful as an opportunity for starting contacts with distinguished researchers from all over the world, for exposure to a significant amount of the best research being conducted today, in particular learning of the most important current directions of research, and for disseminating their own work on a scale rarely provided by other meetings.  This project provides partial support for Junior participants.",
