 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: \r\n\r\nThe broad goal of this research program is to contribute in the development of analytical techniques for the design and performance evaluation of several transmission technologies that are candidates for future wireless communication systems. The scope of the program is broad with particular focus on diversity and adaptive transmission techniques.  Successful completion of the work will allow designers of emerging wireless systems to perform tradeoff studies (performance versus complexity) among various options so as to determine the more suitable choice in the face of complexity and implementation constraints. In addition the developed generic analytical techniques will also serve for other researchers to evaluate the performance of  other practical applications of their own interest.  The research plan has educational benefits not only for the research assistants involved in the proposed research but also for the students enrolled in a wireless communication course that the investigator is developing and which will enhance the strong core curriculum of signal processing and communication theory classes at the University of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nMore specifically on the diversity techniques front the research involves:\r\n1.\tThe metrics, performance, and low complexity implementation of  diversity receivers with                 multi-symbol and decision feedback differential detection. \r\n2.\tDevelopment of generic analytical techniques for the accurate assessment of the outage probability                 and average outage duration of diversity receivers.\r\n3.\tDesign and performance evaluation of low complexity smart antennas with successive co-channel                 interference reduction capabilities.\r\n4.             Accurate assesement of the diversity gain of  more effective composite microscopic/macroscopic                      diversity combining techniques.\r\n\r\nResearch directions for adaptive techniques focuses on the\r\n1.\tDesign and performance evaluation of adaptive embedded modulations. \r\n2.\tDevelopment of an analytical framework to quantify the spectral efficiency of adaptive multimedia cellular systems. \r\n\r\n\r\n3- Level of Effort Statement\r\nAt the recommended level of support, the investigator will make\r\nevery attempt to meet the original scope and level of effort of \r\nthe project.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
