 "awd_abstract_narration": "The differential geometry study of differential equations has a long and distinguished history, going back to the classical papers of Lie, Darboux and E. Cartan.  Their ideas have been at the source of many subsequent developments which have had a great impact in several areas of current interest in pure and applied mathematics, including the theory of completeley integrabale evolution equations and their soliton solutions, conservation laws, the calculus of variations, and the theory of infinite-dimensional Lie groups.  The aim of Professor Kamran in these lectures will be to give a reasonably self-contained account of some of the most significant recent developments which have arisen in this way from the differential study of differential equations.",
