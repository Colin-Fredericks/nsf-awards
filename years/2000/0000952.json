The completed project will be submitted to the International Research Fellowship Program.\r\n\r\nThe need to make highways as safe and productive as possible is as important to developing countries as it is to the United States.  At the same time, the transportation community is shifting away from building new roads to the use of smart systems for the operation and management of transportation systems.  The Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University is creating a Wireless Communications in Transportation (WCT) Laboratory which will remotely collect traffic and roadway data through TTMS sites in foreign countries.  The University of Dar es Salaam has a viable transportation-engineering program, and the program's faculty members are engaged in teaching and research.  During this planning visit, Professor Mussa and Dr. Mfinanga will jointly choose installation sites and finalize arrangements for the installation, operation and maintenance of the TTMS.  This project is being jointly funded by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems.\r\n",
