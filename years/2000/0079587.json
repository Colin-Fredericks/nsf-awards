 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Helium gas hydrostatic pressure apparatus with electrical and optical\r\naccess and a Kulicke and Soffa wire bonder will be acquired to investigate\r\npiezoelectric constants in III-nitrides. The bonder is needed to attach\r\nmetallic wires for electrical access to the semiconductor for conductance\r\nmeasurements. This instrumentation will nicely complement our existing\r\neffort funded by NSF, which deals specifically with the polarization issues\r\nin nitrides. The effort will be supported by our strong in house nitride\r\ngrowth effort with MBE and MOCVD. Prof. Nathan of the University of\r\nMinnesota, with whom we will collaborate, has already conducted these sorts\r\nof experiments in nitrides. Initial experiments of resistivity vs. stress\r\non un-gated Hall bars have already been conducted. The resistivity exhibits\r\nslow long term drifts (time constants of order 100 to 1000 seconds. Similar\r\neffects observed earlier in GaAs have been ascribed to a defect center\r\nassociated with shallow donors called the DX center. However, the effect in\r\nGaN is more complex, but it is reminiscent of the type of persistent\r\nphotoconductivity observed in GaAs in the early stages of development.\r\nClearly trapping effects will have to be separated from the piezoelectric\r\neffects.  Such a study is crucial to the practical application electronic\r\nnitride devices.\r\nThe requested instrument consists of\t\r\n1. Helium gas hydrostatic pressure apparatus with electrical and optical\r\naccess, which will be purchased from Unipress, Poland.
