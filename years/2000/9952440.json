Chart and oscilloscope players are allowing data files to be played across the web and permit users to make measurements and perform data analysis. These players and data files are being integrated into HTML files to produce learning modules, with which the students interact and, thus, produce an experience similar to that seen in the traditional lab setting.  The long-term goal of the project is to produce a large number of learning modules for on-line physiology teaching. The number and scope of the modules is being increased over and above that provided by the PI by collaboration with physiologists in neighboring institutions. The resulting library of learning modules is being mixed-and-matched using a third JAVA applet, which is allowing instructors to build customized lab packages for their students. While the primary goal of the proposal is to produce a lab experience for on-line learners, the flexibility within the system is permitting the instructors to build lab packages with a combination of wet and computer modules. Thus, the integration of technology into lab education is allowing students to use on-line labs to augment their traditional hands-on lab experience. This may be especially useful for students in institutions where lab facilities, teaching equipment and animal maintenance are restricted, as found in certain community and junior colleges, and high schools.\r\n",
