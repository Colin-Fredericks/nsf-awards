The Symposium is being held in conjunction with the World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering (July 23-28, 2000), an activity organized by the International Union for Physics and Engineering in Medicine and six major domestic U.S. and international professional societies in the field of biomedical engineering. The Congress is a major international meeting with 19 international organizations cooperating to make it a success.  \r\n\r\nThe Symposium program includes three sessions, each with a plenary address, presentations and a panel discussion. The sessions are:\r\n\r\n1. Cost-Reducing Health Care Technologie--the NSF/Whitaker Foundation experiment\r\n2. Cost Versus Benefits: A National Perspective\r\n3. Technology Transfer: A Global Perspective\r\n\r\nProceedings of the World Congress Symposium are to be published jointly with those of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Symposia to be held at the 2000 AAAS meeting \"Science in an Uncertain Millennium\" (Washington, DC, 17-22 February 2000): (1) Healthcare Technology, Economics, and Policy: an Evolving Balance, and (2) Cost-Reducing Health Care Technology.\r\n\r\n",
