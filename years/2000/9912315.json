The field station is jointly operated by Cornell University and the University of New Hampshire (UNH). The REU Site will provide students with training in field and laboratory research in marine biology and ecology, including research in marine invertebrates, birds, and plants. Faculty mentors for the students will be selected from scientists at Cornell University, University of New Hamphsire, Brown University, University of Washington, and Merrimack College who have on-going research projects at the Shoals Marine Laboratory.  The REU students will spend 8 weeks immersed in marine biology research projects under the guidance of his/her faculty mentor. The students will also participate in weekly discussion groups, field trips, and journal club meetings. The grant will also provide funding for three undergraduate students and a faculty instructor to participate in an international research/education project in Akumal, Mexico. The students will spend 8 weeks involved in a coral reef monitoring project. This project is jointly funded by the U.S. and Mexico.\r\n\r\n",
