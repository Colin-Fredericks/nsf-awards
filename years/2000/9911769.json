The research is in the area of discrete mathematics -- especially graph theory -- with an emphasis on applications.  The first summer includes an educational program centered on content, mentored research work, teacher-researcher interaction, and classroom implementation sessions.  Follow-up will occur during the academic year and includes research activities for students.  The school program will culminate with presentations about the research projects in a spring conference.  In the following summer the teachers will be involved in a more sophisticated series of research projects.  Also teachers will report on the implementation in the classroom of the materials which were based upon the research topics.  The second year teachers will act as mentors with the next cohort of teachers to help their transition to research and classroom implementation.\r\n\r\n",
