California - Berkeley\r\n\r\nThe proof of concept of a new DNA based self-assembly approach for replication of nanoparticle patterns will be investigated.   The initial pattern is created using scanning probe microscope or electron-beam lithography.  That pattern is introduced in a solution of thiolated single-stranded DNA of sequence J'K' to create a J'K' coded pattern on a substrate, which is replicated with a JK coded nanoparticles attached on the substrate.  An enzyme DNA ligase introduced in the solution covalently binds only the sections JK of the nanoparticle pattern.  By heating the solution to 70-80 degrees Celsius the covalent bonds remain while the weak hydrogen bonds are broken, and the nanoparticle pattern detaches from the substrate pattern.  By decreasing the solution temperature and then heating again, new replicas are created.  The proposed approach allows for model replication of the initial pattern.\r\nThe contribution is novel and may have important long-term effects on replication, self-replication, and fabrication methods of nanostructured systems.  The approach is applicable to the 1-20 nm range where other methods of controlled fabrication are limited and not yet practical.    \r\n",
