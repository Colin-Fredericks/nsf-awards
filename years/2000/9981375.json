The researchers will be undertaking a study of the molecular recognition formed in systematic molecular assemblies.  Infrared spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study the molecular structures and interactions of organized Langmuir monolayers and LB films.  The specific aim is to study the molecular recognition formed in systematic molecular assemblies at the air-water interface.  The researchers plan to develop a biosensor for the detection and monitoring of hazardous chemicals to human health using the Langmuir-Blodgett film technique.  The study will include both fundamental investigation and prototype development.  \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The planned activities are the focusing points in surface science and material science research aimed at the advanced development of nanotechnology.  Results of this research should lead to a better and healthier environment.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of a postdoc and graduate student.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals.\r\n",
