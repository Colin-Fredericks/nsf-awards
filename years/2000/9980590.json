 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple-access communication channels arise in a great \r\nvariety of applications, among which are some of the most \r\nrapidly growing areas of technology development today:\r\ncellular telephony, wireless \"last mile'' systems, indoor wireless \r\nLAN's, nomadic computing, high-speed digital subscriber lines, etc. \r\nNew performance requirements are constantly being imposed \r\non  such systems in order to provide high-quality, multimedia services \r\nto an exponentiating user population.  A major approach\r\nto meeting these requirements is through the use of advance \r\nsignal processing techniques to mitigate the manifold physical \r\nimpairments arising in such channels.  This research addresses \r\na number of key issues in this field.\r\n\r\nMultiple-access channels arise in the above-noted systems as the\r\nresult of  several physical conditions, including non-orthogonal \r\nmultiplexing in CDMA systems, cross-talk in xDSL systems, \r\nmultipath in TDMA systems, and co-channel interference in most\r\ntypes of cellular systems.  Multiuser detection, developed over the \r\npast fifteen years, has provided a very useful theoretical basis for \r\nthe study of optimal signal processing problems in multiple-access\r\nchannels.  This research is concerned with problems in which \r\nmultiuser detection must be combined with other signal processing\r\nfunctions, such as beamforming, channel decoding, impulse-noise\r\nmitigation, etc.  The basic approach is to apply algorithms that\r\niterate between signal-processing functions.  In particular, this\r\nresearch examines the general structural and performance properties\r\nof such algorithms, their implementation, and their application  in\r\nthree specific technologies:  indoor wireless networks, digital \r\nsubscriber lines, and underwater acoustic modems.",
