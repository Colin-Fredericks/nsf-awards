 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Funding is requested to conduct a Workshop by assembling a group of practicing engineers, university faculty, and government professionals specializing in cold regions engineering, dividing them into interest groups, and allowing them to collectively identify and elucidate specific research topics and describe needed research work which should be performed at the beginning of this millennium.  It is proposed that the Workshop be held at the University of Alaska-Anchorage campus to minimize the costs to conduct the Workshop and mazimize the participation from the cold regions engineering professionals community.  The deliverable from the Workshop will be a report to NSF, which will subsequently be distributed to the participants at the Workshop, other cold regions engineering professionals who were not able to attend, and appropriate federal agencies.  The report will hopefully guide research efforts in the cold regions engineering community, encourage faculty members to write research proposals to conduct needed research, and direct federal and state agencies to fund research proposals which relate to research needs identified in the report.",
