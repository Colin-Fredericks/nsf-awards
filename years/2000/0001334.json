The co-organizers are Professor Armando Haeberer of Pontifical Catholic University of Brazil, Professor Gabriel Baum of the University of La Plata, Argentina and Professor Rafael Lins of the Federal University of Recife, Brazil.\r\nFollowing the two-day workshop, there will be an eight-day school directed at young researchers in Argentina and Brazil.  The Argentine Society for Informatics and Operations Research is sponsoring these events.  The subject of the workshop and school is Program Design Using Logic.  It will cover the spectrum of programming methodology including a basic background in calculational logic, requirements modeling, refinement calculi, and logics for imperative programs.  Correct computer programming is critical to ensure that computer software is reliable.  This impacts every aspect of daily life, including commerce, communications, power and transportation.\r\n\r\nA strong U.S. presence at this workshop will help create strong ties and promote lasting collaborations with researchers in South America.\r\n",
