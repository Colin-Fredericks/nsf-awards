 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) This project improves the advanced optics course for physics undergraduates. This is being done primarily through the implementation of new laboratory experiments which illustrate basic concepts in hard-to-grasp topics. The lab experiments are being housed in a newly renovated laboratory space specifically devoted to the course and located near the classroom. The same equipment is being used both for classroom demonstrations and homework/laboratory exercises. This allows a close integration of analytical and laboratory experiences. Students are being encouraged to work in teams in the laboratory and in the classroom. The new laboratory setups better prepare students for future research situations where an intuitive connection between theory and practice is essential.\r\n\r\n Specifically, this project is bolstering curriculum in the areas of lens system design, laser cavity performance, coherence theory, and quantum optics. Students are using Zemax raytracing software, studying Gaussian laser beams and cavities, performing Fourier spectroscopy, and viewing quantum interference effects. The particular topics were chosen because they illustrate fundamental concepts while providing students with hands-on exposure to contemporary equipment and optical methods. A modest amount of support is also being used for the development of computer animations for illustrating advanced optical concepts, animations which can be viewed over the internet. The goal is to provide a multifaceted learning experience where students are motivated to master analytical concepts through improved visualization and experience.\r\n\r\n",
