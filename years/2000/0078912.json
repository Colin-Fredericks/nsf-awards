The exciting progress of\r\nthe past decade has depended upon bringing together people who work with a\r\nvariety of organisms, including yeast, worms, flies, and vertebrates to\r\nlearn about the molecules and principles held in common among these\r\nseemingly diverse organisms.  Despite all the excitement in the field,\r\nthere are relatively few meetings organized to emphasize the increasingly\r\nobvious relationships among developmental events previously viewed as\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nOur specific objectives are to assemble a group of scientists with broad \r\nexpertise in modern molecular analysis of development, have a series \r\nof talks on up to date research, and have about 120 other attendees present\r\nposters describing their research.  The meeting will be held on the campus\r\nof the University of California, Santa Cruz on July 21st to July 26th,\r\n2000.\r\n\r\nThere are two major goals of the meeting.  The first is to teach\r\neach other.  The planned program will be a superb course in advanced\r\ndevelopmental biology, and help those working with each particular organism\r\nto keep abreast of exciting new developments in the study of other\r\norganisms.  This will important not just for established investigators, but\r\nalso for the many students and postdoctoral fellows who will attend the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n",
