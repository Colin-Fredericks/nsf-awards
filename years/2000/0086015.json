The main goal is to develop a proof-of-concept demonstration of the application of DNA self-assembly to various basic computational tasks, such as sequences of arithmetic and logical computations executed in massively parallel fashion, and the application of this method to computational problems such as integer factorization.  The research involves testing of various input/output methods, development of novel DNA tiles with properties that facilitate the self-assembly and their visualization by imaging devices such as an atomic force microscope, and methods to minimize errors in self-assembly.  Specifically, the experiments are being conducted to evaluate the speed and error rates of the various types of self-assembly reactions.  In addition, experimental testing of massively parallel DNA self-assembly on particular problems, such as arithmetic and Boolean vector operations, is being performed.  Some of the technological areas that could be impacted are the application of DNA Lattices as a substrate for surface chemistry and as a substrate for layout of nano-scale circuit components, the construction of 3D DNA lattices, and DNA motors and their application to DNA computations.\r\n",
