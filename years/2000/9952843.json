 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) To meet the need of alternative teaching strategies to the traditional lecture, we have prepared and improved materials that provide explicit guidance on how to incorporate inquiry-based learning, hands-on activities, and action-oriented scientific investigation in the classroom, particularly for introductory classes in the Earth sciences.   We have developed and tested a series of video modules that illustrate sound practices in inquiry-based instructional methodology.  Module topics include leading discussions, posing questions (Socratic approach), guiding inquiry during instructor-led demonstrations, and using peer learning techniques during lecture.  Each module of less than 15 minute duration includes: 1)  video footage of experienced faculty discussing ways to encourage and guide discussions in the classroom,  2)  real classroom activities in which students are involved in group and peer learning, and  3) both instructor- and student-led demonstrations..  The video resource enables the teacher to see actual examples in action in the classroom.  Preliminary testing of two video modules demonstrates that faculty appreciate this aspect of the videos more than any other.  Users of the modules may be new to teaching or more experienced in the traditional lecture yet open to trying new approaches.  The modules are tested at different types of institutions, including 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities.  An advisory board assists in editing of the videos.  With full development the modules will be disseminated widely, along with a short document that provides guidance on how to use the videos.  In addition to use by individual faculty, the suite of seven final video modules could be used in training of teaching assistants, or they could be the focus of departmental discussions on teaching.",
