 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a communication/information dissemination activity aimed at teachers, administrators and teacher educators to improve their knowledge and familiarity with resources for the teaching of science to students with disabilities.  The project will continue an existing alliance with the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) to enhance equity for all students in science.  The mode of delivery will be a two-day preconference program presented at the NSTA annual meeting in Orlando, Florida, on April 5-6, 2000, and maintaining an exhibit booth in the exhibition hall throughout the meeting.  \r\n     The project will educate professionals providing services to students with disabilities about effective resources, and teaching/assessment strategies.  The disability areas addressed will include motor/orthopedic impairments, deaf and hard of hearing, visual impairments, learning disabilities, cognitive impairments, and behavioral disabilities.  Information in the areas of career awareness, teacher education, research on effective teaching, methods of instruction, materials and programs, evaluation and assessment, and educational organizations and agencies will be disseminated to all participants in the project.  \r\n     The proposed effort will address responsibilities of educators contained in legislative mandates (I.E. Rehabilitation Act, 1973; Americans with Disabilities Act, 1990, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 1997), inequities reflected in the literature concerning opportunities in science for students with disabilities, and informational needs of teachers and teacher educators in making science instruction responsive to students with disabilities.\r\n",
