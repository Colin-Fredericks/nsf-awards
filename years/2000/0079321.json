Undesirable electromagnetic interference (EMI) and signal degradation that results from switching digital devices is a critical design issue in high-speed digital electronics.  EMI is also a dominant problem in power electronics where large voltages and currents are switched rapidly.  EMI from one system can cause malfunctioning in other near-by electronics, as well as interfere with wireless technologies.  Further, ensuring signal integrity within a high-speed design is essential to functionality.  The rapid advance of device technologies has overtaken the state of knowledge of design - basic physics, and design methodologies - for meeting the many EMC challenges with future ultra-fast digital electronics, and power electronics based systems.  Further, there are too few engineers to meet the needs for addressing these issues.  The new equipment will facilitate current industry-sponsored research, and expand opportunities for ultra-fast differential signaling applications in computers, data switching, broadband internet technologies, and wireless communications.  Five senior level undergraduate electives, and two graduate courses will be impacted, as well as educational initiatives in an NSF IGERT program.  The proposed equipment will build on existing strengths for expanding EMC research and education in high-speed digital electronics and power electronics systems.\r\n",
