The investigator will study the Gromov-Witten\r\ninvariants of a 3-fold X by determining the local contributions\r\nof a suitably rigid curve C in X. In particular, the investigator\r\nwill study the integrality properties of such contributions and\r\ntheir relationship to the number of certain BPS states in\r\nM-theory as defined via the formula of Gopakumar and Vafa. For\r\nnodal curves C, the investigator will continue his work with Katz\r\nand Leung; for smooth higher genus curves C, the investigator\r\nwill continue work begun with R. Pandharipande. In collaborations\r\nwith Leung, the investigator will also seek to define a new\r\ninvariant of symplectic 4-manifolds which would specialize to the\r\nmodified Gromov-Witten invariants defined by Behrend and Fantechi\r\nfor algebraic surfaces with positive geometric genus (which in\r\nturn generalized the modified invariants defined by the\r\ninvestigator and Leung for K3 and Abelian surfaces). Such an\r\ninvariant would be better suited to study the enumerative\r\ngeometry of irrational surfaces than the ordinary Gromov-Witten\r\ninvariants.\r\n\r\nIn the physics of string theory, particles are replaced with\r\none-dimensional objects (``strings'') and so the path that a\r\nparticle traces out over time becomes a surface in space-time (a\r\n``world-sheet''). The equations of string theory then tell us\r\nthat the surface should be a holomorphic surface (a Riemann\r\nsurface) mapped into space-time in a holomorphic manner. This has\r\nled to the purely mathematical notion of Gromov-Witten\r\ninvariants. Gromov-Witten invariants study holomorphic mappings\r\nof Riemann surfaces into higher dimensional geometric objects\r\n(for example, projective manifolds). They have become important\r\ninvariants in geometry, topology, and algebraic geometry as well\r\nas being central in string theory. Bryan's project specifically\r\naddresses the problem of how the algebraic geometry of a\r\nprojective manifold is encoded in the Gromov-Witten invariants\r\nand how they are tied to string theory.  Algebraic geometry is a\r\nclassical subject in pure mathematics that has recently found\r\napplication in such diverse subjects as robotics and coding\r\ntheory; string theory is the leading candidate for a \"theory of\r\neverything\", i.e. a single physical theory that describes all\r\nknown physical phenomenon.\r\n",
