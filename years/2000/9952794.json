 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) Fourier transform applications to NMR have revolutionized chemical inquiry.   FT-NMR spectroscopy plays an essential role in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  In this project, an older continuous-wave NMR which has been converted  to a modern multinuclear Anasazi EFT-60 FT- NMR plays a key role in achieving the goal of obtaining the sophistication and speed of FT-NMR.  Such upgrades have proven to be a low-maintenance and cost-effective alternative to expensive high-field NMR spectrometers for small undergraduate schools. The long-term goal is the integration FT-NMR spectroscopy throughout the curriculum to produce graduates educated in the technical and scientific aspects of modern FT-NMR spectroscopy. Beginning with the freshman courses (General Chemistry, General Chemistry for Allied Health Professions, and Chemistry , Environment and Health) students are introduced to FT-NMR spectroscopy both theoretically and experientially through a series of experiments designed to require \"hands-on\" involvement. As students progress through the chemistry curriculum  (Organic, Instrumental Analysis, Biochemistry, Advanced Inorganic and Physical Chemistry) they perform experiments that develop technical competency in preparing samples and running routine 1H and 13C NMR spectra. By graduation, the chemistry major experiences 2D- and  heteronuclear techniques by means of thorough, well-planned experiments that demonstrate the breadth and applications of modern FT-NMR spectroscopy.  These experiments are introduced in a measured incremental fashion and are adapted from recent literature (primarily the J. Chemical Education).  The non-science major is introduced to FT-NMR spectroscopy so they can respect and appreciate the necessity of sophisticated instrumentation in modern chemistry.  Continuous assessments using both external (Advisory Board) and internal evaluations provide feedback and guidance on the success of the project as a significant curricular enhancement.",
