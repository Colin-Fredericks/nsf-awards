 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator continues to develop adaptive moving mesh methods\r\nfor the numerical solution of time dependent, multi-dimensional\r\npartial differential equations. The research work will be focused\r\non a new moving mesh method, the moving mesh partial differential\r\nequation approach proposed by the investigator and his collaborators.\r\nThe approach has been implemented in one and two dimensions for\r\ngenerating non-singular structured and unstructured adaptive meshes\r\nand successfully applied to a number of problems. Moreover,\r\nthe approach has led to a unifying framework describing previous\r\nmethods, providing a new theoretical underpinning, and building\r\nreliable new methods. The objectives of the proposal are to\r\nfurther improve the efficiency and robustness of the two dimensional\r\nmethod, to apply it to practical problems, and to implement\r\nthe three dimensional method.\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with the development of new computational\r\nmethods which are essential to enhance the ability of scientists and\r\nengineers to solve large scale computational problems that are crucial\r\nto our economy, environment, and security. The research is focused on\r\ndevelopment of adaptive numerical techniques or mesh adaptation methods,\r\nwhere the special moving features of the particular problem being solved\r\nare adapted to. Mesh adaptation has recently played an indispensable role\r\nin the numerical simulation of many large-scale problems arising from\r\nscience, engineering, and industry, such as those involving shock\r\nwaves, boundary layers, ignition propagation fronts, and multi-material\r\ninterface. These problems have a distinct common feature, that is, their\r\nsolution changes significantly only in a small portion of the physical\r\ndomain and the resolution of the solution in this portion dominates\r\nthe quality of the whole simulation. Standard (non-adaptive) techniques\r\noften fail to solve these problems because they spend effort evenly on\r\nthe entire domain and thus require formidable resources of computer\r\nCPU time and memory to obtain a reasonable degree of resolution.\r\nOn the other hand, adaptive mesh methods gain significant economies\r\nby paying most attention to the small portion of the physical domain\r\nwhere the solution changes most. The moving mesh method under study\r\nis a natural type of adaptive mesh methods which are designed to\r\ncapture the moving features of the physical solution.  The method\r\nis suitable for parallel computing and has proven to be an indispensable\r\ntool for use in the simulation of many industrial manufacturing problems.\r\nAs an important part of the proposed research project, two specific\r\napplications will be focused on. The first will be the numerical\r\nsimulation of chemical transport in groundwater aquifers.\r\nGroundwater supplies much of the water use in the United\r\nStates. The wide spread degradation of groundwater quality from\r\nchemical contamination has recently prompted extensive research for\r\nsimulating and predicting chemical behaviors in the subsurface.\r\nThe application of the moving mesh methods will provide accurate,\r\nefficient, and robust numerical algorithms for simulating chemical\r\ntransport in groundwater and therefore for effectively protecting\r\nand managing the groundwater resources. The other application will be\r\non the analysis of dynamic stall of airfoil for better understanding\r\nthe physical mechanisms which cause the unsteady flow\r\nbehavior in the high-angle-of-attack flight condition found common\r\nwith modern fighter and civil transport aircrafts.\r\n",
