They plan to study inverse and optimal design mathematical problems and several of their applications in various fields.  Some of the applications to which these mathematical tools will be applied are: impedance tomography (in medical applications), acoustic scattering, and the design of automobile mufflers. \r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between Tunisian and US scientists who have complementary capabilities and experience in the field of applied mathematics.  The Tunisian team includes senior researchers, postdoctoral investigators and graduate students.  Both the US and Tunisian team leaders have strong publishing records in the area of inverse and optimal design problems and in applications in several engineering fields. This TAMU-ENIT interaction is likely to be a productive collaboration, with benefits to both teams.  This proposal meets the INT objective of encouraging collaboration by US and foreign scientists in areas of mutual benefit.\r\n",
