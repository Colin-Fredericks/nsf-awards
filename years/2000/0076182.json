The program's awards \r\nprovide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary \r\nfacilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Kristin L. Vanderbilt with support for her to work with Dr. \r\nJanos Toth at the Kossuth Lajos University in Debrecen, Hungary during four field \r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nA better understanding of the environmental controls on soil nitrogen and carbon cycling \r\nis needed to improve predictions of forest nutrient availability under different \r\nmanagement scenarios, changes in global carbon budgets due to climate change, and \r\nforest response.  To address these questions, long-term manipulative plant litter \r\nexperiments (referred to as the DIRT ( (Detritus Input and Removal Treatments)) \r\nexperiments) have been established at a network of sites in the U.S.  The objective of this \r\nresearch project is to establish and sample long-term litter manipulation experimental \r\nplots at Sikfokut Forest in Hungary like those already installed at several U.S. locations.  \r\nThis site differs greatly from the sites in the U.S. in terms of management history.  Dr. \r\nVanderbilt will conduct baseline measurements of soil and soil solution carbon and \r\nnitrogen chemistry, and compare results with data from U.S. sites.  She will establish \r\nprotocols for plot maintenance and sampling, and work with graduate students in ecology \r\nat Kossuth Lajos University to develop research projects using the litter manipulation \r\nplots.  Besides promoting and furthering collaboration between researchers in the U.S. \r\nand Hungary, this project will help realize the potential of cross-site research between \r\nLong Term Ecological Research and International Long Term Ecological Research sites \r\nto provide spatially extensive information about how different ecosystems respond to the \r\nsame treatments.\r\n\r\nDr. Toth has spearheaded the nutrient cycling and litter decomposition studies at \r\nSikfokut.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
