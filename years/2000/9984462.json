 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThis research effort is focused on solving fundamental problems that limit the performance of future broadband digitalwireless communication systems. The emphasis is on problems within the general area of statistical signalprocessing. In recent years, close connections between the fields of statistical signal processing and communication systems have been elucidated, and many significant problems have been solved by exploiting these connections.  With the explosive growth of wireless communication networks and the advent of new broadband wireless technologies, problems that may have been of secondary importance in the past are becoming more fundamentally related to the performance limits of communication systems. The following problems are being studied in this research. Uncertainty Tolerance. Current and future wireless systems will operate in heavily cluttered and mobile environments in which channel characteristics vary rapidly over time. This imposes limits on the accuracy of estimates of important channel parameters and implies that receivers must operate in an environment characterized by a high level of uncertainty. To address this problem, this investigation considers the design and analysis of low-complexity, adaptive wireless receivers that exhibit good performance characteristics in the presence of multiple sources of complex structured interference as well as significant uncertainty regarding the exact structure of that\r\ninterference. Robust adaptive modulation techniques are being studied in parallel with adaptive receiver design.  Adaptive Algorithms for Ultrawideband Systems. Modern radars and newly proposed impulse radio systems rely on transmitted signals of very short duration, correspondingly large bandwidth, and relatively low duty cycle. Such signals possess statistical properties that can be exploited to improve the performance of adaptive channel estimation algorithms. Techniques that exploit these properties are known but have not been studied in the context of such ultrawideband systems, where they can be expected to be of particular importance. In this study, adaptive channel estimation algorithms for system identification on impulse radio channels are being investigated. The emphasis is on higher-order statistics, as opposed to conventional second-order algorithms. Previous work by the investigator clearly indicates that higher-order channel  estimation techniques perform extremely well on impulse radio systems.  Nontraditional Noise Sources. Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) has traditionally been regarded as the dominant noise source in communication system design. Unfortunately, many sources of interference that plague modern communication systems are not well modeled as AWGN. A particular characteristic of many\r\nenvironmentally generated noise sources is strong long-term dependence. Although such interference is additive and often well modeled as Gaussian, it possesses properties such as fractal sample paths and 1/f-type spectra that can cause significant performance degradation on systems that are not appropriately designed. In this work, the problem of signal detection in the presence of an additive, stationary 1/f-type noise process is considered. The class of fractional Gaussian noises (FGN) is adopted as a model of 1/f noise. Most of the known results on signal detection in FGN were derived by the investigator in an earlier study. The current study builds on this earlier work to derive performance results for several classes of transmitted signals and demonstrate that proper signal selection and receiver design are both critical for communication systems operating on additive FGN channels. Multipath Interference. Urban mobile wireless networks are corrupted by significant amounts of multipath interference, the characteristics of which vary rapidly over time. Such channels are ubiquitous and often well characterized as fast, frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels, but good general purpose simulators that can be easily tuned to match particular channel characteristics do not yet exist. The availability of a generic simulator for arbitrary fast Rayleigh fading channels would greatly facilitate the development of practical receivers for such channels. New channel simulators appropriate for arbitrary spread-spectrum waveforms transmitted over arbitrarily time-varying, frequency-selective multipath fading channels are being developed and implemented in this study.\r\n",
