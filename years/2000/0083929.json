 "awd_abstract_narration": "0083929\r\nMartinez\r\nAn interdisciplinary collaboration will apply recently developed techniques for analyzing computer networks to the study of complexity in large food webs.  The focus of the research is the scaling of complexity with diversity, especially the statistical relationships between the numbers of nodes and links in Internet, WWW, and ecological networks.  The strikingly robust patterns in the way network complexity scales with diversity along with the ability of this scaling relationship to underpin successful network models form the scientific basis of the collaboration.  Recent insights into these scaling relationships have made fundamental advances in understanding networks.  This project synergistically integrates scientists responsible for several of these advances to increase the scientific productivity of biocomplexity research.  The project will use insights into the scaling of complexity to predict the relationship between diversity and the structure and function of ecological networks.  Workshops will gather several researchers to exchange data and analytical methods to use computers to study both networks and models of networks as well as the effects of losing nodes and species on networks.  \r\n",
