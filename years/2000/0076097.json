 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Northwestern University supports an interdisciplinary research program on materials with an emphasis on the nanoscale.  The theme of the MRSEC is \"Advancing Materials Research and Education to Improve the Quality of Life\".  Research is carried out in four interdisciplinary research groups, with appropriate seed projects.  Within IRG 1 the Center focuses on nanostructured materials for chemical and biological sensing with the aim to develop and characterize new materials for use in making chemical and biological sensors for environmental applications. Within IRG 2 complex oxides are investigated to use materials design and synthesis in order to develop new thin film ceramic materials required for advanced photonic applications.  The work in IRG 3 uses and interdisciplinary approach to develop a scientific basis for the synthesis and processing of new types of environmentally benign polymers.  Finally, IRG 4, which is concerned with the architecture, transport, and binding in molecular crystals, polyelectrolyte nanocomposites, and nanoscale structures, is focused on new materials and the design of new molecular assemblies with ultimate potential applications to batteries, fuel cells, and molecular electronics.  The Center features a strong pre-college educational program,  including the widely disseminated Materials World Modules (MWM), as well as outstanding undergraduate and graduate educational opportunities.  Of particular interest is the Master's Materials Technology Program which prepares graduates to teach materals science concepts at the community college level.\r\n\r\nParticipants in the 4 IRG Center include 33 senior investigators, 6 postdoctoral associates, 17 graduate students, 15 undergraduates, and 6 technicians and other support personnel.  Professor R.P.H. Chang directs the MRSEC.    \r\n",
