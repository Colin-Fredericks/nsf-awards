 "awd_abstract_narration": "(99), (31), (59), (21) The goal of this project is to enable students to obtain undergraduate degrees in computer science, engineering and mathematics and to enter post-graduate schools or to directly enter the workforce in their chosen field. The objectives are to (1) increase the number of low-income students obtaining undergraduate degrees in computer science, engineering, and mathematics, (2) improve professional development and career choice opportunities of participating students, and (3) strengthen partnerships between the university and corporations employing graduates in relevant fields. \r\n\r\nThis project offers the incentive of financial support for student costs of attendance at the university for two years (four semesters), plus individual attention leading to graduation and ultimately to successful employment. The university is awarding NSF-funded scholarships of $2,500 per academic year to ten low-income undergraduate students majoring in computer science, engineering or mathematics. The scholarship program prepares participants for graduation within two years of entry into the program. \r\n\r\nThe NSF CSEMS Scholarship program offers much more than financial assistance for low-income students. The program provides assistance in academic efforts, research opportunities, career opportunities and on-going personalized monitoring. Program activities include individual and group meetings with the PI, site visits to local corporations, workshops, senior research projects with a mentor and/or external sponsor, and study sessions to prepare engineering majors for the Tennessee State Engineer Intern Examination. An Early Warning System is in place to notify the PI of potential academic or personal problems. Personal counseling, tutors and the math lab are available for students on an as-needed basis. \r\n\r\nThe principal investigator, oversees the program administration and implementation. A scholarship selection committee selects the scholarship recipients. Criteria for selection includes eligibility for a Pell Grant, good academic standing, a junior standing in the fall semester of academic year 2000/2001, and a recommendation from their faculty advisor. Recipients must be U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, refugee aliens or permanent resident aliens. \r\n\r\nThe P.I. establishes a framework to follow NSF CSEMS scholarship recipients through the two academic years of the project and beyond. A Scholarship Team, led by the P.I., implements program activities and reviews the progress of participants. The Scholarship Team is composed of the Principal Investigator, the Dean of Academic Services, the Director of Institutional Effectiveness and two faculty members representing the School of Engineering and the School of Science. The Scholarship Team evaluates the program based on academic achievement, retention to graduation, number and percentage passing license examinations, and employment upon graduation. The PI, the Institutional Effectiveness Office, and the Career Center staff follow-up on the NSF CSEMS scholarship recipients after graduation. \r\n",
