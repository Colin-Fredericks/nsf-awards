The IRLT will consist of a network of robots and control centers.  The robotic devices will be used for exploratory missions ranging from ocean archeology to space science and the control centers will provide wireless communication with the remote robotic devices in order to send commands and receive data.  Several IT learning challenges that emerge include human-computer interfaces, task planning, resource scheduling, fault detection and diagnosis, and goal-directed commanding.  The IRLT will enable students to understand the need for specific IT applications, iteratively develop such applications, test application functionality in an operational environment, and experience application value in a mission setting.  The IRLT will include a suite of services to support collaborating IT educators.  These services will include an educator support program to train faculty in the use of the IRLT as an educational resource, several pre-packaged educational modules permitting the rapid and low-cost use of the testbed, and Web-based documentation providing engineering details, user manuals, guides for new experiments, and libraries of past IT applications.  The IRLT will be centered in an undergraduate engineering curriculum and its high school outreach program.  It will draw stakeholders from multiple universities and research laboratories who will serve as advisors and mentors.\r\n",
