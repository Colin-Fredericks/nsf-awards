Sargent\r\nAST-9977420\r\nCARMA: A Proposal for Development Funds\r\n\r\nThe proposal is for funding to begin implementing long-lead items required for merging the Owens Valley Millimeter Array and the BIMA Array to produce a new array called CARMA (Combined Array for Millimeter-wave Astronomy).  The new array will be sited in the Inyo Mountains of central-eastern California, near the present Owens Valley site but higher in elevation.    Improved atmospheric conditions at the new site will allow routine observations in the prime 1.3mm band.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal requests $350,000 to continue development of CARMA by hiring a Project Manager and contracting consultants to conduct a study of and design a road to the new CARMA site.  These are necessary if a solution is to be found  for the problem of site approval by the Forest Service.  There is considerable resistance from environmental groups for use of the preferred site, Upper Harkless Flat, which is about 40 minutes drive from the current OVRO site.  A more distant site, Badger Flat, is also being considered and may be less controversial.  The new Project Manager will be tasked with shepherding the project through the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the new site, whichever one it turns out to be.  He or she will also oversee development of the site and eventually supervise transport of the Caltech and BIMA telescopes from their current locations and their integration into a working interferometer.  \r\n***\r\n",
