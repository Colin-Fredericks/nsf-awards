 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automated biometric identification systems measure a physiological, behavioral, or biological \"signature\" from the human body or environment, process and recognize classifiable signal components, and then renders an identification decision based upon the parameters of a given application.  Effectively addressing the breadth of needed biometric identification system research from to life sciences to the computing sciences represents a significant challenges to industry and government.  The proposed Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) organizes the activities of faculty groups at four universities spanning the physical, health, and computer sciences and engineering, to effectively address the cross-cutting research needed to advance identification technology and systems in the application domain spanning security/law enforcement, information systems, and public health.  CITeR will serve an enabling role in the technical and economic development of this area through research of new enabling technologies, the integrative training of scientists and engineers across its breadth, and the facilitation of the transfer of this technology to the private and government sectors.",
