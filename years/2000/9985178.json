 "awd_abstract_narration": "This integrated education and research project is aimed at developing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) instrumentation that will provide chemical specificity by measuring inelastic scattering of tunneling electrons that undergo energy losses characteristic of specific surface chemical bonding arrangements.  The goal is to develop a novel substrate structure comprising a superlattice energy analyzer which together with the development of STM tips from semiconductor materials will make possible the detection of inelastically scattered carriers and the suppression of a large background of electrons that do not scatter when they tunnel through specific surface adsorbate molecular structures.  The education project focuses on student research and design needed to advance the STM instrumentation development.  Advising and mentoring student research, course development and outreach that includes stimulating interest in science for both students and families through the Denver Museum of Natural History are the central activities in the overall integrated research and education plan.\r\n%%%\r\nThis well integrated research and education project will provide student training in an important area of atomic and molecular level characterization and manipulation that serve for nanoscience and nanotechnology.  These areas are highly relevant to applied science and engineering, and crucial to advancing the U.S. position in the modern high technology world.  Students trained in these areas will gain significant advantages in the overall competition for high-powered industrial jobs.\r\n***\r\n",
