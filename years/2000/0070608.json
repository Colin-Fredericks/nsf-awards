 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract.  Problems of Complex Analysis Arising in Complex Dynamics\r\n\r\nThe research of this proposal applies the methods of complex analysis to\r\nseveral  problems of dynamical systems in the complex domain.  The dynamics\r\nof a polynomial map of the complex plane  C  has been studied in depth and\r\nhas produced a theory which is both a beautiful and compelling model for\r\nmany systems in nature.  The dynamics of polynomial mappings of\r\ntwo-dimensional complex space  C^2  should produce a theory with equal\r\nbeauty and utility.   The work of this project includes three parts:\r\n\r\n1.  The first objective is to study mappings which are quasi-hyperbolic, a\r\ncondition which is more general and will be more easily verified than the\r\nmore traditional condition of (uniform) hyperbolicity.  At the same time,\r\nthe quasi-hyperbolic mappings have expansion/contraction properties which\r\nmakes them\r\nunderstandable in a way similar to hyperbolic mappings.  The corresponding\r\ndynamical sets will be shown to have bounded geometry.\r\n\r\n2.  A second objective is to apply these complex methods to the study of\r\npolynomial difffeomorphisms of the real plane.  This will give a new\r\napproach that will give results not easily obtained with purely real methods.\r\n\r\n3.  The third objective is to understand the nature of parameter space, the\r\nspace of all mappings.  A particular focus will be on the connectedness\r\nlocus, which is a higher-dimensional analogue of the Mandelbrot set.\r\n\r\nIn each of these cases, the methodology involves the further development of\r\nmathematical techniques from complex analysis: analytic functions and\r\nvarieties, harmonic measure, pluri-potential theory, and the geometric\r\ntheory of currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
