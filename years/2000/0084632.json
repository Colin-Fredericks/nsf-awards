 "awd_abstract_narration": "0084632\r\nSoom\r\nIn modern engineering practice, systems and components that rely on\r\nfrictional response are ubiquitous.  Clutches, brakes and rubbing seals\r\nare well known examples from mechanical engineering. Despite the apparent\r\nsimplicity of the sliding contact problem, its economic importance, and\r\nthe efforts that have been devoted to research on this topic recent\r\ndecades, a detailed physical understanding of many aspects of behavior\r\nremains elusive, particularly those associated with thermal effects. In\r\nthis project, supported under the initiative on Exploratory Research on Model Based Simulation, we will develop a computational mechanics approach to\r\nmodeling these problems based on a multi-level boundary element method\r\nwhich can be scaled up to solve large problems. An unsteady\r\nthree-dimensional thermomechanical formulation that includes surface\r\ntexture and near-surface nonlinearities will be implemented. A speed\r\nor temperature dependent friction will be employed. The computational\r\nmethods, while fully three-dimensional in nature, will initially be\r\napplied to a series of rotating ring geometries that will be studied in a\r\nparallel program of physical experiments.  The experiments will be\r\ncompared with computational results based on full field deformation\r\nanalysis of a stationary ring or disc under both constant and unsteady\r\nsliding conditions. \r\n***",
