 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to enhance the existing research and educational infrastructure to prepare academically talented students from low-income and disadvantaged families for degree achievement in higher education. A well-structured, proactive, and collaborative infrastructure with committed partnerships from industry, government, and academic institutions is now supporting the faculty development, curricular enhancements, and research experiences that promote creativity and innovation from undergraduate students in Computer Science and Mathematics programs. Scholarship support will be provided to eligible students who have committed to pursue graduate level degree programs in Computer Science, Mathematics, or Engineering. \r\n\r\nThis project includes nurturing and mentoring processes that will create a culture and mindset that are necessary to pursue graduate level courses. Tutorial programs, curricular enhancements, co-op and internship programs at major corporations and national laboratories, and a strong interaction with peers from other academic institutions and industry experts provide the required depth in the content area and improved professional development to all scholarship recipients. The knowledge and skills attained through these designed activities will enable graduates to further their education in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering and successfully complete graduate degrees. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
