A priori \r\nestimates have for a long time been the dominant tool for globally solving \r\npartial differential equations.  Such a priori estimates are usually derived \r\nfrom pointwise properties of the partial differential equations.  In many \r\nimportant global geometric problems, some of which are listed above, \r\npointwise arguments are insufficient.  To solve such problems, this project \r\nuses and further develops the method of \"mulitplier ideal sheaf\".  What is \r\nto be estimated is multiplied by a \"multiplier\" before estimation so that \r\nthe a priori estimates hold.  The set of all such multipliers forms the \r\n\"multiplier ideal sheaf\".  Global properties of the \"multiplier ideal sheaf\", \r\nsuch as closedness under certain kinds of differentiation, for certain \r\nproblems force to be a multiplier the function which is identically 1, thus \r\ngiving the desired global solutions of the partial differential equations.  \r\nSome long outstanding problems in algebraic geometry have already been \r\nsolved by this method.  With further development this new method of using\r\nthe multiplier ideal sheaf to solve global partial differential equations\r\nshould be a very powerful tool with broad applications and deep impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
