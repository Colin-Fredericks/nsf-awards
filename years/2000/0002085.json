The co-organizers are Dr. Rodney W. Nichols, President, New York Academy of Sciences and Professor Imura, Executive Member of the Council for Science and Technology and Chairman of the Committee on Science, Technology and Society in Japan.  The meeting will focus on areas of science and technology that will contribute to emerging or growing societal priorities in our nations. In their statement of April 4, l999 President Clinton and Prime Minister Obuchi noted that they considered this area as both urgent and important.  The participants will focus on areas in which there is clear, mutual benefit from strengthening the bilateral partnership, with emphasis on the value of collaboration in science and technology.  Special emphasis will be placed on areas, which are of particularly high societal concern.  These areas will also be discussed at the intergovernmental U.S.-Japan High Level Committee Meeting, chaired by the President's Science Advisor and the Japanese Minister for Science and Technology in May 2000. \r\n*** \r\n",
