As part of this campaign, the College of Natural Sciences is using funds from the National Science Foundation to fund forty scholarships per year for the next two years. These scholarships are being awarded to juniors and seniors majoring in mathematics, computer science and industrial technology who plan to graduate within two years. \r\n\r\nThe College of Natural Sciences strives to recruit and retain academically talented, low-income students by offering student support services as well as financial assistance. Forty National Science Foundation scholarships of $2,500  are available to students each year for two years. In addition, money is used to strengthen the infrastructure of the university in order to offer further support to scholarship recipients.\r\n\r\nAn application process for selecting scholarship recipients is based on academic achievement, financial need, full time status as a student, and date of expected graduation. Student progress is evaluated based on a system that is already in place at the university.  Measurable outcomes relate to student proficiency, grade point average, retention, and career placement upon graduation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
