 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has as its aim the development of methodology that couples normally incompatible early and late transition metal catalysts, to perform multistep catalytic transformations.  In particular, early transition metal Lewis acid catalysts will be coupled with late transition metal redox catalysts to enable one-pot transformations.  Since such catalysts cannot normally coexist in solution, they will separated by immobilizing them onto solid organic supports.  To achieve stereoselective catalysis, polymerizable chiral ancillary ligands will be examined in addition to a molecular imprinting approach.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Synthesis Program supports the research of Professor Michel R. Gagne of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  Professor Gagne's research involves the use of metals as catalysts to bring about useful organic reactions.  Since several kinds of metal catalysts are used in a variety of ways, Professor Gagne is working to develop strategies whereby more than one catalyst can be employed concurrently in a single reaction vessel.  This will significantly increase the efficiency with which synthetic products can be produced in a laboratory or industrial setting.\r\n",
