In the theoretical portion of the effort the interaction of the slip modes with each other and with the lamellar interfaces are investigated to see how channeled flow deformation behavior is established in TiAl. Bond order potentials that include the covalent component of the bonding in TiAl are used.  This allows for a more complete, quantitative picture of the dislocation core structure. The effect of off-stoichiometry, which is known to play a very important role in TiAl, is investigated as well. A second direction of the research is to explore the possibility that this deformation mode occurs in other lamellar materials, such as in multilayer composites with coherent or semicoherent interfaces. The experiments involve deformation of Ag/Cr multilayers in the plane of the film while measuring lateral strains to see if channeled flow results in this material. The theoretical program analyzes the slip modes in the two materials.  Since one is BCC and the other FCC, different slip systems are involved on either side of the interfaces. \r\n%%%\r\nThis research builds on a previous NSF-supported program on the ductility of TiAl and how deformation crosses the various interfaces in polysynthetically twinned TiAl.  In many cases, the deformation modes that dominate in this material are not those with the maximum resolved shear stress, but, in fact, appear to be the ones that have the most favorable interactions with the interlamellar boundaries, i.e., the boundaries do not just respond to the deformation modes in the bulk, they actually determine, to a surprisingly large extent, what the dominant deformation modes are. This deformation mode is called \"channeled flow\", because it is carried by slip vectors, the net sum of which is parallel to the boundaries themselves. This interaction with the interfaces commonly involves a complex coordinated motion of coplanar ordinary dislocations and twinning, even though the same deformation could be produced by a single set of super dislocations. The simulations of dislocation cores in TiAl have shown how these two deformation modes that normally occur at such different rates are closely coupled in this material, but many questions remain unanswered, not the least of which is: How general is this kind of deformation mode?\r\n***\r\n",
