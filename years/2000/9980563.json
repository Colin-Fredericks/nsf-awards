 "awd_abstract_narration": "9980563\r\nCummings\r\n\tMolecular evolution has become the nexus of many areas of biological research. It integrates and enriches such areas as biochemistry, bioinformatics, developmental biology, genomics, microbiology, population biology, systematics, and phylogenetics. The Workshop in Molecular Evolution at the Marine Biological Laboratory is the largest and most influential course in the field. Started in 1988, the workshop has garnered an international reputation for excellence in teaching molecular evolution. With ca. 60 students enrolled each year, the Workshop has provided a rich and intensive learning experience for nearly 660 students since its inception, with an additional 60 students to be trained in each of the next three years. Because of the wide range of fields addressed in the study of molecular evolution, it is difficult to find a comprehensive course offered in a single university setting; it is rare for a single institution to maintain expertise in all the necessary areas. In contrast, the Workshop is uniquely able to provide necessary breadth and depth by utilizing a large number of visiting faculty with appropriate expertise, all of them leaders in their respective fields. Furthermore, the flexible nature of the workshop, with alternating lectures and hands-on computer laboratories, allows for rapid adaptation to changes in this dynamic field. \r\n\tOver the next three years, the Workshop will be administered by Dr. Michael Cummings, trained in comparative molecular evolutionary studies and with experience working with many different groups of organisms. Specific objectives include advanced training in theoretical and analytical aspects of molecular evolution, in computational resources available for such investigations, in database mining for comparative and mechanistic studies, and for the promotion of interdisciplinary projects in molecular biology, phylogenetics, and population biology. Student selection and outreach will continue to capitalize on the broad range of institutions represented over the past several years (more than 150), with women students comprising over 41% of the population. In addition, MBL will support development of a website for the Molecular Evolution workshop, to make available more generally the resources and findings that emerge from the activity.\r\n\r\n",
