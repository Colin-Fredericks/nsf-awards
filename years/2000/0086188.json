 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Appalachian RSI (ARSI) has submitted a plan for another five years of support that is built upon the successes and experiences, as well as the programmatic infrastructure, of the first award.  The second phase is geared toward ensuring sustainability, although significant work in that area has already taken place, and on broadening the scope of the Teacher Partners' work to have a greater districtwide impact.  In addition to continuing to work toward the goals of Phase I (i.e., develop knowledge and skills in the teaching workforce; develop a sustainable system to support teachers and students; and develop the leadership and ancillary support to sustain the project), ARSI will promote the following specific Phase II goals:\r\nDocument the effectiveness of the program\r\nDevelop a research base for math and science reform in rural communities\r\nEstablish rural math and science education sites at Appalachia-serving universities\r\n\r\nARSI will promote these goals through a variety of activities and restructurings, such as:\r\nResource collaborative directors (RCDs) will assist participating districts with systemic reform strategies, as they have done during Phase I.  However, the emphasis will be more on district-wide rather than individual school development.\r\n\r\nRCDs will also work with their sponsoring institutions to get the services that ARSI has provided institutionalized in the universities.  The ultimate objective for this activity is to evolve universities that are service-oriented to the Appalachian districts in their regions.\r\n\r\nRCDs will continue and expand their efforts to engage State Departments of Education to support and promote the ARSI model, in non-participating as well as ineligible districts.\r\n\r\nRCDs will continue to develop and nurture the Teacher Partners as instructional leaders in the region.  This is crucial as TPs expand their roles to a district scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
