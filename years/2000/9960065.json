 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a novel subgrade stabilization process that injects readily available materials into the vitrification zone, eliminating subsidence concerns as the soils densify during vitrification. The problem of in-situ soil stabilization of poor to marginal foundation and slope materials is endemic throughout the transportation system. Localized subgrade failures in highway fill and around ancillary structures, like bridges and culverts, constitute a major maintenance problem in every highway and road system. Phase I will establish process feasibility by developing a robust and versatile technology that produces subgrade synthetic rock from soils. The vitrified material will have suitable strength for soil stabilization and for structural reinforcement purposes. Experiments will demonstrate a method to modify the parent soil-rock properties by the use of additives during processing.\r\nA series of parametric tests will develop a  fundamental understanding of process operational variables upon geotechnic properties of the synthetic rock that is formed.\r\n\r\nThe commercial market for the technology includes highway departments (state and federal), airport authorities, municipalities, federal properties and national infrastructure agenciesm, and various industries.  Application of the technology is expexted in both maintenance of subgrade and new construction where 'local' subgrade instability issues are important. \r\n",
