 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symposium entitled, \"Morphological and Compositional Evolution of Heteroepitaxial Semi-conductor Thin Films\", will be held April 24-27, 2000, in San Francisco, CA. The symposium is organized to bring together experimentalists and theoreticians from a wide variety of disciplines to address fundamentals, consider state-of-the-art knowledge in the field, and to assess applica-tions of morphological and compositional evolution in the nanoscience of semiconductor thin film growth. Examples of  topical areas covered by the symposium are: Surface dynamics and atomistic processes; Growth on Patterned, high index, and vicinal substrates; Quantum dots; In-terdiffusion and segregation; Band structure, electronic properties, and devices; Morphology and microstructure; Nitrides. Within each topic, invited speakers will present a critical overview of their recognized specialties. \r\nThe symposium is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific is-sues in electronic/photonic materials. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future di-rections, it is expected that new ties will be established between universities, research institu-tions, and industry. Support from NSF will be used to partially compensate young scientists (junior faculty, graduate students) for travel and accommodation expenses. The symposium is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues in elec-tronic/photonic materials. \r\n%%%\r\n Electronic/photonic materials have far reaching economic potential since applications range broadly across electronics and photonics associated with computing, communications, and in-formation processing. An evaluation of the progress and status of this field along with current as-sessments of the most important developments will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of these materials in applications beneficial to society. \t \r\n***\r\n",
