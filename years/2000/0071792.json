 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n A lacuna of a linear hyperbolic differential operator is a\r\ndomain inside the propagation cone where its fundamental     \r\nsolution vanishes identically. The study of lacunas for general\r\nhyperbolic equations was initiated by I.G.Petrovsky (1945).\r\nExtending and clarifying his results, Atiyah, Bott and Garding\r\n(1970-73) developed a profound and complete theory for hyperbolic\r\noperators with constant coefficients. In contrast, much less is  \r\nknown about lacunas for operators with variable coefficients. \r\nThe investigation of this classical problem with a view of\r\ngeneralizing the Petrovsky-Atiyah-Bott-Garding theory is one of \r\nthe primary purposes of my project. In particular, the\r\nefforts will be aimed at resolving the old question of\r\nJ.Hadamard on explicit determination of second order analytic\r\nwave operators satisfying Huygens' principle on Minkowski\r\nspaces. Some new conjectures and problems (mostly from Analysis   \r\nand Algebraic Geometry) arising in connection with the theory\r\nof lacunas will be also explored.\r\n\r\n The study of propagation of waves in continuous media is one of\r\nthe fundamental problems in Mathematical Physics with many \r\nimportant applications in natural sciences and engineering. \r\nOf special interest (both from practical and theoretical point of view) \r\nis the question of when the waves may propagate without diffusion \r\nto allow the possibility of transmitting `clean-cut' (sharp) signals. \r\nWell-studied in homogeneous spaces this question remains largely open \r\nin general. My project aims to develop new mathematical tools \r\nand techniques to investigate this difficult problem in the case of\r\ninhomogeneous and anisotropic media. The results sought are of fundamental\r\ninterest and significance in mathematical theory of wave propagation \r\nand may have applications in related physical disciplines including the\r\ntheory of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, space communication\r\ntechnologies, magnetohydrodynamics, crystal optics, etc.\r\n",
